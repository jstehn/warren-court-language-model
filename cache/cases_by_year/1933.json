States Supreme Court\nAETNA LIFE INS. CO. v. MOSES(1933)\nNo. 137\nArgued: December 8, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles W. Arth and Leonard J. Ganse, both of Washington, D.C ., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. Clay Espey, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Roberts, an employee of petitioner Bralove, was killed in the course of his employment by the alleged negligence of respendent. His widow, who was also his administratrix, claimed and has accepted an award of compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act ( March 4, 1927, c. 509, 44 Stat. 1924 (33 USCA  901-950)), made applicable as a workmen's compensation law in the District of Columbia by Act of May 17, 1928, c. 612, 45 Stat. 600 (33 USCA  901 note, and D.C. Code 1929, T. 19,  11, 12). The award directed the employer and petitioner the AEtna Life Insurance Company, his insurer,1 to pay compensation to the widow in periodic installments, and the expenses attendant upon the burial of the deceased.\n The present suit was brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on the theory that the acceptance of compensation awarded under the statute operated as an assignment of the administratrix' right to pursue the respondent for damages for the wrongful death, and that the insurer succeeded to that right by subrogation. The declaration named as plaintiffs petitioner the AEtna Life Insurance Company 'in its own right and also to the \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n use of' the widow 'in her own right and as administratrix' and petitioner Bralove 'to the use of' the insurance company. Respondent moved to strike the declaration for misjoinder of parties plaintiff and causes of action. The trial court sustained the motion on the first ground, and, as petitioners elected to stand on the declaration, gave judgment for the respondent, which the Court of Appeals affirmed, 61 App. D.C. 74, 57 F.(2d) 440. This Court granted certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 582\n, 53 S.Ct. 15, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Both courts below ruled that the administratrix is, by the terms of the District Death Act (23 Stat. 307, D.C. Code (1924),  1301, 1302, 1303 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 21,  1-3)), the only proper plaintiff in an action for wrongful death, and that the Compensation Act, though it assigns the cause of action for the death, to the employer, upon acceptance of the award, does not under the common-law practice prevailing in the District, permit him to bring the suit in his own name. The trial court further expressed the view that the insurer was without any interest in the litigation, by way of subrogation, since the cause of action for wrongful death is not assignable at common law, and the Compensation Act confers on the insurer no rights analogous to those given the employer. The question before us is whether the Court of Appeals was right, and, if not, whether the proper parties have been designated as plaintiffs.\n Sections 7, 8, and 9 of the Compensation Act (33 USCA  907-909) provide for compensation to the employee if he is injured, or to certain of his dependents, if he is killed, in the course of his employment. Section 33(a) provides that 'if on account of a disability or death for which compensation is payable ... the person entitled to such compensation determines that some person other than the employer is liable in damages, he may elect ... to receive such compensation or to recover damages against such third person.' By subsection (b) 'Acceptance of such compen- \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 538]\n\u00a0\n sation shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person,' and by subsection (d) the 'employer on account of such assignment may either institute proceedings for the recovery of such damages or may compromise with such third person.' 33 USCA  933(a, b, d, e).\n But the cause of action against a third party which is thus cast upon the employer is not to be maintained exclusively for his own benefit. From the proceeds of the litigation or compromise the employer is directed by section 33(e) to retain an amount equal to his disbursements in securing them, the cost of benefits furnished by him to the employee, amounts paid as compensation, and the present value of all amounts which it is estimated are payable as such. The latter sum is to be held by the employer 'as a trust fund to pay such compensation as it becomes due and to pay any sum, in excess of such compensation, to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative.' Any amount recovered above that required for these purposes is to be paid by the employer directly 'to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative.'\n In the case where the employee survives and accepts compensation as the only person entitled, it is clear that the statutory assignment vests in the employer the full right to recover damages from the third person. Double recovery by the employee, compare Mercer v. Ott, 78 W.Va. 629, 89 S. E. 952; Fox v. Dallas Hotel Co., 111 Tex. 461, 240 S.W. 517, is thus avoided. Yet the employer is permitted to share in the recovery only to the extent of his own liability, compare Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Brass Goods Mfg. Co., 239 N.Y. 273, 146 N.E. 377, 37 A.L.R. 826, and any excess goes to the injured employee.\n In this case the injury resulted in death of the employee, and the election to take compensation was made by the widow. As she is both the administratrix and the only \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 539]\n\u00a0\n person entitled to compensation, the election was validly exercised and we need not resolve possible doubts as to the proper person to make the election under other circumstances. Compare sections 33(a) and (b) with (f ). Her election has called into operation the statutory assignment so far as it applies to the action for wrongful death. We must decide its effect on that cause of action.\n The statute is not free from ambiguity. The right to recover for a wrongful death is the creature, not of the common law, but of a statute which confers the right on the personal representative of the deceased for the benefit of his next of kin under the local statute of distribution, some of whom may not be entitled to compensation under the Compensation Act. Nevertheless, section 33(b) of the act provides that it is the 'right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person' which is assigned to the employer by the election to take compensation. Reading this provision literally and alone, the employer, in the case of the wrongful death of his employee, would take nothing by the assignment which it purports to effect, since the person entitled to the compensation has no right to recover for the death. But section 33(d) authorizes the employer to institute suit or to compromise the claim, and section 33(e)(1)(C) and (e)(2) provide that any recovery in excess of the sums required to reimburse the employer and allow for compensation payable by him is to be paid to the representative of the deceased. Having regard to those provisions and to the general purpose which the act discloses with respect to rights of recovery when the injury does not result in death, we see no escape from the conclusion that the statute contemplates that the employer is to have the same control over the institution of an action for wrongful death, the compromise and settlement of the claim, and the distribution of the proceeds, as he is given in unambiguous language in the case where the injury results only \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 540]\n\u00a0\n in disability. What is made explicit by the statute with respect to the latter is implicit with respect to the former. For, if it had been intended that the employer should assert only a part of the action for wrongful death, proportionate to the interest of those who are dependents under the Compensation Act, compare Matter of Zirpola v. Casselman, 237 N. Y. 367, 143 N.E. 222; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Graham & Norton Co., 254 N.Y. 50, 171 N.E. 903, there would be no meaning to the language of section 33(e)(2) directing him to pay to the personal representative from the proceeds of the action any excess over the compensation award.\n Concluding that, where the employer is given anything to recover, it is the full recovery provided by the Wrongful Death Act, we do not think, as did the courts below, that the rights thus conferred may be enforced only by an action brought in the name of the personal representative. It is true that the statute does not expressly say that the employer may bring the action in his own name and that by the common law the assignee must, in general, sue in the name of the assignor. Glenn v. Marbury, \n145 \nU.S. 499\n, 12 S.Ct. 914. This rule a vestige of the common law's reluctance to admit that a chose in action may be assigned, is to- day but a formality which has been widely abolished by legislation. We see no reason for thinking that a statute passed in 1928 and clearly intended to effect a complete transfer of the cause of action, should be interpreted to perpetuate that formality. There is nothing in its language, history, or purpose to indicate that the word 'assignment' was used as anything other than a convenient description of the transfer to the employer of the rights of the employee or his representative, or that it is to be read in the common-law sense, merely because the forum for the enforcement of those rights has not departed from \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 541]\n\u00a0\n the common-law form in the case of voluntary assignments.\n It is immaterial whether the statutory assignment is said to create a new cause of action in the employer or merely to permit him to enforce that previously vested in the employee or his personal representative. What is material is that the employer acquires the legal rights of the employee or the personal representative, subject to the qualifications imposed by the common law or the death statute to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Compensation Act. The Compensation Act permits him to enforce them in his own name.\n We do not doubt, although other courts have, Henderson Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Owensboro Home Tel. & Tel. Co., 192 Ky. 322, 233 S.W. 743; Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Englander, 93 N.J.Eq. 188, 118 A. 628, that the insurer is subrogated to the rights of the employer to the extent that it has discharged his duties, though whether its rights extend to compensation which it is liable to pay, as well as to that which it has paid, we need not decide. \n2\n Notwithstanding, the provision of the statute and of the policy permitting an award for compensation to be made against the insurer directly, the function of the insurer is essentially that of indemnifying the employer. The statute contemplates that the payment of compensa- \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 542]\n\u00a0\n tion should be secured by insurance, and nothing in it indicates that the insurer is to be denied an indemnitor's rights. Subrogation is a normal incident of indemnity insurance. Hall & Long v. The Railroad Companies, 13 Wall. 367; Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 462\n, 9 S.Ct. 469; St. Louis Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., \n139 \nU.S. 223, 235\n, 11 S.Ct. 554; Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Great Lakes Engineering Co. (C.C.A.) 184 F. 426, 36 L.R.A. (N.S.) 60; Workmen's Compensation Exchange v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co. (D.C.) 45 F.(2d) 885.\n The suggestion of the trial court that subrogation is precluded here by the nonassignability, under the Death Act and the common law, of the administratrix' cause of action for death, is without force. Considerations of policy which may forbid the voluntary assignment of the cause of action are obviously inapplicable to a case where the statute does assign the action to the employer in order to carry out the plan of the Compensation Act. That plan would be destroyed if the insurance company were denied the right of subrogation; for the consequence would be to permit that double recovery by either the employer or the next of kin entitled to compensation which the statute is careful to avoid, with a resulting increase in the cost of the insurance which the statute requires.\n The insurer's right of subrogation does not alter the fact that it is the employer who is directed by the statute to distribute the proceeds of the recovery, in which the insurer has only a partial interest. Accordingly, the employer is the party to bring the action and the only necessary party plaintiff in the case before us. \n3\n But the insur- \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 543]\n\u00a0\n ance company and the widow, both in her own right and as administratrix, are interested in the recovery. Under the common-law practice, the defendant may not complain if the employer indicates their beneficial interests by bringing the action to their use as well as to his own. See Southern Ry. v. Carter, 139 Ga. 236, 238, 77 S.E. 21; Pearce v. Twichell, 41 Miss. 344, 346; Atkins v. Moore, 82 Ill. 240, 241. Compare Roof v. Chattanooga Wood Split Pulley Co., 36 Fla. 284, 293, 18 So. 597. Whether, under Equity Rule 13 of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, made applicable to actions at law by the first paragraph of the law rules, they may join with him as legal plaintiffs since they have 'an interest ... in obtaining the relief demanded,' we do not decide. The decision does not depend upon the federal statute, but upon the local rule, and may be conditioned by unwritten practices which we should hesitate to disturb. Nor do we consider what would be the rights of the person entitled to compensation or the personal representative, compare Hunt v. Bank Line (C. C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 136; or the insurer, see Norwich Insurance Co. v. Standard Oil Co. (C.C.A.) 59 F. 984; Continental Insurance Co. v. Loud & Sons Lumber Co., 93 Mich. 139, 53 N.W. 394, 32 Am.St.Rep. 494; United States Fidelity & Guaranty \n\n[287 U.S. 530, 544]\n\u00a0\n Co. v.

Phoenix Nat. Bank & Trust Co., \n285 \nU.S. 209, 214\n, 52 S.Ct. 329, in a case where the employer refused to co-operate in the prosecution of the action.\n Since the ruling below that the action could only be brought in the name of the personal representative was erroneous, petitioners' failure to amend in conformity to that ruling will not preclude amendment now. Judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under the terms of the policy, the insurer obligated itself to pay all installments of compensation directly to the person entitled to them 'because of the obligation for compensation ... imposed upon ... this Employer,' as well as to indemnify the employer against any loss by reason of his liability. The former provision is required by sections 35 and 36 of the statute (33 USCA  935, 936) 'in order that the liability for compensation imposed by this chapter may be most effectively discharged by the employer, and in order that the administration of this chapter in respect of such liability may be facilitated. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The policy of insurance provides (clause K) that 'the Company shall be subrogated in case of any payment under this Policy, to the extent of such payment, to all rights of recovery therefor vested by law either in this Employer or, in any employee or his dependents claiming hereunder, against persons, corporations, associations, or estates.' The insurer is subrogated to the employer's rights to no greater extent under this express provision than it would be without it by operation of law; whether its rights may be limited by it, we have no occasion to consider. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under the common law practice rights acquired by subrogation were asserted in an action at law in the name of the insured to the insurer's use, Hall & Long v. The Railroad Companies, 13 Wall. 367; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n166 \nU.S. 468, 474\n, 17 S.Ct. 619, though in equity, Garrison et al. v. Memphis Ins.

We need not consider the effect upon the common law rule of Equity Rule 13 of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (made applicable to actions at law by Law Rules, 1) providing that all actions 'shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,' in a case where the insurer succeeds by subrogation to the entire cause of action of the insured against the party primarily responsible for the loss.

U.S.(1933)\nNo. 56\nArgued: November 15, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Norman M. Littell, of Seattle, Wash., Charles W. Arth, of Washington, D.C., and Cassius E. Gates, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this suit, brought under the Tucker Act, 24 Stat. 505, in the District Court for Western Washington, petitioner sought compensation at an agreed rate for the transportation of certain destitute seamen from Ketchikan, Alaska, to Seattle, under the provisions of section 4578, Rev. St., as amended, 46 U.S.C.  679 (46 USCA  679). That section imposes on masters of United States vessels homeward bound the duty, upon request of consular officers, to receive and carry destitute seamen to the port of destination at such compensation not exceeding a specified amount as may be agreed upon by the master with a consular officer, and authorizes the consular officer to issue certificates for such transportation, 'which certificates shall be assignable for collection.' By section 4526, Rev. St ., 17 Stat. 269, as amended December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 46 U.S.C.  593 (46 USCA  593), seamen, whose term of service is terminated by loss or wreck of their vessel, are 'destitute seamen,' and are required to be transported as provided in section 4578 (46 USCA  679).\n The demand in the present case was for compensation for the transportation of the crew of the S. S. Depere, \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n owned by petitioner, which had been wrecked on the Alaska coast and for that reason had been unable to complete her voyage. The crew was received and carried to Seattle on petitioner's steamship Yukon, on certificate of the deputy customs collector of Alaska that he had agreed with the master for their transportation at a specified rate. The Comptroller General refused payment upon the certificate on the sole ground that it was the duty of petitioner to transport to the United States the crew of its own wrecked vessel, and that the congressional appropriation for the relief of American seamen was not available to compensate the owner for performing that duty. Judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint, 60 F.( 2d) 135, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the ground that the certificate of the deputy collector authorizing the transportation did not satisfy the requirement of the statute that the certificate should be that of a consular officer. 63 F.(2d) 398. This court granted certiorari. \n290 \nU.S. 608\n, 54 S.Ct. 49, 78 L.Ed. --.\n The government, conceding that the statute by long administrative practice has been construed as authorizing payment for transportation of seamen from Alaska on the certificate of deputy customs collectors, insists that it does not authorize payment to the owner for the transportation of the crew of his own wrecked vessel and that such has been its administrative construction.\n\n 1. \nIf the statutory language is to be taken literally, the certificate, which by Rev. St.  4578 is authority for the transportation and evidence of the right of the vessel to compensation, must be that of a consular officer. Deputy collectors of customs are not consular officers and there are no consular officers in Alaska. If the right to compensation is dependent upon certification by a consular officer the statutes providing for transportation of destitute seamen can be given no effect in Alaska. But the meaning of this provision must be ascertained by reading \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 260]\n\u00a0\n it with related statutes and in the light of a long and consistent administrative practice.\n Since 1972 the statutes of the United States have made provision for the return of destitute seamen to this country upon suitable action taken by consular officers of the United States. \n1\n And since 1803 the government has undertaken to compensate for their transportation. \n2\n Beginning in 1896, Congress has made provision for the relief of American seamen shipwrecked in Alaska in annual appropriation bills for the maintenance of the diplomatic and consular service. The appropriation bill for that year, 29 Stat. 186, and every later one has extended the benefits of the appropriation for the relief of American seamen in foreign countries to 'American seamen shipwrecked in Alaska.' \n3\n The appropriation for 1922 and 1923, c. 204, 42 Stat. 599, 603; c. 21, 42 Stat. 1068, 1072, contained the proviso, not appearing in previous acts, that no part of the appropriation should be available for payment for transportation in excess of a specified rate agreed upon by a consular officer and the master of the vessel. The proviso did not appear in subsequent appropriation acts, but by Act of January 3, 1923, 43 Stat. 1072, it was transferred to its proper place in the shipping laws, where it now appears in section 680 of title 46 of the United States Code (46 USCA  680). The act of 1929, 45 Stat. 1028, 1098, applicable when the seamen in the present case were transported, appropriated $70,000 'for relief, \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 261]\n\u00a0\n protection and burial of American seamen in foreign countries, in the Panama Canal Zone, and in the Philippine Islands, and shipwrecked American seamen in the Territory of Alaska, in the Hawaiian Islands, in Porto Rico, and in the Virgin Islands.' By the amendment of Rev. St.  4526 of December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 46 U.S.C.  593 (46 USCA  593), it was provided that where the service of a seaman terminates by reason of the loss or wreck of the vessel, 'he shall not be entitled to wages for any period beyond such termination of the service and shall be considered as a destitute seaman, and shall be treated and transported to port of shipment,' as provided in Rev. St.  4578 (46 USCA  679). No exception is made in the case of transportation of seamen from Alaska or other dependencies of the United States.\n Thus, from 1896 to the present time, there has been a definite obligation on the part of the government to provide transportation for shipwrecked seamen without reference to the place where shipwrecked, and funds have been annually appropriated for the purpose of carrying out that obligation in the case of seamen shipwrecked in Alaska. As appears from the findings of the trial court, not challenged here, the appropriations have been expended for the transportation of shipwrecked seamen from Alaska, in conformity to a practice established and consistently followed at least since 1900. Certificates for the transportation of shipwrecked seamen have been regularly signed and issued by the collector of customs or the deputy collector in Alaska upon forms provided by the Bureau of Navigation of the Department of Commerce. That bureau, which has a general superintendence over merchant seamen of the United States, 46 U.S.C.  1 and 2 (46 USCA  1, 2), has regularly supplied its customs officials and its agents in Alaska with these forms, with instructions that they were to be used in arranging transportation of shipwrecked seamen to the United States, as provided by the sections of the statute to which reference has been made. The stipu- \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 262]\n\u00a0\n lated amounts due for the transportation, as certified, have been regularly paid without objection upon presentation of the certificate to the disbursing officer of the United States.\n Courts are slow to disturb the settled administrative construction of a statute long and consistently adhered to. Brown v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 568, 571\n, 5 S.Ct. 648; United States v. Philbrick, \n120 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 7 S.Ct. 413; United States v. G. Falk & Bro., \n204 \nU.S. 143, 151\n, 27 S.Ct. 191. This is especially the case where, as here, the declared will of the legislative body could not be carried out without the construction adopted. That construction must be accepted and applied by the courts when, as in the present case, it has received congressional approval, implicit in the annual appropriations over a period of thirty-five years, the expenditure of which was effected by resort to the administrative practice, and in amendments by Congress to the statutes relating to transportation of destitute seamen without modification of that practice. United States v. G. Falk & Bro., supra; compare United States v. Missouri Pacific R.R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269\n, 49 S.Ct. 133.\n\n 2. \nThe rejection of petitioner's claim by the Comptroller General rests upon the supposed duty of the owner to transport to the home port the seamen of its own wrecked vessel. \n4\n Diligent search by counsel of the ancient learning of the admiralty has failed to disclose the existence of any such duty. At most, in the absence of statutory command or of stipulations in the shipping articles providing otherwise, the rights of the seamen after shipwreck, preventing the completion of the voyage, appear to have been limited to wages payable from freight earned on the voyage or to \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 263]\n\u00a0\n wages or salvage from the vessel they have helped to save. \n5\n It is unnecessary for us to consider to what extent these rights have survived the statutes regulating the duties of the owner toward the seamen or what bearing they may have on the duty of the owner to transport the seamen. For there is no finding and no evidence in the present case that the wrecked vessel had earned freight on her voyage or had been salvaged either with or without the aid of her seamen. Under those statutes we think it plain that no duty is imposed on the owner to provide transportation for seamen of his own wrecked vessel and that the statutory undertaking of the government is not upon condition that destitute seamen shall be transported upon vessels other than those of the owner of the wrecked vessel.\n There are numerous instances in which the statutes of the United States specifically impose on the master the duty to provide seamen with transportation if he does not secure employment for them on another vessel. 6 But there is no statute imposing any duty on the vessel or owner to provide transportation for seamen who may be shipwrecked or who are discharged because incapacitated for further service. See Rev. St.  4581, 46 U.S.C.  683 (46 USCA  683). \n\n[290 U.S. 256, 264]\n\u00a0\n The statutes terminate seamen's right to wages with the termination of their service by the shipwreck, and without qualification impose on the government the obligation to transport them. It cannot be supposed that the performance of this obligation which since the early days of the government has been treated by Congress as a public duty, was intended to be conditional upon the ability of seamen, left destitute in a distant land, to induce the ship owner to transport them in performance of a supposed duty which the statute neither imposes nor mentions.\n The Department of Commerce, not the Comptroller General, is charged with the administration of the statute, 4 Comptroller General Rep. 252, 253, and its administrative practice should be followed if thought to be controlling. But in any case, there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute with respect to the point urged by the government, and, in carrying it out as written, there is no administrative difficulty which would call for construction. The rulings of the Comptroller General rest upon a proposition so plainly contrary to law and so plainly in conflict with the statute as to leave them without weight as administrative constructions of it.

While resondent was cruising in the vessel on the waters of Lake Michigan, an explosion occurred midship, fire followed, and the vessel became a total wreck, and in consequence lay sunken and worthless. Alleging these facts, that respondent and other persons with him on the vessel had been injured, and that respondent's personal effects, as well as the vessel, its machinery, equipment and supplies, were a total loss, and that all the alleged injuries and damages were occasioned and incurred without its privity or knowledge, petitioner filed this libel against respondent seeking limitation of liability under the Act of March 3, 1851, c, 43,  3, 46 U.S. C. 183 (46 USCA  183). Respondent filed exceptions upon the ground that the libel did not disclose that libelant was the owner of the vessel or engaged in maritime commerce, or any facts sufficient to show that libelant was entitled to the limitation. The District Court dismissed the libel, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 61 F.(2d) 162. This Court granted certiorari. \n288 \nU.S. 596\n, 53 S.Ct. 397, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The libel disclosed that the sole relation of petitioner to the cruiser was that of manufacturer and vendor under a contract of conditional sale. Respondent gave his order for the cruiser to be delivered on the terms stated and subject to warranty against 'defects in workmanship and material' which by its terms was limited to replacement of parts. The order was followed by a 'conditional sale agreement,' by which respondent acknowledged receipt of the boat in good condition and which provided for the payment of the balance of the purchase price within ninety days after delivery, and that, until such payment or tender, title to the boat should remain in the seller. Subject to the conditions of the agreement, the purchaser was entitled to the possession and use of the boat with the right on the part of the seller to retake it and its equipment in case of the purchaser's default. The purchaser \n\n[289 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n was required to keep the boat insured with full marine coverage, to pay all taxes and charges, to comply with all applicable laws, and to hold the seller harmless from all 'liability, claim, demand, cost, charge and expense in any way imposed upon or accruing to seller' by reason of the use or operation of the boat. The libel alleged that the vessel when delivered to respondent was 'sturdy, safe and seaworthy.' The cause of the accident, except as above stated, is not shown. It appears to have occurred prior to any default on the part of respondent and while he was operating the vessel on his own behalf. The libelant, while proceeding directly against respondent, sought limitation against all claims.\n The statute1 limiting the liability of shipowners was enacted to encourage investments in ships and their employment in commerce. That purpose embraced, as petitioner insists, the promotion of shipbuilding, but it was not concerned with construction as a mere enterprise of manufacture, which itself was not a maritime activity (People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393, 402; Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 554, 557; Thames Co. v. The Francis McDonald, \n254 \nU.S. 243, 244\n, 41 S.Ct. 65), but with the promotion of commerce and the encouragement 'of persons engaged in the business of navigation,' to the end that the shipping interests of this country might not suffer in competition with foreign vessels (Moore v. American Transportation Co., 24 How. 1, 39; Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104, 121; The Main v. Williams, 152 \n\n[289 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 122, 131, 14 S.Ct. 486; Evansville Company v. Chero Cola Co., 271, U.S. 19, 21, 46 S.Ct. 379; Hartford Accident Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 47 S.Ct. 357; Flink v. Paladini, \n279 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 49 S.Ct. 255). The statute embodied the principle of the general maritime law that shipowners should not 'be liable beyond their interest in the ship and freight for the acts of the master or crew done without their privity or knowledge.' Butler v. Boston Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527, 549\n, 9 S.Ct. 612, 616. The liability thus limited is an imputed liability; it is a liability imputed by law by reason of the ownership of the vessel. For his own fault, neglect, and contracts the owner remains liable. Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 \nU.S. 96, 103\n, 106 S., 32 S.Ct. 27; Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 \nU.S. 353, 356\n, 38 S.Ct. 330.\n Petitioner retained title solely for the purpose of securing the purchase price of the vessel, and, prior to default in payment, petitioner had no control over the vessel's operation. Petitioner did not man or operate her, and had no right to do so. For all purposes of use in navigation, the vessel belonged to respondent. In these circumstances, petitioner was not liable as owner for acts of respondent or for those of the master and crew. It is well settled2 that a mortgagee out of possession, and not exercising authority, is not answerable for the acts of the master or other agent of the ship. See Morgan v. Shinn, 15 Wall. 105, 110; McIntyre v. Scott, 8 Johns. (N.Y.) 159; Macy v. Wheeler, 30 N.Y. 231; Brooks v. Bondsey, 17 Pick.(Mass.) 441, 28 Am.Dec. 313; Davidson v. Baldwin (C.C.A.) 79 F. 95; Calumet & Hecla Mining Co. v. Equitable Trust Co. (D.C.) 275 F. 552; Parsons on Shipping and Admiralty, 129, note; Abbott, Merchant Ships and Seamen (14th Ed.) p. 55. The same is true of a vendor who retains title as \n\n[289 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n security for the payment of the purchase price. See Philips v. Ledley, Fed. Cas. No. 11,096, 1 Wash.C.C. 226; Wendover v. Hogeboom, 7 Johns.(N.Y.) 308; Leonard v. Huntington, 15 Johns. (N.Y.) 298; Thorn v. Hicks, 7 Cow.(N.Y.) 697; Jones v. Pitcher, 3 Stew. 3 P. (Ala.) 135, 24 Am.Dec. 716; Hemm v. Williamson, 47 Ohio St. 493, 25 N.E. 1; The Boise Penrose (C.C.A.) 22 F.( 2d) 919, 920; The John E. Berwind (C.C.A.) 56 F. (2d) 13. The principle, generally recognized, was thus emphatically stated in Thorn v. Hicks, supra: 'The mere circumstance of the naked legal title to the vessel' remaining in the vendors 'to secure the purchase money for which she had been sold, unquestionably would not render them liable as owners, on the contracts of the master, or for the consequences of his negligence and unskilfulness.'\n What, then, is the liability which petitioner seeks to limit? It is manifestly not a liability imputed to petitioner as shipowner. With respect to respondent, the mere fact that petitioner retained the legal title to the vessel, in order to secure the payment of the remainder of the price, neither created liability for the injury alleged to have been sustained on account of the explosion nor conferred immunity. If such liability existed, it arose, not because petitioner reserved title, while delivering possession and control of use, but because it was manufacturer and vendor. The question of liability would be determined with reference to the obligations which were expressly assumed by the vendor, or were inherent in the transaction, irrespective of the title retained as security. Similarly, as to other persons who are alleged to have suffered injury from the accident-the possible claimants described in the libel- petitioner's liability, if any, had no relation to any responsibility of petitioner as holder of the naked title, but would depend upon petitioner's conduct as maker of the vessel, that is, upon the question whether in the circumstances petitioner could be held \n\n[289 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n guilty of actionable neglect in its manufacture. See Bohlen, 'Studies in the Law of Torts,' pp. 109 et seq.; MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050, L.R.A 1916F, 696, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 440. That question is not before us. Whatever liability there may be in that aspect, either to respondent or to others, it is not a liability falling within the policy and purview of the act of Congress limiting the liability of shipowners.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The liability of the owner of any vessel, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction, by any person, of any property, goods, or merchandise, shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred without the privity, or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending.'

MAROTTA(1933)\nNo. 131\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 513, 514]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry Le Baron Sampson, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. George I. Cohen, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n July 16, 1930, petitioner claiming to be a creditor of respondent in an amount exceeding $7,000 filed a petition in bankruptcy against her in the United States District Court for Massachusetts. It alleged that on March 18, 1930, she conveyed her property with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud her creditors, including the petitioner, and that she was insolvent. Respondent's answer denied that she committed the alleged act of bankruptcy or was insolvent or that petitioner was a creditor or had a provable claim against her. The court heard the case on evidence taken by, and the report of, a special master, made findings of fact, and adjudged respondent a bank- \n\n[287 U.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n rupt. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 57 F.(2d) 829.\n The substance of the findings, so far as material to our decision, may be briefly stated:\n Under date of April 18, 1927, one Mogliani as principal and petitioner as surety executed a bond for $15,000 to the treasurer of the commonwealth of Massachusetts to secure, among other things, the payment of any judgment that might be obtained in an action against the principal for injury resulting to any person by reason of the discharge of fireworks by him at a public exhibition. The bond was made and delivered pursuant to Massachusetts G.L. 1921, c. 148,  57 A. 57 D, as added by St. 1921, c. 500. Petitioner became surety in accordance with an application executed by respondent and in reliance upon her agreement to indemnify it against every claim or liability arising on the bond. The application and agreement were accompanied by a financial statement made by her showing that, in addition to considerable cash, she owned several pieces of real estate worth much more than the amount of the bond. September 26, 1927, one Beatrice Ricci was injured by fireworks discharged at a public exhibition under the direction of Mogliani. She sued him for damages, and, March 4, 1930, got a verdict for $10,000. March 18 respondent conveyed all her real estate to one Muollo, and on the same day he mortgaged a part of it and quitclaimed all to her husband to be held by the latter in trust for the benefit of their children. These conveyances covered all respondent's property, and were made without consideration and with specific intent on her part to hinder, delay, and defraud the petitioner, her only creditor. The verdict having been reduced, judgment was entered April 10, 1930, in favor of Ricci and against Mogliani for $6,650.48. Unable to collect from him, she demanded payment from \n\n[287 U.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n petitioner. And April 18, 1930, conformably to the statute, a suit on the bond was brought against petitioner to recover for her the amount of the judgment. Some time before it filed the petition in bankruptcy, petitioner paid to her attorney the sum claimed, and judgment was entered against it for that amount.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained respondent's contention that, to constitute an act of bankruptcy, a fraudulent transfer must hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor holding a claim provable at the time of such conveyance, and held that petitioner's claim against respondent was contingent and not provable until the entry of the judgment against Mogliani, and that therefore respondent committed no act of bankruptcy. And it directed the District Court to dismiss the petition.\n Unless required by the act, the meaning of the word 'creditors' as used in section 3a(1) is not to be restricted to those whose claims are provable at the time of the fraudulent conveyance.\n Section 1 declares: 'The words and phrases used in this title and in proceedings pursuant hereto shall, unless the same be inconsistent with the context, be construed as follows: ... (9) 'creditor' shall include anyone who owns a demand or claim provable in bankruptcy, and may include his duly authorized agent, attorney, or proxy.' 11 U.S.C.  1(9), 11 USCA  1(9). And section 3a contains the following: 'Acts of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having (1) conveyed, transferred, concealed, or removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed, any part of his property with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of them.' 11 U.S.C.  21(a) (1), 11 USCA  21(a)(1). The decision below shows that at common law the word 'creditors' has a broader meaning. But the court construed the definition of creditor, section 1(9), to be comprehensive and the word 'include' to be one of limitation, the equivalent of 'include only,' and to exclude every person not having a demand pres- \n\n[287 U.S. 513, 517]\n\u00a0\n ently provable. Its ruling that respondent's transfer of her property to defraud petitioner was not an act of bankruptcy rests upon that construction.\n In definitive provisions of statutes and other writings, 'include' is frequently, if not generally, used as a word of extension or enlargement rather than as one of limitation or enumeration. Fraser v. Bentel, 161 Cal. 390, 394, 119 P. 509, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 1062; People ex rel. Estate of Woolworth v. S.T. Comm., 200 App.Div. 287, 289, 192 N.Y.S. 772; Matter of Goetz, 71 App.Div. 272, 275, 75 N.Y.S. 750; Calhoun v. Memphis & P.R. Co., Fed. Cas. No. 2,309; Cooper v. Stinson, 5 Minn. 522 (Gil. 416). Subject to the effect properly to be given to context, section 1 (11 USCA  1) prescribes the constructions to be put upon various words and phrases used in the act. Some of the definitive clauses commence with 'shall include,' others with 'shall mean.' The former is used in eighteen instances and the latter in nine instances, and in two both are used. When the section as a whole is regarded, it is evident that these verbs are not used synonymously or loosely, but with discrimination and a purpose to give to each a meaning not attributable to the other. It is obvious that, in some instances at least, 'shall include' is used without implication that any exclusion is intended. Subsections (6) and (7), in each of which both verbs are employed, illustrate the use of 'shall mean' to enumerate and restrict and of 'shall include' to enlarge and extend. Subsection (17) declares 'oath' shall include affirmation, Subsection (19) declares 'persons' shall include corporations, officers, partnerships, and women. Men are not mentioned. In these instances the verb is used to expand, not to restrict. It is plain that 'shall include,' as used in subsection (9) when taken in connection with other parts of the section, cannot reasonably be read to be the equivalent of 'shall mean' or 'shall include only.' \n\n[287 U.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n There being nothing to indicate any other purpose, Congress must be deemed to have intended that in section 3a(1) 'creditors' should be given the meaning usually attributed to it when used in the common-law definition of fraudulent conveyances. See Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 242\n, 29 S.Ct. 436, 16 Ann.Cas. 1008; Lansing Boiler & Engine Works v. Joseph T. Ryerson & Son (C.C.A.) 128 F. 701, 703; Githens v. Shiffler (D.C.) 112 F. 505. Under the common-law rule a creditor having only a contingent claim, such as was that of the petitioner at the time respondent made the transfer in question, is protected against fraudulent conveyance. And petitioner, from the time that it became surety on Mogliani's bond, was entitled as a creditor under the agreement to invoke that rule. Yeend v. Weeks, 104 Ala. 331, 341, 16 So. 165, 53 Am.St.Rep. 50; Whitehouse v. Bolster, 95 Me. 458, 50 A. 240; Mowry v. Reed, 187 Mass. 174, 177, 72 N.E. 936; Stone v.

WILSON(1933)\nNo. 460\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for Anderson, Collector of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. George E. Cleary, of New York City, for Wilson and others.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question to be decided is whether the difference between the value of real estate at the death of a testator and the proceeds realized thereafter upon a sale by the trustees may be deducted as a loss by the taxpayer, the beneficial owner of the proceeds, upon his return to the collector for the income of the year.\n Richard T. Wilson, Sr., a resident of New York, died in November, 1910, the owner of a large estate. By the Fourth article of his will he directed his executors to sell and convert into personalty his entire residuary estate, and to divide the proceeds thereof into five equal parts. Out of the fifth part set aside for the use of his son, Richard T. Wilson, Jr., the sum of $500,000 was to be held for the use of the son during life with remainder to lineal descendants, and in default of such descendants to others. 'The balance of such part I give to my said son, Richard T. Wilson, Jr., to be his absolutely.'\n This gift, if it had stood alone, might have seemed to allow to the executors no discretion as to the time of sale, and might have bred uncertainty as to their powers and duties before the time for distribution. The next or fifth article clarifies the meaning. The testator there recalls the fact that, after setting up the trust for $500,000 and \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n other special funds, a large part of his residuary estate will consist of real estate in New York and other states, and shares of manufacturing and business corporations, 'which should not be sold excepting under favorable conditions.' Accordingly he lays upon his executors the following command: 'To hold and manage such remaining portion of my residuary estate until in their judgment it can from time to time be advantageously sold and disposed of, not exceeding, however, a period longer than the lives of my sons Marshall Orme Wilson and Richard T. Wilson, Jr., and the survivor of them, and I hereby authorize and empower my said executors within said period to sell, convey, assign and transfer the same, or any part thereof, at such time or times as they may deem for the best interests of my estate, and upon such terms and conditions as they may deem proper, including the terms and mode of payment thereof.' Nor is this all. The executors are authorized in their discretion to organize a corporation, to convey to it the whole or any part of the residuary estate in return for the capital stock, and to hold the stock 'until it can in their judgment be advantageously disposed of.' Finally there is a provision that upon the making of a sale, the executors in their discretion may distribute the proceeds, 'or retain the same, or any part thereof for further conversion before distribution, not, however, beyond the period of the lives of my said sons and the survivor of them.' Until the time of distribution, the net income is to be paid semiannually to those entitled to receive it.\n Included in the real estate at the death of the testator was a building in the city of New York known as the 'Commercial Building,' of a value at that time of $290,000. This building the executors held till 1922, when they sold it for $165,000. After allowance for depreciation, the loss to the estate by reason of this sale was $113,300. The executors were at liberty to distribute the entire pro- \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n ceeds ($165,000) among the residuary legatees if their judgment moved them to that course. They did not do so. They distributed only $50,000, and held the balance in the trust. One-fifth of the part distributed belonged and was paid to Richard T. Wilson, Jr. One-fifth of the part retained was held for his use as it had been before the sale.\n The present controversy grows out of a tax return of income for 1922. From the gross income of that year the taxpayer, Richard T. Wilson, Jr., deducted $25,001.17, one-fifth, according to his computation, of the loss resulting from the sale. It was afterwards agreed that one-fifth of the loss was not more than $22,660, and that the amount of the claimed deduction should be corrected accordingly. The Commissioner disallowed the loss altogether, and assessed an additional tax. The taxpayer upon payment of the tax filed a claim for refund which the Commissioner rejected. This suit was then brought to recover the amount paid upon the additional assessment. During the pendency of the suit, the taxpayer died, and his executors were substituted. The District Court gave judgment in their favor, holding that one-fifth of the loss upon the sale of the Commercial Building was a loss suffered by the taxpayer, the beneficiary of the trust, and was a proper deduction from his income for the year of sale. 51 F.(2d) 268. Upon an appeal by the government, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained the representatives of the taxpayer in their claim for a deduction, but reduced the amount. In the view of that court, the loss allowable to the beneficiary was not one-fifth of the entire loss that had been suffered by the trust estate, but only that part of one-fifth of the total loss represented by the ratio between the part of the proceeds presently distributed (not more than $50,000), and $165,000, the entire proceeds of the sale. The record left room for some uncertainty whether the payment of $50,000 had \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n been derived altogether from a sale of the Commercial Building, or in part from other sources. To the end that this uncertainty might be removed, the judgment of the District Court was reversed, and the cause remanded for retrial in accordance with the opinion. 60 F.(2d) 52. Cross-petitions for certiorari, allowed by this court, have brought the controversy here, \n287 \nU.S. 592\n, 53 S.Ct. 123, 77 L.Ed. --. In No. 460, the government complains that there was error in the refusal to disallow the deduction altogether. In No. 461, the representatives of the taxpayer complain that there was error to their prejudice in restricting the amount.\n To determine whether the loss was one suffered by the trust estate, or one suffered by the taxpayer to whom the proceeds of the sale were payable, there is need at the outset to determine the meaning of the will. The government contends, and so the courts below have held, that title to the realty was given to the executors upon a valid trust to sell and to apply the rents and profits in the interval. The representatives of the taxpayer contend that the executors had no title, but only a power in trust, and that, subject to the execution of that power, the taxpayer was owner. If that be so, the loss was his and no one else's. A mere donee of a power is not the owner of an estate, nor to be classed as a juristic entity to which a loss can be attributed. We think, however, that what passed to the executors was ownership or title. True the will does not say in so many words that the residuary estate is given or devised to them, but the absence of such words is of no controlling significance when a gift or devise is the appropriate and normal medium for the attainment of purposes explicitly declared. Robert v. Corning, 89 N.Y. 225, 237; Vernon v. Vernon, 53 N.Y. 351, 359; Tobias v. Ketchum, 32 N.Y. 319; Brewster v. Striker, 2 N.Y. 19. Nothing less than ownership will supply that medium here. The executors are charged \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n with active and continuing duties not susceptible of fulfillment without possession and dominion. They are to collect the income and pay it over in semiannual installments after deducting the expenses. They are to 'hold and manage' the estate with full discretionary powers. They are even at liberty to convey it to a corporation if they believe that efficient administration will thereby be promoted. Under reiterated judgments of the highest court of New York, they are more than the donees of a power. They are the repositories of title. Morse v. Morse, 85 N.Y. 53; Robert v. Corning, N.E. 373; Mee v. Gordon, 187 N.Y. 400, 80 N.E. 373; Mee v. Gordon, 187 N.Y. 400, ,0 N.E. 353, 116 Am.St.Rep. 613, 10 Ann.Cas. 172; Putnam v. Lincoln Safe Deposit Co., 191 N.Y. 166, 182, 83 N.E. 789; Striker v. Daly, 223 N.Y. 468, 472, 119 N.E. 882.\n Another question of construction has yet to be considered. We have seen that the effect of the will was to clothe the executors with title to the land. We have yet to determine whether the title that came to them was the fee or something less. If it was the fee, the whole estate was in them, and no one else had any ownership or interest in the land as distinguished from ownership or interest in the proceeds of a sale. Delafield v. Barlow, 107 N.Y. 535, 14 N.E. 498; Salisbury v. Slade, 160 N.Y. 278, 290, 54 N.E. 741; Weintraub v. Siegel, 133 App.Div. 677, 681, 118 N.Y.S. 261. If it was less than the fee, there may have vested in others upon the death of the testator a future estate in remainder, which would take effect in possession on the termination of the trust. Losey v. Stanley, 147 N.Y. 560, 568, 42 N.E. 8; Stevenson v. Lesley, 70 N.Y. 512; Matter of Easterly, 202 N.Y. 466, 474, 96 N.E. 122. Under the law of New York, what passed to these executors was the title to the fee. By the will of this testator all his property, real and personal (with exceptions not now material), was to be \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 26]\n\u00a0\n converted into money. The five sons and daughters among whom the money was to be divided had no interest in the land, aside from a right in equity to compel the performance of the trust. Real Property Law of New York (Consol. Laws c. 50)  100; Schenck v. Barnes, 156 N.Y. 316, 321, 50 N.E. 967, 41 L. R.A. 395; Melenky v. Melen, 233 N.Y. 19, 23, 134 N.E. 822. What was given to them was the money forthcoming from a sale. Delafield v. Barlow, Salisbury v. Slade, Weintraub v. Siegel, supra. Their interest in the corpus was that and nothing more.\n Our answer to the inquiry as to the meaning of the will comes close to being an answer to the inquiry as to the incidence of the loss. The taxpayer has received the only legacy bequeathed to him, and received it as it was given without the abatement of a dollar. What was bequeathed was an interest in a fund to be made up when the trustees were of opinion that it would be advisable to sell. This alone was given, and this has been received. There has been no loss by the taxpayer of anything that belonged to him before the hour of the sale, for nothing was ever his until the sale had been made and the fund thereby created. A shrinkage of values between the creation of the power of sale and its discretionary exercise is a loss to the trust, which may be allowable as a deduction upon a return by the trustees. It is not a loss to a legatee who has received his legacy in full. One might as well say that a legatee of shares of stock to be bought by executors out of the moneys of the estate would have an allowance of a loss upon a showing that the value would have been greater if the executors in the exercise of their discretion had bought sooner than they did. The legatee must take the legacy as the testator has bequeathed it.\n We hold that the trust, and not the taxpayer, has suffered the loss resulting from the sale of the Commercial \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n Building, and it follows that, where loss has not been suffered, there is none to be allowed. Whether the result would be the same if the beneficiaries had been the owner of future estates in remainder, we are not required to determine. Cf. Francis v. Commissioner, 15 B.T.A. 1332, 1340. Our ruling will be kept within the limits o f the case before us. In so ruling, we do not forget that the trust is an abstraction, and that the economic pinch is felt by men of flesh and blood. Even so, the law has seen fit to deal with this abstraction for income tax purposes as a separate existence, making its own return under the hand of the fiduciary and claiming and receiving its own appropriate deductions. The Revenue Act of 1921 under which the tax in question was imposed defines the word 'taxpayer' as including a trust or an estate. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227,  2(9). The definition is pursued to its logical conclusion in a long series of decisions. Baltzell v. Mitchell (C.C.A.) 3 F.(2d) 428; Whitcomb v. Blair, 58 App.D.C. 104, 25 F.(2d) 528; Abell v. Tait (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 54; Busch v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 800, 801; Roxburghe v. Burnet, 61 App.D.C. 141, 58 F.(2d) 693. Cf. Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509\n, 41 S.Ct. 386, 15 A.L.R. 1305. These and other cases bear witness to the rule that an equitable life tenant may not receive a deduction for the loss of capital assets of the trust, though the result of such a loss is a reduction of his income. The argument will not hold that what was lost to this taxpayer was not the capital of the trust, but rather his own capital, withdrawn from his possession, but held for his account by the executors as custodians or bailiffs. His capital was in the proceeds, to the extent that they were distributed, and never in the land. We do not pause to consider whether a statute differently conceived and framed would yield results more consonant with fairness and reason. We take the statute as we find it. \n\n[289 U.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in reversing the judgment of the District Court. It did err in its instructions as to the relief upon a second trial.\n The judgment of reversal is accordingly affirmed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with instructions that a judgment should be entered dismissing the complaint. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANGLO-CHILEAN NITRATE SALES CORP. v. STATE OF ALABAMA(1933)\nNo. 377\nArgued: January 19, 1933Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama. \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 219]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. Worth Vaughan and Elihu Root, Jr., both of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., and Frontis H. Moore, both of Montgomery, Ala., for the State of Alabama.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 218, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is a New York corporation having its principal office in that state. October 10, 1927, it qualified to do business in Alabama, and March 14, 1930, made and sent to the state tax commission a return showing that its \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n only property in Alabama on December 31, 1929, the date as of which the statute required the statement to be made, was 33,455,763 pounds of nitrate of soda which had been imported by it from Chile into Alabama and stored in the original packages, the book value of which was $712,846.72. March 31, 1930, the commission under section 54 of No. 163, General Acts 1927,1 assessed against appellant for that year a franchise tax of $1,425. 69, being at the rate of $2 on each $1,000 of the value so reported.\n Conformably to state practice appellant appealed to the circuit court of Montgomery county. The case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts the abridged substance of which follows.\n From the date of its qualification in Alabama to the time of the assessment, appellant was engaged in the business of importing nitrate through the port of Mobile and other ports. The nitrate, in bags containing about 100 pounds each, was brought into Mobile and there stored \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 222]\n\u00a0\n by appellant in a public warehouse and kept in the original packages until sold and delivered to the ultimate consumers. All was sold upon orders through a salesman who, paying his own expenses, was compensated by commissions on his sales. The orders were taken subject to approval and were not effective until approved by appellant in its New York office. When so accepted, directions were given that the nitrate be forwarded to the customers. These directions were given to and carried out by the Walsh Stevedoring Company at Mobile, an independent contractor, having an arrangement with appellant to handle its importations of nitrate, store it in a public warehouse and forward it as directed.\n All transactions were for cash. The customers received the nitrate only upon payment of the purchase price when they took up the shipping documents through a bank of collection by paying the drafts attached. Such payments were sent to the Merchants' National Bank at Mobile and by it immediately transferred to appellant in New York. Appellant had no bank account in Alabama and paid all expenses there by remittances from New York. On the date as of which appellant's return was made it had no accounts or bills receivable in Alabama and had no money there at any time except during the brief intervals that the funds were being so transmitted. It did not have or employ any capital in that State unless the importation through the port of Mobile, the storage and sale of nitrate in the manner above described constitutes capital and its employment there.\n Section 54, under which the assessment was made, declares that every corporation organized under the laws of any other state and doing business in Alabama shall pay to the state an annual franchise tax of $2 on each $1, 000 of the actual amount of capital employed therein. Appellant maintained below and here insists that the section, construed to impose the tax in question, \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 223]\n\u00a0\n is repugnant to the declarations of the federal Constitution: 'No state shall, without the consent of the congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws,' article 1,  10, cl. 2, and, 'The congress shall have power ... to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states ...' article 1,  8.\n The Alabama statute in question was enacted in pursuance of section 232 of the state Constitution which declares: No foreign corporation shall do any business in the state without having a place of business and an authorized agent therein and without filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of its articles of incorporation. 'The legislature shall, by general law, provide for the payment to the State of Alabama of a franchise tax by such corporation, but such franchise tax shall be based on the actual amount of capital employed in this state.' As to the meaning and purpose of the statute, we are governed by the construction put upon it by the state supreme court.\n Its decisions clearly show that the exaction is laid, not upon the authorization, right, or privilege to do business in Alabama, but upon the actual doing of business. While the case at bar was pending on appeal there, the state supreme court in State v. National Cash Credit Ass'n, 224 Ala. 629, 632, 141 So. 541, 544, held that the mere investment in or ownership of property in the state by a foreign corporation does not subject it to the franchise tax. Adverting to the language of the statute, it declared that the 'property must be employed in a corporate business done in this state.' On rehearing, May 19, 1932, and after its decision in the case before us, that court said: 'We merely hold a franchise tax to be what it purports to be, a tax upon the exercise or use of its franchise in Alabama for the purposes of such franchise; and that, \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 224]\n\u00a0\n if no corporate activity is conducted in Alabama during the period covered by the tax, the corporation does not owe a franchise tax.'\n And in the case at bar the court said: 'The defendant duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business in this state, appointed a resident agent, and that it actually engaged in business in Alabama by selling its nitrate through a selesman both within and without the state appears as an uncontroverted fact. It seeks to be relieved from this franchise tax solely upon the theory the imported nitrate, the sale of which constituted its business, was immune from state taxation. ... The statute here under review has no reference to imports, but is merely of a general character relating to the fixation of the amount of a franchise tax upon foreign corporations doing business in this state.' 142 So. 87, 89. And, aftet referring to the manner of appellant's acceptance of orders and the collections and remittances, the court said: 'These details go to show the corporation was actually engaged in business in this state. ...' 142 So. 87, 91. As appellant did no local business in the state, that decision plainly rests upon the assumption that Alabama had power to tax appellant's sales in original packages of the nitrate it imported into that state only for sale and that such sales constituted a business that is taxable under section 54. The Alabama statute is unlike that of Michigan examined here in Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board of Michigan, \n287 \nU.S. 295\n, 53 S.Ct. 137, and Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 342\n, 52 S.Ct. 512. There the tax upon a domestic corporation was imposed for the mere right to transact business.\n The fact that appellant qualified to do business in Alabama was not, and rightly cannot be, held to sustain the tax. In Ozark Pipe Line v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.Ct. 184, we condemned as repugnant to the commerce clause a Missouri statute that required every foreign corporation engaged in business in that state to pay an annual franchise tax upon the privilege or right to do business. \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 225]\n\u00a0\n The company's business there consisted in the operation of a pipe line for interstate transportation of oil and in the ownership of property, the keeping of its principal office, purchase of supplies, employment of labor, maintenance and operation of telephone and telegraph lines all in furtherance of such interstate commerce and constituting the means and instruments by which it was conducted. We held that the tax could not be constitutionally exacted, and that the facts that the foreign corporation was organized for local business and had applied for and received a local license conferring the power of eminent domain did not enable the state to tax its right to carry on interstate commerce. We said (page 567 of 266 U. S., 45 S.Ct. 184, 187): 'The state has no such power even in the case of domestic corporations. See Phila. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 342\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118.'\n The question whether, consistently with the imports and commerce clauses, the Alabama statute may be construed to require appellant to pay the specified franchise tax is dual in form but single in substance for, upon the facts of this case, it is clear that if the exaction is a tax on imports it necessarily burdens foreign commerce. Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 295\n, 38 S.Ct. 126.\n The stipulation of the parties shows that the only transactions in Alabama in which appellant is concerned are the landing, storage, and sale of the nitrate in the form and packages in which it was put up abroad and transported into the United States. The bags were kept intact, no nitrate was removed therefrom, and, prior to the delivery of the same to those who bought from appellant, it was not in any manner commingled with, and did not become a part of, the general mass of property within the state. The right to import the nitrate included the right to sell it in the original bags while it remained the property of appellant and before it lost its distinctive character as an import. State prohibition of such sales \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 226]\n\u00a0\n would take from appellant the very rights in respect of importation that are conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Alabama was powerless, without the consent of Congress, to tax the nitrate before such sales or to require appellant by the payment of occupation or franchise tax or otherwise to purchase from it the privilege of selling goods so imported and handled. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 436, 442- 444. In that case a state license fee imposed on an importer selling imported goods in the original bales or packages was condemned as repugnant to the imports and commerce clauses. Chief Justice Marshall said ( page 444 of 12 Wheat.): 'All must perceive, that a tax on the sale of an article, imported only for sale, is a tax on the article itself . ... A tax on the occupation of an importer is ... a tax on importation. It must add to the price of the article, and be paid by the consumer, or by the importer himself, in like manner as a direct duty on the article itself would be made. This the state has not a right to do, because it is prohibited by the constitution.'\n In Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n, the court held offensive to the same provisions a tax on the amount of the sales of imported goods in the original packages made by an auctioneer for the importer. In May & Co. v. New Orleans, \n178 U.S. 496\n, the court, at page 507, 20 S.Ct. 976, formally reaffirmed and succinctly stated the propositions established in Brown v. Maryland, but held that the city tax there involved did not violate the imports or commerce clause because the imported goods were not sold in the original package. \n2\n And recently in Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 U.S. 216\n, we said, at page 228, 51 S.Ct. 125, 128: 'When the Constitution prohibits States from laying duties on imports, the prohibition not \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 227]\n\u00a0\n only extends to a tax upon the act of importing, but also to one upon the occupation of the importer or upon the articles imported. A tax on the sale of an article, imported only for sale, is a tax on the article itself. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444.' And see Almy v. State of California, 24 How. 169; Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283\n, 21 S.Ct. 648; Selliger v. Kentucky, \n213 \nU.S. 200\n, 29 S.Ct. 449; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S.Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; Thames & Mersey Ins. Co. v. United States, \n237 \nU.S. 19\n, 35 S.Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506, 509\n, 43 S.Ct. 643. The constitutional protection extends to corporations as well as to individuals. Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 57\n, 11 S.Ct. 851, International Text- Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 108\n, 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.( N.S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103\n\n\n In support of its conclusion the state court cited and appellee relies upon New York State v. Roberts, \n171 \nU.S. 658\n, 19 S.Ct. 58, 70. The question for decision in the case now before us was not involved, presented, or decided there. The statute of New York considered there imposed a tax on the business or franchise of domestic and foreign corporations except, among others, those wholly engaged in carrying on manufacture in the state. The taxpayer, Parke, Davis & Co., was a Michigan corporation. It had its factory in Detroit and a warehouse and depot in New York. It had a manager and over fifty employees there. It did local business and also sold in original packages goods received from its factory and goods imported for it from foreign countries. The tax rate was graded by the statute according to dividends (presumably paid out of net earnings). Cf. U.S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748. The tax base was the amount of capital employed within the state and the comptroller fixed that amount at $90,000. The corporation, seeking to have the assessment set aside, took the case to the state supreme court. It sustained the assessment against the contention that the statute as construed by the comptroller was repugnant to \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 228]\n\u00a0\n the privileges and immunities clause, article 4,  2, and held that the business was 'not interstate commerce, which will prevent the corporation carrying it on from being taxed. ...' People ex rel. Parke, Davis & Co. v. Roberts, 91 Hun, 158, 162, 36 N.Y.S. 368, 371. No other federal question was considered. The court of appeals affirmed without opinion. In this court the corporation's principal insistence was that the statute was repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it exempted domestic corporations manufacturing and selling in New York while imposing upon the Michigan corporation a discriminatory tax for selling in New York in original packages products manufactured in its Detroit factory. The court overruled that contention. The opinion shows that as to the amount of its capital employed in New York no federal question was presented. And, as admittedly the corporation did a local business in that state, i.e., business not included in interstate or foreign commerce (New York v. Roberts, \n171 \nU.S. 659\n, 19 S.Ct. 58, 70, People ex rel. Parke, Davis & Co. v. Roberts, 91 Hun, 160, 36 N.Y. S. 368), that case is essentially different from this one.\n The decisions here since New York State v. Roberts, supra, definitely show that the power of the state to withhold from a foreign corporation permission to exercise its franchise to do business therein does not enable it, when granting the privilege, to burden by taxation interstate commerce carried on by such corporation within the state. And quite recently in Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 U.S. 426\n, we said (page 434, 46 S.Ct. 331, 332): 'Thus the right to exclude a foreign corporation cannot be used to prevent it from resorting to a federal Court. Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S.Ct. 188, 21 A.L.R. 186; or to tax it upon property that by established principles the State has no power to tax, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190, and other cases in the same volume and later that have followed it; or to interfere with interstate commerce, Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S.Ct. 57; Looney \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 229]\n\u00a0\n v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S.Ct. 85; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S.Ct. 438, 1 A.L.R. 1278.' See Ozark Pipe Line v. Monier, supra; Alpha Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203\n, 45 S.Ct. 477, 44 A.L.R. 1219; Frost Trucking Co. v. R.R. Comm. of California, \n271 U.S. 583\n, 593, et seq., 46 S.Ct. 605, 47 A.L.R. 457; Sprout v. South Bend, Ind., \n277 U.S. 163\n, 170-171, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; New Jersey Tel. Co. v. Tax Board of New Jersey, \n280 \nU.S. 338, 346\n, 50 S.Ct. 111; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm. of Ohio, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S.Ct. 499.\n It follows that the Alabama statute, construed to impose a tax upon appellant for selling in that state in the original packages the nitrate imported by it from Chile, is repugnant to the imports and commerce clauses above quoted. And, as it did no other business in that state, it is not liable for any part of the tax that the state commission assessed against it.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n This case does not present the question that would be here if the appellant had not sought for and obtained a privilege or franchise to do a local business in the state of Alabama. There is nothing in the Alabama decisions, and little in her statutes, to indicate that the tax would have been sustained in the absence of such a grant, or that there would have been even an attempt to levy it. Ewart Lumber Co. v. American Cement Co., 9 Ala.App. 152, 156, 62 So. 560; Citizens' National Bank v. Buckheit, 14 Ala.App. 511, 517, 519, 71 So. 82; Tyson v. Jennings Produce Co., 16 Ala.

City Council of Montgomery, 110 Ala. 619, 20 So. 127; Alabama Code of 1928,  7217, limiting the application of sections 7209 to 7220. Indeed, the Attorney General informed us on the argument that this would have been the position of his department of the Govern- \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 230]\n\u00a0\n ment, charged, as it is, with the collection of the revenues of the state. Alabama has said by her courts that it is beyond the power of the Legislature to restrict by conditions the exercise or enjoyment of a privilege that has its origin and sanction in the Constitution of the nation. See cases supra. Alabama has said by her statutes (Code,  7217) that the permits and franchise taxes exacted of foreign corporations by article 26 of the Alabama Code do not apply to corporations 'engaging in or transacting business of interstate commerce only,' if the privilege they ask for is that and nothing more. The act now in question (Section 54 of Act No. 163, approved July 22, 1927, Alabama General Acts 1927, p. 176) was passed in fulfilment of a mandate laid upon the Legislature by section 232 of the Alabama Constitution. By that section it is provided that no foreign corporation shall do business in that state 'without having at least one known place of business and an authorized agent or agents therein, and without filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of its articles of incorporation or association.' By the same section: 'The legislature shall, by general law, provide for the payment to the State of Alabama of a franchise tax by such corporation, but such franchise tax shall be based on the actual amount of capital employed in this state.' It is this section that the courts of Alabama have adjudged to be inapplicable to interstate business. See cases supra. If that is the construction to be given to the command whereby the Legislature was to establish a franchise tax and measure it in a certain way, there can be no doubt that the same construction must be given to the statute passed thereafter to give effect to the command. The power abjured in one breath was not exerted in the next.\n With this approach to the problem, the pathway in made open. When the Legislature of Alabama said in 1927 that an annual tax was imposed upon the fran- \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 231]\n\u00a0\n chise of every foreign corporation, it meant to lay the burden upon those franchises and those only which there was power in Alabama to grant or to withhold. If the corporation was there by virtue of a dual right, the one created by the state, and no other, was to be subjected to the charge. The presumption of that intention is hardly to be escaped in view of past disclaimers of a purpose more pretentious. True there is another section of the same act whereby a written permit is exacted for 'the purpose of registration and to prevent the duplication of names and in order to secure for the public record, for taxation, and for other purposes, the names and addresses of the said corporations,' and its officers (Act No. 163, p. 171,  42). True also that for such a permit there is to be paid an annual tax varying from $5, the minimum, to $100, the maximum. The statute provides, however, that the tax imposed by that section shall be 'in addition to other license and privilege taxes required to be paid by law.' There is thus a tax in the nature of a fee to be paid in instalments as compensation for the permit, and another tax, measured by the capital in use within the state, upon the underlying franchise. The fee for the permit does not rebut the inference that there is not to be a tax upon the franchise unless user is a privilege that issues from the state. Doubt, if there is any, will be resolved in favor of the construction that keeps the act alive.\n The appellant was not satisfied to stand upon its federal right, though the state had made it plain that the claim of right would be respected. It was seeking something more, the privilege of going over the line that marks the federal immunity; and to that end it asked for and obtained a license or franchise, the name is unimportant, to do a local business as well as one related to interstate or foreign commerce. By the grant thus pro- \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 232]\n\u00a0\n cured, it became free, at its unfettered will, to sell at wholesale or at retail, in the original packages or in others, unhampered by the restrictions that would have limited its capacity if it had been there as an importer and with the powers of an importer only. This franchise or privilege, this grant of benefits beyond any conferred by the federal Constitution, the state of Alabama was competent to tax. Home Ins. Co. v. N.Y., \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S.Ct. 593, 594; Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 440\n, 14 S.Ct. 865; Kansas City Ry. v. Kansas, \n240 U.S. 227\n; Lusk v.

There being competence to tax, there was competence to measure the burden of the payment by capital employed, irrespective of the use to which employment is directed. Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra; Home Ins. Co. v. N.Y., supra. There may be a wrong to the taxpayer if the standard of measurement is oppressive and unreasonable. W. U. Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190. There is none where the standard bears a fair and natural relation, in its normal or average workings, to the privilege conferred.\n The argument is made, however, that the tax though declared by the express terms of the statute to be a tax upon the 'franchise' is confined to corporations 'doing business' in Alabama, and hence is to be viewed as a tax upon the kind of business actually conducted, and not upon the franchise to conduct it in that or other ways. More than once a like argument directed to statutes phrased in the same way has been urged upon this court, only to be rejected as unsound. Home Ins. Co. v. N.Y., supra; St. Louis, S.W. Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 233]\n\u00a0\n supra; L. & N.R.R. Co. v. Alabama, \n248 \nU.S. 533\n, 39 S.Ct. 18; Id., 201 Ala. 317, 78 So. 93 (involving a statute of Alabama similar to this one); Kansas City Ry. v.

N.Y., supra, a statute provided that every corporation then or thereafter incorporated under any law of the state or of any other state or country, 'and doing business in the state,' should be subject to a tax 'upon 'its corporate franchise or business,\" measured by its dividends. The court held that the tax was one upon the privilege 'of doing business in a corporate capacity,' and not upon the business or activities that were the outcome of the privilege. Cf. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, pages 145, 146 of 220 U.S., 31 S.Ct. 342, Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334\n, 52 S.Ct. 512, Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corp.

There would be greater force in the appellant's argument if its construction of the tax as one upon the activity or the business had support in anything decided by the courts of Alabama. To the contrary, the highest court of the state has put that meaning aside by its opinion in this very case. Adopting the reasoning of this court in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, it has said that 'the tax is an excise upon the particular privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, and with the advantages derived therefrom.' State v. Anglo-Chilean Nitrate Sales Corp. (Ala. Sup.) 142 So. 87, 91; cf. L. & N.R.R. Co. v. State, 201 Ala. 317, 318, 78 So. 93; Ellis v. Handley Mfg. Co., 214 Ala. 539, 108 So. 343; Kansas City Ry. Co. v. Stiles, 182 Ala. 138, 62 So. 734. True indeed it is that the corporation will be relieved of the burden if no business is transacted and no capital employed (State v. National Cash Credit Association, 224 Ala. 629, 141 So. 541), but so was the corporation in the Home Insurance Case, and so also were the corporations in many other cases. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., St. Louis, S.W. \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 234]\n\u00a0\n Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, L. & N.R.R. Co. v. Alabama, Kansas City Ry. Co. v. Stiles, supra. If the state has conferred a privilege which it is competent to tax, the competence is not lost, and the validity of the tax destroyed, because the privilege is to be free when the corporation is inactive. There is a requirement in the Alabama Constitution, repeated in the statute, that the tax upon the franchise shall be measured by the capital employed within the state, a measure obviously inapplicable to dormant corporations. In such circumstances, activity is an event that conditions liability, but the privilege, not the event, is still the subject of the burden. To re sume the matter in a few words: The tax is not imposed upon those capacities and privileges that emanate by implication from the power of the nation. The tax is laid upon those privileges, and those only, that emanate either expressly or by implication from the power of the state. Business, it is true, must have been done, for without the doing of business there can be no capital employed. Even so, capital and business are by-products and incidents, like dividends or income. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. They are the yardstick by which the state measures the value of the privilege. They are not the privilege itself.\n The argument is made that 'capital employed' is an illegal and arbitrary measure because the appellant has made no use of the taxable franchise emanating from the state, but has confined its activities to interstate or foreign commerce. What has been said in recent cases ( Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra, and Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra) goes far to give the answer. There was no attempt here as there was in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, supra, or in Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S.Ct. 85, or in International Paper Co. v. Mass., \n246 \nU.S. 135\n, 38 S.Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617, or in other cases of that type, to burden a local privilege in close association with one not local by a levy upon values beyond the confines of the state. \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 235]\n\u00a0\n Cf. Kansas City Ry. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 \nU.S. 111, 119\n, 37 S.Ct. 58; Baltic Mining Co. v. Mass., \n231 \nU.S. 68\n, 34 S.Ct. 15; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66\n, 40 S.Ct. 435; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Hinkle, \n278 \nU.S. 460\n, 49 S.Ct. 204; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra, at page 391 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 170. The measure here was capital employed in Alabama (St. Louis, S.W. Ry. v. Arkansas, supra; L. & N.R.R. Co. v. Alabama, supra); and it was a mere fortuity that in this instance the capital was made up of imports still intact. Moreover, what was done under the franchise one day might not be done under it the next. Another franchise tax would not be owing for a year. In the meantime the appellant might transact its business as it pleased. If some of its sales, however few and trifing, had been made in broken packages, there would be no denial by any one that the privilege of making them would be subject to taxation by one measure or another. This court has never held that the measure in such circumstances would be arbitrary and unlawful because determined by the value of all the local capital, and not merely the proportion necessary for sales in broken lots. In principle the situation would then be governed by the ruling in Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S.Ct. 305, and Western Cartridge Co. v. Emmerson, \n281 \nU.S. 511\n, 50 S.Ct. 383, where an apportionment very similar had the approval of this court. Especially must the standard hold when the statute is directed against foreign corporations generally, and not particularly against such of them as are engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. If the standard is a valid one when the privilege is used, it does not cease to be valid because user is abandoned or postponed. Very likely the statute might have been read in a different way. It might have been read as imposing two conditions, first that business should have been done, and second that what was done could be attributed, at least in part, to the actual exercise of the privileges granted by the state. As to such matters of construction the \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 236]\n\u00a0\n courts of the state may speak the final word. All that concerns us here is capacity or power. Here was no covert effort by the state to extend its taxing jurisdiction into an area denied to it. The burden upon interstate business in Western Union v. Kansas and the other cases cited, was an outcome inherent in the statutory scheme; it was the very event intended. The burden here, if there was any, was unforeseen and adventitious. Cf. Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S.Ct. 829, Kansas City Ry. Co. v. Stiles, supra.\n None of the decisions cited by the appellant controls the case at hand.\n Ozark Pipe Line Corporation v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.Ct. 184, is invoked with special confidence. There are obvious distinctions. The statute of Missouri there held to be invalid in its application to a corporation engaged in interstate commerce was very similar in form to the statute of Alabama in controversy here. The conduct of the aggrieved corporation was, however, very different. Its business was the operation of a pipe line from oil wells in Oklahoma passing through Missouri to a distination in Illinois. Nothing was done in Missouri, or so the court interpreted the evidence, except in furtherance of transportation. Oil was neither received nor delivered in that state. In these circumstances the corporation asked for and obtained from Missouri a license to 'engage 'exclusively in the business of transporting crude petroleum by pipe line.\" 266 U.S. at pages 561, 567, 45 S.Ct. 184, 187. This, however, was the very business that was incidental to the federal right. The privilege to transport upon the interstate journey was an essential incident of commerce, and so an emanation from the federal power. The court did not hold that the tax would have been unlawful if laid upon a franchise emanating from the power of the state. The court condemned the \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 237]\n\u00a0\n tax for the reason that it read the statute as designed to lay a burden on the franchise to do business as an interstate carrier. The imputation of that design was borne out in a measure by the remedy, for the state had brought a suit not only to impress a lien upon the property, but to revoke the license altogether (page 561 of 266 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 184, 185), limited though it was. Cf. Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 119\n, 41 S.Ct. 45; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 530\n, 43 S.Ct. 192. If there had been decisions in Missouri, as there are in Alabama, disclaiming a purpose to affect the federal privilege, and if the state and federal privileges had varied substantially from each other in meaning and in function, the parallel would be closer between the Ozark Case and this. But if those conditions had been present, the result must have been changed.\n Other cases, emphasized in the briefs, are still more faintly applicable.\n Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126, brought before us a tax upon the business of foreign commerce, whether conducted by natural persons or by corporations. Its measure was the gross receipts. 'It bears no semblance of a property tax, or a franchise tax in the proper sense; nor is it an occupation tax, except as it is imposed upon the very carrying on of the business of exporting merchandise.' \n245 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 126, 128. Cf. Phila. S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118. The conclusion would have been different if net income, and not gross, had been adopted as the measure. United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S.Ct. 432; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 52\n, 40 S.Ct. 221. The case has no relation to the validity of a tax to be measured by local capital and imposed upon a privilege.\n Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachussetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203\n, 45 S.Ct. 477, 44 A.L.R. 1219, dealt with a statute of Massachusetts, different in \n\n[288 U.S. 218, 238]\n\u00a0\n form from this, and interpreted as one laid directly upon the operations of the business. Cf. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196\n, 5 S.Ct. 826. No license or franchise to engage in a local business had been granted by the state.\n Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, was a case of a discriminatory tax upon the business of importers, and Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n, a case of a discriminatory tax upon an auctioneer selling for importers. In neither was there a franchise, or a tax upon a franchise, or a reference to capital as a standard of measurement. In each the presence of imported packages to be subjected to a burden was an event considered and intended, not an adventitious circumstance developing unexpectedly in the application of the tax to one taxpayer out of many.\n The tax imposed by this statute does not discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations to the prejudice of the latter. Domestic corporations pay a franchise tax that is measured by their whole capital; foreign corporations one that is measured by 'the actual amount of capital employed' within the state. It does not discriminate between foreign corporations engaged in interstate or foreign commerce and other foreign corporations. It lays a burden on all impartially. Finally, it is not oppressive in amount, nor framed in such a form as to suggest a furtive purpose to stifle activities not covered by its terms. The tax is $2 per thousand dollars until 1932, and $1 per thousand afterwards. General Acts of Alabama, 1927,  56, p. 177.\n The appellant is in the enjoyment of a privilege of value which it solicited and received from the state of Alabama, and for that privilege it should pay.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 54 of Act No. 163, Alabama General Acts 1927, p. 176, provides: 'That every corporation organized under the laws of any other state, nation, or territory, and doing business in this State, except strictly benevolent, educational or religious corporations, shall pay annually to the State an annual franchise tax of Two Dollars ($2.00) on each One Thousand Dollars of the actual amount of capital employed in this State.

The District Court, composed of three Circuit Judges, made detailed findings of fact and entered final decree granting the injunction. 1 F.Supp. 339. The case comes here on appeal. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n Defendants, other than Appalachian Coals, Inc., are 137 producers of bituminous coal in eight districts (called for \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 357]\n\u00a0\n convenience Appalachian territory) lying in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. These districts, described as the Southern High Volatile Field, form part of the coal bearing area stretching from central and western Pennsylvania through eastern Ohio, western Maryland, West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and northeastern Alabama. In 1929 (the last year for which complete statistics were available) the total production of bituminous coal east of the Mississippi river was 484,786,000 tons, of which defendants mined 58,011, 367 tons, or 11.96 per cent. In the so-called Appalachian territory and the immediately surrounding area, the total production was 107,008,209 tons, of which defendants' production was 54.21 per cent., or 64 per cent. if the output of 'captive' mines (16,455,001 tons) be deducted. \n1\n With a further deduction of 12,000,000 tons of coal produced in the immediately surrounding territory, which, however, is not essentially different from the particular area described in these proceedings as Appalachian territory, defendants' production in the latter region was found to amount to 74.4 per cent. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The challenged combination lies in the creation by the defendant producers of an exclusive selling agency. This agency is the defendant Appalachian Coals, Inc., which may be designated as the Company. Defendant producers own all its capital stock, their holdings being in \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 358]\n\u00a0\n proportion to their production. The majority of the common stock. which has exclusive voting right, is held by seventeen defendants. By uniform contracts, separately made, each defendant producer constitutes the Company an exclusive agent for the sale of all coal (with certain exceptions) which the producer mines in Appalachian territory. 3 The Company agrees to establish standard classifications, to sell all the coal of all its principals at the best prices obtainable and, if all cannot be sold, to apportion orders upon a stated basis. The plan contemplates that prices are to be fixed by the officers of the Company at its central office, save that, upon contracts calling for future deliveries after sixty days, the Company must obtain the producer's consent. The Company is to be paid a commission of 10 per cent. of the gross selling prices f.o.b. at the mines, and guarantees accounts. In order to preserve their existing sales outlets, the producers may designate subagents, according to a agreed form of contract, who are to sell upon the terms and prices established by the Company and are to be allowed by the Company commissions of eight per cent. The Company has not yet begun to operate as selling agent; the contracts with it run to April 1, 1935, and from year to year thereafter unless terminated by either party on six months' notice.\n The Government's contention, which the District Court sustained, is that the plan violates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note)- in the view that it eliminates competition among the defendants themselves and also gives the selling agency power substantially to affect and control the price of bituminous coal in many interstate markets. On the latter point the District Court made the general finding that this elimination of competition and con- \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 359]\n\u00a0\n certed action will affect market conditions, and have a tendency to stabilize prices and to raise prices to a higher level than would prevail under conditions of free competition. The court added that the selling agency will not have monopoly control of any market nor the power to fix monopoly prices.\n Defendants insist that the primary purpose of the formation of the selling agency was to increase the sale, and thus the production, of Appalachian coal through better methods of distribution, intensive advertising and research, to achieve economies in marketing, and to eliminate abnormal, deceptive, and destructive trade practices. They disclaim any intent to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce, and in justification of their design they point to the statement of the District Court that 'it is but due to defendants to say that the evidence in the case clearly shows that they have been acting fairly and openly, in an attempt to organize the coal industry and to relieve the deplorable conditions resulting from overexpansion, destructive competition, wasteful trade practices, and the inroads of competing industries.' 1 F.Supp. page 341. Defendants contend that the evidence establishes that the selling agency will not have the power to dominate or fix the price of coal in any consuming market; that the price of coal will continue to be set in an open competitive market; and that their plan by increasing the sale of bituminous coal from Appalachian territory will promote, rather than restrain, interstate commerce.\n First. There is no question as to the test to be applied in determining the legality of the defendants' conduct. The purpose of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act is to prevent undue restraints of interstate commerce, to maintain its appropriate freedom in the public interest, to afford protection from the subversive or coercive influences of monopolistic endeavor. As a charter of freedom, the act \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 360]\n\u00a0\n has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions. It does not go into detailed definitions which might either work injury to legitimate enterprise or through particularization defeat its purposes by providing loopholes for escape. The restrictions the act imposes are not mechanical or artificial. Its general phrases, interpreted to attain its fundamental objects, set up the essential standard of reasonableness. They call for vigilance in the detection and frustration of all efforts unduly to restrain the free course of interstate commerce, but they do not seek to establish a mere delusive liberty either by making impossible the normal and fair expansion of that commerce or the adoption of reasonable measures to protect it from injurious and destructive practices and to promote competition upon a sound basis. The decisions establish, said this Court in Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 781, 'that only such contracts and combinations are within the act as, by reason of intent or the inherent nature of the contemplated acts, prejudice the public interests by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the course of trade.' See Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Company, \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632; Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S.Ct. 242, 244; National Ass'n of Window Glass Manufacturers v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 403, 412\n, 44 S.Ct. 148; Maple Flooring Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563, 583\n, 584 S., 45 S.Ct. 578, 592; Paramount Famous Corporation v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 30, 43\n, 51 S.Ct. 42; Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 51 S.Ct. 421.\n In applying this test, a close and objective scrutiny of particular conditions and purposes is necessary in each case. Realities must dominate the judgment. The mere fact that the parties to an agreement eliminate competition between themselves is not enough to condemn it. 'The legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 361]\n\u00a0\n competition. Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains.' Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra. The familiar illustrations of partnerships, and enterprises fairly integrated in the interest of the promotion of commerce, at once occur. The question of the application of the statute is one of intent and effect, and is not to be determined by arbitrary assumptions. It is therefore necessary in this instance to consider the economic conditions peculiar to the coal industry, the practices which have obtained, the nature of defendant's plan of making sales, the reasons which led to its adoption, and the probable consequences of the carrying out of that plan in relation to market prices and other matters affecting the public interest in interstate commerce in bituminous coal.\n Second. The findings of the District Court, upon abundant evidence, leave no room for doubt as to the economic condition of the coal industry. That condition, as the District Court states, 'for many years has been indeed deplorable.' Due largely to the expansion under the stimulus of the Great War, 'the bituminous mines of the country have a developed capacity exceeding 700,000,000 tons' to meet a demand 'of less than 500,000,000 tons.' In connection with this increase in surplus production, the consumption of coal in all the industries which are its largest users has shown a substantial relative decline. The actual decrease is partly due to the industrial condition but the relative decrease is progressing, due entirely to other causes. Coal has been losing markets to oil, natural gas and water power and has also been losing ground due to greater efficiency in the use of coal. The change has been more rapid during the last few years by reason of the developments of both oil and gas fields. The court below found that, based upon the assumption that bituminous coal would have maintained the upward trend prevailing between 1900 and 1915 in percentage of total \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 362]\n\u00a0\n energy supply in the United States, the total substitution between 1915 and 1930 has been equal to more than 200,000,000 tons per year. \n4\n While proper allowance must be made for differences in consumption in different parts of the country,5 the adverse influence upon the coal industry, including the branch of it under review, of the use of substitute fuels and of improved methods is apparent.\n This unfavorable condition has been aggravated by particular practices. One of these relates to what is called 'distress coal.' The greater part of the demand is for particular sizes of coal such as nut and slack, stove coal, egg coal, and lump coal. Any one size cannot be prepared without making several sizes. According to the finding of the court below, one of the chief problems of \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 363]\n\u00a0\n the industry is thus involved in the practice of producing different sizes of coal even though orders are on hand for only one size, and the necessity of marketing all sizes. Usually there are no storage facilities at the mines and the different sizes produced are placed in cars on the producer's tracks, which may become so congested that either production must be stopped or the cars must be moved regardless of demand. This leads to the practice of shipping unsold coal to billing points or on consignment to the producer or his agent in the consuming territory. If the coal is not sold by the time it reaches its destination, and is not unloaded promptly, it becomes subject to demurrage charges which may exceed the amount obtainable for the coal unless it is sold quickly. The court found that this type of 'distress coal' presses on the market at all times, includes all sizes and grades, and the total amount from all causes is of substantial quantity.\n'Pyramiding' of coal is another 'destructive practice.' It occurs when a producer authorizes several persons to sell the same coal, and they may in turn offer it for sale to other dealers. In consequence 'the coal competes with itself, thereby resulting in abnormal and destructive competition which depresses the price for all coals in the market.' Again, there is misrepresentation by some producers in selling one size of coal and shipping another size which they happen to have on hand. 'The lack of standardization of sizes and the misrepresentation as to sizes' are found to have been injurious to the coal industry as a whole. The court added, however, that the evidence did not show the existence of any trade war or widespread fraudulent conduct. The industry also suffers through 'credit losses,' which are due to the lack of agencies for the collection of comprehensive data with respect to the credits that can safely be extended.\n\n In addition to these factors, the District Court found that organized buying agencies, and large consumers \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 364]\n\u00a0\n purchasing substantial tonnages, 'constitute unfavorable forces.' 'The highly organized and concentrated buying power which they control and the great abundance of coal available have contributed to make the market for coal a buyers' market for many years past.'\n It also appears that the 'unprofitable condition' of the industry has existed particularly in the Appalachian territory where there is little local consumption as the region is not industrialized. 'The great bulk of the coal there produced is sold in the highly competitive region east of the Mississippi river and north of the Ohio river under an adverse freight rate which imposes an unfavorable differential from 35 cents to 50 cents per ton.' \n6\n And in a graphic summary of the economic situation, the court found that 'numerous producing companies have gone into bankruptcy or into the hands of receivers, many mines have been shut down, the number of days of operation per week have been greatly curtailed, wages to labor have been substantially lessened, and the states in which coal producing companies are located have found it increasingly difficult to collect taxes.'\n Third. The findings also fully disclose the proceedings of the defendants in formulating their plan and the reasons for its adoption. The serious economic conditions had led to discussions among coal operators and state and national officials, seeking improvement of the industry. Governors of states had held meetings with coal producers. The limits of official authority were apparent. A general meeting of producers, sales agents and attorneys was held in New York in October, 1931, a committee was appointed and various suggestions were considered. At a second general meeting in December, 1931, there was further discussion and a report which recommended \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 365]\n\u00a0\n the organization of regional sales agencies, and was supported by the opinion of counsel as to the legality of proposed forms of contract, was approved. Committees to present the plan to producers were constituted for eighteen producing districts including the eight districts in Appalachian territory. Meetings of the representatives of the latter districts resulted in the organization of defendant Appalachian Coals, Inc. It was agreed that a minimum of 70 per cent. and a maximum of 80 per cent. of the commercial tonnage of the territory should be secured before the plan should become effective. Approximately 73 per cent. was obtained. A resolution to fix the maximum at 90 per cent. was defeated. The maximum of 80 per cent. was adopted because a majority of the producers felt that an organization with a greater degree of control might unduly restrict competition in local markets. The minimum of 70 per cent. was fixed because it was agreed that the organization would not be effective without this degree of control. The court below also found that it was the expectation that similar agencies would be organized in other producing districts including those which were competitive with Appalachian coal, and that it was 'the particular purpose of the defendants in the Appalachian territory to secure such degree of control therein as would eliminate competition among the 73 per cent. of the commercial production.' But the court added: 'However, the formation of Appalachian Coals was not made dependent upon the formation of other regional selling agencies and there is no evidence of a purpose, understanding or agreement among the defendants that in the event of the formation of other similar regional sales agencies there would be any understanding or agreement, direct or indirect, to divide the market territory between them or to limit production or to fix the price of coal in any market or to cooperate in any way.' When, in January, 1932, the Department of Jus- \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 366]\n\u00a0\n tice announced its adverse opinion, the producers outside Appalachian territory decided to hold their plans in abeyance pending the determination of the question by the courts. The District Court found that 'the evidence tended to show that other selling agencies with a control of at least 70 per cent. of the production in their respective districts will be organized if the petition in this case is dismissed'; that in that event 'that will result an organization in most of the districts whose coal is or may be competitive with Appalachian coal; but the testimony tends to show that there will still be substantial, active competition in the sale of coal in all markets in which Appalachian coal is sold.'\n Defendants refer to the statement of purposes in their published plan of organization-that it was intended to bring about 'a better and more orderly marketing of the coals from the region to be served by this company (the selling agency) and better to enable the producers in this region, through the larger and more economic facilities of such selling agency, more equally to compete in the general markets for a fair share of the available coal business.' The District Court found that among their purposes, defendants sought to remedy 'the destructive practice of shipping coal on consignment without prior orders for the sale thereof, which results in the dumping of coal on the market irrespective of the demand'; 'to eliminate the pyramiding of offers for the sale of coal'; to promote 'the systematic study of the marketing and distribution of coal, the demand the the consumption and the kinds and grades of coal made and available for shipment by each producer in order to improve conditions'; to maintain an inspection and engineering department which would keep in constant contact with customers 'in order to demonstrate the advantages and suitability of Appalachian coal in comparison with other competitive coals'; to promote an extensive advertising \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 367]\n\u00a0\n campaign which would show 'the advantages of using coal as a fuel and the advantages of Appalachian coal particularly'; to provide a research department employing combustion engineers which would demonstrate 'proper and efficient methods of burning coal in factories and in homes' and thus aid producers in their competition with substitute fuels; and to operate a credit department which would build up a record with respect to the 'reliability of purchasers.' The court also found that 'defendants believe that the result of all these activities would be the more economical sale of coal, and the economies would be more fully realized as the organization of the selling agent is perfected and developed.' But in view of the designation of subagents, economies in selling expenses would be attained 'only after a year or so of operation.'\n No attempt was made to limit production. The producers decided that it could not legally be limited and, in any event, it could not be limited practically. The finding is that 'it was designed that the producer should produce and the selling agent should sell as much coal as possible.' The importance of increasing sales is said to lie in the fact that the cost of production is directly related to the actual running time of the mines.\n Fourth. Voluminous evidence was received with respect to the effect of defendants' plan upon market prices. As the plan has not gone into operation, there are no actual results upon which to base conclusions. The question is necessarily one of prediction. The court below found that, as between defendants themselves, competition would be eliminated. This was deemed to be the necessary consequence of a common selling agency with power to fix the prices at which it would make sales for its principals. Defendants insist that the finding is too broad and that the differences in grades of coal of the same sizes and the market demands at different times \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 368]\n\u00a0\n would induce competition between the coals sold by the agency 'depending upon the use and the quality of the coals.'\n The more serious question relates to the effect of the plan upon competition between defendants and other producers. As already noted, the District Court found that 'the great bulk' of the coal produced in Appalachian territory is sold 'in the highly competitive region east of the Mississippi river and north of the Ohio river under an adverse freight rate.' Elaborate statistics were introduced with respect to the production and distribution of bituminous coal and the transportation rates from the different producing sections to the consuming markets, as bearing upon defendants' competitive position, together with evidence as to the requirements of various sections and consumers and the relative advantages possessed by reason of the different qualities and uses of the coals produced. It would be impossible to make even a condensed statement of this evidence (which has been carefully analyzed by both parties), but an examination of it fails to disclose an adequate basis for the conclusion that the operation of the defendants' plan would produce an injurious effect upon competitive conditions, in view of the vast volume of coal available, the conditions of production, and the network of transportation facilities at immediate command. While strikes and interruptions of transportation may create temporary and abnormal dislocations, the bituminous coal industry under normal conditions affords most exceptional competitive opportunities. Figures as to developed and potential productive capacity are impressive. The court below found upon this point that the capacity of the mines in the Appalachian region operated by others than defendants is 82,660,760 tons, as against the capacity of defendants' mines of 86,628,880 tons, while the present yearly capacity of all mines in southern West Virginia, Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and Tennessee is 245,233,560 tons, based upon an eight-hour working day. \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 369]\n\u00a0\n 'This excess capacity over actual production,' the court said, 'could be brought into production at moderate expense and with reasonable promptness.' As to potential, undeveloped capacity in Appalachian territory, the court found that in the eight districts in this region not held by any operating, or by any captive, company, there are approximately 760,000 acres containing more than 4,300,000,000 tons of recoverable coal. In addition, in the same territory 'owned by captive companies and not being operated, or owned by operating companies who are using only a very small proportion of their holdings,' there is an additional 860,000 acres, containing more than 4,600,000,000 tons of coal. Within the twenty-four counties in which defendants' mines are located, and immediately adjacent to them, on railroads already operating, 'with the exception of short, feeder extensions,' there are over 1,620,000 acres of coal bearing land, containing approximately 9,000,000,000 net tons of recoverable coal 'comparable both in quality and mining conditions with the coal now being mined in that region.' 'The opening up of this acreage would involve only the extension of short branch lines from the railroads and the building of mining plants. The price of these lands at the present time would be less than half of the value of two or three years ago, and considerably less on a royalty basis. Coal produced from these districts is available for any market in which Appalachian coal is sold. Conditions in the coal industry are such that new companies are free to enter the business of producing and marketing coal in competition with existing companies.' In connection with this proof of developed and potential capacity, the 'highly organized and concentrated buying power' that can be exerted must also have appropriate consideration. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 344, 370]\n\u00a0\n Consumers testified that defendants' plan will be a benefit to the coal industry and will not restrain competition. Testimony to that effect was given by representatives of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, the Norfolk & Western Railroad, and the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, 'the largest railroad users of coal operating in the Appalachian region,' and by representatives of large utility companies and manufacturing concerns. \n8\n There \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 371]\n\u00a0\n was similar testimony by wholesale and retail dealers in coal. There are 130 producers of coal other than defendants in Appalachian territory who sell coal commercially. There are also 'a large number of mines that have been shut down and could be opened up by the owners on short notice.' Competing producers testified that the operation of the selling agency, as proposed by defendants, would not restrain competition and would not hurt their business. Producers in western Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, and Illinois testified to like effect. Referring to this testimony, the court below added, 'The small coal producer can, to some extent, and for the purpose of producing and marketing coal, produce coal more cheaply than many of the larger companies and is not prevented by higher cost of operation from being a competitor in the market.'\n The Government criticizes the 'opinion testimony' introduced by defendants as relating to a competitive situation not within the experience of the witnesses, and also animadverts upon their connections and interests, but the Government did not offer testimony of opposing opinions as to the effect upon prices of the operation of the selling agency. Consumers who testified for the Government explained their dependence upon coal from Appalachian territory.\n The District Court commented upon the testimony of officers of the selling agency to the effect 'that the organization would not be able to fix prices in an arbitrary way but, by the elimination of certain abuses, and by better advertising and sale organization, the producers would get more in the aggregate for their coal.' 'Other witnesses for the defendants' said the court, 'indicated that there would be some tendency to raise the price but \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 372]\n\u00a0\n that the degree of increase would be affected by other competitors in the coal industry and by producers of coal substitutes.'\n Fifth. We think that the evidence requires the following conclusions:\n\n 1. \nWith respect to defendant's purposes, we find no warrant for determining that they were other than those they declared. Good intentions will not save a plan otherwise objectionable, but knowledge of actual intent is an aid in the interpretation of facts and prediction of consequences. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra. The evidence leaves no doubt of the existence of the evils at which defendants' plan was aimed. The industry was in distress. It suffered from overexpansion and from a serious relative decline through the growing use of substitute fuels. It was afflicted by injurious practices within itself-practices which demanded correction. If evil conditions could not be entirely cured, they at least might be alleviated. The unfortunate state of the industry would not justify any attempt unduly to restrain competition or to monopolize, but the existing situation prompted defendants to make, and the statute did not preclude them from making, an honest effort to remove abuses, to make competition fairer, and thus to promote the essential interests of commerce. The interests of producers and consumers are interlinked. When industry is greviously hurt, when producing concerns fail, when unemployment mounts and communities dependent upon profitable production are prostrated, the wells of commerce go dry. So far as actual purposes are concerned, the conclusion of the court below was amply supported that defendants were engaged in a fair and open endeavor to aid the industry in a measurable recovery from its plight. The inquiry then, must be whether despite this objective the inherent nature of their plan was such as to create an undue restraint upon interstate commerce. \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 373]\n\u00a0\n 2. The question thus presented chiefly concerns the effect upon prices. The evidence as to the conditions of the production and distribution of bituminous coal, the available facilities for its transportation, the extent of developed mining capacity, and the vast potential undeveloped capacity, makes it impossible to conclude that defendants through the operation of their plan will be able to fix the price of coal in the consuming markets. The ultimate finding of the District Court is that the defendants 'will not have monopoly control of any market, nor the power to fix monopoly prices'; and in its opinion the court stated that 'the selling agency will not be able, we think, to fix the market price of coal.' Defendants' coal will continue to be subject to active competition. In addition to the coal actually produced and seeking markets in competition with defendants' coal, enormous additional quantities will be within reach and can readily be turned into the channels of trade if an advance of price invites that course. While conditions are more favorable to the position of defendants' group in some markets than in others, we think that the proof clearly shows that, wherever their selling agency operates, it will find itself confronted by effective competition backed by virtually inexhaustive sources of supply, and will also be compelled to cope with the organized buying power of large consumers. The plan cannot be said either to contemplate or to involve the fixing of market prices.\n The contention is, and the court below found, that while defendants could not fix market prices, the concerted action would 'affect' them, that is, that it would have a tendency to stabilize market prices and to raise them to a higher level than would otherwise obtain. But the facts found do not establish, and the evidence fails to show, that any effect will be produced which in the circumstances of this industry will be detrimental to fair competition. A co-operative anterprise, otherwise free \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 374]\n\u00a0\n from objection, which carries with it no monopolistic menace, is not to be condemned as an undue restraint merely because it may effect a change in market conditions, where the change would be in mitigation of recognized evils and would not impair, but rather foster, fair competitive opportunities. Voluntary action to rescue and preserve these opportunities, and thus to aid in relieving a depressed industry and in reviving commerce by placing competition upon a sounder basis, may be more efficious than an attempt to provide remedies through legal processes. The fact that the correction of abuses may tend to stabilize a business, or to produce fairer price levels, does not mean that the abuses should go uncorrected or that co-operative endeavor to correct them necessarily constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade. The intelligent conduct of commerce through the acquisition of full information of all relevant facts may properly be sought by the co-operation of those engaged in trade, although stabilization of trade and more reasonable prices may be the result. Maple Flooring Association v. United States, supra; Cement Manufacturers' Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588, 604\n, 45 S.Ct. 586, 592. Putting an end to injurious practices, and the consequent improvement of the competitive position of a group of producers is not a less worthy aim and may be entirely consonant with the public interest, where the group must still meet effective competition in a fair market and neither seeks nor is able to effect a domination of prices.\n Decisions cited in support of a contrary view were addressed to very different circumstances from those presented here. They dealt with combinations which on the particular facts were found to impose unreasonable restraints through the suppression of competition, and in actual operation had that effect. American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S.Ct. 114, 21 A.L.R. 1093; United States \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 375]\n\u00a0\n v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S.Ct. 607. Compare Maple Flooring Association v. United States, supra, at pages 579- 582 of 268 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 578, 583, 584. In Addyston Pipe & Steel Company v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S.Ct. 96, the combination was effected by those who were in a position to deprive, and who sought to deprive, the public in a large territory of the advantages of fair competition and was for the actual purpose and had the result of enhancing prices-which which in fact had been unreasonably increased. Id., pages 237, 238 of 175 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 96, 106. In United States v. Trenton Potteries Company, \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 379, 50 A.L.R. 989, defendants, who controlled 82 per cent. of the business of manufacturing and distributing vitreous pottery in the United States, had combined to fix prices. It was found that they had the power to do this and had exerted it. The defense that the prices were reasonable was overruled, as the court held that the power to fix prices involved 'power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices,' and that in such a case the difference between legal and illegal conduct could not 'depend upon so uncertain a test' as whether the prices actually fixed were reasonable, a determination which could 'be satisfactorily made only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies.' See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S.Ct. 298, 14 A.L.R. 1045. In the instant case there is, as we have seen, no intent or power to fix prices, abundant competitive opportunities will exist in all markets where defendants' coal is sold, and nothing has been shown to warrant the conclusion that defendants' plan will have an injurious effect upon competition in these markets.\n\n 3. \nThe question remains whether, despite the foregoing conclusions, the fact that the defendants' plan eliminates competition between themselves is alone sufficient to condemn it. Emphasis is placed upon defendants' control of about 73 per cent. of the commercial produc- \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 376]\n\u00a0\n tion in Appalachian territory. But only a small percentage of that production is sold in that territory. The finding of the court below is that 'these coals are mined in a region where there is very little consumption.' Defendants must go elsewhere to dispose of their products, and the extent of their production is to be considered in the light of the market conditions already described. Even in Appalachian territory it appears that the developed and potential capacity of other producers will afford effective competition. \n9\n Defendants insist that on the evidence adduced as to their competitive position in the consuming markets, and in the absence of proof of actual operations showing an injurious effect upon competition, either through possession or abuse of power, no valid objection could have been interposed under the Sherman Act if the defendants had eliminated competition between themselves by a complete integration of their mining properties in a single ownership. United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121; United States v. International Harvester Company, \n274 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 748. We agree that there is no ground for holding defendants' plan illegal merely because they have not integrated their properties and have chosen to maintain their independent plants, seeking not to limit but rather to facilitate production. We know of no public policy, and none is suggested by the terms of the Sherman Act, that in order to comply with the law those engaged in industry should be driven to unify their properties and businesses in order to correct abuses which may be corrected by less drastic measures. Public policy might indeed be deemed to point in a different direction. If the mere size of a single, embracing entity is not enough to bring a combination in corporate form within the statutory inhibition, the mere number and extent of the production of those engaged in a co-operative endeavor to \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 377]\n\u00a0\n remedy evils which may exist in an industry, and to improve competitive conditions, should not be regarded as producing illegality. The argument that integration may be considered a normal expansion of business, while a combination of independent producers in a common selling agency should be treated as abnormal-that one is a legitimate enterprise and the other is not-makes but an artificial distinction. The Anti-Trust Act aims at substance. Nothing in theory or experience indicates that the selection of a common selling agency to represent a number of producers should be deemed to be more abnormal than the formation of a huge corporation bringing various independent units into one ownership. Either may be prompted by business exigencies and the statute gives to neither a special privilege. The question in either case is whether there is an unreasonable restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize. If there is, the combination cannot escape because it has chosen corporate form, and, if there is not, it is not to be condemned because of the absence of corporate integration. As we stated at the outset, the question under the act is not simply whether the parties have restrained competition between themselves but as to the nature and effect of that restraint. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra; United States v. Terminal Association, \n224 \nU.S. 383\n, 32 S.Ct. 507; Window Glass Manufacturers v. United States, supra; Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 179 S., 51 S.Ct. 421.\n The fact that the suit is brought under the Sherman Act does not change the principles which govern the granting of equitable relief. There must be 'a definite factual showing of illegality.' Standard Oil Company v. United States, 283 U.S. page 179, 51 S.Ct. 421, 427. We think that the Government has failed to show adequate grounds for an injunction in this case. We recognize, however, that the case has been tried in advance of the operation of defendants' plan, and that it has been necessary to test that plan with \n\n[288 U.S. 344, 378]\n\u00a0\n reference to purposes and anticipated consequences without the advantage of the demonstrations of experience. If in actual operation it should prove to be an undue restraint upon interstate commerce, if it should appear that the plan is used to the impairment of fair competitive opportunities, the decision upon the present record should not preclude the Government from seeking the remedy which would be suited to such a state of facts. We think also that in the event of future controversy arising from the actual operation of the plan the results of the labor of both parties in this litigation in presenting the voluminous evidence as to the industry, market conditions and transportation facilities and rates, should continue to be available, without the necessity of reproducing that evidence.\n The decree will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter a decree dismissing the bill of complaint without prejudice and with the provision that the court shall retain jurisdiction of the cause any may set aside the decree and take further proceedings if future developments justify that course in the appropriate enforcement of the Anti-Trust Act.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks that the court below reached the proper conclusion and that its decree should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Captive' mines are thus designated as they produce chiefly for the consumption of the owners. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Defendants contend that, in calculating their position upon a percentage basis, surrounding territory should be included and that their percentage thus lies 'somewhere between 54.21 and 64 per cent.' The District Court found: 'The coal produced in the surrounding territory is the same kind of coal as that produced in the Appalachian territory and is suitable for the same purposes and available to the same markets, generally on the same freight rates, and for all practical purposes might have been included in the territory described as Appalachian territory.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Exception is made of deliveries on contracts then outstanding and of coal used in the operations of defendant's mines or sold to its employees. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The findings show that: 'The number of domestic oil burners in use has increased more than sixty fold ... from 1921 to 1931. ... About fifty per cent. of all oil burners, both domestic and commercial, are in the markets in which Appalachian coals are sold. The railroads have improved combustion methods and reduced their fuel consumption from 1916 to 1929 by 32,000,000 tons. In freight service, their consumption of coal per thousand freight ton miles dropped from 164 pounds in 1919 to 125 pounds in 1929. The electric industries decreased consumption of coal per kilowatt hour from approximately 3.2 pounds to 1.6 pounds and thereby reduced their requirements for coal in excess of 47,000,000 tons. Efficiency in the smelting of pig iron decreased the consumption of coal in relation to the pig iron made by 10,000,000 tons. The saving in by- product coke manufacturers over the bee hive system amounted to 12,000,000 tons.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The court below points out that the use of natural gas and fuel oil is limited to certain areas. Gas is not available to all sections of the country and the great centers of fuel oil consumption are California, the southwest, the midcontinent field, and the Atlantic seaboard. Moreover, in the states in which Appalachian coal is chiefly marketed, the substitute fuels combined supply only about 10 per cent. of the total energy consumption. In the year 1929 about 50 per cent. of defendants' coal, other than railroad fuel, went into the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. In these states the percentage of total energy comsumption derived from bituminous coal in 1929 ranged from 88.7 per cent. to 92.7 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Defendants insist that 'the real spread is from 25 cents to $1.84 per ton.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] J. M. Dewberry, general coal and coke agent of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, a large consumer of Appalachian coal, testified: 'It is a well known fact to-day that the buying power of these large consumers of coal is more intelligent, more forceful, more far reaching than ever before in the history of the industry. And it just sounds to me like a joke for somebody to talk about Appalachian Coals or somebody else dictating the price that they are going to pay. They dictate their own price. The purchaser makes it. And he makes it because of the tremendous force and influence of his buying power. Why, it is nothing these days for one interest or one concern to buy several million tons of coal.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The District Court in its findings, after referring to the railroads above mentioned, continues: 'A representative of a large public utility company' (with extensive power lines in the middle west and on the Atlantic seaboard) 'consuming annually approximately 2,485,000 tons of coal has stated that the organization and operation of Appalachian Coals, Inc., will not affect competition in the markets in which his company buys coal, and that it will have a beneficial effect on the coal industry. A representative of a power company operating throughout the state of Georgia ... using from 30,000 to 125,000 tons of coal annually, has stated that the organization and operation of Appalachian Coals, Inc., will not restrain competition in the markets in which his company buys coal. A representative of the Carbide & Carbon Corporation which uses annually about 250,000 tons of bituminous coal, 100,000 tons of coke made from bituminous coal, and 40,000 to 50,000 tons of petroleum coke, and operating plants that consume coal at South Charleston, W. Va.; Niagara Falls, N.Y.; Cleveland, Ohio; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.; Indianapolis, Ind., and Fremont and Fostoria, Ohio, has stated that the organization of Appalachian Coals, Inc., will have a beneficial effect in the coal industry and will not restrain competition in the markets in which his company buys coal. The largest purchaser of coal in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and eastern Tennessee who purchases approximately 600,000 tons of coal annually under normal conditions for use by textile mills, located in those states, has stated that the organization and operation of Appalachian Coals, Inc., will not control or dominate the price in the markets in which he purchases coal, and that he will be able to purchase coal in an open and competitive market.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Supra, Pp. 10,11. \n\n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARTHUR C. HARVEY CO. v. MALLEY(1933)\nNo. 537\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n Mr. O. Walter Taylor, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Paul D. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued respondents in the United States District Court for Massachusetts to recover alleged overpayment of taxes. After waiver of trial by jury, the judge heard the cause upon the pleadings and evidence, and gave judgment for the respondents. The reasons therefor were stated in an opinion dealing generally with the issues of law and fact. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment, and undertook to support its action by an opinion (60 F.(2d) 97, 98). A duly authenticated bill of exceptions setting forth the evidence and the proceedings at the trial is in the record; also appropriate assignments of \n\n[288 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n error. No assignment makes substantial claim of error based upon the pleadings alone.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly found:\n'There was a waiver of a jury trial, and the case was heard by the judge without a jury. A request for findings of fact and rulings of law was made by the plaintiff, but no special findings were made nor were the requested rulings of law either made or refused, nor were any exceptions to a refusal to rule as requested taken 'in the course of the trial.' So far as any rulings of law were made 'in the course of the trial,' with one exception, they were in favor of the plaintiff, and, though an exception was allowed in this instance, it is not relied upon in the assignments of error. ... The findings of fact are general, and no rulings of the court were excepted to 'during the course of the trial,' which are relied on. Exceptions, following an order of judgment, to alleged rulings in a written opinion of the judge assigning reasons for ordering a judgment for either party, are not rulings in the course of the trial. ... Each of the assignments of error in this case relates either to matters of fact or to conclusions of law embodied in the opinion. These are not open to review, as there were no special findings of fact and no exceptions to rulings on matters of law were taken during the course of the trial and duly preserved by a bill of exceptions, and no questions of law favorable to the plaintiff are raised on the pleadings.'\n\n Notwithstanding the condition of the record, the appellate court proceeded to discuss sundry questions beyond the pleadings, not pertinent because not properly raised, and decided them against the petitioner. The challenged judgment was rightly affirmed, but this should have been done upon the ground that the assignments of error presented for consideration no substantial question of law or fact. \n\n[288 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n The Revised Statutes, as amended, provide:\n Section 649: 'Issues of fact in civil cases in any (circuit) district court may be tried and determined by the court, without the intervention of a jury, whenever the purties, or their attorneys of record, file with the clerk a stipulation in writing waiving a jury. The finding of the court upon the facts, which may be either general or special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury.' (U.S.C., title 28,  773 (28 USCA  773.))\n Section 700: 'When an issue of fact in any civil cause in a (circuit) district court is tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, according to section 773 (649) of this title, the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial of the cause, if excepted to at the time, and duly presented by a bill of exceptions, may be reviewed (by the Supreme Court (Circuit Court of Appeals)) upon a writ of error or upon appeal; and when the finding is special the review may extend to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.' (U.S.C. title 28,  875 (28 USCA  875)).\n In Fleischmann Const. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 356 S., 357, 46 S.Ct. 284, 287, this Court construed and applied the above sections, and the doctrine there approved is decisive of the present cause. Through Mr. Justice Sanford, we said:\n'The opinion of the trial judge, dealing generally with the issues of law and fact and giving the reasons for his conclusion, is not a special finding of facts within the meaning of the statute. ... And it is settled by repeated decisions, that in the absence of special findings, the general finding of the court is conclusive upon all matters of fact, and prevents any inquiry into the conclusions of law embodied therein, except in so far as the rulings during the progress of the trial were excepted to and duly preserved by bill of exceptions, as required by the statute. ... To obtain a review by an appellate court of the conclusions of law a party must either obtain from the \n\n[288 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n trial court special findings which raise the legal propositions, or present the propositions of law to the court and obtain a ruling on them . ...\n\n'These rules necessarily exclude from our consideration all the questions presented by the assignment of errors except those arising on the pleadings.

These are not open to review, as there were no special findings of fact and no exceptions to the rulings on matters of law were taken during the progress of the trial or duly preserved by a bill of exceptions. The defendants offered no exceptions to the rulings of the court until after the writ of error had issued, transferring jurisdiction of the case to the Court of Appeals. And the recitals in the subsequent 'bills of exceptions' that the exceptions, then for the first time presented, where to be taken as made before the entry of the judgment, are nugatory. A bill of exceptions is not valid as to any matter which was not excepted to at the trial. ... And it cannot incorporate into the record nunc pro tunc as of the time when an exception should have been taken, one which in fact was not then taken. ...\n\n'The statute however, relates only to those rulings of law which are made in the course of the trial, and by its terms has no application to the preliminary rulings of the District Judge made, in the exercise of his general authority, before the issues are submitted to him for hearing under the statutory stipulation. Such rulings on the pleadings and the sufficiency of the complaint are therefore subject to review as in any other case, independently of the statute.'\n\n And, see, Wilson v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1933)\nNo. 163\nArgued: December 13, 1932Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Graham Summer, of New York City for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the petitioner, Atlantic City Electric Company, was affiliated with the American Gas & Electric Company so that the federal taxes for 1917, 1918, and 1919 should be determined upon the basis of consolidated returns under section 1331 of the Reve- \n\n[288 U.S. 152, 153]\n\u00a0\n nue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 319), as applicable to the year 1917, and section 240 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1081, 1082). The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the order of the Board of Tax Appeals (15 B.T. A. 1084), upheld the ruling of the Commissioner that the corporations were not affiliated and must make separate returns. 57 F.(2d) 186. The case comes here on certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 582\n, 53 S.Ct. 18, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The following facts were found by the Board of Tax Appeals: The petitioner, Atlantic City Electric Company, is a public service corporation. During the years in question, it had outstanding 12,500 shares of common stock, of the par value of $100 per share, and 3,702 shares of preferred stock. Holders of preferred stock were entitled to vote, and that stock was preferred to the extent of an annual cumulative dividend of 6 per cent. and on final liquidation. The preferred stock was redeemable at any time, and had no interest in dividends except as above stated. The American Gas & Electric Company was a holding company. It owned all the common stock of the Atlantic City Electric Company and none of its preferred stock. 655 to 761 shares of that preferred stock were owned by stockholders of the American Gas & Electric Company, but the finding is that the control exercised by that company resulted 'from its absolute ownership of the entire common stock of its subsidiaries and not from control or ownership of preferred stock by its stockholders.' Of the total outstanding stock of the Atlantic City Electric Company, preferred and common, the American Gas & Electric Company owned approximately 77 per cent.\n With respect to control of stock, as creating the affiliation which affords a basis for a consolidated return, section 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921 is to the same effect as section 240 of the Revenue Act of 1918. The requirement of control, in the absence of legal title or beneficial ownership, is not satisfied by acquiescence or by business considera- \n\n[288 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n tions without binding force. There must be a control that is legally enforceable. Handy & Harman v. Burnet, \n284 \nU.S. 136, 140\n, 141 S., 52 S.Ct. 51. And it must be control of 'substantially all the stock.' In Handy & Harman v. Burnet, supra, legally enforceable control of somewhat more than 75 per cent. of the stock was held to be insufficient. The question, then, is whether in the instant case the entire voting stock, preferred and common, should be considered in determining whether there was affiliation, or the common stock alone.\n The purpose of the Congress was to secure substantial equality among stockholders who ultimately bear the burden of taxation, and to prevent evasion through the manipulation of intercompany transactions. Handy & Harman v. Burnet, supra. See, also, Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Mfg. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 544\n, 53 S.Ct. 227, 77 L.Ed. --, decided January 9, 1933. The requirement of consolidated returns was 'based upon the principle of levying the tax according to the true net income and invested capital of a single business enterprise, even though the business is operated through more than one corporation.' Treasury Regulations No. 45, article 631.1 \n\n[288 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n In establishing ownership or control of substantially all the stock as the criterion of a business unit, the statute made no distinction between preferred and common stock. It referred simply to 'stock,' and we perceive no ground upon which stock with voting right can be treated as excepted. The Treasury Regulations under the Revenue Act of 1918 regarded the statutory requirement as relating to the 'outstanding voting capital stock ( not including stock in the treasury) at the beginning of and during the taxable year.' Regulations No. 45, article 633. The same construction was given by the Department to the corresponding provision of the Revenue Act of 1921. Regulations No. 62, article 633. The Congress, in the Revenue Act of 1924, embodied this construction in the statute itself. \n2\n Section 240(c)( 1), 43 Stat. 288 (26 USCA  993 note). See, also, Revenue Act of 1926,  240(c)(d), 44 Stat. 46, 26 USCA  993(c, d); Revenue Act of 1928,  141(d), 45 Stat. 831 (26 USCA  2141(d); Revenue Act of 1932,  141(d), 47 Stat. 213 (26 USCA  3141(d). Compare Schlafly v. United States (C.C.A.) 4 F. ( 2d) 195, 200; Ice Service Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 230, 231; United States v. Cleveland, P. & E.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 413; Commissioner v. City Button Works (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 705.\n Nor are we able to conclude that in the instant case the preferred stock with voting right should be excluded because it was redeemable at any time and had a limited interest in dividends. Compare Commissioner v. Shillito \n\n[288 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n Realty Co. (C.C.A.) 39 F.(2d) 830, 69 A.L.R. 1266; United States v. Cleveland, P. & E.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 413. Despite redeemability and the limitation of dividends, the owners of the preferred stock were not in the position of creditors, but were stockholders with a proprietary interest in the corporate undertaking and with a corresponding relation, through the voting right, to the direction of that undertaking. The voting right remained unimpaired until actual redemption. The statute is not concerned with a failure to exercise existing rights, but with what is deemed to be a more certain and adequate test of a unitary enterprise. According to this test, petitioner failed to show affiliation. Burnet v. Howes Brothers Hide Co., \n284 \nU.S. 583, 584\n, 52 S.Ct. 126.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 631 of Regulations No. 45 is as follows:\n'Affiliated Corporations.-The provision of the statute requiring affiliated corporations to file consolidated returns is based upon the principle of levying the tax according to the true net income and invested capital of a single business enterprise, even though the business is operated through more than one corporation. Where one corporation owns the capital stock of another corporation or other corporations, or where the stock of two or more corporations is owned by the same interests, a situation results which is closely analogous to that of a business maintaining one or more branch establishments. In the latter case, because of the direct ownership of the property, the invested capital and net income of the branch form a part of the invested capital and net income of the entire organization. Where such branches or units of a business are owned and controlled through the medium of separate corporations, it is necessary to require a consolidated return in order that the invested capital and net income of the entire group may be accurately determined. Otherwise opportunity would be afforded for the evasion of taxation by the shifting of income through price fixing, charges for services and other means by which income could be arbitrarily assigned to one or another unit of the group. In other cases without a consolidated return excessive taxation might be imposed as a result of purely artificial conditions existing between corporations within a controlled group.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] With respect to this provision, the report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives said: \"The requirement that the stock held must be 'voting' stock merely embodies in the law the present rule of the Treasury Department.\" House Rep.

FORD(1933)\nNo. 194\nArgued: December 14, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina. \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry E. Davis, of Florence, S.C., and Thomas W. Davis, of Wilmington, N.C., for appellants.\n Mr. W. C. Davis, of Manning, S.C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by appellee in a South Carolina state court of first instance against the railroad company and its engineer to recover for injuries said to have been sustained by her as the result of a collision at a public highway crossing between an automobile in which she was riding and a passenger train of the company. The complaint alleges several grounds of negligence, but the only one necessary for our consideration is that appellants negligently failed to give the crossing signals provided for by the state law. \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n By section 4903, vol. 3 of the Code of South Carolina (1922), a railroad company is required to place on each locomotive engine a bell of at least thirty pounds weight and a steam or air whistle, and 'such bell shall be rung or such whistle sounded by the engineer ... at the distance of at least five hundred yards from the ... traveled place, and be kept ringing or whistling until the engine ... has crossed such highway. ...'\n Section 4925 provides: 'Injuries at Crossings-Penalty and Damages.-If a person is injured in his person or property by collision with the engines or any car or cars of a railroad corporation at a crossing, and it appears that the corporation neglected to give the signals required by this Chapter, and that such neglect contributed to the injury, the corporation shall be liable for all damages caused by the collision, or to a fine recoverable by indictment, as provided in the preceding Section, unless it is shown that in addition to a mere want of ordinary care the person injured, or the person having charge of his person or property, was at the time of the collision guilty of gross or wilful negligence, or was acting in violation of the law, and that such gross wilful negligence or unlawful act contributed to the injury.'\n Appellants answered the complaint, denying liability and setting up affirmative defenses. The cause was tried before the court and a jury. At the close of the evidence, appellants moved for a directed verdict in their favor upon the ground, among others, that sections 4903 and 4925 of the Code, as they had been construed, constituted a violation of the due process of law and equal protection of law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and an unlawful attempt to regulate interstate commerce. The motion was overruled, and the jury, after being instructed, returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n upon which judgment was duly entered. The state Supreme Court (168 S.E. 143) affirmed the judgment.\n The attack upon the statute as contravening the due process clause is based upon the contention, shortly stated, that the state Supreme Court, by affirming the judgment, in effect construed the statute to mean that failure to give the prescribed signals is negligence per se and raises a presumption that such failure is the proximate cause of the collision and warrants recovery by the plaintiff without further proof, and that such presumption does not vanish from the case upon the introduction of evidence by the railroad company, but remains throughout to be considered by the jury as evidence. We have italicized the words which are said by appellants to constitute the crux of their contention.\n Appellants review many decisions of the state Supreme Court dealing with the question, which seem not to be altogether in agreement; but it is not necessary to analyze these decisions and from them attempt to extract the rule. The court below has done this and reached a conclusion contrary to that advanced by appellants; and that is enough for the purposes of our decision here. If the assailed provisions as construed and applied in the present case afford due process, appellants cannot complain that in earlier cases they were so construed and applied as to deny due process to other litigants. Compare Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358\n, 53 S.Ct. 145 (Docember 5, 1932); Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 460\n, 27 S.Ct. 556, 10 Ann.Cas. 689; Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 680\n, 50 S.Ct. 451; Dunbar v.

Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 44 S.Ct. 246.\n The jury, upon this subject, was instructed as follows:\n'... Under that statute, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff here first to prove that the crossing signals were \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n not given, ... and then she must prove, and prove both by the preponderance of the evidence as I have already charged you, that that failure to give the signals contributed to the injury of which she is complaining. ...\n\n'Where the signals are not given as in the manner provided by statute, and an injury occurs at the crossing of railroad and public highway, a presumption would arise that the failure to give the signals is the proximate cause of the injury. But such presumption would be rebuttable by evidence, and the jury should consider any and all evidence that may be in the case in determining the question of proximate cause. ... The failure to give these signals raises that presumption, but it is rebuttable; it is not a conclusive presumption. That may be rebutted by the defendants by its (their) evidence, and as stated here, all the evidence must be considered in determining the question of proximate cause.'\n\n Immediately preceding the charge to the jury, the trial court, ruling upon the motion for a directed verdict, had quoted the words of this court in Western & A.R.R. v. Henderson, \n279 \nU.S. 639, 643\n, 49 S.Ct. 445, 447, used in comparing the Georgia statute there under consideration with the Mississippi statute considered in Mobile, J. & K.C.R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35\n, 31 S.Ct. 136, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463: 'Each of the state enactments raises a presumption from the fact of injury caused by the running of locomotives or cars. The Mississippi statute created merely a temporary inference of fact that vanished upon the introduction of opposing evidence. (Citing cases.) That of Georgia as construed in this case creates an inference that is given effect of evidence to be weighed against opposing testimony, and is to prevail unless such testimony is found by the jury to preponderate.'\n And the effect of the ruling of the trial court is that the South Carolina statute was comparable with that of Mis- \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n sissippi and not with that of Georgia. It must be supposed that the court, with this in mind, intended to charge the jury in accordance with the language which it had just quoted. True, the jury was not told in so many words that, where countervailing evidence has been put in, the presumption comes to an end, but we think this is the fair purport of the language of the court to the effect that appellants may rebut the presumption by their evidence, and that then all the evidence must be considered in determining the question of proximate cause. Certainly, the charge contains no affirmative words directing the jury in that event to consider the presumption as evidence to be weighed with other evidence in the case. Under these circumstances, a request for a more explicit instruction in exact accord with what had just been read as to the Mississippi statute undoubtedly would have been granted; but that request was not made. Instructions are entitled to a reasonable interpretation, and are not generally to be regarded as the subject of error on account of not being sufficiently definite, if omissions complained of are not at the time pointed out by the excepting party. Castle et al. v. Bullard, 23 How. 172, 189, 190; First Unitarian Soc. v. Faulkner et al., \n91 U.S. 415\n, 423; Tweed's Case, 16 Wall. 504, 515, 516; Locke v. United States, 2 Cliff. 574, 15 Fed.Cas. 740, 742, No. 8,442.\n A reading of its opinion leaves no doubt that the state Supreme Court construed the statute as creating a presumption limited by the rule of the Turnipseed Case, supra (at page 43 of 219 U.S., 31 S.Ct. 136), and considered the charge of the trial court as in harmony with that view- namely, that the legal effect of the presumption was to cast upon the railroad company the duty of producing some evidence to the contrary, whereupon the inference was at an end, and the question became one for the jury upon all of the evidence. Appellants' contention that the presumption \n\n[287 U.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n fell within the principle laid down as to the Georgia statute in the Henderson Case, supra, was rejected, and the court said that no decision brought to its attention sustained 'the characterization of the disputable presumption arising under the crossing statute to the effect that it remains 'throughout the entire case' and is to be weighed as opposing evidence in fixing liability.'\n The Georgia statute involved in the Henderson Case was of an entirely different character. As construed by the Georgia court, it not only permitted the presumption of negligence to be given the effect of evidence to be weighed against opposing testimony and to prevail unless such testimony was found by the jury to preponderate, but it was fundamentally arbitrary, in that the mere fact of collision between a railway train and a vehicle at a highway grade crossing created a presumption that the accident was caused by the negligence of the company. The mere fact of such a collision, we said, 'furnishes no basis for any inference as to whether the accident was caused by negligence of the railway company or of the traveler on the highway or of both or without fault of anyone. Reasoning does not lead from the occurrence back to its cause.' Moreover, the presumption was invoked to support conficting allegations of negligence. Our decision in that case appropriately might have been cited here if we were considering a statute construed to mean that mere proof of collision at a crossing creates a presumption that the bell was not rung or the whistle sounded. But the rational connection between the fact proved and the fact inferred is plain enough when the proposition is put conversely, namely, that proof of failure on the part of the railroad to give the statutory signals raises a presumption that such failure is the proximate cause of the injury. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n It follows that the statutory presumption as construed by the court below is free from constitutional infirmity under the due process clause.\n The objection that, because the presumption applies only to railway companies, its effect is to deprive appellants of the equal protection of the laws is clearly untenable. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 289\n, 34 S.Ct. 829; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Anderson, \n233 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 34 S.Ct. 599; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v.

There is even less ground for the final contention that the statutory presumption under consideration violates the interstate commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Upon that point we are satisfied with what was said by the court below upon the authority, among other cases, of Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, supra, 234 U.S. at page 290, 34 S.Ct. 829, and Southern Railway Co. v.

BRADY(1933)\nNo. 526\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George M. Hoffheimer, of Clarksburg, W. Va., and Eugene S. Williams, of Baltimore, Md., for petitioners.\n Mr. George T. Bell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by respondent in the federal District Court for Northern West Virginia against petitioners in consequence of their failure to comply with a reparation order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It directed them to pay to plaintiff $12,838.31 damages found to have been sustained by reason of undue prejudice to which they had subjected him in respect of furnishing cars for the transportation of coal from his mine. He sought judgment for $57,735.11, together with interest, costs, and an attorney's fee. Defendants demurred to the complaint generally and also specifically upon the ground that plaintiff was not entitled to recover more than the award. The demurrers were overrled, and, issue having been joined, there was a trial by jury which resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff for $63,048.60, not including attorney's fee as to which all questions were reserved. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 61 F.(2d) 242. \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n There is no bill of exceptions,1 and we are called on to decide whether the facts alleged in the complaint, of which the reports and order of the Commission are a part, are sufficient to sustain the judgment. The substance of plaintiff's claim as thus shown is as follows:\n Between October 14, 1922, and April 1, 1923, he operated a coal mine on a branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad over which the Western Maryland had trackage rights. His mine was located between two mines operated by a competitor and served by both defendants. During that period there was a shortage of coal cars.\n For the rating of, and the distribution of coal cars among, mines on their respective lines, each of the defendants established and maintained in force certain rules and regulations. These required that during periods of coal-car shortage the cars available for loading should be distributed pro rata among the mines in accordance with their ratings. They also permitted the operator of 'any mine reached by two railroads to order 100 per cent or less of its rating from either of the said railroads, or to divide the orders between the two railroads in any way which the judgment of the operator dictated, provided the combined orders did not exceed 100 per cent of the rating of the mine; and the mine was entitled to receive its pro rata share of the available cars on the basis of such orders and to ship the coal loaded therein via the railroad which furnished the cars.'\n The Baltimore & Ohio furnished a smaller percentage of cars ordered than did the Western Maryland. Plaintiff's mine was being served exclusively by the former. Desiring to be served by the latter, he regularly ordered \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n from it 100 per cent. of his rating, but with a single exception was furnished no cars. He complained to the defendants, and was informed that his competitor was ordering 20 per cent. from the Baltimore & Ohio and 80 per cent. from the Western Maryland, and that such a division of his orders would be acceptable to them. He rejected the offer, claiming the right to order from either or both as from time to time he might see fit. But he was denied the right so given his competitor.\n He complained to the Commission that defendants thus subjected him to undue prejudice. The Commission so found. \n2\n And it held the case open to permit him to file a petition for further hearing as to the amount of damages, if any, sustained by him. 112 I.C.C. 244. And see 102 I.C.C. 19. Plaintiff upon such hearing claimed that the cost of mining the coal that he shipped had been increased $9,283.14 and that his loss of profits was $ 48,451.97, making a total of $57,735.11 Defendants, while denying liability, did not controvert these figures. The commission found that, if plaintiff had accepted defendant's offer, his increased mining costs would have been only $2,225.49 and his loss of profits but $10,612.82, making in all $12,838.31, and that he was entitled to reparation in that amount together with interest. It directed that, within 60 days, defendants pay that sum. 152 I.C.C. 327. They refused to do so.\n The complaint attacks the award on the ground that as a matter of law the Commission erred in ruling that in order to lessen his loss plaintiff was bound to accept de- \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n fendants' offer. It asserts that the reduction of his claim upon that ground was beyond the power of the Commission, and therefore null and void. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The Interstate Commerce Act declares it unlawful for a carrier to subject any person or traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage (section 3 (49 USCA  3)), and imposes upon carriers liability for the full amount of damages sustained by any person in consequence of any such violation of the Act. Section 8 (49 USCA  8). A person so injured may either make complaint to the Commission or bring suit for damages in a district court; but he shall not have the right to pursue both remedies and must elect which method he will adopt. Section 9 ( 49 USCA  9). If the Commission shall determine that complainant is entitled to an award of damages, it shall make an order directing the carrier to pay to him the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named. Section 16(1), 49 USCA  16(1). If the carrier does not comply with such order, the complainant may file in the United States District Court or in any state court a petition 'setting forth briefly the causes for which he claims damages, and the order of the commission in the premises. Such suit in the district court of the United States shall proceed in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.' Section 16(2), 49 USCA  16(2).\n Questions as to the reasonableness of rules and regulations governing the distribution of coal cars in periods of shortage are for the Commission. And, until found unreasonable by it, a shipper may not maintain an action in any court against a corrier upon the claim that any such rule or regulation was unreasonable and that through \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n its enforcement he sustained loss or damage. Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Penn. R.R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 304, 313\n, 33 S.Ct. 938. But, if the rule, regulation, or practice of the carrier is not attacked, and the shipper's claim is grounded upon its violation or discriminatory enforcement, there is no administrative question involved. In such cases the court is required merely to decide whether the carrier has departed from its established standard. The decision does not concern the reasonableness or validity of the rule itself and it has no tendency against uniformity or other purpose of the act. Suits for damages upon such grounds may be prosecuted without action or finding by the Commission. Pennsylvania R.R. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 U.S. 121\n, 131-134, 35 S.Ct. 484; Illinois Cent. R.R. v. Mulberry Hill Coal Co., \n238 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 283 S., 35 S.Ct. 760; Pennsylvania R.R. v. Sonman Coal Co., \n242 \nU.S. 120, 124\n, 37 S.Ct. 46.\n The facts stated in the complaint clearly show that there was no question in this case requiring the exercise of the Commission's administrative powers. Plaintiff's mine was in the same class as the mines of its competitor. It was entitled to have a supply of cars from either or both defendants as it saw fit. Cf. United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533, 542\n, 44 S.Ct. 610. His claim for damages does not rest upon defendants' adherence to or enforcement of their rule, but upon their refusal to furnish him cars in accordance with the rule. Therefore, without any prior action on the part of the Commission, plaintiff was entitled under sections 8 and 9 to maintain an action at law for the full amount of damages sustained by him on account of the undue prejudice to which he claims to have been subjected by defendants.\n But, having elected to seek relief through the Commission, plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the amount of the award.\n This is not a suit authorized by section 9 but one brought under section 16(2), because of defendants' refusal to comply with the Commission's order. Subject to the right of \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 458]\n\u00a0\n contestation preserved by the act (Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R.R., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 35 S.Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B 691), it is a suit for the enforcement of the award. Section 16(3), (f), 49 USCA  16(3)( f). Lewis-Simas-Jones Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n283 \nU.S. 654, 661\n, 51 S. Ct. 592. Section 16(2) does not permit suit in the absence of an award, and, if the Commission denies him relief, a claimant is remediless. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235\n, 51 S.Ct. 429; Brady v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 804\n, 51 S.Ct. 559; Bartlesville Zinc Co. v. Mellon (C.C.A.) 56 F.(2d) 154. No suit is permitted if the carrier pays the award. Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., \n242 \nU.S. 288\n, 37 S.Ct. 120. Cf. Pennsylvania R.R. v. Clark Coal Co., \n238 \nU.S. 456\n, 35 S.Ct. 896. Plaintiff may not adopt the award as the basis of his suit and then attack it. Cf. Mitchell Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247, 258\n, 33 S.Ct. 916\n\n\n The fact that the act merely makes the findings and report of the Commission prima facie evidence, and so preserves the defendant's right to contest the award, gives no support to plaintiff's contention that it does not bind him. It is to be remembered that, by electing to call on the Commission for the determination of his damages, plaintiff waived his right to maintain an action at law upon his claim. But the carriers made no such election. Undoubtedly it was to the end that they be not denied the right of trial by jury that Congress saved their right to be heard in court upon the merits of claims asserted against them. The right of election given to a claimant reasonably may have been deemed an adequate ground for making the Commission's award final as to him. Confessedly, it is final save when carriers refuse to pay within the time allowed. If by such a suit plaintiff may obtain a trial de novo or a revision of the award, the provisions of section 9 requiring election and prohibiting pursuit of both remedies would be set at naught in cases in which carriers refuse to pay and would be given effect in all other cases. There is no support for such a distinction. The \n\n[288 U.S. 448, 459]\n\u00a0\n construction for which plaintiff contends cannot be sustained. He is bound by the award.\n Defendants insist that plaintiff not only was limited in recovery by the amount of the award, but that he suffered no discrimination. The latter contention is without merit. The allegations of the complaint comply with the requirements of section 16(2), and are clearly sufficient to sustain a judgment against the defendants for the amount of the award together with interest, costs, and a reasonable attorney's fee to be taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed. The case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The District Court found the proposed bill was presented out of time and refused to sign it. 56 F.(2d) 231.

Factors & Finance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 89\n, 53 S.Ct. 287, 289, January 9, 1933. There is need once again to decide whether a claim for the refund of a tax has been presented by the taxpayer in such a form as to be subject to amendment after a claim wholly new would be barred by limitation.\n The petitioner Bemis Bros. Bag Company, having made payment of excess profits taxes for 1918 and 1919, filed its claims for refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The claims contained a request for a special assessment under sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918 ( 40 Stat. 1093), and in support of the request annexed a statement under oath which had been filed with a like claim as to the taxes of another year.\n By the statement thus annexed, the right to the relief demanded is placed upon three grounds which are not to be confused.\n The first is that the case is one 'where the Commissioner is unable to determine the invested capital' in the ordinary way. This is the ground covered by section 327(a) of the applicable statute.\n The second is that the case is one 'where a mixed aggregate of tangible and intangible property has been paid in for stock or for stock and bonds and the Commissioner is unable satisfactorily to determine the respective \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n values of the several classes of property at the time of payment, or to distinguish the classes of property paid in for stock and for bonds, respectively.' This is the ground covered by section 327(c).\n The third is that the case is one where 'the tax, if determined without the benefit of this section (327) would, owing to abnormal conditions affecting the capital or income of the corporation, work upon the corporation an exceptional hardship evidenced by gross disproportion between the tax computed without the benefit of this section and the tax computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328.' This is the ground covered by section 327(d).\n The taxpayer, in presenting its claims to the Commissioner, submitted facts and arguments in support of each of the three grounds.\n To show that the invested capital had been inaccurately determined, and could not be accurately determined by resort to the usual methods, the taxpayer stated inter alia that the value of printing plates and patterns had been erroneously omitted, and that, owing to the loss of vouchers and the changes wrought by the lapse of time, the value of these items could not be measured with complete precision, though it was susceptible even then of being fixed approximately. An estimate of the value was included in the claims.\n To show that the case was one of a mixed aggregate of tangibles and intangibles paid for in stock, with the value of the several elements not subject to accurate division, the taxpayer made a statement of the corporate history and structure.\n To show that there were abnormal conditions that would bring about injustice if the computation of the tax were to be made according to the usual method, and this though the invested capital were to be accurately determined, the taxpayer made a statement of the inequalities \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n between its position and that of other corporations engaged in a like business.\n Grounds Nos. 1 and 2 gave notice to the Commissioner that the taxpayer's invested capital had been erroneously assessed and charged him with a duty to inquire into the error and to give appropriate relief. United States v. Factors & Finance Co., supra. If he found that items had been omitted, but that he was unable to ascertain their value with reasonable accuracy, he might resort to section 328, and order the tax to be assessed in accordance with a special method. If he found that there had been omissions, but that he was able to his own satisfaction to identify and appraise them, he would learn in the process that there had been an undervaluation of invested capital, and that the assessment of the tax was correspondingly erroneous.\n Ground No. 3 is independent of the others, and has a different origin and meaning. 'A demand for a special assessment in accordance with section 327(d) of the statute of 1918 is not a challenge to any act of the Commissioner in the valuation of invested capital. On the contrary, the valuation of invested capital is irrelevant if the special method is accepted. The very basis of the application for the use of such a method is the presence of abnormal conditions whereby an unfair and disproportionate burden will be laid upon the taxpayer if invested capital is to be reckoned according to the statutory definition (sections 325, 326 ), and the profits of the taxpayer subjected to a tax accordingly. Let the new method be adopted and the value of the invested capital ceases to be a factor in the process.' United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., supra.\n The Commissioner notified the taxpayer in October and November, 1926, that there was no evidence before him sufficient to justify relief under section 327(d) on the ground of abnormal conditions in the business of the \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n claimant as compared with that of others. He seems to have overlooked the fact that the taxpayer was claiming relief also under subdivisions (a) and ( c). A protest promptly followed the delivery of the notice, and with the protest went an amended claim. In this amended claim there was no change of importance, unless importance be attached to the form of the relief demanded. The request for a computation in accordance with section 328 was accompanied by a request for relief in the alternative. In the event of a denial of a special assessment, the taxpayer now demanded that the items 'improperly eliminated from invested capital should be restored to invested capital, and the excess profits tax recalculated on that basis.' The Commissioner ordered another hearing, and considered the claim anew. Upon reconsideration he held that there had been an undervaluation of invested capital in 1918 and 1919, with the result that the taxes for the one year had been overpaid in the sum of $14,054.18, and for the other in the sum of $9,073.15. After thus finding an error in the assessment, he dismissed the claims for refund on the ground that their form as first presented was defective and that the amendment came too late. Cf. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra. In a suit by the taxpayer to recover the moneys overpaid, the District Court gave judgment for the government, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 60 F.(2d) 944. The case is here on certiorari, \n288 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 318, 77 L.Ed. --.\n We held in United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., supra, that, after the period of limitation, a claim for a special assessment under section 327(d) may not be turned by amendment into one for the reaudit of invested capital and for the reassessment of the tax accordingly. The two proceedings, it was pointed out, are essentially diverse. The one is nonjusticiable, invoking, as it does, an administrative and discretionary jurisdiction. The other is akin to a \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n judicial inquiry, re-examining an earlier determination for error of fact or law. The one 'assumes adherence to the statute (in the valuation of invested capital). and counts upon extraordinary conditions as justifying a claim that the statute is oppressive.' The other, rejecting that assumption, is a demand for a new audit. The distinction between a special assessment under subdivision (d) and a claim for like relief under subdivisions (a) and (c) becomes apparent when the Prentiss Case is compared with another case decided the same day. In United States v. Factors & Finance Co., supra, there had been a general claim for refund without statement of the grounds. The taxpayer tried to turn it by amendment into a claim for a special assessment under section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 307). The amendment was upheld. We pointed out, in upholding it, that 'section 210 of the Act of 1917 is the precursor of section 327(a) of the Act of 1918, and is not at all the analogue of section 327(d).' Under section 210 of the earlier act, as under section 327(a) of the later act, there is a challenge to the valuation of invested capital which opens up the whole subject for revision and readjustment.\n We think procedural analogies and administrative practice sustain the contention of the petitioner that the claim as amended does not differ in matter of substance from the claim as first presented.\n\n 1. \nIf we look to the analogy of pleadings in a lawsuit, the conclusion is not doubtful. The claim as first presented gives notice to the Commissioner that assets of great value have been omitted from invested capital. It tells him what those assets are, and even estimates their value, though imperfectly and roughly. There is no failure to make disclosure of the substance of the grievance, no dearth of information as to the facts that should be the prelude to inquiry. What is subject to criticism is this and nothing more, that the claim is niggardly, and hence \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 34]\n\u00a0\n defective, in its prayer for relief. It asks for a special assessment under sections 327 and 328. It should have asked for this, and, in the alternative, that invested capital be re-examined and increased. But for the purpose of determining the limits of permissible amendment, a change of the legal theory of a suit, 'a departure from law to law,' is no longer accepted as a test of general validity. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra, and cases there cited. Still weaker is a test derived from the prayer for relief, the mere demand for judgment. The rule is now general that at a trial upon the merits the suitor shall have the relief appropriate to the facts that he has pleaded, whether he has prayed for it or not. \n1\n Cf. Equity Rules 19 and 22 (28 USCA  723). A claim for refund is not a pleading, and analogies borrowed from the forms and methods of a lawsuit will be applied to these administrative remedies 'in due subordination to differences of end and aim.' United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra. Even so, they will have their place of influence, which may turn out to be controlling, if differences of end and aim are obscure or indecisive.\n\n 2. \nIn this case, administrative practice reinforces the suggestions of procedural analogies, and bids us follow where they point.\n When a claim such as the one in controversy is submitted to a Commissioner, there is only one way in which it is possible for him to deal with it. He must look into the omitted items, and determine their effect upon the assessment he has made. If he finds that items have been omitted, and that by reason of their nature they make it impossible for him to determine the value of the capital, he will order a special assessment, for there will be nothing else to do. If he finds that they have been omitted, but \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 35]\n\u00a0\n that he is able to appraise them, he will have learned in the course of the investigation, that the assessment is erroneous in a determinable amount. Justice will then require that it be changed to that extent. In amending the claim by a prayer for alternative relief, a taxpayer is not forcing the inquiry into an unexplored territory, into strange and foreign paths. He is asking the Commissioner to take action upon discoveries already in the making or perhaps already made. There is no transfiguring amendment, such as we found in the Prentiss Case, with its attempted change from a discretionary to a justiciable remedy. There is an adaptation of the relief to a case already proved.\n The brief for the government describes the division of functions between one section and another of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. A claim which appears on its face to be one for a special assessment is sent to the Special Assessment Section. A claim for the revaluation of invested capital is sent to a section of the Field Audit Review Division. From this it ensues, we are told, that claims may be handled by different persons, and to some extent in different ways, according to the end in view. More than that must be shown to make out the contention that the substantial identity of the claim will be changed by this amendment. Whatever the distribution of labor may be between one division and another, it is impossible for any of them to pass upon a claim under section 327(a) without also passing upon the question whether the valuation of the invested capital is wrong, and, if so, whether in a determinable or an indeterminable amount. Once let it be ascertained that the amount is determinable, and all that follows is an incident. At that point discovery has gone on to such a stage that the Commissioner may not rid himself of the duty of pressing forward to the end. He cannot in good conscience be satisfied with less. There may be need to take the case out \n\n[289 U.S. 28, 36]\n\u00a0\n of one section and transfer it to another before revision will be complete. All this is quite irrelevant when once a wrong is brought to light. There can be no stopping after that until justice has been done.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For a summary of the decisions, see Clark on Code Pleading, p. 184. \n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEVAN v. KRIEGER(1933)\nNo. 784\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeals from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio.[ Bevan v. Krieger \n289 U.S. 459\n (1933) ]\n\n\n[289 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Crary Davis and George D. Welles, both of Toledo, Ohio, for appellants.\n Mr. Raymond T. Jackson, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The three judgments from which these separate appeals are prosecuted have a common origin, are founded upon the same Code provisions, in the main present related questions, and may be reviewed in a single opinion.\n Suit was instituted in an Ohio court by Clara Sielcken-Schwarz, as widow and sole legatee of Herman Sielcken, against the Woolson Company (of which the appellant Bevan is secretary and treasurer), Koehrman, Stranahan, and others, to obtain redress for an alleged fraudulent scheme whereby her deceased husband's executor, The Columbia Trust Company, was induced to part with certain capital stock of that corporation. The plaintiff, desiring to take the depositions of the three appellants, proceeded as provided by the General Code of Ohio.1 Subpoenas duces tecum were served upon Bevan and Koehrman, and a subpoena ad testificandum on Stranahan. A notary public was named to take the testimony, and at the time and place appointed Bevan appeared before him, was sworn, \n\n[289 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n answered some questions, declined to answer others, and finally declared that he would answer no more. In each instance he was enjoined by the notary to answer, and in each case stated that he refused on the advice of counsel. He also failed to produce papers and documents called for in his subpoena, although he admitted that he had them in his possession or under his control, and in this matter also gave as his excuse advice of counsel. He did not claim personal privilege or possibility of self-incrimination, but he and his counsel contented themselves with the statement that the questions and the writings were immaterial and irrelevant to any issue in the suit. Koehrman and Stranahan faile to appear in response to the subpoenas served upon them. The notary, upon the plaintiff's request, issued a commitment of Bevan for contempt, and attachments for the other two appellants. These writs were delivered to the sheriff for service. All three appellants surrendered to that official, and applied to the Court of Appeals of Lucas County for writs of habeas corpus. After hearings, that court remanded each to the custody of the sheriff. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgments.\n In the courts below, and here, the appellants have insisted that the statutes of Ohio authorizing their arrest and detention deprive them of due process. The sections of the General Code drawn in question are 11510, whereby disobedience of a subpoena and refusal to be sworn, or an unlawful refusal to answer as a witness, may be punished as a contempt of the officer by whom the attendance or testimony of the witness is required; 11511, which authorizes the notary to issue an attachment to arrest and bring before him the person subpoenaed to give his testimony or answer for his contempt; and section 11512 which fixes the penalty for contempt: 'When the witness fails to attend in obedience to a subpoena, the court or officer may fine him not over fifty \n\n[289 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n dollars; in other cases, not more than fifty dollars nor less than five dollars; or he may imprison him in the county jail, there to remain until he submits to be sworn, testifies, or gives his deposition.' By section 11514 it is provided that a witness so imprisoned by an officer may apply to a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, common pleas or probate court, who may discharge him if it appears that his imprisonment is illegal.\n The appellants' position is that since the statute requires the witness to answer only lawful questions, and the notary, not being a judidicial officer, is not permitted to pass upon the lawfulness of a question, but is bound to commit for refusal to answer, the commitment without a prior judicial hearing and provision for such a hearing only after commitment (section 11514), is a denial of due process.\n Koehrman and Stranahan fail to present a federal question. Both of them, without excuse, absented themselves from the taking of the depositions. The writs of attachment issued to bring them before the notary for contempt were not served. While the sheriff held the process these appellants sought him out, surrendered to him, and immediately applied for writs of habeas corpus. Their conduct precludes the assertion that they were denied a hearing by the notary. They asked for none, and by their action rendered one impossible.\n Bevan's case differs but slightly from those of Koehrman and Stranahan. He refused to answer questions or to produce the writings enumerated in his subpoena. The notary thereupon, after adjourning the hearing until the following day, issued the commitment. Bevan surrendered himself to the sheriff, and by habeas corpus challenged the legality of his detention.\n In Ohio, as generally elsewhere, the officer taking a deposition does not rule upon the competency or materi- \n\n[289 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n ality of the evidence to the issues made by the pleadings. The witness' testimony is taken subject to the reserved right to object to its admissibility at the trial. The right of objection and exclusion belongs to the parties, not to the witness. So far as disclosed, the refusal to answer and produce documents was based solely on the theory that the petition in the suit did not state a cause of action and that the depositions constituted a fishing expedition for evidence. But the appellant now insists that aside from their irrelevancy, which was the ground of refusal to answer, the questions propounded may have been improper as trenching upon the personal privilege of the witness, although he indicates no aspect in which this might be true. He says that it would have been useless for him to raise the issue before the notary because under the decisions of the Ohio courts the latter is not a judicial officer invested with power to pass upon such an issue; that therefore a witness must take the risk that he is correct in his refusal to answer, and may vindicate his action only before a court after commitment, in accordance with section 11514.\n In Ohio a notary has been held not to be a judicial officer within the meaning of the state Constitution; but we think that he may nevertheless be authorized to pass upon the witness' privilege. We find no decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio holding the notary incompetent to consider and to pass in the first instance upon the propriety of a witness' refusal to answer. No such lack of power appears upon the face of the statutes. The appellant admits this, but asserts that the Code provision has been construed by the courts to prohibit the notary from passing on the witness' reasons for refusal to testify. We are not convinced that the state courts have so interpreted the statute. \n\n[289 U.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n But we deem it unnecessary to pursue the inquiry, or to express any view as to the adequacy of the hearing afforded after commitment by section 11514, for the reason that the alleged deprivation of appellant's liberty was consequent upon his sweeping statement that he would answer no further questions. Such conduct by a witness in any court would be sufficient ground for his commitment without further or other hearing. Such an attitude indicates no desire for a hearing upon the propriety of the questions, but on its face constitutes a contempt. Bevan requested no consideration of his rights by the notary, and was denied no hearing by that officer upon the issue whether the questions infringed his personal privileges as a witness. His claim that he was denied due process is therefore without foundation.\n The appellant Bevan also advances the contention that the notary had such a pecuniary interest in compelling the testimony as would disqualify him, and deprive his rulings of the impartiality required for due process. Notaries are entitled to fees of 25 cents per hundred words for taking and certifying depositions (General Code Ohio,  127, 1746-2). These are paid in the first instance by the party taking the depositions, and are taxable as costs in the suit. It appears from the record that it is also customary for the notary if, as in this case, he happens to be a stenographer, to take the testimony stenographically and to furnish additional copies to the parties at a charge somewhat less per hundred words than is provided in the statute. These facts are said to bring the case within the principle announced in Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 50 A.L.R. 1243. But we think the suggested analogy does not exist. Tumey, as mayor of a city, sat as a magistrate. His judgments were final as to certain offenses, unless wholly unsupported by evidence. The law awarded him a substan- \n\n[289 U.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n tial fee if he found an offender guilty, and none in case of acquittal. Tumey's interest was direct and obvious, but the possibility that the extent of the notary's services and the amount of his compensation may be affected by his ruling is too remote and incidental to vitiate his official action. Moreover, his action lacks the finality which attached to the judgment in the Tumey Case, as it is subject to review in accordance with section 11514. \n No. 784\n, judgment affirmed.\n Nos. 785 and 786, appeals dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Either party may commence taking testimony by deposition at any time after service of process (section 11526), before a judge or clerk of a court, a justice of the peace, a notary public, and certain other designated persons (section 11529).

Customs duties were exacted at the rates prescribed by the Tariff Act of 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858. The university paid under protest, insisting that as an instrumentality of the state of Illinois, and discharging a governmental function, it was entitled to import the articles duty free. At the hearing on the protest, the Customs Court decided in favor of the Government (59 Treas. Dec. 747) and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals affirmed the decision. 61 Treas.Dec. 1334. This Court granted certiorari. 28 U.S.C.  308 (28 USCA 308); \n287 \nU.S. 596\n, 53 S.Ct. 315, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The Tariff Act of 1922 is entitled, 'An Act to provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes.' The Congress thus asserted that it was exercising its constitutional authority 'to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.' Article 1,  8, cl. 3. The words of the Constitution 'comprehend every species of commercial intercourse between the United States and foreign nations. No sort of trade can be carried on between this country and any other, to which this power does not extend.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 193. It is an essential attribute of the power that it is exclusive and plenary. As an exclusive power, its exercise may not \n\n[289 U.S. 48, 57]\n\u00a0\n be limited, qualified, or impeded to any extent by state action. Id., pages 196-200 of 9 Wheat.; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446; Almy v. California, 24 How. 169, 173; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 492\n, 493 S., 24 S.Ct. 349. The power is buttressed by the express provision of the Constitution denying to the States authority to lay imposts or duties on imports or exports without the consent of the Congress. Article 1,  10, cl. 2.\n The Congress may determine what articles may be imported into this country and the terms upon which importation is permitted. No one can be said to have a vested right to carry on foreign commerce with the United States. Buttfield v. Stranahan, supra; The Abby Dodge, \n223 \nU.S. 166, 176\n, 177 S., 32 S.Ct. 310; Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 219 S., 35 S.Ct. 285; Weber v. Freed, \n239 \nU.S. 325, 329\n, 330 S., 36 S.Ct. 131, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 317. If the Congress saw fit to lay an embargo or to prohibit altogether the importation of specified articles, as the Congress may (The Brigantine William, 2 Hall, Amer. L.J., 255, Fed. Cas. No. 16,700; Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, pages 192, 193 of 9 Wheat.; Brolan v. United States, supra; Weber v. Freed, supra; Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 434\n, 52 S.Ct. 607), no state by virtue of any interest of its own would be entitled to override the restriction. The principle of duality in our system of government does not touch the authority of the Congress in the regulation of foreign commerce.\n Appellant argues that the Tariff Act is a revenue measure; that it is not the less so because it if framed with a view, as its title states, of encouraging the industries of the United States (Hampton & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 411\n, 412 S., 48 S.Ct. 348); that the duty is a tax, that the act is not one for the regulation of commerce but is an exertion of the taxing power; and that, as such, it is subject to the constitutional limitation that the Congress may not lay a tax so as to impose a direct burden upon an instru- \n\n[289 U.S. 48, 58]\n\u00a0\n mentality of a state used in the performance of a governmental function.\n It is true that the taxing power is a distinct power; that it is distinct from the power to regulate commerce. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, page 201 of Wheat.. It is also true that the taxing power embraces the power to lay duties. Article 1,  8, cl. 1. But because the taxing power is a distinct power and embraces the power to lay duties, it does not follow that duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the power to regulate commerce. The contrary is well established. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, page 202 of 9 Wheat.. 'Under the power to regulate foreign commerce Congress impose duties on importations, give drawbacks, pass embargo and non-intercourse laws, and make all other regulations necessary to navigation, to the safety of passengers, and the protection of property.' Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505. The laying of duties is 'a common means of executing the power.' 2 Story on the Constitution,  1088. It has not been questioned that this power may be exerted by laying duties 'to countervail the regulations and restrictions of foreign nations.' Id.,  1087. And the Congress may, and undoubtedly does, in its tariff legislation consider the conditions of foreign trade in all its aspects and effects. Its requirements are not the less regulatory because they are not prohibitory or retaliatory. They embody the congressional conception of the extent to which regulation should go. But if the Congress may thus exercise the power, and asserts, as it has asserted here, that it is exercising it, the judicial department may not attempt in its own conception of policy to distribute the duties thus fixed by allocating some of them to the exercise of the admitted power to regulate commerce and others to an independent exercise of the taxing power. The purpose to regulate foreign commerce permeates the entire congressional plan. The revenue resulting from the duties \n\n[289 U.S. 48, 59]\n\u00a0\n 'is an incident to such an exercise of the power. It flows from, but does not create the power.' Id.\n The principle invoked by the petitioner, of the immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation, has its inherent limitations. Fox Film Corporation v. Doyal, \n286 \nU.S. 123, 128\n, 52 S.Ct. 549. It is a principle implied from the necessity of maintaining our dual system of government. The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 127; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 51 S.Ct. 125; Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 575\n, 51 S.Ct. 601. Springing from that necessity it does not extend beyond it. Protecting the functions of government in its proper province, the implication ceases when the boundary of that province is reached. The fact that the state in the performance of state functions may use imported articles does not mean that the importation is a function of the state government independent of federal power. The control of importation does not rest with the state but with the Congress. In international relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power. There is thus no violation of the principle which petitioner invokes, for there is no encroachment on the power of the state as none exists with respect to the subject over which the federal power has been exerted. To permit the states and their instrumentalities to import commodities for their own use, regardless of the requirements imposed by the Congress, would undermine, if not destroy, the single control which it was one of the dominant purposes of the Constitution to create. It is for the Congress to decide to what extent, if at all, the states and their instrumentalities shall be relieved of the payment of duties on imported articles.\n The contention of the petitioner finds no support in the history of tariff acts or in departmental practice. It is \n\n[289 U.S. 48, 60]\n\u00a0\n not necessary to review this practical construction. It is sufficient to say that only in recent years has any question been raised by state officials as to the authority of Congress to impose duties upon their imports.\n In view of these conclusions, we find it unnecessary to consider the questions raised with respect to the particular functions of the petitioner and its right to invoke the principle for which it contends.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADLEY v. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION(1933)\nNo. 395\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of Ohio. \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. La Rue Brown, of Boston, Mass., and John T. Scott, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellant.\n Mr. Thomas J. Herbert, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Bradley applied to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate by motor as a common carrier of property over State Route No. 20, extending from Cleveland, Ohio, to the Ohio-Michigan line, with Flint, Mich., as final destination. The New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad opposing, moved that the application be dismissed on the ground of the present congested condition of that highway. Upon a full hearing, the commission found 'that said State Route No. 20, at this time, is so badly congested by established motor vehicle operations, that the addition of the applicant's \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n proposed service would create and maintain an excessive and undue hazard to the safety and security of the travelling public, and the property upon such highway.' It therefore ordered: 'That in the interest of preserving the public welfare, the application be, and hereby is, denied.'\n In a petition for a rehearing, which was also denied, Bradley urged, among other things, that denial of the application for the certificate on the ground stated violated rights guaranteed to the applicant by the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The same claims were asserted in a petition in error to the Supreme Court of the state; were there denied (125 Ohio St. 381, 181 N.E. 668) upon the authority of Motor Transport Co. v. Public Utilities Company, 125 Ohio St. 374, 181 N.E. 665; and are renewed here upon this appeal. We are of opinion that the claims are unfounded.\n First. It is contended that the order of the commission is void because it excludes Bradley from interstate commerce. The order does not in terms exclude him from operating interstate. The denial of the certificate excludes him merely from Route 20. In specifying the route, Bradley complied with the statutory requirement that an applicant for a certificate shall set forth 'the complete route' over which he desires to operate. Ohio General Code,  614-90(c). But the statute confers upon an applicant the right to amend his application before or after hearing or action by the commission. Section 614-91. And it authorizes him, after the certificate is refused, to 'file a new application or supplement any former application for the purpose of changing' the route. Section 614-93. No amendment of the application was made or new application filed. For aught that appears, some alternate or amended route was available on which there was no congestion. If no other feasible \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n route existed and that fact was deemed relevant, the duty to prove it rested upon the applicant. It was not incumbent upon the commission to offer a certificate over an alternate route.\n Second. It is contended that an order denying to a common carrier by motor a certificate to engage in interstate transportation necessarily violates the Commerce Clause. The argument is that under the rule declared in Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S.Ct. 324, 38 A.L.R. 286, and Bush & Sons Co. v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 317\n, 45 S.Ct. 326, 327, an interstate carrier is entitled to a certificate as of right; and that hence the reason for the commission's refusal and its purpose are immaterial. In those cases, safety was doubtless promoted when the certificate was denied, because intensification of traffic was thereby prevented. See Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 U.S. 251\n, 269-272, 53 S.Ct. 181. But there promotion of safety was merely an incident of the denial. Its purpose was to prevent competition deemed undesirable. The test employed was the adequacy of existing transportation facilities; and since the transportation in question was interstate, denial of the certificate invaded the province of Congress. In the case at bar, the purpose of the denial was to promote safety; and the test employed was congestion of the highway. The effect of the denial upon interstate commerce was merely an incident.\n Protection against accidents, as against crime, presents ordinarily a local problem. Regulation to ensure safety is an exercise of the police power. It is primarily a state function, whether the locus be private property or the public highways. Congress has not dealt with the subject. Hence, even where the motorcars are used exclusively in interstate commerce, a state may freely exact registration of the vehicle and an operator's license, Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 47 S.Ct. 702; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; may require the appointment of an agent upon whom \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n process can be served in an action arising out of operation of the vehicle within the state, Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S.Ct. 30; Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352, 356\n, 47 S.Ct. 632; and may require carriers to file contracts providing adequate insurance for the payment of judgments recovered for certain injuries resulting from their operations, Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 U.S. 352\n, 365- 366, 52 S.Ct. 595, 81 A.L.R. 1402. Compare Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140\n, 44 S.Ct. 257; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 U.S. 163\n, 171-172, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; Hodge Co. v. Cincinnati, \n284 \nU.S. 335, 337\n, 52 S.Ct. 144. The state may exclude from the public highways vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, if of a size deemed dangerous to the public safety, Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 144\n, 47 S.Ct. 548; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 U.S. 374\n, 389-390, 52 S.Ct. 581. Safety may require that no additional vehicle be admitted to the highway. The Commerce Clause is not violated by denial of the certificate to the appellant, if upon adequate evidence denial is deemed necessary to promote the public safety. Compare Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 U.S. 164\n, 170- 171, 48 S.Ct. 66.1\n Third. It is contended that the order is void under the Commerce Clause because the finding of congestion of Route 20 is unsupported by evidence. The argument is that the only evidence introduced on that issue consisted of two traffic counts, both in the single city of Fremont; that this evidence was insufficient because Route 20 extends for only 2.2 miles through Fremont, whereas the total length of the portion which would be traversed is about 100 miles; and that the evidence was conflicting. The evidence was adequate to support the finding. \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, no such objection is set forth in the statement as to jurisdiction filed pursuant to Rule 12.\n Fourth. It is contended that the statute as applied to the plaintiff violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff was treated less favorably than others who applied at the same time or thereafter for certificates as common carriers; nor is there any suggestion that the classification operates to favor intrastate over interstate carriers. One argument is that the statute discriminates unlawfully against common carriers in favor of shippers who operate their own trucks. In dealing with the problem of safety of the highways, as in other problems of motor transportation, the state may adopt measures which favor vehicles used solely in the business of their owners, as distinguished from those which are operated for hire by carriers who use the highways as their place of business. See Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 144\n, 44 S.Ct. 257. Compare Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, \n280 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 50 S.Ct. 64; Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 373\n, 52 S.Ct. 595, 81 A.L.R. 1402; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 396\n, 52 S.Ct. 581. Another objection is that to deny certificates to subsequent applicants discriminates unlawfully in favor of carriers previously certificated. But classification based on priority of authorized operation has a natural and obvious relation to the purpose of the regulation. Conceivably, restriction of the volume of traffic might be secured by limiting the extent of each certificate holder's use. But that would involve reapportionment whenever a new applicant appeared. The guaranty of equal protection does not prevent the state from adopting the simple expedient of prohibiting operations by additional carriers.\n There is a further argument that the statute discriminates unlawfully between common and contract carriers. It rests upon the assumption that the statute is, as a \n\n[289 U.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n matter of construction, inapplicable to contract carriers. On the question of construction, there appears to be no authoritative decision. \n2\n We have no occasion to consider that question. For it does not appear that there has been discrimination against the plaintiff in favor of contract carriers. Compare Albany County Supervisors v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 314\n\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Johnson Transfer & Freight Lines v. Perry (D.C.) 47 F.( 2d) 900, 902; Phillips v.

The District Court of three judges (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)) sustained the tax, and the cases come here on appeal from final decress dismissing the bills of complaint for want of equity. South Carolina Power Co. v. South Carolina Tax Commission (D.C.) 52 F. (2d) 515; Broad River Power Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 525\n, 52 S.Ct. 494; South Carolina Power Co. v. South Carolina Tax Commission (D.C.) 60 F. (2d) 528.\n The contention, pressed below, that the statute is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution is not presented here. The grounds of attack are (1) that the statute is a denial of the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment; and (2), in the case of the Lexington Water Power Company, that the tax is imposed upon an agency of the United States.\n\n 1. \nThe complaint, upon the first ground, is that the tax is laid upon the production of electricity by water power or steam power, while the production of electricity by the use of oil or internal combustion engines is not taxed, and that the statute also exempts from the tax industrial plants generating power for their own use or that of their employees.\n The court below adequately answered this contention. The court found that there were at least two plants in the state producing electric current by the use of internal combustion engines, and that these plants were small and their business was comparatively insignificant. The court pointed out that the purpose of the Legislature was evidently 'to tax the generation of electric current by the hydroelectric companies which utilize the water power in the rivers of South Carolina, one of the great natural resources of that State.' And the generation of current \n\n[288 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n by the use of steam power was taxed 'because it is a matter of common knowledge that the hydroelectric companies use steam power to supplement water power in the production of their current, and also because current produced by steam power is the great competing factor on the market with current produced by water power.' 52 F.(2d) 519. This classification cannot be regarded as arbitrary. Nor can it be doubted that the state was entitled, in devising its fiscal system, to recognize the distinction between hydroelectric companies generating electric current for sale to the public and industrial plants which develop power for their own use and that of their employees. The principles involved have been so recently restated by this court that elaboration is unnecessary. Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S.Ct. 83; Ohio Oil Company v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146\n, 50 S.Ct. 310; State Board of Tax Commissioners of Indiana v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464\n\n\n 2. The separate complaint of the Lexington Water Power Company is that it is generating current at a water power plant, on the Saluda river, which was constructed and is operated pursuant to a license granted by the Federal Power Commission under the Federal Water Power Act (16 U.S.C. c. 12 (16 USCA  791 et seq.)), and hence that the tax is an 'excise, license or privilege tax' upon a federal agency.\n It is apparent, however, that the complainant, in generating and selling power, is not acting as an agent for the government. It acts with the government's permission, and, while it may be said to have received a privilege from the government, it is not a privilege to be exercised on behalf of the government. The tax is not upon the exertion of, and cannot be said to burden, any governmental function. Fox Film Corporation v. Doyal, \n286 \nU.S. 123, 130\n, 52 S.Ct. 546. The tax is not laid upon the license granted by the Federal Water Power Commission, but upon the production and sale of power which the company generates at its own \n\n[288 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n pleasure and exclusively for its own profit. Notwithstanding the special characteristics of electrical energy, the company is engaged in producing and selling an article of trade. Utah Power & Light Company v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 180\n, 181 S., 52 S.Ct. 548. The product is property. The fact that a privilege has been received from the federal government does not exempt that property or the local business in producing and selling it from the burdens of taxation otherwise valid.

PETER BARCELOUX CO.(1933)\nNo. 564\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George R. Freeman, of Willows, Cal., and Horace B. Wulff, Robert T. Devlin, and William H. Devlin, all of Sacramento, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arthur C. Huston, of Woodland, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In April, 1926, the bankrupt, Henry Barceloux, was the owner of 2,500 shares of the Peter Barceloux Company, a quarter of the capital stock. The other three quarters were owned, one by his brother George, one by his sister Cora, and one by three nephews, the sons of a deceased \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n brother. The book value of the bankrupt's shares was over $90,000, and the actual value over $94,000, but the shares were not traded in, and had no current value in the market. The business was a family affair, and strangers were not welcome within the family preserve.\n A time arrived when the unwelcome stranger seemed likely to break in. The family combined to maintain its solidarity and keep the intruder out. Henry Barceloux had become heavily involved in debt. A former partner, Freeman, had recovered a judgment against him for nearly $50,000. Freeman had been lenient, but Freeman was now dead, and the administrator was asking for security as the price of delay. There were other creditors too, though they are not shown to have been importunate. With these intruders visible, the family set out to build protective barriers. There is testimony that Henry Barceloux was indebted to the corporation in upwards of $33,000. On April 27, 1926, he secured part of this indebtedness by a pledge of 2,499 shares of the Barceloux stock. The agreement was in writing. We are assured by the family that it was confirmatory of an oral agreement made some years before, but the testimony as to this is not persuasive, and might, not unreasonably, be rejected by the trier of the facts. The movement of events was swift thereafter. The Freeman administrator had still to be placated. He was put off in June, 1926, with an assignment of the equity in the Barceloux shares together with an assignment of an interest in heavily mortgaged lands. He gave notice to the corporation of his interest in the shares and made demand upon the secretary for a statement of the indebtedness secured by the superior lien. He also asked for an agreement that the corporation give him notice of ninety days before enforcing its security. His activity aroused the family to new measures of protection. The request for notice was \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n refused, and the defensive barrier extended. Henry Barceloux was then the owner of shares of stock in other corporations, his ownership till then being clear of any lien. On June 29, 1926, he pledged his interest in these shares (worth about $2158) as additional security for the family debt. In so doing he stripped himself of the control of all or nearly all his unincumbered assets. On the same day, or perhaps a few days later, the corporation canceled the certificate for 2499 shares which was in the name of the pledgor, and took out a new certificate in its own name as pledgee.\n The scene was now ready. The time for action was at hand. On August 16, 1926, there was the gesture of a public sale. A printed notice had been posted on a telegraph pole and perhaps elsewhere. There was no other notice either to , freeman or to any one else. At the appointed time, the members of the family, accompanied by a lawyer, went through the form of an auction on the steps of the court house. The debtor's sister Cora, who was a director of the corporation, read the notice of sale and asked for bids; all the collateral, both the Barceloux shares and the others, being offered as a single lot. The brother George, who was then the president, made a bid for the entire lot in the name of the Barceloux corporation, the bid being for the amount of its claim against the debtor and a fee for its attorney. No sooner had the corporation bought than it sold back again to George. In payment for what it sold, it took his promissory note with a pledge of the shares as collateral security. About two years later, it canceled the resale, gave back the promissory note, and thereafter held the shares as owner. In the meanwhile a few scraps of property retained by Henry Barceloux had been put out of his name. He still held one share in the Barceloux Company. He sold it to his sister. He had equities in other properties, lands, and shares of stock. He sold part to his sister and part to his \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n wife. The value in each instance was in excess of the price. The equity in collateral pledged with a bank in San Francisco went to the Barceloux Company, which assumed the payment of the debt. All that was then left to him was his office furniture and fixtures, and this he transferred to his attorney. By October, 1926, he had stripped himself of everything. He waited four months, and became a voluntary bankrupt.\n The trustee in bankruptcy has brought this suit under section 70e of the National Bankruptcy Act1 to recover from the Barceloux Company the value of property pledged by the bankrupt with fraudulent intent. At the filing of the bill the company had resold the shares to George Barceloux, its president; and the prayer for relief, adapting itself to the situation then existing, was for the value of the shares on August 16, 1926, with interest at 7 per cent., the statutory rate of interest in the state of California. There was also a prayer for an accounting and for any other relief consistent with equity. The District Court found that the fraudulent intent had been made out; that both pledgor and pledgee were sharers in it; and that there should be an appointment of a master to take and state an account and to report the value of the property covered by the pledge. Upon the coming in of the report, there was a final judgment for $106,409.44, with costs, in favor of the trustee. 51 F.(2d) 80.\n An appeal by the defendant followed with the result that the decree was reversed, one judge dissenting. 61 F.(2d) 145. The Court of Appeals held that the Freeman \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n administrator was estopped from contesting the validity of the pledge by reason of the fact that he had accepted a pledge of the equity in the shares, subject by its terms to the pledge already made. Finding no sufficient evidence that other creditors were aggrieved, it refused to pass upon the question whether the pledge as to them was good or bad. It held, however, that the sale under the pledge had not been fairly made, and that a resale should be ordered. Upon the argument the defendant had made profert of the Barceloux certificate, and had left it with the court to be disposed of in any way consistent with equity and conscience. The shares in other corporations it could not produce, having disposed of them again. The court held that there could be no recovery of the value of the Barceloux shares in view of the willingness of the defendant to submit to a resale. Judgment was therefore ordered that the shares be resold under the direction of the court of bankruptcy; that out of the proceeds the Barceloux Company be paid its indebtedness with interest (less the value of the shares that it was unable to surrender); and that only the surplus, if any, be paid to the trustee. A writ of certiorari brings the case here, \n288 \nU.S. 595\n, 53 S.Ct. 319, 77 L.Ed. --.\n\n 1. \nThe evidence sustains the finding of the District Court that the pledge to the defendant was made in fraud of creditors.\n More is here than a mere preference. If that and nothing else had been intended, the pledge would be proof against attack, for it was made more than four months before the bankruptcy petition. But in truth there was much besides. The pledge was a step in a general plan which must be viewed as a whole with all its composite implications. Dean v. Davis, \n242 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 37 S.Ct. 130; Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 244\n, 29 S.Ct. 436, 16 Ann.Cas. 1008. The principal assets of the debtor were his certificates of stock in the family corporation. There was to be a delivery of these certificates as security for an indebtedness much less than the value of \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n the collateral deposited. There was to be a delivery of other security to make sure that all the assets of the debtor, not otherwise incumbered, would be within the control of the pledgee. There was to be a sale so secret that none of the creditors would be likely to know anything about it, with the result that other bids would be forestalled, and embarrassing inquiries as to preferences averted. Finally, to make the job a through one, the odds and ends of other assets were to be conveyed to friends or relatives. As the outcome of these manoeuvres the Barceloux Company canceled an indebtedness of about $33,000, and became the owner of stock certificates worth triple that amount. The unconscionable sale is not to be viewed in isolation, as something disconnected from the pledge, an accident or afterthought. It was the fruit for which the seed was planted, or so the trier of the facts might look at it. The Barceloux Company set out to do something more than secure the payment of a debt. It became a party to a plan to appropriate a surplus and in combination with its debtor to hold his creditors at bay. Dean v. Davis, supra; Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348\n, 53 S.Ct. 142. So the District Judge interpreted the transaction, viewing the events consecutively as stages of an unfolding plot. We discover no sufficient reason for rejecting his conclusion. Indeed, the Circuit Court of Appeals held nothing to the contrary. It refrained from approving or condemning the purpose of the pledge, being led to that course by the application of the doctrine of estoppel. The finding therefore stands.\n\n 2. \nThe trustee is not subject to the bar of an estoppel in his effort to undo the fraud.\n The argument for the defendant is that the Freeman administrator is estopped by force of his acceptance of a junior lien upon the shares, and that the trustee as his champion enjoys no better right. To overcome the supposed estoppel it is enough to recall the fact that at the \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n time of the unlawful pledge the Freeman administrator was not the only creditor. The uncontradicted evidence is that there were many other creditors whose claims are still unpaid. What the trustee recovers will be for the benefit of all. Moore v. Bay, \n284 \nU.S. 4\n, 52 S.Ct. 3.\n The result would not be different, however, if the administrator stood alone. Neither in his own name nor indirectly through the trustee is he building any rights upon the pledge or claiming any preference over others. He has rejected the security, and claims as a general creditor. There may have been obscurity as to this at the beginning of the suit. The bill of complaint which was a declaration by the trustee, and not by the administrator, gives recognition to the junior pledge as valid and subsisting. There has been no obscurity, however, since the trial and the interlocutory judgment. The pledge to the administrator is disregarded, and he is left in the same position with reference to any general creditors as if the transaction putting him ahead of them had been undone from the beginning. One who takes a mortgage or an assignment of an interest in property subject to a specific lien may be estopped while he retains the benefit from disavowing the attendant burden. Freeman v. Auld, 44 N.Y. 50, 53; Matter of Oakes, 248 N.Y. 280, 284, 162 N.E. 79. He either takes the security upon the terms conditioning the offer, or does not take it at all. The basis for an estoppel is cut away if the transaction is lawfully disaffirmed and the security abandoned. Old National Bank v. Heckman, 148 Ind. 490, 507, 47 N.E. 953. Cf. Bybee v. Oregon & Cal. R.R. Co., \n139 \nU.S. 663, 682\n, 11 S.Ct. 641.\n Disaffirmance and abandonment in this instance rested on sufficient grounds. The Freeman administrator, though informed of the fact that there was a pledge superior to his, had no knowledge of anything else. He was not informed of the circumstances essential to an \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n understanding of the fraud. He did not even know, so far as the evidence discloses, whether the pledge was new or old. Only through later events was the collusive plan exhibited in all its sinister significance. There can be no irrevocable estoppel when the truth has been withheld.\n\n 3. \nThe repurchase of the certificates by the fraudulent grantee during the pendency of the suit did not make it error for a court of equity to render judgment for the value.\n There is no occasion to consider what relief would have been proper if the certificates had been owned by the defendant at the filing of the bill, and had been continuously retained thereafter. We may assume, though we do not decide, that the trustee, suing in such circumstances for an accounting in equity, would have had the shares, and not the value. See Dunphy v. Kleinschmidt, 11 Wall. 610; Wasey v. Holbrook, 141 App.Div. 336, 125 N.Y.S. 1087; Id., 206 N.Y. 708, 99 N.E. 1119; and compare American Law Institute, Restatement of Law of Trusts, Tentative Draft No. 3,  199, and cases cited, pp. 157, 158. The fact is, however, that at the filing of the bill, the defendant had assigned the certificates to another, who was not a party to the suit. The assignment is alleged in the complaint and admitted in the answer. Not till May 11, 1928, after the answer had been filed, did George Barceloux return his certificates to the defendant and thus reinstate its title. This being so, the suit in its inception was properly framed as one for money relief, the value of the shares at the time of the foreclosure of the pledge. There was no objection at any stage of the controversy that the case was triable by a jury. Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., \n287 \nU.S. 92\n, 53 S.Ct. 50; United States v. Bitter Root Co., \n200 \nU.S. 451\n, 26 S.Ct. 318. In saying this we do not intimate that the objection would have prevailed, if seasonably urged. There were entanglements that may have called for discovery and accounting, \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 236]\n\u00a0\n at least in possible contingencies. The point will not be labored, for at the trial the defendant did not argue to the contrary (Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S.Ct. 486; American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S.Ct. 149; Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., supra, at page 96 of 287 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 50 ), and does not even now. By common consent the suit was tried as one in equity, the fraudulent grantee being held to account as a trustee ex maleficio for the value of the shares which it had fraudulently acquired and then conveyed to some one else. United States v. Dunn, \n268 \nU.S. 121\n, 45 S.Ct. 451; Independent Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 640, 647\n, 47 S.Ct. 714; Newton v. Porter, 69 N.Y. 133, 25 Am.Rep. 152; Hamliton National Bank v. Halsted, 134 N.Y. 520, 527, 31 N.E. 900, 30 Am.St.Rep. 693. A like recovery would have been permitted if the suit had been at law.\n The defendant being chargeable with the value upon the filing of the bill, the question for us now is whether it could change its liability by buying back the shares. The answer is supplied by the opinion of Story, J., in Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 401, a landmark in the law of trusts. The trustee who misapplies the subject-matter of a trust becomes accountable at once for the proceeds or the value. Cf. Hamilton National Bank v. Halsted, supra. Nothing that he can do afterwards in buying the property back will affect that liability, except at the option of the beneficiary complaining of the wrong. 'This right or option of the cestui que trust is one which positively and exclusively belongs to him, and it is not in the power of the trustee to deprive him of it by any subsequent repurchase of the trust property, although in the latter case the cestui que trust may, if he pleases, avail himself of his own right, and take back and hold the trust property upon the original trust; but he is not compellable so to do.' Oliver v. Piatt, supra; and cf. Bunnel v. Stoddard, 4 Fed. Cas. pages 667, 683, No. 2,135; Miles v. Coombs, 120 Me. 453, 455, \n\n[289 U.S. 227, 237]\n\u00a0\n 115 A. 249; Burwell v. Burwell's Guardian, 78 Va. 574, 582; Bate v. Scales, 12 Ves. 402; American Law Institute, Restatement of Law of Trusts, supra. Any other rule, it was said, would enable the wrongdoer to take advantage of his own wrong; to let the transaction stand, if the investment showed a profit, and by aid of a repurchase to charge the beneficiary with an intermediate decline. Cf. Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535, 543. The standard of duty is no different whether the trust to be enforced is actual or constructive. United States v. Dunn, supra; Independent Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, supra; Newton v. Porter, supra. The implication of a trust is the implication of every duty proper to a trust. Equity has its distinctive standards of fidelity and honor, higher at times than the standards of the market place. Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 468, 164 N.E. 545, 62 A.L.R. 1. Whoever is a fiduciary or in conscience chargeable as a fiduciary is expected to live up to them.\n\n 4. \nThe ruling of the trial court whereby the highest value of the property up to the time of the decree was made the measure of the recovery was not harmful to the defendant.\n The recovery would have been larger if the value at the sale with legal interest thereafter had been adopted as the measure.\n\n 5. \nThe defendant may participate on the same basis with other creditors in the distribution of the assets.\n The decree of the District Court is erroneous in so far as the claim of the defendant is postponed to those of others. Moore v. Bay, supra.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court modified in accordance with this opinion, and as modified affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The trustee may avoid any transfer by the bankrupt of his property which any creditor of such bankrupt might have avoided, and may recover the property so transferred, or its value, from the person to whom it was transferred, unless he was a bona fide holder for value prior to the date of the adjudication.'

CITY OF CISCO, TEX.(1933)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 12, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dexter Hamilton and Lawrence C. McBride, both of Dallas, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. F. D. Wright, of Cisco, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action at law brought in the federal court for the Northern District of Texas against the city of Cisco to recover on bonds and coupons issued by it. The plaintiffs were citizens of states other than Texas-three of New York and one of Ohio. The defendant city was a municipal corporation of Texas.\n Of the pleadings it suffices now to say that the plaintiffs in their petition alleged that they were owners and holders of the bonds and coupons sued on, the former aggregating $14,000 and the latter $335,787.50; and that the defendant in its answer challenged the court's jurisdiction by alleging that the plaintiffs were not actual or beneficial owners of the bonds and coupons sued on but held them solely for purposes of collection on behalf of others who severally were the real owners, and none of \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n whom could sue in the federal court because their respective holdings were not in excess of $3,000.\n The evidence at the trial, so far as now material, was to the following effect: The city of Cisco in 1902-1928 issued and sold, for considerations duly received, its bonds aggregating a large sum. Attached to the bonds were coupons to be paid from time to time. The bonds and coupons were all negotiable in form and payable to bearer. When this suit was begun the plaintiffs held $2,115,000 of the bonds, $14,000 thereof being past due and unpaid, and held past due and unpaid coupons aggregating $335,787.50. These past due bonds and coupons are the ones in suit and the plaintiffs produced them in evidence.\n All of the bonds and coupons held by the plaintiffs were transferred to them by prior holders in conformity with, and for purposes defined in, a bondholders' protective agreement of January 3, 1930. The prior holders were all citizens of states other than Texas; but the extent of their respective holdings so transferred was not shown by the evidence, save as it disclosed that the coupons sued on included $5,403.75 which, with the bonds to which they pertained, were received from George F. Averill, a citizen of Maine; $3,120 which, with the bonds to which they pertained, were received from the Title & Guaranty Trust Company, a corporate citizen of Ohio; and $5,590 which, with the bonds to which they pertained, were received from E. Schier Welch, a citizen of Massachusetts.\n The agreement of January 3, 1930, in general outline was much like the usual bondholders' protective agreement. The parties to it were, upon one hand, the plaintiffs, who were called the bondholders' committee, and, on the other hand, all holders of bonds or coupons of the city who might thereafter deposit the same under the agreement in the manner provided. \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n There were introductory recitals that the city had failed to make payments of interest and principal in 1929; that it was desirable that holders of the bonds and coupons should 'unite and organize for the protection of their interests'; that this protection could be 'accomplished most effectively and with the least expense' through the committee if it were invested 'with full power and authority in the premises'; and that the committee had consented to act. Provisions then followed for a depositary which was to act on behalf of the committee and under its direction; for the deposit of bonds and coupons with the depositary by their several holders, the deposit to be such as would transfer to the committee 'the complete and absolute title'; and for the issue to each depositor of a certificate of deposit transferable only upon the books of the depositary. Other related provisions declared that the registered holder of any certificate of deposit should be deemed 'for all purposes to be the absolute owner thereof and of the bonds and\/or coupons therein referred to, and neither the depositary nor the committee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary'; that each depositor should be deemed, by reason of his deposit, to have assented to and agreed to be bound by all provisions of the agreement; that no depositor should have 'any right to withdraw any bonds or coupons from deposit' or 'to take any separate action' with respect to them after their deposit; and that deposited bonds and coupons 'shall not be satisfied or discharged except if and as may be expressly declared or provided by the committee.'\n Two paragraphs particularly defining the title and powers which the committee was to have declared:\n'Seventh: Every depositor, for himself and not for any other, hereby sells, assigns, transfers and delivers to the Committee, its successors and assigns, each and every bond and coupon deposited hereunder by him, and also all his right, title, interest, property and claim at law, or in \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n equity, by virtue of said bonds and coupons ... and any and all his claims against the City or any receiver or receivers, or under any receivership of the City,1 or any of its property, to the end that the Committee, as from time to time constituted, shall be vested with full legal title to all the bonds and coupons deposited hereunder, and to each and every claim based thereon. ...'\n\n'Eighth: The Committee may, as the owner and holder of the deposited bonds and coupons, demand, collect and receive all moneys due or payable thereon and may take or cause to be taken, or participate in or settle, compromise or discontinue, any actions or proceedings for the collection of any of the bonds or coupons or the protection, enforcement or foreclosure of any legal or equitable lien securing or pertaining to same, including liens arising from the enforcement of taxes, levies, and assessments dedicated, levied or available for the service of the bonds,1 or for the appointment of a receiver of the City or for any purpose whatsoever. The Committee may give such directions, execute such papers, and do such acts, as the Committee may consider wise or proper in order to preserve or enforce the rights or to advance or serve the interest of the depositors. ...' \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n Other paragraphs authorized the committee to purchase, acquire, sell or dispose of any property 'which may be or become affected by any such lien, foreclosures, or taxes'; to borrow money for the purpose of making such purchases or acquisitions, discharging liens on property so purchased or acquired, or paying obligations and expenses of the committee, or for any other purpose of the agreement; and 'to pledge all or any part of the bonds and coupons deposited hereunder as collateral security for the payment of any such loan or loans.'\n\n There were also provisions relating to 'a plan or plans for the refinancing, readjustment, liquidation or settlement of all of the bonds and\/or other obligations of said city.' \n2\n By these provisions the committee was authorized to prepare or participate in preparing such a plan and to include therein arrangements (a) for the purchase or acquisition of any properties or securities, the purchase or acquisition of which, in the opinion of the committee, would aid in advancing the interests of the certificate holders, and (b) for the 'sale, exchange or disposition' of the 'whole or any pro rata part of the deposited bonds and coupons.' The plan was to be submitted to the holders of certificates of deposit, and each holder was to be taken as assenting thereto unless within thirty days he dissented in writing. If two thirds assented the committee was to be at liberty either to make the plan operative or to abandon it and submit another. If any plan from which there was a dissent was made operative the committee was required to return to each dissenting certificate holder 'the bonds and coupons represented by his certificate,' upon the surrender of the certificate and the payment by him of 'an amount to be fixed by the committee'-which amount evidently was to be fixed \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n on the basis prescribed in another provision soon to be mentioned.\n The agreement further declared that the deposited bonds and coupons and all property purchased or acquired by the committee should be charged with the payment of the compensation, expenses, etc., of the committee; that any member of the committee might become 'pecuniarily interested' in any property or matters which might be subject to the agreement or to any plan of readjustment; and that the committee should have authority to construe the agreement, and its construction thereof, made in good faith, should be conclusive and bind the holders of certificates of deposit.\n It was also provided that the agreement should not remain in force beyond the period of five years from its date, unless extended by the committee with the consent of the holders of certificates representing a majority in amount of the deposited bonds and coupons; and that the committee, if considering it expedient, might terminate the agreement at any time by a vote of two thirds of its members and giving notice thereof to the certificate holders.\n Upon the termination of the agreement the securities, cash and property held thereunder by the committee were to be distributed by the committee among the certificate holders according to the amount of deposited bonds and coupons represented by their respective certificates, but subject to and upon the condition that each certificate holder should pay his share, as fixed by the committee, of the compensation and expenses of the committee, its counsel, agents and depositary, and of all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities incurred by the committee.\n From the evidence here outlined the District Court concluded (a) that under the agreement the committee (the plaintiffs) received the bonds and coupons merely as a collection agency and had no real ownership of them; ( b) that of the owners who deposited their bonds and \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n coupons with the committee only three were shown to have severally deposited more than $3,000 of those sued on; and (c) that the particular bonds and coupons received from these three depositors were not in the evidence identified or segregated from the others. The court gave effect to its conclusions by sustaining the challenge to its jurisdiction and dismissing the suit without prejudice.\n On an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that under the agreement the committee received and held the legal title to the bonds and coupons simply for purposes of collection and had no beneficial ownership; that the depositing holders remained the beneficial owners; that as to such of the bonds and coupons in suit as could not have been sued on by the beneficial owners, because their respective holdings were not in excess of $3,000, the suit was not within the jurisdiction of the District Court and should have been dismissed; that as to such of the bonds and coupons in suit as could have been sued on by the beneficial owners, because their respective holdings were in excess of $3,000, the suit 'was not kept from being one within the court's jurisdiction by the fact that appellants (the committee) were vested with the legal title to those instruments simply for the purpose of collection'; and that, as the coupons in suit included three lots-each of more than $3,000 and apparently susceptible of identification and segregation-which were received from depositing holders who could have sued thereon in the federal court, it was error to dismiss the suit in its entirety for want of jurisdiction without distinctly according to the plaintiffs an opportunity by evidence to identify and segregate the coupons received in the lots of more than $3,000.\n Thus, the Court of Appeals, while in the main approving the District Court's decision of the jurisdictional issue, pronounced its judgment of dismissal erroneous as \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n to a minor part of the coupons sued on. For that error the judgment of the District Court was reversed with a direction for further proceedings conforming to the rulings of the Court of Appeals. 62 F.(2d) 313.\n The plaintiffs, insisting that the suit in its entirety was within the District Court's jurisdiction, petitioned for certiorari, which this Court granted.\n Under section 41(1), title 28, U.S.C. (28 USCA  41(1),3 two things were essential to the jurisdiction of the District Court-one, that the suit be between citizens of different states, and the other that the sum or value in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $ 3,000. It was shown and not questioned that the parties-the plaintiffs on the one hand and the defendant on the other-were citizens of different states. The suit was on bonds amounting to $14,000 and coupons amounting to $335,787.50-all payable to bearer, made by the defendant corporation and held by the plaintiffs-and recovery was sought of the full amount of these bonds and coupons. Thus both jurisdictional requisites were apparently present.\n But it is urged that a part of that which made for such apparent jurisdiction was not real but colorable only, in that the plaintiffs had no actual ownership of the bonds and coupons sued on, but held them solely for purposes of collection on behalf of others who severally were the \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n actual owners but unable to sue in the federal court since their respective claims were too small to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement. If this were all true the conclusion would follow that the suit was not properly within the jurisdiction of the District Court and should have been dismissed under section 80, title 28, U.S.C. (28 USCA  80).4\n On the other hand if the transfers whereby the plaintiffs came to hold the bonds and coupons were not merely colorable or simply for purposes of collection, but were real and intended to invest the plaintiffs with the full title, even though in trust for purposes of which the transferrers ultimately would be the chief beneficiaries, it is quite plain that the plaintiffs could sue in the federal court notwithstanding the several transferrers, by reason of their small holdings, may have been unable to do so. With one accord prior decisions of this Court show that the right of a transferee of corporate bonds and coupons, payable to bearer, to sue in a federal court, notwithstanding a disability of his transferrers in that regard, turns on \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 189]\n\u00a0\n the nature of the transfer-whether it be real or only a colorable device to enable the transferrers, through the favor and name of the transferee, to invoke a federal jurisdiction which they could not invoke in their own right. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n We are of opinion that the purpose of the agreement of January 3, 1930, was not to create a mere collection agency, nor to set up a merely colorable device for circumventing restrictions on federal jurisdiction, but to put the bonds and coupons, the owners of which were numerous and widely scattered, into an express trust, to be managed and administered by four trustees, for the purpose of conserving, salvaging, and adjusting the investment; the municipal debtor having become financially embarrassed. The depositing owners, or succeeding certificate holders, were to be the cestuis que trustent or beneficiaries. The plaintiffs were to be the trustees. Although not called trustees in the agreement, they necessarily had that status by reason of the rights, powers and duties expressly assigned to them. There was a distinct declaration that they should have full title to the deposited bonds and coupons, and this was fortified by other provisions defining the control and power of disposal which the trustees were to have over them.\n Counsel for the defendant inquire-If the committee were to be the legal owners of the bonds and coupons, why were they authorized to borrow money and pledge the bonds and coupons for its repayment, as also to do other things which legal owners would be free to do without special authorization? The answer is obvious. The title and authority confided to the persons constituting the committee were confided to them as trustees, and not in their personal right, and there was need for carefully and fully defining the authority, for trustees are not permitted to go beyond such as is given expressly or by necessary implication. \n\n[290 U.S. 179, 190]\n\u00a0\n To summarize, we think it apparent from the agreement as a whole that resort to litigation was not the principal thing in mind when it was being made, and that what was intended was to invest the trustees with full title and such discretionary powers as might enable them to effect a helpful adjustment of the situation through refinancing, composition, exchange of securities and other means, including litigation if needed.\n As the transfers under which the plaintiffs held the bonds and coupons were made to them as trustees, were real and not simply for purposes of collection, and invested them with the full title they were entitled, by reason of their citizenship and of the amount involved, to bring the suit in the federal court. The beneficiaries were not necessary parties and their citizenship was immaterial. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The judgments of both courts below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Judgments reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The references to a possible receivership for the city and to the enforcement of taxes dedicated to the payment of the bonds have explanation in laws of Texas permitting receiverships for cities in certain situations, and in other laws of that state requiring the governing body of a city before issuing its bonds to 'provide for the levy and collection of a tax annually sufficient to pay the annual interest and provide a sinking fund for the payment of such bonds.'

A T JERGINS TRUST(1933)\nNo. 541\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A.\nYoungquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.[ Burnet v. a T Jergins Trust \n288 U.S. 508\n (1933) ]\n\n\n[288 U.S. 508, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Mare F. Mitchell and A. Calder MacKay, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent. \n\n[288 U.S. 508, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles D. Hamel and John Enrietto, both of Washington, D.C., amici curiae for Public Ownership League of America.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to 1911 the city of Long Beach, Cal., procured water from companies owning and operating \n\n[288 U.S. 508, 513]\n\u00a0\n artesian wells on lands lying outside the city. The service proving inadequate and unsatisfactory, the municipality in 1911 acquired these lands, comprising about 600 acres, and the appurtenant systems, and has since used the tract for water supply and other purposes. In 1922 oil was discovered in the vicinity, and the respondent was organized under the law of California with the intention of obtaining an oil and gas lease on the lands in question. The city leased to the respondent 140 acres, the agreement stipulating that the lessee should receive 60 per cent. of the proceeds of oil and gas recovered and the city 40 per cent. As permitted by the lease, the oil and gas produced have been sold under a contract made by the city and the respondent as joint vendors. The trust has derived substantial income from the lease.\n Upon audit of the taxpayer's returns for the years 1922, 1923, and 1924, the Commissioner, by formal written notification, proposed a deficiency in income taxes for those years. The respondent appealed to the United States Board of Tax Appeals raising two issues: (1) Whether its income derived from the lease was immune from taxation; and, if not, (2) whether capitalized expenses for drilling and developing its oil wells were to be returned through depletion allowance, as ruled by the Commissioner, or by way of depreciation. The Board held the income taxable and the intangible development costs recoverable through depreciation charges. The Circuit Court of Appeals upon cross-petitions for review decided that the income from the lease was immune from federal income tax, and therefore found it unnecessary to pass upon the matter of depreciation allowance presented by the Commissioner's petition. 61 F.(2d) 92. Both questions are raised by the petition for certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 316, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The respondent, in support of its claim of immunity, relies upon the principle that a tax upon instrumentalities of the states is forbidden by the Federal Constitution; \n\n[288 U.S. 508, 514]\n\u00a0\n that by clear implication the means employed by the general government to carry into operation the powers granted to it are exempt from taxation by the states, as are those employed by the states exempt from taxation by the general government. The principle is settled by a wealth of authority and has been applied in varying circumstances; has been recently fully discussed and the authorities collected and commented upon in decisions of this court (Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S.Ct. 172; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S.Ct. 125; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of County Commissioners of Payne County, Okl., \n288 \nU.S. 325\n, 53 S.Ct. 388, decided February 13, 1933); and no purpose would be served by a repetition of what was there said.\n The revenue acts do not discriminate between the respondent and others similarly situated, in the imposition of the income tax. If the respondent is exempt from the exaction, the conclusion must follow, because the tax directly burdens the functions of the state acting through the city of Long Beach. Considerations which have led to the condemnation of taxes in other circumstances are here absent. The levy is not upon the property of the municipality, nor upon the income it derives from its property, is not upon the city's share of the oil recovered, the lease, or the gross income therefrom. The law measures the assessment by the net income of the respondent, whose operations are carried on in a private, and not in a public, capacity for the personal gain of its cestuis que trust. The government asserts that the incidence of the tax is so remote from the activities of the municipality as to have no substantial adverse effect upon them. The respondent insists that as lessee of the lands in question it is a governmental agency, and any tax laid upon its income directly burdens governmental functions.\n In Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, this court said: \n\n[288 U.S. 508, 515]\n\u00a0\n 'Just what instrumentalities of either a state or the federal government are exempt from taxation by the other cannot be stated in terms of universal application.'\n And further:\n'As cases arise, lying between the two extremes, it becomes necessary to draw the line which separates those activities having some relation to government, which are nevertheless subject to taxation, from those which are immune. Experience has shown that there is no formula by which that line may be plotted with precision in advance. But recourse may be had to the reason upon which the rule rests, and which must be the guiding principle to control its operation. Its origin was due to the essential requirement of our constitutional system that the federal government must exercise its authority within the territorial limits of the states; and it rests on the conviction that each government in order that it may administer its affairs within its own sphere, must be left free from undue interference by the other. ...'\n\n It was there pointed out that while in one aspect the extent of the exemption must finally depend upon the effect of the tax upon the functions of the government alleged to be affected, still the nature of the governmental agencies and the mode of their Constitution may not be disregarded in passing upon the question of tax exemption. An agency may be so intimately connected with the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty by the government that any taxation of it would be a direct interference with the functions of government itself. In Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 50, 52, it was said: '... it seems to us extravagant to say that an independent private corporation for gain, created by a state, is exempt from state taxation, either in its corporate person, or its property, because it is employed by the United States, even if the work for which it is employed is important and takes much of its time.' \n\n[288 U.S. 508, 516]\n\u00a0\n The statement holds true as well, when the positions of the sovereigns are reversed.\n The application of the doctrine of implied immunity must be practical ( Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 31, 36), and should have regard to the circumstances disclosed. We think that in the present instance the subject of the tax is so remote from any governmental function as to render the effect of the exaction inconsiderable as respects the activities of the city. Compare Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 51 S.Ct. 273, 75 A.L.R. 9. Its collection is not inconsistent with and does not trench upon the immunity of the state as a sovereign. The income of the respondent from the lease is not immune from federal income tax.\n The respondent relies upon Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, and Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S.Ct. 443, as authorities binding upon us and requiring a decision in its favor. In both of those cases the sovereign was acting as the trustee of an express trust with regard to the lands leased. In both the burden upon the public use was more definite and direct than in the present case. As said in the Coronado Case, the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma is to be applied strictly and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it disclosed. The decisions relied on cannot be held to be authority upon the facts presented by this record.\n The petitioner also asserts that the Board of Tax Appeals was in error in holding that the cost of drilling should be amortized by way of depreciation charges, and not through the statutory allowance for depletion. The identical issue is involved and settled in favor of petitioner by United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459\n, 53 S. Ct. 435, and Petroleum Exploration v. Burnet, \n288 \nU.S. 467\n, 53 S.Ct. 439, decided this day.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v. ALUMINUM GOODS MFG. CO.(1933)\nNo. 192\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 544, 545]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Atty. Gen., and G. A.Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frederic Sammond, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1914 respondent, a New Jersey manufacturing corporation purchased all the capital stock of the Aluminum Sales & Manufacturing Company, a New York corporation. From that time until its liquidation, carried on in 1917, the sales company was principally engaged in selling goods manufactured by respondent. In February, 1918, it was dissolved. The operation of the sales company reflected net losses during the years 1914, 1915, and 1916, as well as in the year 1917. At a result of the operating losses and the liquidation of the sales company, \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n respondent suffered the loss of certain sums advanced to the sales company, and of the total investment in its stock.\n For 1917 the two corporations filed separate returns for computation of the normal income tax, and a consolidated return for the purposes of the excess profits tax. In its separate return respondent claimed, and the Commissioner allowed, deduction of an aggregate loss made up of respondent's advances to the sales company, and the cost of its stock, less the value of equipment and good will realized on its liquidation. This loss, reduced by the 1917 operating loss of the sales company, was deducted from gross income in the consolidated return. The Commissioner's refusal to allow the deduction was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals, 22 B.T.A. 1, whose determination was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 56 F.(2d) 568. The Court of Appeals held that respondent's affiliation with the sales company was ended by the liquidation in 1917, so that the loss was suffered 'outside the period of affiliation,' and that, in any case, as the loss did not result from an 'intercompany' transaction, it could be deducted in the consolidated return. This Court granted certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 583\n, 53 S.Ct. 21, 77 L.Ed . --, to resolve an alleged conflict with the decision of the Court of Claims in Utica Knitting Co. v. United States, 68 Ct. Cl. 77, and see Autosales Corporation v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 931, 933.\n Title 2 of the Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 302 (section 200 et seq.), imposed a war excess profits tax in addition to the normal tax upon the income of corporations. The statute made no provision for consolidated returns by affiliated corporations, but articles 77 and 78 of Treasury Regulations 41, adopted pursuant to the act, did authorize the Commissioner to require affiliated corporations, including those, the stock of one of which was owned by another, to file a consolidated return of net income and invested capital. And section 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 319 (26 USCA  1067), \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n provided that, for the purpose of determining excess profits taxes, the Revenue Act of 1917 'shall be construed to impose the taxes therein mentioned upon the basis of consolidated returns of net income and invested capital in the case of domestic corporations and domestic partnerships that were affiliated during the calendar year 1917'1.\n The purpose of requiring consolidated returns by affiliated corporations was, as the government contends, to impose the war profits tax, according to true net income and invested capital of what was, in practical effect, a single business enterprise, even though conducted by means of more than one corporation. Primarily, the consolidated return was to preclude reduction of the total tax payable by the business, viewed as a unit, by redistribution of income or capital among the component corporations by means of intercompany transactions. See Handy & Harman v. Burnet, \n284 \nU.S. 136, 140\n, 52 S.Ct. 51; Appeal of Gould Coupler Co., 5 B.T.A. 499, 514-516; cf. Treasury Regulations 41, art. 77; Treasury Regulations 45, art. 631.\n It is not denied that the two corporations became affiliated when respondent acquired all the capital stock of the sales company. But, on the basis of the finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that the sales company was chiefly engaged during 1917 in closing up its business preparatory to formal dissolution, which took place in February, 1918, that all its assets and liabilities were disposed of by the end of 1917, and that it did not do any business after that date, petitioner argues that the affiliation of the two companies was terminated by the liquidation. \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 548]\n\u00a0\n Since complete stock ownership is made the test of affiliation applicable here under article 77 of Treasury Regulations 41 and section 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921, no ground is apparent for saying that the corporations ceased to be affiliated, merely because without change of corporate control, one of them was being liquidated. The findings do not reveal that the liquidation of the sales company was completed, that it ceased to do any business or to function as a corporation before the end of 1917. Neither statute nor regulations recognize that affiliation may be terminated by the mere fact that such liquidation is being carried on, and the reasons for requiring the consolidated return may be quite as valid during that liquidation as before. During that period the unitary character of the business enterprise is not necessarily ended, and intercompany manipulations are not precluded.\n In the present case, even though the affiliation continued, it does not follow as a matter of law that the loss was not rightly deducted in the consolidated return. Section 12, Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 767, governs the computation of the excess profits tax under section 206, Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 305. That section and the regulation under it (see article 147, Treasury Regulations 33 (1918 Ed.)) direct that taxable net income of a corporate taxpayer shall be ascertained by deducting, from gross income, losses sustained within the year. It is conceded that the loss of respondent's advances to the sales company and the investment in its stock was sustained in 1917, was deductible therefore, if at all, in that year, and might properly have been deducted by respondent in a separate return, if a separate return had been permissible. But the government insists that the loss cannot be deducted in the mandatory consolidated return for 1917 because it occurred as the result of 'intercompany' transactions. \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 549]\n\u00a0\n We need not decide whether the loss resulted from intercompany transactions within the meaning of the regulations under later statutes2 which broadly exclude from the consolidated returns profit or loss upon all such transactions. For neither the Revenue Act of 1917, nor section 1331 of the Revenue Act of 1921, nor the regulations under them,3 prescribe specifically the method of making up the consolidated return or require the elimination from the computation of the tax of the results of all intercompany transactions. Article 77 of Treasury Regulations 41 required every corporation to describe in its return 'all its intercorporate relationships with other corporations, with which it is affiliated,' and to 'furnish such information in relation thereto as will enable the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compute the amount of the tax properly due from each corporation on the basis of an equitable and lawful accounting.' Article 78 authorizes the Commissioner to require consolidated returns of affiliated corporations 'wherever necessary to more equitably determine invested capital or taxable income,' and provides that 'the total tax will be computed in the first instance as a unit on the basis of the consolidated return.'\n These provisions plainly do not lay down any rigid rule of accounting to be applied to consolidated returns which would exclude from the computation of taxable income the results of every intercompany transaction, regardless \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 550]\n\u00a0\n of its effect upon the capital or the net gains or losses of the business of the affiliated corporations. Instead, they merely disclose the purpose underlying regulations and statute to prevent, through the exercise of a common power of control, any intercompany manipulation which would distort invested capital or the true income of the unitary business carried on by the affiliated corporations. Hence no method of accounting, in calculating taxable income upon the consolidated return, can be upheld, which would withhold from the taxpayer all benefit of deduction for losses actually sustained and deductible under the sections governing the computation of taxable income, and which at the same time would not further, in some way, the very purpose for which consolidated returns are required.\n Such, we think, is the effect of the method adopted by the Commissioner. The sales company suffered losses during the years 1914, 1915, and 1916 which could not be deducted in its separate returns for those years, because they were net losses, and which could not be deducted from the profits of the parent company because there was no consolidated return in those years. While it may be assumed that those losses affected the value of the stock owned by the parent company, the loss of its investment in the stock of the sales company and in advances to it could not be deducted by the parent company in its separate return for those years because the loss had not then been sustained with such finality as to permit its deduction under the applicable statute and regulations. So far as the loss from operation of the sales company in earlier years contributed to respondent's capital loss in 1917, deduction of the latter in the consolidated return involved no double deduction of losses of the business of the two companies during the period of their affiliation. As respondent's total loss in 1917 was reduced, before deduction in the consolidated return, by the amount of the \n\n[287 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n operating loss of the sales company for that year, there was no duplication of any losses accrued or sustained in that year.\n The loss was a real one, suffered by respondent as a separate corporate entity, and it was equally a loss suffered by the single business carried on by the two corporations during the period of their affiliation, ultimately reflected in the 1917 loss of capital invested in that business. While equitable principles of accounting applied to the calculation of the net income of the business unit do not permit deduction of the loss twice, they do require its deduction once. Hence the loss was deductible in 1917 under the statute and regulations controlling computation of taxable income, and its deduction is not forbidden by the regulations applicable to the consolidated return. Articles 77 and 78 of Treasury Regulations 41 would, indeed, require the elimination of any losses resulting from intercompany transactions, the inclusion of which would defeat the purpose of consolidated returns to tax the true income of the single business of affiliated corporations, calculated by correct accounting methods. The deductions claimed here had no such effect.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Subsequent to 1917, affiliated corporations were required to file such a return for all purposes for any taxable year prior to January 1, 1922 (section 240, Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1081; section 240, Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 260).

Decedent, who died in October, 1924, was a subject of Great Britain and a resident of Cuba. He was not engaged in business in the United States. The property in question consisted of securities, viz., bonds of foreign corporations, bonds of foreign governments, bonds of domestic corporations and of a domestic municipality, and stock in a foreign corporation, and also of a balance of a cash deposit. \n1\n Some of the securities, consisting of a stock certificate and bonds, were in the possession of decedent's son in New York City, who \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n collected the income and placed it to the credit of decedent in a New York bank. Other securities were in the possession of Lawrence Turnure & Co., in New York City, who collected the income and credited it to decedent's checking account, which showed the above-mentioned balance in his favor. None of the securities was pledged or held for any indebtedness. Finding these facts, the Board of Tax Appeals decided that the property should not be included in the decedent's gross estate for the purpose of the federal estate tax (22 B.T.A. 71), and the decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 60 F.(2d) 890. This Court granted certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 222, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The provisions governing the imposition of the tax are found in the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 303-307, and are set forth in the margin. 2 Two questions \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n are presented: (1) Whether the property in question is covered by these provisions; and (2) whether, if construed to be applicable, they are valid under the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The decisions below answered the first question in the negative.\n First. The first question is one of legislative intention. In the case of a nonresident of the United States, that part of the gross estate was to be returned and valued 'which at the time of his death is situated in the United States.' In interpreting this clause, regard must be had to the purpose in view. The Congress was exercising its taxing power. Defining the subject of its exercise, the Congress resorted to a general description referring to the situs of the property. The statute made no distinction between tangible and intangible property. It did not except intangibles. It did not except securities. Save as stated, it did not except debts due to a nonresident from \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n resident debtors. As to tangibles and intangibles alike, it made the test one of situs, and we think it is clear that the reference is to property which, according to accepted principles, could be deemed to have a situs in this country for the purpose of the exertion of the federal power of taxation. Again, so far as the intention of the Congress is concerned, we think that the principles thus impliedly invoked by the statute were the principles theretofore declared and then held. It is quite inadmissible to assume that the Congress exerting federal power was legislating in disregard of existing doctrine, or to view its intention in the light of decisions as to state power which were not rendered until several years later. \n3\n The argument is pressed that the reference to situs must, as to intangibles, be taken to incorporate the principle of mobilia sequunter personam and thus, for example, that the bonds here in question though physically in New York should be regarded as situated in Cuba where decedent resided. But the Congress did not enact a maxim. When the statute was passed it was well established that the taxing power could reach such securities in the view that they had a situs where they were physically located. As securities thus actually present in this country were regarded as having a situs here for the purpose of taxation, we are unable to say that the Congress in its broad description, embracing all property 'situated in the United States,' intended to exclude such securities from the gross estate to be returned and valued.\n The general clause with respect to the property of nonresidents 'situated in the United States' is found in the provisions for an estate tax of the Revenue Act of 1916,  203(b), 39 Stat. 778, and was continued in the Revenue \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n Acts of 1918,  403(b), 40 Stat. 1098; of 1921,  403(b), 42 Stat. 280; and of 1924,  303(b), 26 USCA  1095 note, the provision now under consideration. Before the phrase was used in the act of 1916, this Court, in passing upon questions arising under the inheritance tax law of June 13, 1898,  29, 30 Stat. 464 (in a case where the decedent had left 'certain federal, municipal and corporate bonds' in the custody of his agents in New York), recognized that the property would not have escaped the tax, had it been imposed in apt terms, in the view that the property was intangible and belonged to a nonresident. Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 578, 582\n, 22 S.Ct. 515. While that statute was found to be inapplicable, as the property had not passed, within the limitations of the statute, 'by will or by the intestate laws of any state or territory,' the opinion conceded the power of Congress 'to impose an inheritance tax upon property in this country, no matter where owned or transmitted.' Id., page 592 of 184 U.S., 22 S.Ct. 515, 516, 521. We see no reason to doubt that it was with this conception of its power that the Congress enacted the later provisions for an estate tax in the case of nonresidents. And before the Revenue Act of 1921 was passed, we had stated the principles deemed controlling in De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376\n, 39 S.Ct. 524, 525, in construing the provision of the Income Tax Law of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, imposing a tax upon the net income 'from all property owned ... in the United States by persons residing elsewhere.' The decision was upon a certified question with respect to the income of a citizen and resident of France from stocks, bonds, and mortgages secured upon property in the United States, where the owner's agent in the United States collected and remitted the income and had 'physical possession of the certificates of stock, the bonds and the mortgages.' The Court said: 'The question submitted comes to this: Is the income from the stock, bonds, and mortgages, held by \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 391]\n\u00a0\n the Pennsylvania Company (the agent), derived from property owned in the United States? A learned argument is made to the effect that the stock certificates, bonds, and mortgages are not property, that they are but evidences of the ownership of interests which are property; that the property, in a legal sense, represented by the securities, would exist if the physical evidences thereof were destroyed. But we are of opinion that these refinements are not decisive of the congressional intent in using the term 'property' in this statute. Unless the contrary appears, statutory words are presumed to be used in their ordinary and usual sense, and with the meaning commonly attributable to them. To the general understanding and with the common meaning usually attached to such descriptive terms, bonds, mortgages, and certificates of stock are regarded as property. By state and federal statutes they are often treated as property, not as mere evidences of the interest which they represent.' Having no doubt 'that the securities, herein involved, are property,' the Court proceeded to the question, 'Are they property within the United States? It is insisted that the maxim 'mobilia sequuntur personam' applies in this instance, and that the situs of the property was at the domicile of the owner in France. But this Court has frequently declared that the maxim, a fiction at most, must yield to the facts and circumstances of cases which require it, and that notes, bonds, and mortgages may acquire a situs at a place other than the domicile of the owner, and be there reached by the taxing authority.' Then, describing the location of the certificates of stock, bonds and mortgages in question in the possession of the agent in Philadelphia, the Court concluded that the securities constituted 'property within the United States within the meaning of Congress as expressed in the statute under consideration.' The reference in the state- \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 392]\n\u00a0\n ment of this conclusion to the authority of the agent to sell, invest, and reinvest was by way of emphasis and is not to be taken as importing a necessary qualification. The Court, answered the certified question in the affirmative. Id., pages 380-383 of 250 U.S., 39 S.Ct. 524, 525\n\n\n Under the Revenue Act of 1916, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled 'that Congress has the power and evidenced an intention' in that act 'to impose a tax upon bonds, both foreign and domestic, owned by a non- resident decedent, which bonds are physically situate in the United States,' and that 'such bonds must be returned as a portion of his gross estate.' T.D. 2530. The regulations promulgated by the Treasury Department under the Revenue Act of 1918, interpreting the words 'situated in the United States,' contained the following: 'The situs of property, both real and personal, for the purpose of the tax is its actual situs. Stock in a domestic corporation, and insurance payable by a domestic insurance company, constitute property situated in the United States, although owned by, or payable to, a nonresident. A domestic corporation or insurance company is one created or organized in the United States. Bonds actually situated in the United States, moneys on deposit with domestic banks and moneys due on open accounts by domestic debtors constitute property subject to tax.' Regulations No. 37, art. 60, T.D. 2378, 2910, 3145. This provision, in substance, as to bonds and moneys due (other than insurance moneys and bank deposits which were made the subject of a special statutory provision), was repeated in the regulations under the Revenue Act of 1921, as follows: 'Bonds actually within the United States, moneys due on open accounts by domestic debtors, and stock of a corporation or association created or organized in the United States, constitute property having its situs in the United States.' Regulations No. 63, art. 53, T.D. 3384. We find no ground for questioning the inten- \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 393]\n\u00a0\n tion of the Congress, when in the Revenue Act of 1924 it re-enacted the provision as to the property of nonresidents 'situated in the United States,' to impose the tax with respect to bonds physically within the United States and stock in domestic corporations. Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115.\n The argument is pressed that the regulations above quoted are silent as to stock owned by nonresidents in foreign corporations when the certificates of stock are held within the United States. We think that the omission is inconclusive. It may be more fairly said that the express terms of these regulations did not go far enough, rather than that, so far as they did go, they failed to express the legislative intent. In the view which identifies the property interest with its physical representative, no sufficient reason appears for holding that bonds were intended to be included, and not certificates of stock, if these were physically in the United States at the time of death. See De Ganay v. Lederer, supra; Direction Der Disconto-Gesellschaft v. United States Steel Corporation, \n267 \nU.S. 22, 28\n, 29 S., 45 S.Ct. 207. The regulations adopted under the Revenue Act of 1924 expanded the provision as to the 'situs of property of nonresident decedents' so as to include stock in foreign corporations when the certificates were held here, by providing: 'Real estate within the United States, stocks and bonds physically in the United States at date of death, moneys due on open accounts by domestic debtors, and stock of a corporation or association created or organized in the United States, constitute property having a situs in the United States.' Regulations No. 68, art. 50, T.D. 3683. The Revenue Act of 1926, sec. 303( b), 44 Stat. 73 (26 USCA  1095 note) re-enacted the provision as to property of nonresidents 'situated in the United States,' and the regulation under that act expressly embraces 'certificates of stock, bonds, bills, notes, and mortgages, physically in the United States at date of death' as property 'having a situs in the United States,' \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 394]\n\u00a0\n in addition to the clause relating to stock of domestic corporations. Regulations No. 70, art. 50. And these provisions have been continued. Id. 1929 edition.\n We do not find that the qualifying provisions of sections 303(d) and ( e) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 26 USCA  1095(d, e) are inconsistent with the departmental construction. Section 303(d) provided that 'stock in a domestic corporation owned and held by a nonresident decedent shall be deemed property within the United States.' Respondents point to the absence of a similar provision as to bonds and as to stock in foreign corporations and invoke the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. But the argument seems to prove too much. It is not to be supposed that the Congress intended that stock owned by a nonresident in a domestic corporation, where the certificates of stock were held in the United States, were to be subject to the tax, and that bonds of the same corporation similarly owned and physically in the United States, were to be excepted. See T.D. 2530. We think that the government's construction of the provision is the more reasonable one, that the place where the stock was held was not an element in the application of section 303(d), and that this provision was designed to insure the inclusion of the stock of a domestic corporation in all cases whether the certificates were physically present in the United States or not. Compare Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466, 473\n, 474 S., 25 S.Ct. 297.\n Section 303(e) provided: 'The amount receivable as insurance upon the life of a nonresident decedent, and any moneys deposited with any person carrying on the banking business, by or for a nonresident decedent who was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of his death,' are not to be deemed 'property within the United States.' The Revenue Act of 1918,  403(b)(3), 40 Stat. 1099, had provided that the amount receivable as insurance, where the insurer is a domestic corporation, should be regarded \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 395]\n\u00a0\n as property within the United States, and this was repealed by the substituted provision of the Revenue Act of 1921,  403(b)(3), 42 Stat. 280, to the contrary effect; the latter being carried forward in the Revenue Act of 1924. It is a matter of common knowledge that American life insurance companies were engaged in business abroad, and no clear inference with respect to the question now under consideration may be drawn either from the original provision or from its repeal. \n4\n But the significance of the remaining clause of the act of 1921, re-enacted in 1924, is apparent. This provided for the exclusion from the gross estate of bank deposits in this country, in the circumstances stated; deposits which, as constituting property of nonresidents situated in the United States, had theretofore been subject to the estate tax. \n5\n The Congress evidently thought it necessary to make this express exception, in order to exclude such deposits from the tax, but did not provide any exception with respect to bonds and certificates of stock physically here.\n As to decedent's deposit balance in the instant case, the Board of Tax Appeals did not make an explicit finding that Lawrence Turnure & Co., with whom the decedent had a checking account, was 'carrying on the banking business.' The Board thought that the point was not material. 22 B. T.A. page 87. If that firm was engaged in the banking business, the statute required the exclusion of the deposit balance from the gross estate. As to the securities, in view of the legislative history and departmental construction, we find no basis for holding that the statute, if valid in this application, did not require their inclusion. \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 396]\n\u00a0\n Second. The question of power to lay the tax. As a nation with all the attributes of sovereignty, the United States is vested with all the powers of government necessary to maintain an effective control of international relations. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 711\n, 13 S.Ct. 1016; Knox v. Lee, 12 Wall. 457, 555, 556. 'We should hesitate long,' we said in Mackenzie v. Hare, \n239 \nU.S. 299, 311\n, 36 S.Ct. 106, 108, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 645, 'before limiting or embarrassing such powers.' So far as our relation to other nations is concerned, and apart from any self-imposed constitutional restriction, we cannot fail to regard the property in question as being within the jurisdiction of the United States; that is, it was property within the reach of the power which the United States by virtue of its sovereignty could exercise as against other nations and their subjects without violating any established principle of international law. This view of the scope of the sovereign power in the matter of the taxation of securities physically within the territorial limits of the sovereign is sustained by high authority and is a postulate of legislative action in other countries. The subject was considered by the House of Lords in Winans v. Attorney-General, (1910) A.C. 27. The question was as to the liability to estate duty, under the British Finance Act, 1894, of bonds and certificates when these were physically situated in the United Kingdom at the death of the owner, who was a citizen of the United States and domiciled here. The securities were payable to bearer, marketable on the London Stock Exchange, and passed by delivery. The executors insisted that 'the property did not pass by the law of the United Kingdom but by the law of the deceased's domicile'; that 'the presence in the United Kingdom of the documents of title to the property did not create a liability to estate duty'; that 'all the debtors on the bonds and certificates were at the time of the death and all material times outside the \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 397]\n\u00a0\n United Kingdom and beyond its jurisdiction'; that 'the marketability of a piece of paper in the United Kingdom was not sufficient to make the debt of which it was evidence liable to estate duty'; and that 'the property was not situate in the United Kingdom.' The House of Lords was not convinced by these contentions. The Lord Chancellor observed that 'the property received the full protection of British laws-which is a constant basis of taxation-and can only be transferred from the deceased to other persons by the authority of a British Court.' Id., p. 30. Lord Atkinson referred to the status of the securities under international law. 'Being physically situated in England at the time of their owner's death,' said his Lordship, 'they were subject to English law and the jurisdiction of English courts, and taxes might therefore prima facie be leviable upon them. ... There does not appear, a priori, to be anything contrary to the principles of international law, or hurtful to the polity of nations, in a state's taxing property physically situated within its borders, wherever its owner may have been domiciled at the time of his death.' Id., p. 31. And Lord Shaw of Dunfermline summed up the application of the British acts as follows: 'In the case of an English citizen all his property 'wheresoever situate,' subject to the exception in the act, is aggregated, and into that aggregation-to confine oneself to the matter in hand-all personal property situate out of the United Kingdom must come, unless legacy or succession duty would not have been payable in respect thereof. In the case of the foreign citizen no taxation, of course, falls, except upon property situate within the United Kingdom, and I know no reason either under the law of nations, by the custom of nations, or in the nature of things why property within the jurisdiction of this country, possessed and held under the protection of its laws, should not, upon transfer from \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 398]\n\u00a0\n the dead to the living, pay the same toll which would have been paid by property enjoying the same protection but owned by a deceased British subject.' Id., pp. 47, 48. In this view, the securities were held to be subject to the estate duty. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In Direction Der Disconto-Gesellschaft v. United States Steel Corporation, \n267 \nU.S. 22\n, 45 S.Ct. 207, 208, a somewhat analogous question of jurisdiction arose in relation to the title to shares of stock of an American corporation, which were owned by German corporations, and the certificates of which had been seized in London by the British Public Trustee appointed to be custodian of enemy property during the late war. As was found to be usual with shares which it was desired to deal in abroad, the shares had been registered on the books of the American corporation in the name of an English broker or dealer who had indorsed the certificates in blank. The German corporations had bought the shares and held the certificates in London. Their suit here was to establish title, to cancel outstanding certificates, and to have new certificates issued to them. They based their claim on the proposition that seizure of the certificates in Great Britain did not constitute a seizure of the shares; that the presence of the certificates did not bring the shares within the territorial jurisdiction of Great Britain. This Court took a different view and sustained the title of the British Public Trustee. The Court thus stated the basis of its ruling: 'New Jersey having authorized this corporation like others to issue certificates that so far represent the stock that ordinarily at least no one can get the benefits of ownership except through and by means of the paper, it recognizes as owner anyone to whom the person declared \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 399]\n\u00a0\n by the paper to be owner has transferred it by the indorsement provided for wherever it takes place. It allows an indorsement in blank, and by its law as well as by the law of England an indorsement in blank authorizes anyone who is the lawful owner of the paper to write in a name, and thereby entitle the person so named to demand registration as owner in his turn upon the corporation's books. But the question who is the owner of the paper depends upon the law of the place where the paper is. It does not depend upon the holder's having given value or taking without notice of outstanding claims but upon the things done being sufficient by the law of the place to transfer the title. An execution locally valid is as effectual as an ordinary purchase. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R.R. Co. v. Clarksdale, \n257 \nU.S. 10\n, 42 S.Ct. 27. The things done in England transferred the title to the Public Trustee by English law.' The Court thought it 'so plain that the Public Trustee got a title good as against the plaintiffs by the original seizure' that it was deemed unnecessary to advert to the treaties upon which the Public Trustee also relied or upon the subsequent dealings between England and Germany. Id., pages 28, 29 of 267 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 207, 208.\n As jurisdiction may exist in more than one government, that is, jurisdiction based on distinct grounds-the citizenship of the owner, his domicile, the source of income, the situs of the property-efforts have been made to preclude multiple taxation through the negotiation of appropriate international conventions. These endeavors, however, have proceeded upon express or implied recognition, and not in denial, of the sovereign taxing power as exerted by governments in the exercise of jurisdiction upon any one of these grounds. For many years this subject has been under consideration by international committees of experts and drafts of conventions have been proposed, the advantages of which lie in the mutual concessions or reciprocal restrictions to be voluntarily made or accepted \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 400]\n\u00a0\n by powers freely negotiating on the basis of recognized principles of jurisdiction. \n7\n In its international relations, the United States is as competent as other nations to enter into such negotiations, and to become a party to such conventions, without any disadvantage due to limitation of its sovereign power, unless that limitation is necessarily found to be imposed by its own Constitution.\n Respondents urge that constitutional restriction precluding the federal estate tax in question is found in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The point, being solely one of jurisdiction to tax, involves none of the other considerations raised by confiscatory or arbitrary legislation inconsistent with the fundamental conceptions of justice which are embodied in the due process clause for the protection of life, liberty, and property of all persons; citizens and friendly aliens alike. Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 51 S. Ct. 229; Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 52 A.L.R. 1081; Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 326\n, 52 S.Ct. 358. If in the instant case the federal government had jurisdiction to impose the tax, there is manifestly no ground for assailing it. Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 109\n, 20 S.Ct. 747; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 61\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 153\n, 154 S., 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 39 S.Ct. 214. Respondents' reliance is upon the decisions of this Court with respect to the limitation of the taxing power of the states under the due process \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 401]\n\u00a0\n clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S.Ct. 54; First National Bank of Boston v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 174. They insist that the like clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes a corresponding restriction upon the taxing power of the federal government.\n The argument is specious, but it ignores an established distinction. Due process requires that the limits of jurisdiction shall not be transgressed. That requirement leaves the limits of jurisdiction to be ascertained in each case with appropriate regard to the distinct spheres of activity of state and nation. The limits of state power are defined in view of the relation of the states to each other in the Federal Union. The bond of the Constitution qualifies their jurisdiction. This is the principle which underlies the decisions cited by respondents. These decisions established that proper regard for the relation of the states in our system required that the property under consideration should be taxed in only one state, and that jurisdiction to tax was restricted accordingly. In Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, supra, the Court applied the principle to intangibles, and, referring to the contrary view which had prevailed, said (page 209 of 280 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 98, 99, 65 A.L.R. 1000): 'The inevitable tendency of that view is to disturb good relations among the states and produce the kind of discontent expected to subside after establishment of the Union. The Federalist, No. VII. The practical effect of it has been bad; perhaps two-thirds of the states have endeavored to avoid the evil by resort to reciprocal exemption laws.' It was this 'rule of immunity from taxation by more than one state,' deducible from the decisions in respect of various and distinct kinds of property, that the Court applied in First National Bank v. Maine, supra, page 326 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 174, 176.\n As pointed out in the opinion in the First National Bank Case, the principle has had a progressive application. \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 402]\n\u00a0\n In Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Company v. Kentucky, \n188 \nU.S. 385\n, 23 S.Ct. 463, the question related to a ferry franchise granted by Indiana to a Kentucky corporation which Kentucky attempted to tax. Despite the fact that the tax was laid upon a property right belonging to a domestic corporation, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment precluded the imposition. Id., page 398 of 188 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 463. In Union Refrigerator Transit Company v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493, the principle was applied to the attempted taxation by Kentucky of tangible personal property which was owned by a domestic corporation but had a permanent situs in another state. The Court decided that where tangible personal property had an actual situs in a particular state, the power to subject it to state taxation rested exclusively in that state regardless of the domicile of the owner. By Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A. L.R. 316, the rule became definitely fixed that as to tangible personal property the power to impose a death transfer tax was solely in the state where the property had an actual situs, and could not be exercised by another state where the decedent was domiciled. See First National Bank v. Maine, supra, page 322 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 174. The decision in Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, supra, overruling Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S.Ct. 277, carried forward the principle by applying it to intangibles. The Court was of the opinion that 'the general reasons declared sufficient to inhibit taxation of them (tangibles) by two states apply under present circumstances with no less force to intangibles with taxable situs imposed by due application of the legal fiction. Primitive conditions have passed; business is now transacted on a national scale. A very large part of the country's wealth is invested in negotiable securities whose protection against discrimination, unjust and oppressive taxation, is matter of the greatest moment.' 280 U.S. pages 211, 212, 50 S.Ct. 98, 100, 65 A.L.R. 1000. \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 403]\n\u00a0\n But it has been as decisively maintained that this principle, thus progressively applied in limiting the jurisdiction of the states to tax, does not restrict the taxing power of the federal government. The distinction was clearly and definitely made in United States v. Bennett, \n232 \nU.S. 299\n, 34 S.Ct. 433, 436. The question arose under section 37 of the Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, 36 Stat. 112, imposing a tax upon the use of foreign built yachts, owned or chartered by citizens of the United States. The levy of the tax with respect to a yacht owned by a citizen of the United States, domiciled here, but which was not used within the jurisdiction of the United States and had its permanent situs in a foreign country, was resisted under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The objector invoked the doctrine, already established, which denied to a state, under the Fourteenth Amendment, jurisdiction to tax personal property which had a permanent situs in another state. Union Refrigerator Transit Company v. Kentucky, supra. Under that doctrine, as we have seen, it made no difference that the owner of the property was a citizen of, or domiciled in, the state which attempted to lay the tax. The argument was pressed that the federal statute should not be so construed as to apply to the use of a yacht wholly beyond the territorial limits of the United States, since if so interpreted it would be repugnant to the Constitution. But the Court thought that to apply that rule of interpretation would be to cause 'an imaginary doubt' as to the constitutionality of the statute, and would render it necessary to give the statute 'a wholly fictitious and unauthorized meaning.' We found nothing 'of such gravity in the asserted constitutional question' as to justify departing from the evident legislative intention. Speaking through Chief Justice White, and fully recognizing the principle applicable to the taxing power of the states, the Court observed \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 404]\n\u00a0\n that the argument involved a misapprehension, not as to what had actually been decided, but 'in taking for granted that because the doctrine stated has been applied and enforced in many decisions with respect to the taxing power of the states, that the same principle is applicable to and controlling as to the United States in the exercise of its powers.' 'The confusion results,' the Court continued, 'from not observing that the rule applied in the cases relied upon to many forms of exertion of state taxing power is based on the limitations on state authority to tax resulting from the distribution of powers ordained by the Constitution. In other words, the whole argument proceeds upon the mistaken supposition, which is sometimes indulged in, that the calling into being of the government under the Constitution had the effect of destroying obvious powers of government instead of preserving and distributing such powers. The application to the states of the rule of due process relied upon comes from the fact that their spheres of activity are enforced and protected by the Constitution, and therefore it is impossible for one state to reach out and tax property in another without violating the Constitution, for where the power of the one ends the authority of the other begins.' 'But this,' the Court added, 'has no application to the government of the United States so far as its admitted taxing power is concerned,' for that power 'embraces all the attributes which appertain to sovereignty in the fullest sense. ... Because the limitations of the Constitution are barriers bordering the states and preventing them from transcending the limits of their authority, and thus destroying the rights of other states, and at the same time saving their rights from destruction by the other states, in other words, of maintaining and preserving the rights of all the states, affords no ground for constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 405]\n\u00a0\n around the exterior confines of the United States for the purpose of shutting that government off from the exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by virtue of its sovereignty.' Id., pages 305, 306 of 232 U.S ., 34 S.Ct. 433, 437.\n This distinction between the limitations of state jurisdiction to tax and the broad authority of the federal government, was restated and applied in Cook v. Tait, \n265 \nU.S. 47, 55\n, 56 S., 44 S.Ct. 444, and was again explicitly recognized in Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, page 491 of 268 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316.\n The distinction cannot be regarded as limited to tangible property. It has equal application to intangibles. It does not rest upon the question whether the property is of the one sort or the other, but upon the fact that the limitation of state jurisdiction to tax does not establish the limitation of federal jurisdiction to tax. If the federal government may rest its jurisdiction to lay its tax upon the fact of the citizenship and domicile in this country of the owner of tangible property, wherever that property may be situated, although the state may not impose a like tax with respect to property having a permanent location outside the state, the federal government cannot be regarded as restrained in its power to tax securities owned by a nonresident, but physically in this country, merely because the state is debarred from laying such a tax with respect to a nonresident of the state. The decisive point is that the criterion of state taxing power by virtue of the relation of the states to each other under the Constitution is not the criterion of the taxing power of the United States by virtue of its sovereignty in relation to the property of nonresidents. The Constitution creates no such relation between the United States and foreign countries as it creates between the states themselves.\n Accordingly, in what has been said, we in no way limit the authority of our decisions as to state power. We \n\n[288 U.S. 378, 406]\n\u00a0\n determine national power in relation to other countries and their subjects by applying the principles of jurisdiction recognized in international relations. Applying those principles we cannot doubt that the Congress had the power to enact the statute, as we have construed and applied it to the property in question. The securities should be included in the gross estate of the decedent; the inclusion of the balance of the cash deposit will depend, under the statute, upon the finding to be made with respect to the nature of the business of the concern with which the deposit was made.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER is of opinion that the statute does not extend to the transfer of the foreign or other securities effected by the death of decedent, Ernest Augustus Brooks, a British subject resident of, and dying in, Cuba, and that the conclusions of the Board of Tax Appeals and Circuit Court of Appeals are right, and should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The property was scheduled as follows: \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 301.

GUGGENHEIM(1933)\nNo. 283\nArgued: January 11, 1933Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Elihu Root, Jr., of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question to be decided is whether deeds of trust made in 1917, with a reservation to the grantor of a power of revocation, became taxable as gifts under the Revenue Act of 1924 when in 1925 there was a change of the deeds by the cancellation of the power.\n On June 28, 1917, the respondent, a resident of New York, executed in New Jersey two deeds of trust, one for the benefit of his son, and one for the benefit of his daughter. The trusts were to continue for ten years, during which period part of the income was to be paid to the \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n beneficiary and part accumulated. At the end of the ten-year period, the principal and the accumulated income were to go to the beneficiary, if living; if not living, then to his or her children; and, if no children survived, then to the settlor in the case of the son's trust, and in the case of the daughter's trust to the trustees of the son's trust as an increment to the fund. The settlor reserved to himself broad powers of control in respect of the trust property and its investment and administration. In particular, there was an unrestricted power to modify, alter, or revoke the trusts except as to income, received or accrued. The power of investment and administration was transferred by the settlor from himself to others in May, 1921. The power to modify, alter, or revoke was eliminated from the deeds, and thereby canceled and surrendered, in July, 1925\n\n\n In the meanwhile Congress had passed the Revenue Act of 1924 which included among its provisions of tax upon gifts. 'For the calendar year 1924 and each calendar year thereafter ... a tax ... is hereby imposed upon the transfer by a resident by gift during such calendar year of any property wherever situated, whether made directly or indirectly,' the tax to be assessed in accordance with a schedule of percentages upon the value of the property. 43 Stat. 253, 313, c. 234,  319, 320, 26 U.S. Code,  1131, 1132 (26 USCA  1131 note, 1132 note).\n At the date of the cancellation of the power of revocation, the value of the securities constituting the corpus of the two trusts was nearly $13, 000,000. Upon this value the Commissioner assessed against the donor a tax of $2,465,681, which the Board of Tax Appeals confirmed with a slight modification due to a mistake in computation. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which reversed the decision of the Board and held the gift exempt. 58 F.(2d) 188. The case is here on certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 587\n, 53 S.Ct. 85, 77 L.Ed. --. \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n On November 8, 1924, more than eight months before the cancellation of the power of revocation, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, adopted and promulgated the following regulation: 'The creation of a trust where the grantor retains the power to revest in himself title to the corpus of the trust, does not constitute a gift subject to tax, but the annual income of the trust which is paid over to the beneficiaries shall be treated as a taxable gift for the year in which so paid. Where the power retained by the grantor to revest in himself title to the corpus is not exercised, a taxable transfer will be treated as taking place in the year in which such power is terminated.' Regulations 67, article I.\n The substance of this regulation has now been carried forward into the Revenue Act of 1932, which will give the rule for later transfers. Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169, 245,  501(c), 26 USCA  1136a( c).1\n We think the regulation, and the later statute continuing it, are declaratory of the law which Congress meant to establish in 1924.\n'Taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxed-the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.' Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376, 378\n, 50 S.Ct. 336; Cf. Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225; Tyler v. United States, \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758; Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74; Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 225. While the powers of revocation stood uncanceled in the deeds, the gifts, from the point of view of substance, were inchoate and imperfect. By concession there would have been no gift in any aspect if the donor had attempted to attain the same result by the mere delivery of the securities into the hands of the donees. A power of revocation accompanying delivery would have made the gift a nullity. Basket v. Hassell, \n107 \nU.S. 602\n, 2 S.Ct. 415. By the execution of deeds and the creation of trusts, the settlor did indeed succeed in divesting himself of title and transferring it to others (Stone v. Hackett, 12 Gray (Mass.) 227; Van Cott v. Prentice, 104 N.Y. 45, 10 N.E. 257; National Newark & Essex Banking Co. v. Rosahl, 97 N.J. Eq. 74, 128 A. 586; Jones v. Clifton, \n101 U.S. 225\n), but the substance of his dominion was the same as if these forms had been omitted (Corliss v. Bowers, supra). He was free at any moment, with reason or without, to revest title in himself, except as to any income then collected or accrued. As to the principal of the trusts and as to income to accrue thereafter, the gifts were formal and unreal. They acquired substance and reality for the first time in July, 1925, when the deeds became absolute through the cancellation of the power.\n\n The argument for the respondent is that Congress in laying a tax upon transfers by gift made in 1924 or in any year thereafter had in mind the passing of title, not the extinguishment of dominion. In that view the transfer had been made in 1917 when the deeds of trust were executed. The argument for the government is that what was done in 1917 was preliminary and tentative, and that not till 1925 was there a transfer in the sense that must have been present in the mind of Congress when laying a burden upon gifts. Petitioner and respondent are at one in the view that from the extinguishment of the power there came about a change of legal rights and a shifting \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n of economic benefits which Congress was at liberty, under the Constitution, to tax as a transfer effected at that time. Chase National Bank v. United States, supra; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra; Tyler v. United States, supra; Corliss v. Bowers, supra. The question is not one of legislative power. It is one of legislative intention.\n With the controversy thus narrowed, doubt is narrowed too. Congress did not mean that the tax should be paid twice, or partly at one time and partly at another. If a revocable deed of trust is a present transfer by gift, there is not another transfer when the power is extinguished. If there is not a present transfer upon the delivery of the revocable deed, then there is such a transfer upon the extinguishment of the power. There must be a choice, and a consistent choice, between the one date and the other. To arrive at a decision, we have therefore to put to ourselves the question, Which choice is it the more likely that Congress would have made? Let us suppose a revocable transfer made on June 3, 1924, the day after the adoption of the Revenue Act of that year. Let us suppose a power of revocation still uncanceled, or extinguished years afterwards, say in 1931. Did Congress have in view the present payment of a tax upon the full value of the subject-matter of this imperfect and inchoate gift? The statute provides that, upon a transfer by gift, the tax upon the value shall be paid by the donor, 43 Stat. 316, c. 234,  324, and shall constitute a lien upon the property transferred, 43 Stat. c. 234,  324, 315 (26 USCA  1136 note, and  1115 and note). By the act now in force, the personal liability for payment extends to the donee. Act of June 6, 1932, c. 209,  510, 47 Stat. 249 (26 USCA  1136j). A statute will be construed in such a way as to avoid unnecessary hardship when its meaning is uncertain. Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 23 S.Ct. 787; Sorrells v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 435\n, 53 S.Ct. 210. Hardship there plainly is in exacting the immediate payment of a tax upon the value of the principal when nothing has been \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n done to give assurance that any part of the principal will ever go to the donee. The statute is not aimed at every transfer of the legal title without consideration. Such a transfer there would be if the trustees were to hold for the use of the grantor. It is aimed at transfers of the title that have the quality of a gift, and a gift is not consummate until put beyond recall.\n The respondent invokes the rule that in the construction of a taxing act doubt is to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179\n, 44 S.Ct. 69, 29 A.L.R. 1547; Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151\n, 38 S.Ct. 53. There are many facets to such a maxim. One must view them all, if one would apply it wisely. The construction that is liberal to one taxpayer may be illiberal to others. One must strike a balance of advantage. It happens that the taxpayer before us made his deeds in 1917, before a transfer by gift was subject to a tax. We shall alleviate his burden if we say that the gift was then complete. On the other hand, we shall be heightening the burdens of taxpayers who made deeds of gift after the act of 1924. In making them, they had the assurance of a treasury regulation that the tax would not be laid, while the power of revocation was uncanceled, except upon the income paid from year to year. They had good reason to suppose that the tax upon the principal would not be due until the power was extinguished or until the principal was paid. If we disappoint their expectations, we shall be illiberal to them.\n The tax upon gifts is closely related both in structure and in purpose to the tax upon those transfers that take effect at death. What is paid upon the one is in certain circumstances a credit to be applied in reduction of what will be due upon the other, 43 Stat. 315,  322, 26 U.S. C.  1134 (26 USCA  1134 and note). The gift tax is part 2 of title 3 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (see 26 USCA  1131 note et seq.); the estate tax is part 1 of the same title (see 26 USCA  1091 et seq.). The two statutes are plainly in pari materia. There has been a steady widening of the concept of a transfer for the purpose of taxation under the provisions of part 1. \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n Tyler v. United States, supra; Chase National Bank v. United States, supra; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra; cf. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473. There is little likelihood that the lawmakers meant to narrow the concept, and to revert to a construction that would exalt the form above the substance, in fixing the scope of a transfer for the purposes of part 2. We do not ignore differences in precision of definition between the one part and the other. They cannot obscure identities more fundamental and important. The tax upon estates, as it stood in 1924, was the outcome of a long process of evolution; it had been refined and perfected by decisions and amendments almost without number. The tax on gifts was something new. Even so, the concept of a transfer, so painfully developed in respect of taxes on estates, was not flung aside and scouted in laying this new burden upon transfers during life. Congress was aware that what was of the essence of a transfer had come to be identified more nearly with a change of economic benefits than with technicalities of title. The word had gained a new color, the result, no doubt in part, of repeated changes of the statutes, but a new color none the less. Cf. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S.Ct. 158, L.R.A. 1918D, 254; Int. Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19; Gooch v. Oregon Short Line Co., \n258 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 42 S.Ct. 192; Hawks v. Hamill, \n288 \nU.S. 52\n, 53 S.Ct. 240.\n The respondent finds comfort in the provisions of section 302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1094 note), governing taxes on estates. 2 \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n He asks why such a provision should have been placed in part 1 and nothing equivalent inserted in part 2, if powers for purposes of the one tax were to be treated in the same way as powers for the purposes of the other. Section 302(d) of the act of 1924 is in part a re-enactment of a section of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, though it has been changed in particulars. 40 Stat. 1097, c. 18,  402(c); 42 Stat. 227, c. 136,  402(c ). Cf. Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397. It is an outcome of that process of development which has given us a rule for almost every imaginable contingency in the assessment of a tax under the provisions of part 1. No doubt the draftsman of the statute would have done well if he had been equally explicit in the drafting of part 2. This is not to say that meaning has been lost because extraordinary foresight would have served to make it clearer. Here as so often there is a choice between uncertainties. We must be content to choose the lesser. To lay the tax at once, while the deed is subject to the power, is to lay it on a gift that may never become consummate in any real or beneficial sense. To lay it later on is to unite benefit with burden. We think the voice of Congress has ordained that this be done.\n Precedents are cited as opposed to our conclusion. We find none of them decisive.\n United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257\n, 41 S.Ct. 256, 18 A.L.R. 1461, holds that under the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 777, c. 463), the subject of a power created by another is not a part of the estate of the decedent to whom the power was committed. It does not hold that a revocable conveyance inter vivos is a perfected transfer by gift that will justify the immediate imposition of a tax upon the value. There was no such question in the case. \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n Jones v. Clifton, \n101 U.S. 225\n, holds that a power of revocation in a deed of conveyance from a husband to his wife does not avail without more to invalidate the transaction as one in fraud of creditors. A transfer within the meaning of a taxing act may or may not be one within the statute of Elizabeth.\n We are referred to cases in the state courts, from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In re Dolan's Estate, 279 Pa. 582, 124 A. 176, 49 A.L.R. 858; In re Hall's Estate, 99 N.J. Law, 1, 125 A. 246. In neither did the court decide that a conveyance inter vivos was taxable as a present gift when the conveyance was subject to revocation at the pleasure of the grantor. No such statute was involved. In each the ruling was that upon the death of the grantor the subject of the conveyance was not taxable as part of his estate, and hence not taxable at all. The ruling might have been different if a choice had been necessary between taxing the conveyance, or its subject, while the power was outstanding, and taxing it later on. New channels of thought cut themselves under the drive of a dilemma.\n A decision of the Court of Claims, Means v. United States, 39 F.(2d) 748, 69 Ct.Cl. 539, upholds the contention of the government that within the meaning of the act of Congress the termination by a settlor of the power to revoke a trust is a transfer of the property and as such subject to taxation.\n The argument for the respondent, if pressed to the limit of its logic, would carry him even farther than he has claimed the right to go. If his position is sound that a power to revoke does not postpone for the purpose of taxation the consummation of the gift, then the income of these trusts is exempt from the tax as fully as the principal. What passed to the beneficiaries was the same in either case, an interest inchoate and contingent till rendered absolute and consummate through receipt or accrual before the act of revocation. Congress did not mean that \n\n[288 U.S. 280, 290]\n\u00a0\n recurring installments of the income, payable under a revocable conveyance which had been made by a settlor before the passage of this statute, should be exempt, when collected, from the burden of the tax.\n The judgment is\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the termination of the donor's power of revocation was not a transfer by gift of any property within the meaning of the statute, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 501(c): 'The tax shall not apply to a transfer of property in trust where the power to revest in the donor title to such property is vested in the donor, either alone or in conjunction with any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such property or the income therefrom, but the relinquishment or termination of such power (other than by the donor's death) shall be considered to be a transfer by the donor by gift of the property subject to such power, and any payment of the income therefrom to a beneficiary other than the donor shall be considered to be a transfer by the donor of such income by gift.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By section 302(d), the gross estate of a decedent is to be taken as including the subject of any trust which he has created during life 'where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or revoke, or where the decedent relinquished any such power in contemplation of his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth.'\n By section 302(h), 26 USCA  1094 note, the foregoing subdivision (d), as well as many others, is declared to 'apply to the transfers, trusts, estates interests, rights, powers, and relinquishment of powers, as severally enumerated and described therein whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised or relinquished before or after (the enactment of this act).' \n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v. HUFF(1933)\nNo. 58\nArgued: December 6, 1932Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 156, 157]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Paul D. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry C. Weeks, of Wichita Falls, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In computing net income for 1920, the respondents, R. E. Huff, and his wife, E. B. Huff (now deceased), sought deduction of a loss alleged to have been sustained in that year, in relation to community property, through the embezzlement of trust funds. The funds were held by a partnership of which R. E. Huff was a member and were embezzled by his copartner. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, holding that as the funds were not the property of the petitioners, and they were not called upon to make good the amount embezzled until 1921, they sustained no loss in 1920. The Board of Tax Appeals, upon the authority of Farish v. Commissioner (C.C.A.8th) 31 F.(2d) 79, upheld this ruling. An alternative claim, for the deduction of the amount in question as a worthless debt, was also disallowed. 20 B.T.A. 516. The Circuit Court of Appeals, declining to \n\n[288 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n follow the Farish Case, reversed the decision of the Board (56 F.(2d) 788), and this Court granted certiorari, \n286 \nU.S. 541\n, 52 S.Ct. 645\n\n\n The pertinent facts as found by the Board of Tax Appeals are these: R. E. Huff, a lawyer and banker in Wichita Falls, Texas, and J. S. Mabry were copartners engaged in managing the business of a reciprocal fire insurance association known as Wichita Great Western Underwriters. Under the plan of organization, 25 per cent. of the gross premium income of the association was allotted to expenses and profits, and the remaining 75 per cent. was to be set apart as a reserve to pay fire losses. Any person might become an 'underwriter' by subscribing to the association such amount as he wished to invest, paying one-fourth in cash. Ten per cent. of the cash payment was allowed to the managing attorneys and the rest constituted a reserve or trust fund which was to remain the property of the underwriters and to be used only for the payment of fire losses in excess of the association's reserve. An advisory board was created from safeguarding the interests of the subscribers but undertook no active supervision until about the end of 1920. The board looked to Huff for the proper conduct of the affairs of the association, but the management was left almost entirely to Mabry. Early in 1920, on Mabry's representation that the sum of $25,000 was needed for working capital, Huff advanced this amount to the partnership upon partnership notes payable in six months. The entire amount was repaid to Huff in the autumn of 1920 by checks drawn by Mabry, the money being taken from the trust fund of the association held in reserve for the subscribing underwriters. Huff and Mabry were not the owners of that fund and neither of them had authority to use it for any purpose other than the payment of fire losses. To cover the checks, given to repay Huff, Mabry gave a demand note signed in the firm name in favor of the reserve fund. Mabry had no authority to execute the note and Huff did not know until near the end of 1920 \n\n[288 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n that the note had been given or that the repayment to him had not been made from funds belonging to the firm. The unauthorized use of the trust fund was discovered, in the absence of Mabry, in December, 1920. On Mabry's return in January, 1921, he was removed as one of the managing attorneys and the firm then discontinued business. Mabry promised to pay back the money he had taken but did not do so, and a judgment against him would have been worthless. Huff was unable to determine the amount of the assets of the firm of Huff & Mabry before the close of 1920, and in February, 1921, these assets, amounting to $3,228.65, were turned over by Huff to the association, together with $21,771.35 which he paid personally. He has not been reimbursed. Huff kept no regular books of account and made up his income tax returns upon a cash receipts and disbursements basis.\n First. The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057, 1066, 1067) provided for the deduction of losses incurred 'in trade or business' or 'in any transaction entered into for profit,' or arising from theft of property 'not connected with the trade or business,' when the losses were 'sustained during the taxable year' and were 'not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.' Sections 214(a)(4-6).\n The Government concedes that if assets of the taxpayer used in trade or business, or 'in any transaction entered into for profit,' are stolen in any year, the taxpayer sustains the loss in that year and the deduction must then be taken even though the theft is not discovered or the amount ascertained until the following year. This is said to be the import of the regulation adopted by the Treasury Department under the Revenue Act of 1921. Regulations No. 45, art. 111.1 But the Government contends \n\n[288 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n that a different rule applies (at least where the taxpayer is on a cash basis) when the property stolen is not that of the taxpayer but is held by him in trust, and the theft is not discovered until the following year, as in that case 'the taxpayer, being nothing out of pocket, cannot be said to have 'sustained' the loss in the year of the theft.' The Government also raises the question whether Huff, in the absence of a finding of negligence, or of improper delegation of the administration of the trust to Mabry, can be regarded as legally bound to make restitution. Respondents insist that Huff was 'liable for the trust funds' from the moment they were received by his firm, and that the loss was sustained at the time of the embezzlement because it deprived him of assets with which he could have discharged his obligation.\n We find it unnecessary to discuss the question whether Huff was bound to make good the amount taken from the funds of the association by his copartner. We may assume that he was. But the mere existence of liability is not enough to establish a deductible loss. There is liability in the case of a breach of contract, but as the Court said in Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 450\n, 50 S.Ct. 202, 203, 'even an unquestionable breach does not result in loss, if the injured party forgives or refrains from prosecuting his claim.' And whether a taxpayer will actually sustain a loss through embezzlement of trust funds of which he is trustee will depend upon a variety of circumstances. If there is liability on his part for the misappropriation, it does not create a certainty of loss, as the defalcation may be made good by the one who caused it, \n\n[288 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n or the liability of the taxpayer may be enforced only to a limited extent or not at all. The requirement that losses be deducted in the year in which they are sustained calls for a practical test. The loss 'must be actual and present.' Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 335\n, 49 S.Ct. 337; Lucas v. American Code Co., supra; Eckert v. Burnet, \n283 U.S. 140\n 141, 142, 51 S.Ct. 373.\n The instant case aptly illustrates the importance of this principle and calls for its application. Huff himself received the entire amount embezzled. He received this amount in payment of notes given to him by his firm to cover his advances to the firm. If he was liable to restore the amount taken from the trust fund, he himself had the full sum that was to be restored. So far as his individual estate was concerned, he had lost nothing by the embezzlement. If Huff had learned of the embezzlement immediately upon the payment to him and had at once restored the entire amount to the trust fund, he would have been in the same position as that in which he was before he received the money; that is, he would have held the partnership notes, for his advances to the partnership, which had not been properly discharged. Huff's personal wealth would have remained the same as it was prior to the embezzlement, and his individual gains or losses would have turned not upon the embezzlement but upon the result of the partnership business. When in 1921, on the liquidation of that business, Huff turned over to the association the sum of $21,771.35, he was merely restoring part of what he himself had received of the misappropriated fund, and whatever loss he sustained was upon his investment in, or his advances to, his firm. That loss was determinable only through the winding up of the partnership business.\n The result of the partnership transactions was not known and could not be ascertained in 1920. The firm did not discontinue business until January, 1921. The \n\n[288 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n finding is explicit that 'some collections from premiums were made in January and February, 1921' and 'Huff was unable to determine the amount of Huff & Mabry's assets before the close of 1920.' In February, 1921, the firm assets were found to amount to $3,228.65 and this sum was paid to the association, with the amount paid by Huff as above stated. Upon these facts we find no basis for the conclusion that Huff sustained a deductible loss in 1920.\n Second. The respondents make an alternative claim upon the ground that the amount due Huff by his firm was a debt 'ascertained to be worthless' and hence deductible under section 214(a)(7) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 240). This claim was not passed upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but it was considered and rejected, properly as we think, by the Board of Tax Appeals. The facts as found show that the results of the firm's business were not known prior to 1921 and that no portion of the debt was ascertained to be worthless within the preceding taxable year.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 111 of Regulations No. 45 provides: 'A loss from theft or embezzlement occurring in one year and discovered in another is deductible only for the year of its occurrence. ... If subsequently to its occurrence, however, a taxpayer first ascertains the amount of a loss sustained during a prior taxable year which has not been deducted from gross income, he may render an amended return for such preceding taxable year, including such amount of loss in the deductions from gross income, and may file a claim for refund of the excess tax paid by reason of the failure to deduct such loss in the original return.'

The point now in controversy has relation to the distribution for taxation of income derived from sales on the installment plan of two pieces of real estate on Eighty-Second and Eighty-Third streets, New York City. Each was covered by one or more mortgages which the purchaser assumed. \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 409]\n\u00a0\n The Revenue Act 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 23, 39, 41,  230 (26 USCA  981 note), lays a tax upon the net income of corporations. Section 232 (26 USCA  984) provides: 'In the case of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 981 of this title (230) the term 'net income' means the gross income as defined in section 985(233) less the deductions allowed by sections 986(234) and 937(206), and the net income shall be computed on the same basis as is provided in subdivisions (b) and (d) of section 953( 212) or in section 968(226).'\n Sec. 212 '(b) The net income shall be computed ... in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but ... if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made in accordance with such method as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income. ...\n'(d) Under regulations prescribed by the commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property on the installment plan may return as income therefrom in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the total profit realized or to be realized when the payment is completed, bears to the total contract price. In the case (1) of a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property for a price exceeding $1,000, or (2) of a sale or other disposition of real property, if in either case the initial payments do not exceed one-fourth of the purchase price, the income may, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, be returned on the basis and in the manner above prescribed in this subdivision. As used in this subdivision the term 'initial payments' means the payments received in cash or property other than evidences of indebtedness of the purchaser during the taxable period in which the sale or other disposition is made.'

'The provisions of subdivision (d) of section 953 of this title (212) shall be retroactively applied in computing income under the provisions of ... the Revenue Act of 1924. ...' (26 USCA  953a).\n\n Treasury Regulations 69, Article 44, promulgated August 28, 1926-as amended in 1929:-\n'Art. 44. Sale of Real Property Involving Deferred Payments.-Under section 212(d) deferred-payment sales of real property fall into two classes when considered with respect to the terms of sale, as follows: (1) Sales of property on the installment plan, that is, sales in which the payments received in cash or property other than evidences of indebtedness of the purchaser during the taxable year in which the sale is made do not exceed one-fourth of the purchase price.\n\n'(2) Deferred-payment sales not on the installment plan, that is, sales in which the payments received in cash or property other than evidences of indebtedness of the purchaser during the taxable year in which the sale is made exceed one-fourth of the purchase price.\n\n'Sales falling within class (1) and class (2) alike include (a) agreements of purchase and sale which contemplate that a conveyance is not to be made at the outset, but only after all or a substantial portion of the purchase price has been paid, and (b) sales where there is an immediate transfer of title, the vendor being protected by a mortgage or other lien as to deferred payments.\n\n'In the sale of mortgaged property the amount of the mortgage, whether the property is merely taken subject to the mortgage or whether the mortgage is assumed by the purchaser, shall be included as a part of the 'purchase price,' but the amount of the mortgage, to the extent it does not exceed the basis to the vendor of the property sold, shall not be considered as a part of the 'initial payments' or of the 'total contract price,' as those terms are used in section 212(d), in articles 42 and \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 411]\n\u00a0\n 45, and in this article. Commissions and other selling expenses paid or incurred by the vendor are not to be deducted or taken into account in determining the amount of the 'initial payments,' the 'total contract price,' or the 'purchase price.'\n\n'Art. 45. Sale of Real Property on Installment Plan.-In transactions included in class (1) in article 44, the vendor may return as income from such transactions in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the total profit realized or to be realized when the property is paid for bears to the total contract price.'\n\n In 1924 respondent sold the Eighty-Second street property then under mortgage which it had executed to secure a loan of $1,100,000, payable in semiannual installments of $22,000 until 1933 when the balance would become due. The purchaser assumed the mortgage, paid $300,000 in cash, agreed to pay $700,000, and secured this by a purchase-money mortgage. Upon the latter mortgage $30,000 was paid in 1924 and $36,250 in 1925. In 1924 and 1925, respectively, the purchaser paid upon the assumed mortgage $ 22,000 and $24,000.\n The Commissioner estimated the depreciated cost of the property at.$1, 541,323.48. Subtracting this from the total sale price, $2,100,000, he ascertained realized profit, $558,676.52.\n He ruled that for 1924 the taxable sum was the same proportion of the amount actually received during the year ($330,000) as the entire profit ($ 558,676.52) was of the total ($1,000,000) payable directly to the taxpayer, 55 per cent. plus. He excluded the assumed mortgage from the total used for determining the applicable percentage and held 'total contract price' was what the purchaser agreed to pay directly to the vendor; the whole amount which the taxpayer expected to receive in money.\n Payments received by respondent during 1925 were likewise assessed. \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 412]\n\u00a0\n In 1925 respondent sold the Eighty-Third street property then subject to two mortgages which it had executed to secure loans of $1,100,000 and $ 500,000 respectively, payable in installments, six and three months, until 1933 and 1934 when the balance would become due. The purchaser assumed both mortgages, paid $300,000 in cash, and agreed to pay $265,000, and secured this by a purchase-money mortgage. On the latter obligation $2,000 was paid in 1925. During 1925 the purchaser paid on the assumed second mortgage $22,500.\n The Commissioner fixed the depreciated cost of the property at $1,522, 035. Subtracting this from the total sale price, $2,165,000, he found the realized profit, $642,967. He ruled that the difference ($77,967) between the base or depreciated cost ($1,522,033) and the total of the assumed mortgages ($1,600,000) should be treated as if received in money by the taxpayer during 1925; also, that the sum subject to taxation in 1925 was the same proportion of what the taxpayer received, actually and constructively, during the year ($302,000 plus $77,967) as the realized profit ($642,967) was of the total amount ($565,000) which the purchaser agreed to pay directly to the taxpayer, 100 per cent. plus.\n He excluded the amount of the assumed mortgages from the totals used to determine the applicable percentage and payments on them were not regarded as received by the vendor. He also treated as if cash received by the vendor in 1925 the difference between the depreciated cost and the total of the assumed mortgages. 'Total contract price' was held to be the total amount payable directly to the vendor.\n The respondent maintains that the assumed mortgages should be regarded as part of the contract price, and payments upon them by the purchaser should be treated as money received by the vendor. In this way it is said \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 413]\n\u00a0\n the tax would be spread over the entire life of the assumed mortgage. And it further insists that the excess of the assumed mortgages over the depreciated value of the Eighty-Third street property should not be regarded as if money actually received by the vendor during 1925\n\n\n Respondent's books were kept upon the accrual basis; but all agree that in the circumstances the Revenue Act of 1926 permitted assessments upon the installment basis. The Commissioner undertook to act according to his prescribed regulations.\n Prior to the act of 1926, the Revenue Acts definitely recognized only two bases for tax returns; cash and accrual. Where sales were upon the installment plan, application of either of these bases led to hardship; payment of the total tax on ascertained profit was often required in a single year. By regulations the Commissioner offered some alleviation; the vendor was allowed to distribute the profit through the years during which purchase money was actually received. The general principal underlying these regulations was to make division of partial payments and apply part as return of capital and part to profit. In 1926 the Board of Tax Appeals disapproved of the earlier regulations and pointed out that the statutes permitted returns only upon the cash or accrual basis. Thereupon, Congress enacted section 212(d), above quoted. The end in view was to permit the Commissioner to make assessments according to the general principle theretofore followed under regulations deemed appropriate to the varying situations. The new plan was optional; taxpayers were allowed to elect whether to make returns under the regulations upon the new basis or upon one of the old bases.\n The Conference Report to the House, on Revenue Act of 1926, p. 32, House Reports, volume I, 69th Congress, 1st Session, 1925-1926, declares concerning section 212(d): 'This amendment \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 414]\n\u00a0\n writes into the bill the basic principles of the installment method authorized by prior regulations.' See Report Senate Committee on Finance, No. 52, 69th Congress.\n Installment sales of real estate incumbered by liens give rise to many complications which Congress could not readily foresee. Accordingly, it intrusted to the Commissioner wide discretion in respect of details. And considering the practical requirements of the taxing system, we think the regulations now challenged constitute a fair attempt to effectuate the legislative intent. They are within the broad discretion granted to the Commissioner, and violate no definite provision of the statute.\n The amounts which respondent realized as profits are not in question. These were subject to taxation either upon the accrual basis or at the taxpayer's option on the installment basis. Generally, the Commissioner's regulations permitted the tax payments to be spread over the period during which the taxpayer would receive funds, and divided these partly into return of capital and partly into profits actually collected. The method suggested by the respondent would inevitably lead to many practical difficulties, might postpone collection far beyond the time when the vendor would receive any direct payments; and probably would render impossible determination from the taxpayer's books of what he should account for.\n The Commissioner's treatment of the excess of the mortgages on the Eighty-Third street property over the base cost followed the general purpose to place reasonable limitation upon the spread of the tax. It was appropriate in the unusual circumstances presented; certainly not prohibited. It was a practical way to accomplish the end. Some possible departure from the method prescribed for ordinary circumstances is not enough to destroy what he deemed necessary to meet unusual conditions.\n The excess of $77,967 under the sale agreement would never actually come into the vendor's hands, but it rep- \n\n[288 U.S. 406, 415]\n\u00a0\n resented part of the admitted profits and was subject to taxation. No positive provision in the statute required that it be spread over subsequent years, and we think there was nothing illegal or oppressive in treating this as if an actual payment. The taxpayer has been treated more leniently than if required to report upon the accrual basis. The Regulations were not contrary to any positive provisions of the statute and, as said by the Board of Tax Appeals, were 'both equitably and legally sound.'\n Since 1926, the Board has consistently upheld the Commissioner's regulations as to profits on installment sales.

And the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932 substantially re-enacted the pertinent provision of the act of 1926.\n The Commissioner and Board of Tax Appeals have practical knowledge of the intricate details incident to tax problems, and their determination in circumstances like those under consideration here should be given effect when not clearly contrary to the will of Congress.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v. WELLS(1933)\nNo. 792\nArgued: May 9, 1933Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 670, 671]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General andMr. Erwin W. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. James S.Y. Ivins, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 670, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Income of a trust has been reckoned by the taxing officers of the government as income to be attributed to \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 673]\n\u00a0\n the creator of the trust in so far as it has been applied to the maintenance of insurance on his life. Section 216(h) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 (26 USCA  960 note) permits this to be done. The question is whether as applied to this case the acts are constitutional.\n On December 30, 1922, the respondent, Frederick B. Wells, created three trusts, referred to in the record as Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and on August 6, 1923, two additional ones, Nos. 4 and 5, all five being irrevocable.\n By trust No. 1, he assigned certain shares of stock of the par value of $10,000 to the Minneapolis Trust Company as trustee. The income of the trust was to be used to pay the annual premiums upon a policy of insurance for $100,000 on the life of the grantor. After the payment of the premiums, the excess income, if any, was to be accumulated until an amount sufficient to pay an additional annual premium had been reserved. Any additional income was, in the discretion of the trustee, to be paid to a daughter. Upon the death of the grantor, the trustee was to collect the policy, and with the proceeds was to buy securities belonging to the Wells estate amounting to $100,000 at their appraised value. The securities so purchased, which were a substitute for the cash proceeds of the policy, were to be held as part of the trust during the life of the daughter, who was to receive the income. On her death the trust was to end, and the corpus was to be divided as she might appoint by her will, and, in default of appointment or issue, to the grantor's sons.\n The other trusts carried out very similar plans, though for the use of other beneficiaries. Thus, trust No. 2 had in view the preservation of a policy of life insurance which was to be held when collected for the use of one Lindstrom, said to be a kinswoman. Trust No. 3 was directed to the maintenance of four policies of insurance for named beneficiaries, three of them relatives of the \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 674]\n\u00a0\n grantor and one a valued employee, who later became his wife. Trust No. 4 kept alive seven policies of life insurance which had been taken out by the grantor for the use of sons and daughter, and three accident policies for his own use. Trust No. 5 kept alive nine life policies for his sons and daughter, and two accident policies for himself. Several of the deeds made provision for contingent limitations for the benefit of charities.\n The grantor in making the returns of his own income for the years 1924, 1925, and 1926, did not include any part of the income belonging to the trusts. Upon an audit of the returns the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency to the extent that the income of the trusts had been applied to the payment of premiums on the policies of insurance. There was no attempt to charge against the taxpayer the whole income of the trusts, to charge him with the excess applied to other uses than the preservation of the policies. The deficiency assessment was limited to that part of the income which had kept the policies alive. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the Commissioner. 19 B.T.A. 1213. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, except as to the premiums on the policies of accident insurance, those policies, in the event of loss thereunder, being payable to the insured himself. As to the income applied to the maintenance of the policies of life insurance, payable, as they were, to persons other than the insured or his estate, the Court of Appeals held that an assessment could not be made against the creator of the trust without an arbitrary taking of his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. 63 F. (2d) 425. Section 219(h) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, permitting such an assessment, was adjudged to be void. The court drew no distinction between the validity of the statute in its application to trusts in existence at the time of its enactment and its validity in \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 675]\n\u00a0\n application to trusts to be created afterwards. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n289 \nU.S. 716\n, 53 S.Ct. 528, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The meaning of the statute is not doubtful, whatever may be said of its validity. 'Where any part of the income of a trust is or may be applied to the payment of premiums upon policies of insurance on the life of the grantor (except policies of insurance irrevocably payable for the purposes and in the manner specified in paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of section (214) 955 (the exception having relation to trusts for charities)), such part of the income of the trust shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' Section 219(h), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 26 U.S. Code,  960 (26 USCA  960 no e); Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 26 U.S. Code App.  960 (26 USCA  960 note).\n The purpose of the law is disclosed by its legislative history, and indeed is clear upon the surface. When the bill which became the Revenue Act of 1924 was introduced in the House of Representatives, the report of the Committee on Ways and Means made an explanatory statement. Referring to section 219(h) it said: 'Trusts have been used to evade taxes by means of provisions allowing the distribution of the income to the grantor or its use for his benefit. The purpose of this subdivision of the bill is to stop this evasion.' house Report, No. 179, 68th Congress, 1st Session, p. 21. There is a like statement in the report of the Senate Committee on Finance. Senate Report, No. 398, 68th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 25, 26. By the creation of trusts, incomes had been so divided and subdivided as to withdraw from the government the benefit of the graduated taxes and surtaxes applicable to income when concentrated in a single ownership. Like methods of evasion, or, to speak more accurately, of avoidance ( Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 630\n, 36 S.Ct. 473), had been used to diminish the transfer or succession taxes payable at death. One can read in the revisions of the Revenue \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 676]\n\u00a0\n Acts the record of the government's endeavor to keep pace with the fertility of invention whereby taxpayers had contrived to keep the larger benefits of ownership and be relieved of the attendant burdens.\n A method, much in vogue until an amendment made it worthless, was the creation of a trust with a power of revocation. This device was adopted to escape the burdens of the tax upon incomes and the tax upon estates. To neutralize the effect of the device in its application to incomes, Congress made provision by section 219(g) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  960 note) that, 'where the grantor of a trust has, at any time during the taxable year, either alone or in conjunction with any person not a beneficiary of the trust, the power to revest in himself title to any part of the corpus of the trust, then the income of such part of the trust for such taxable year shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' The validity of this provision was assailed by taxpayers. It was upheld by this court in Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n, 50 S.Ct. 336, as applied to a trust in existence at the enactment of the statute, the power of revocation in that case being reserved to the grantor alone, and recently, at the present term, was upheld where the power of revocation had been reserved to the grantor in conjunction with some one else. Reinecke v. Smith, \n289 \nU.S. 172\n, 53 S.Ct. 570, 77 L.Ed. --, April 10, 1933. Cf. Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369. Other amendments of the statute were directed to the trust as an instrument for the avoidance of the tax upon estates. By section 302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1094 note), the gross estate of a decedent is to be taken as including the subject of any trust which he has created during life 'where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend or revoke, or where the decedent relinquished any such power in contemplation of his death, except in case of a bona fide \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 677]\n\u00a0\n sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth.' The validity of this provision as to trusts both past and future is no longer open to debate. Porter v. Commissioner, \n288 \nU.S. 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 451. Cf. Reinecke v. 'Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225. Through the devices thus neutralized, as well as through many others, there runs a common thread of purpose. The solidarity of the fam ly is to make it possible for the taxpayer to surrender title to another and to keep dominion for himself, or, if not technical dominion, at least the substance of enjoyment. At times escape has been blocked by the resources of the judicial process without the aid of legislation. Thus, Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, held that the salary, earned by a husband was taxable to him, though he had bound himself by a valid contract to assign it to his wife. Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345, laid down a like rule where there had been an assignment by a partner of his interest in the future profits of a partnership. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499, and United States v. Boston & Maine Railroad Co., \n279 \nU.S. 732\n, 49 S.Ct. 505, held that income was received by a taxpayer when pursuant to a contract a debt or other obligation was discharged by another for his benefit, the transaction being the same in substance as if the money had been paid to the debtor and then transmitted to the creditor. Cf. United States v. Mahoning Coal Railroad Co. (C.C.A.) 51 F. (2d) 208. In these and other cases there has been a progressive endeavor by the Congress and the courts to bring about a correspondence between the legal concept of ownership and the economic realities of enjoyment or fruition. Of a piece with that endeavor is the statute now assailed.\n The controversy is one as to the boundaries of legislative power. It must be dealt with in a large way, as questions of due process always are, not narrowly or pedanti \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 678]\n\u00a0\n cally, in slavery to forms or phrases. 'Taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxes-the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.' Corliss v. Bowers, supra, page 378 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 336. Cf. Burnet v. Guggenheim, supra, page 283 of 288 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 369. Refinements of title have at times supplied the rule when the question has been one of construction and nothing more, a question as to the meaning of a taxing act to be read in favor of the taxpayer. Refinements of title are without controlling force when a statute, unmistakable in meaning, is assailed by a taxpayer as overpassing the bounds of reason, an exercise by the lawmakers of arbitrary power. In such circumstances the question is no longer whether the concept of ownership reflected in the statute is to be squared with the concept embodies, more or less vaguely, in common-law traditions. The question is whether it is one that an enlightened legislator might act upon without affront to justice. Even administrative convenience, the practical necessities of an efficient system of taxation, will have heed and recognition within reasonable limits. Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 24\n, 25 S., 51 S.Ct. 324; Reinecke v. Smith, supra. Liability does not have to rest upon the enjoyment by the taxpayer of all the privileges and benefits enjoyed by the most favored owner at a given time or place. Corliss v. Bowers, supra; Reinecke v. Smith, supra. Government in casting about for proper subjects of taxation is not confined by the traditional classification of interests or estates. It may tax, not only ownership, but any right or privilege that is a constituent of ownership. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 268\n, 53 S.Ct. 345; Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124, 136\n, 50 S.Ct. 46. Liability may rest upon the enjoyment by the taxpayer of privileges and benefits so substantial and important as to make it reasonable and just to deal with him as if he were the owner, and to tax him on that basis. A margin must be allowed for the play of legisla- \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 679]\n\u00a0\n tive judgment. To overcome this statute the taxpayer must show that in attributing to him the ownership of the income of the trusts, or something fairly to be dealt with as equivalent to ownership, the lawmakers have one a wholly arbitrary thing, have found equivalence where there was none nor anything approaching it, and laid a burden unrelated to privilege or benefit. Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S.Ct. 44; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Milliken v. United States, supra. The statute, as we view it, is not subject to that reproach. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A policy of life insurance is a contract susceptible of ownership like any other chose in action. It 'is not an assurance for a single year, with a privilege of renewal from year to year by paying the annual premium.' It is 'an entire contract of assurance for life, subject to discontinuance and forfeiture for non-payment of any of the stipulated premiums.' N.Y. Life Insurance Co. v. Statham, \n93 U.S. 24\n, 30; Vance on Insurance, pp. 260, 262, and cases there cited. One who takes out a policy on his own life, after application in his own name accepted by the company, becomes in so doing a party to a contract, though the benefits of the insurance are to accrue to some one else. Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hurni Pracking Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 177\n, 44 S.Ct. 90, 31 A.L.R. 102; Vance on Insurance, pp. 90, 91, and 108. The rights and interests thereby generated do not inhere solely in those who are to receive the proceeds. They inhere also in the insured who in co- operation with the insurer has brought the contract into being. If the Minneapolis Trust Company, the trustee, were to refuse to apply the income to the preservation of the insurance, \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 680]\n\u00a0\n the insured might maintain a suit to hold it to its duty. If the insurer without cause were to repudiate the policies, the insured would have such an interest in the preservation of the contracts that he might maintain a suit in equity to declare them still in being. Cohen v. M.L. Inc. Co., 50 N.Y. 610, 624, 10 Am.Rep. 522; Meyer v. Knickerbocker L. Ins. Co., 73 N.Y. 516, 524, 29 Am.Rep. 200; Fidelity National Bank v. Swope, \n274 \nU.S. 123, 132\n, 47 S.Ct. 511; cf. Croker v. N.Y. Trust Co., 245 N.Y. 17, 18, 20, 156 N.E. 81; Johnson Service Co. v. Monin, Inc., 253 N.Y. 417, 421, 171 N.E. 692, 77 A.L.R. 214; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Contracts,  135, 138; Williston, Contracts,  358, 359. The contracts remain his, or his at least in part, though the fruits when they are gathered are to go to some one else. American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Contracts, supra.\n With the aid of this analysis the path is cleared to a conclusion. Wells by the creation of these trusts did more than devote his income to the benefit of relatives. He devoted it at the same time to the preservation of his own contracts, to the protection of an interest which he wished to keep alive. The ends to be attained must be viewed in combination. True he would have been at liberty, if the trusts had not been made, to put an end to his interest in the policies through nonpayment of the premiums, to stamp the contracts out. The chance that economic changes might force him to that choice was a motive, along with others, for the foundation of the trusts. In effect he said to the trustee that for the rest of his life he would dedicate a part of his income to the preservation of these contracts, so much did they mean for his peace of mind and happiness. Income permanently applied by the act of the taxpayer to the maintenance of contracts of insurance made in his name for the support of his dependents is income used for his benefit in such a sense and to \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 681]\n\u00a0\n such a degree that there is nothing arbitrary or tyrannical in taxing it as his.\n Insurance for dependents is to-day in the thought of many a pressing social duty. Even if not a duty, it is a common item in the family budget, kept up very often at the cost of painful sacrifice, and abandoned only under dire compulsion. It will be a vain effort at persuasion to argue to the average man that a trust created by a father to pay premiums on life policies for the use of sons and daughters is not a benefit to the one who will have to pay the premiums if the policies are not to lapse. Only by closing our minds to common modes of thought, to everyday realities, shall we find it in our power to form another judgment. The case is not helped by imagining exceptional conditions in which the advantage to the creator of the trust would be slender or remote. By and large the purpose of trusts for the maintenance of policies is to make provision for dependents, or so at least the lawmakers might not unreasonably assume. Trusts to give insurance to creditors are beneficial to the grantor by reducing his indebtedness. Trusts for charities are expressly excepted from the operation of the tax. Section 219(h) (26 USCA  960 note); section 214(a) ( 10) (26 USCA  955 and note). If other classes of life policies exist, they must be relatively few. The line of division between the rational and the arbitrary in legislation is not to be drawn with an eye to remote possibilities. What the law looks for in establishing its standards is a probability or tendency of general validity. If this is attained, the formula will serve, though there are imperfections here and there. The exceptional, if it arises, may have its special rule. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S.Ct. 106.\n Trusts for the preservation of policies of insurance involve a continuing exercise by the settlor of a power to direct the application of the income along predetermined \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 682]\n\u00a0\n channels. In this they are to be distinguished from trusts where the income of a fund, though payable to wife or kin, may be expended by the beneficiaries without restraint, may be given away or squandered, the founder of the trust doing nothing to impose his will upon the use. There is no occasion at this time to mark the applicable principle for those and other cases. The relation between the parties, the tendency of the transfer to give relief from obligations that are recognized as binding by normal men and women, will be facts to be considered. Cf. Rinecke v. Smith, supra, distinguishing Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S.Ct. 120. We do not go into their bearing now. Here the use to be made of the income of the trust was subject, from first to last, to the will of the grantor announced at the beginning. A particular expense, which for millions of men and women has become a fixed charge, as it doubtless was for Wells, an expense which would have to be continued if he was to preserve a contract right, was to be met in a particular way. He might have created a blanket trust for the payment of all the items of his own and the family budget, classifying the proposed expenses by adequate description. If the transaction had taken such a form, one can hardly doubt the validity of a legislative declaration that income so applied should be deemed to be devoted to his use. Instead of shaping the transaction thus, he picked out of the total budget an item or class of items, the cost of continuing his contracts of insurance, and created a source of income to preserve them against lapse.\n Congress does not play the despot in ordaining that trusts for such uses, if created in the future, shall be treated for the purpose of taxation as if the income of the trust had been retained by the grantor.\n It does not play the despot in ordaining a like rule as to trusts created in the past, at all events when in so doing it does not cast the burden backward beyond the income \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 683]\n\u00a0\n of t e current year. Reinecke v. Smith, supra; Corliss v. Bowers, supra; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409, 411\n, 50 S.Ct. 164; Milliken v. United States, supra.\n The judgment is reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I think otherwise.\n The powers of taxation are broad, but the distinction between taxation and confiscation must still be observed. So long as the Fifth Amendment remains unrepealed and is permitted to control, Congress may not tax the property of A as the property of B, or the income of A as the income of B.\n The facts here show that Wells created certain irrevocable trusts. He retained no vestige of title to, interest in, or control over, the property transferred to the trustee. The result was a present, executed, outright gift, which could then have been taxed to the settlor. Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369. That the property which was the subject of the gift could never thereafter, without a change of title, be taxed to the settlor is, of course, too plain for argument. To establish the contention that the income from such property, the application of which for the benefit of others had been irrevocably fixed, is nevertheless the income of the settlor and may lawfully be taxed as his property, requires something more tangible than a purpose to perform a social duty, or the recognition of a moral claim as distinguished from a legal obligation, which, we think, is not supplied by an assumption of his desire thereby to secure his own peace of mind and happiness or relieve himself from further concern in the matter. If the trusts in question had irrevocably devoted the income \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 684]\n\u00a0\n to charitable purposes, to the cause of scientific research, or to the promotion of the spread of religion among the heathen, and the statute had authorized its taxation, probably no thoughtful person would have insisted that the relation of the settlor to the benefaction was such as constitutionally to justify the tax against him. And yet in each of these supposed cases it would not be hard to find a purpose to discharge a social duty, or unreasonable to assume the desire of the settlor thereby to enjoy the mental comfort which is supposed to follow the voluntary performance of righteous deeds.\n If there be any difference between the cases supposed and the present one, it is a difference without real substance. In each the motive of the taxpayer is immaterial. The material question is, What has he done? not, Why has he done it? however pertinent the latter query might be in a different case. Obviously, as it seems to us, the distinction to be observed is between the devotion of income to payments which the settlor is bound to make, and to those which he is free to make or not make, as he may see fit. In the former case the payments have the substantial elements of income to the settlor. In the latter, whatever may be said of the moral influence which induced the settlor to direct the payments, they are income of the trustee for the benefit of others than the settlor.\n It is not accurate, we think, to say that these trusts involve the continuing exercise by the settlor of a power to direct the application of the income along predetermined channels. The exertion of power on the part of the settlor to direct such application begins and ends with the creation of the irrevocable trusts. Thereafter, the power is to be exercised automatically by the trustee under a grant which neither he nor the settlor can recall or abridge. The income, of course, is taxable, but to the trustee, not to the settlor. The well-reasoned opinion of \n\n[289 U.S. 670, 685]\n\u00a0\n the court below, which fully sustains respondent's contention here, renders it unnecessary to discuss the matter at greater length. We think that opinion should be sustained. It finds ample sup ort in Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206, 215\n, 52 S.Ct. 120; Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 326\n, 52 S.Ct. 358; and other decisions of this court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The trusts, having been created in 1922 and 1923, were not subject to the gift tax of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 313, 314, c. 234,  319, 320, 26 U. S. Code  1131, 1132 (26 USCA  1131, 1132 notes). Whether they would have been subject to that tax if they had been created at a later date is a question not before us. There is no inconsistency between a gift to take effect in enjoyment upon the death of a grantor and the reservation of benefits to be enjoyed during his life. \n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUTTE A. & P. R. CO. v. U. S.(1933)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 20, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 127, 128]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel M. Kelly, of Butte, Mont., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Harold M. Stephens, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the United States, on August 23, 1929, in the federal court for Montana to recover the sum of $487,116.31 paid to Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Railway Company, on March 26, 1925. The payment was made pursuant to a certificate of the Interstate Commerce Commission for that amount, issued March 20, 1925, and addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury. Deficit Settlement with Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Ry., 94 I. C.C. 617. The Secretary, after receiving from the Comptroller General his certificate approving the payment, issued a warrant for that sum and transmitted it \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 133]\n\u00a0\n to the Treasurer of the United States. The Treasurer paid the railway.\n The proceeding before the Commission originated in a claim for $600, 527.35 filed with it by the railway under section 204 of Transportation Act 1920, 41 Stat. 460 (49 USCA  73) entitled 'Reimbursement of deficits during Federal control.' \n1\n Upon due hearing, the Commission concluded that the railway was entitled to $487,116.31; and it offered to issue a certificate for that amount on condition that the railway sign a release accepting the amount 'in settlement of all claims against the Government under said section 204.' This condition was agreed to. About two years after the money received had been disbursed by the railway, partly in dividends to stockholders, partly in the expenses of operation, the Commission issued an order purporting to reopen the proceeding; and set a hearing 'for the purpose of affording the Railway opportunity to show cause why the certificate issued on March 20, 1925, should not be revoked and its claim dismissed.' The railway, appearing specially, protested against the action of the Commission in attempting to reopen the proceeding; and challenged its power to do so. On March 7, 1927, the Commission entered an order purporting to cancel the certificate of March 20, 1925, and to dismiss the railway's claim. Deficit Settlement with Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Railway, 117 I.C.C. 780. On June 8, 1928, the Under-Secretary of the Treasury demanded of the railway repayment of the $ 487,116.31 received by it. Repayment was refused. Fourteen months later, this action was begun to recover the money. \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n The case was first heard upon defendant's demurrer to the complaint. That demurrer was overruled. The defendant set up by answer the terms on which the payment had been made and the disposition of the money received. Then the case was heard upon the plaintiff's demurrer to the answer; that demurrer was sustained; and judgment for the government was entered in the sum of $487,116.31, with interest at 8 per cent. from the date of the demand and costs. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 61 F.( 2d) 587. This Court granted certiorari, \n289 \nU.S. 717\n, 53 S.Ct. 656\n\n\n The action is brought to recover money paid by mistake. The charge is that the money was paid, because, in 1925, the officials misconstrued the word 'deficit,' so as improperly to extend the scope of section 204. That is a charge, not of mistake, but of error of judgment-a judgment necessarily exercised in the performance of the duties of office. Neither the Commission in issuing the certificate, nor the Secretary of the Treasury, the Comptroller General, or the Treasurer, when co-operating to make the payment, labored under any mistake of fact; or overlooked any applicable rule of law; or was guilty of any irregularity in proceeding. Moreover, if the word 'deficit' was misconstrued, the error was not due to inadvertence. Ever since the enactment of Transportation Act 1920, it had been recognized that the construction to be given the word 'deficit' presented a difficult and important question. In 1920, before hearing those interested, the Commission attributed to the word the meaning now contended for by the government. Protests against its then interpretation led the Commission to set, in 1921, a public hearing for the consideration solely of that question. \n2\n Counsel for many railroads participated and submitted briefs. On February 7, 1922, the \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n Commission stated its conclusion in an elaborate report. In the matter of the construction of the word 'deficit' as used in Paragraph (a) of section 204 of the Transportation Act, 1920, 66 I.C.C. 765. The rule there announced was consistently acted upon for over two years and a half. Under it, the Commission issued certificates to 71 carriers, including that here attacked. 3 Then there was a change in the membership of the Commission. On October 17, 1925, it overruled, in Deficit Status of Bingham & Garfield Railway Co., 99 I.C.C. 724, its earlier decision; and in March, 1927, instituted against Butte, Anaconda & Pacific Railway Company the proceeding to revoke the certificate on which payment had already been made. \n4\n Obviously, 'mistake ... there was none, but merely a revision of judgment in respect of matters of opinion.' United States v. Great Northern Railway, \n287 \nU.S. 144, 151\n, 53 S.Ct. 28, 30.\n The United States claims that the money can be recovered because it was a disbursement made without the authority of Congress. The argument is that the Commission had no authority to issue a certificate, and the financial officers of the government had no authority to pay money, except to a carrier which had suffered a 'deficit' in operations during the period of federal control; that, properly construing that word, the railway had not suffered a 'deficit'; and that, having received the money which the officials were not authorized to pay, the railway must restore it, since in dealings with the government one is bound, at his peril, to know the limits of the authority of its agents. We have no occasion to determine which of the Commission's interpretations of the word 'deficit' is the correct one. For we are of \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n opinion that the government cannot recover the money paid in 1925, even if the Commission erred in attributing to the word 'deficit' the meaning then acted on.\n The decision was on the merits. The case is no different than it would have been, if the Commission had erred in any other ruling on a matter of law; or in a finding strictly of fact; or in some finding as to maintenance, depreciation, or value-determinations called findings of fact but which rest largely in opinion. In making those decisions the Commission would necessarily act in a quasi judicial capacity. If it misconstrued the term 'deficit,' it committed an error; but it did not transcend its jurisdiction. Since Congress has not provided a method of review, neither the Commission nor a court has power to correct the alleged error after payment made pursuant to a certificate. The government cannot recover, because, when Congress, by section 204, imposed the duty to certify to the Treasury the amounts severally due to carriers, it required the Commission-and hence authorized it-to determine whether the claimant was entitled to relief.\n In making its determinations the Commission was required to decide many things besides the meaning of the term 'deficit' or the amount thereof, if any. To appreciate the broad scope of the Commission's duty, we must consider the occasion and the character of the legislation and the precise question of construction here involved. On December 28, 1917, the President took possession and assumed control of all the railroads in the United States. By the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, 40 Stat. 451, Congress provided for compensation equal to the 'average annual railway operating income for the three years ended' June 30, 1917, called the 'test period.' \n5\n Later, \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 137]\n\u00a0\n the Director General surrendered the possession and control of many short lines. Their owners operated them thereafter privately during some part of the period of federal control. These owners claimed that such private operation had resulted in heavy losses attributable to the continued federal control of the main transportation systems of the country. They urged upon Congress that the surrendered short lines ought to be put into as good a position financially as they would have been in, if the Director General had retained possession of them throughout the period of federal control. Recognizing that they had suffered, Congress included in Transportation Act 1920 the provision for compensation contained in section 204. Paragraph (a) describes the carriers entitled to compensation:\n'The term 'carrier' means a carrier by railroad which, during any part of the period of Federal control, engaged as a common carrier in general transportation, and competed for traffic, or connected, with a railroad under Federal control, and which sustained a deficit in its railway operating income for that portion (as a whole) of the period of Federal control during which it operated its own railroad or system of transportation; but does not include any street or interurban electric railway which has as its principal source of operating revenue urban, suburban, or interurban passenger traffic or sale of power, heat, and light, or both.'\n\n Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) direct the Commission to ascertain the data from which the amount of deficits or losses are to be calculated; paragraph (f) fixes the amounts payable; and paragraph (g) provides:\n'The commission shall promptly certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the several amounts payable to car- \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 138]\n\u00a0\n riers under paragraph (f). The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed thereupon to draw warrants in favor of each such carrier upon the Treasury of the United States for the amount shown in such certificate as payable thereto. An amount sufficient to pay such warrants is appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.'\n\n Claims under section 204 were filed by 461 carriers. \n6\n Each claimant inisisted that it had suffered a 'deficit.' The controverted question of construction discussed in this case is whether, by the use of the word 'deficit,' Congress intended that compensation should be paid to those carriers only which had suffered an actual (red-ink) loss in operation or intended to put all the short lines into as good a position as they would have been in if the Director General had retained possession throughout federal control. If 'deficit' be held to mean actual loss in operation, many of these carriers would receive nothing, as they had earned net income, although at a rate less than during the 'test period.' But it might prove upon investigation of the accounts that some carriers who had vainly claimed compensation on the basis of lessened income as compared with the 'test period' were entitled to compensation because they had actually suffered a (red-ink) loss in operation. Compare Deficit Status of Fairport, Painesville & Eastern R.R. Co., 124 I.C.C. 323; Id., 145 I.C.C. 684. This is true, because, while on the face of the accounts there appeared to have been net income, it might prove that there was, during the period, an operating loss, by reason of the fact that the carrier had failed to make the proper maintenance and depreciation charges. Where the right to compensation depends upon the propriety of the maintenance and depreciation \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 139]\n\u00a0\n charges, it may be impossible to determine, until the completion of the investigation into the accounts, whether the carrier is entitled to relief. Compare Great Northern Ry. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S.Ct. 466; Continental Tie & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 290\n, 52 S.Ct. 529; United States v. Great Northern Ry., \n287 \nU.S. 144\n, 53 S.Ct. 28.\n On the other hand, many a carrier may be denied compensation, although the fact is unquestioned that a (red-ink) operating loss had been suffered. Such denial has been based sometimes on failure to prove other essential facts; sometimes because of a ruling on matter of law. The Commission has been required, in passing upon claims under section 204, to decide, in addition to the meaning of the word 'deficit,' many controlling questions of statutory construction which, in a sense, are preliminary. Among them are: What did Congress mean by the phrase 'in general transportation'?7 What did Congress mean by the phrase 'complete for traffic ... with a railroad under Federal control'?8 What did Congress mean by the phrase 'connected with a railroad under Federal control'?9 \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 140]\n\u00a0\n What did Congress mean by the phrase 'common carrier'?10 What did Congress mean by 'a system of transportation'?11 Did Congress intend to grant compensation to a carrier part of whose line is in a foreign country?12 Did Congress intend that compensation should be granted to carriers which had failed either during the period of federal control or during the 'test period' to render reports to the Commission and to keep their accounts in conformity with its rules?13 Did Con- \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 141]\n\u00a0\n gress intend that a certificate should issue where the operating loss was due to expenditures arising from occurrences unusual in the conduct of the carrier's business?14 Did Congress intend that a certificate should issue where the operating loss was due to causes other than the war or the federal control of the main lines of transportation?15 Did Congress intend that a railroad technically under federal control, but which actually was operated by its owners, should receive compensation under section 204?16\n While section 204 granted a bounty, it conferred a right, and constituted the Commission a quasi judicial tribunal to adjudicate claims thereunder. Thus it was called upon to pronounce a formal judgment on rights asserted. A decision adverse to the carrier on any one of the suggested questions of construction might compel dismissal of the claim;17 thus relieving the Commission of the necessity of inquiring whether a deficit had been suffered. But it does not follow that such a decision would determine an issue of jurisdiction. Under this legislation, whether a \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 142]\n\u00a0\n claimant seeking 'relief has the requisite standing is a question going to the merits, and its determination is an exercise of jurisdication.' Compare General Investment Co. v. New York Central R.R., \n271 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 46 S.Ct. 496, 497. Though it were charged that the Commission erred in so dismissing the claim, the carrier could not by mandamus compel it to proceed with the inquiry. See U.S. ex rel. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 56 App.D.C. 40, 8 F.( 2d) 901; Cripple Creek & Colorado Springs R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 56 App.D.C. 168, 11 F.(2d) 554; U.S. ex rel. Empire & S.E.

Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638\n, 38 S.Ct. 408.\n Under section 204, the Commission exercises functions broader than those customarily conferred upon auditing or disbursing officers. It sits as a special tribunal to hear and determine the claims presented. Compare Work v. U.S. ex rel. Rives, \n267 \nU.S. 175, 182\n, 45 S.Ct. 252; Great Northern Ry. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172, 182\n, 48 S.Ct. 466. It renders a judgment upon a full hearing. In deciding any one of the enumerated questions of construction, as in other rulings of law or findings of fact, the Commission may err. The victim of the error may be either the carrier or the government. Although the decision on the question of construction be favorable to the carrier, it may still fail to secure compensation, because there was, in fact, no deficit, whatever meaning be given to that word. On the other hand, an erroneous decision in favor of the carrier, on any of those questions, may result in the issue of a certificate and the payment thereunder of money which should not, and but for the error would not, be made. Since authority to pass upon the meaning of the word 'deficit,' and \n\n[290 U.S. 127, 143]\n\u00a0\n upon each of the other questions of construction, is essential to the performance of the duty imposed upon the Commission, and Congress did not provide a method of review, we hold that it intended to leave the government, as well as the carrier, remediless whether the error be one of fact or of law. Compare United States v. Great Northern Ry., \n287 \nU.S. 144\n, 53 S.Ct. 28. The rule declared in Wisconsin Central Railroad Co. v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 190\n, 17 S.Ct. 45; Grand Trunk Western Ry. Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 112\n, 40 S.Ct. 309, is not applicable here. The decision in Continental Tie & Lumber Co. v.

Co., 154 I.C.C. 1, it was held the term had a broader significance than 'common carrier'; that it meant a carrier which might be utilized by the government in the prosecution of the war; that, by this term, Congress intended to differentiate between railroads (common carriers) with reference to their utility and necessity as a part of the transportation system of the country; and that freight transportation, rather than passenger transportation, was considered a test of this utility and necessity. The claims were dismissed because these carriers did not meet the test erected. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] In Deficit Claim of Manitou & Pike's Peak Ry., 94 I.C.C. 767, 773, the claim was dismissed, among other reasons, because it was not shown that the competition was of such a character that the short line suffered, through diversion, loss of traffic that otherwise might have moved over its line. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] In Deficit Claim of Manitou & Pike's Peak Ry., 94 I.C.C. 767, 773, it was held also that, although the carrier joined in through passenger rates with railroads under Federal control, it was not within this phrase, because there was not such a connection as would permit the regular and general transfer of freight.

Henry T. Duncan, of Lexington, Ky., and D. L. Hazelrigg, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellant.\n Messrs. Robert H. Winn, of Mt. Sterling, Ky., and Clinton M. Harbison, of Lexington, Ky., for appellees Railroad Commission of Kentucky and City of Lexington.\n Mr. Joseph A. Edge, of Lexington, Ky., for appellees Mrs. George Hignight et al.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity, brought by appellant, a Kentucky corporation, in the District Court for Eastern Kentucky, against the state Railroad Commission, certain state officers, and the city of Lexington, to set aside as confiscatory a rate prescribed by the commission for the sale of natural gas distributed by appellant through its pipe lines to consumers in Lexington. The District Court, of three judges, found the rate confiscatory, but refused to enjoin it because of the failure of the appellant to conform to a condition prescribed by the court as prerequisite to granting the injunction. 60 F.(2d) 137. From this decree the present appeal was taken under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380).\n In 1905 the appellant had secured a twenty-year franchise for the distribution of natural gas to consumers through its pipe lines in the city of Lexington. After the expiration of the franchise on September 5, 1925, and pursuant to ordinance of the city of Lexington of January 28, 1927, the appellant became the purchaser, at public sale, of a new franchise to distribute natural gas to consumers in Lexington, upon the terms and conditions of a written contract between appellant and the city, which \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n was incorporated in the ordinance and became effective on its acceptance by the city by ordinance of February 25, 1927\n\n\n The rate to be charged to consumers for gas was not fixed by the franchise contract. It stipulated that the gas supplied by appellant should be at just and reasonable rates, but it provided that, in the first instance, the rates should be designated by appellant in writing, by a rate schedule, filed with the mayor of the city and the Railroad Commission, and that if the city should consider the scheduled rates in excess of just and reasonable rates, it should, within a time specified, institute proceedings before the Railroad Commission to have a just and reasonable rate found and prescribed by it in accordance with the applicable statutes of the state. It was also agreed by the franchise contract that pending proceedings before the commission and 'subsequent proceedings in court,' for the determination of a just and reasonable rate, the appellant should charge its patrons a temporary rate of 50 cents per thousand feet for gas consumed until such time as it should furnish certain increased pipe line service, required by the franchise, after which, and during the proceedings for fixing the rate, the temporary rate should be increased to 60 cents per thousand feet; that pending such proceedings 10 cents of the rate collected from customers, whether 50 cents or 60 cents, should be impounded under the direction of the commission and that at their conclusion 'the Commission or the court' should distribute the impounded fund in accordance with the respective interests in it of appellant and its consumers.\n Acting under the provisions of the franchise contract, appellant promulgated a schedule of rates on February 26, 1927, whereupon the city, on March 25, 1927, lodged a complaint with the Railroad Commission assailing the scheduled rates as excessive, and asked that it establish a just and reasonable rate. The commission directed that 10 cents of the temporary rate collected by appellant \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n from consumers should be impounded with a custodian, appointed by the commission, to receive and hold it pending final determination of the rate. In December, 1927, while the proceeding before the commission was pending, the additional pipe line service required by the franchise was brought into operation and the prescribed temporary rate of 60 cents per thousand was established. Hearings were had and the proceedings continued before the commission, which resulted in its order of October 9, 1929, assailed here, which fixed 45 cents per thousand as a just and reasonable rate and directed appropriate preliminary steps for the distribution of the impounded fund.\n The bill in the present suit assails the 45-cent rate as confiscatory and hence an infringement of appellant's immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment, and contains allegations showing that appellant will be irreparably injured if the rate becomes effective. It prays that the respondents be restrained from carrying out the order of the commission, and asks payment over to appellant of the impounded fund. The District Court, by interlocutory injunction, enjoined any further proceedings under the order, and appointed as receiver the custodian of the fund impounded by direction of the commission, to receive and hold, subject to the further order of the court, any fund required to be impounded by the franchise contract subsequent to the order of the commission, and directed appellant, pending the final decree, to pay over to the receiver 10 cents of the 60-cent rate which it should collect from its patrons.\n After a hearing and consideration of the evidence, the court found that the 45-cent rate was confiscatory, that a rate of 50 cents would be just and reasonable, and directed that a permanent injunction issue restraining the imposition of the 45-cent rate, but upon the condition that appellant file with the court its consent that the fund impounded from the rate collected in excess of 50 cents per thousand be distrib- \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n uted to such of its patrons as were entitled to share in it, and that it file with the Railroad Commission and with the Fayette circuit court of Kentucky its written consent that those tribunals make like orders of distribution of all funds in excess of the 50-cent rate which had been impounded and held by their orders. As appellant declined to consent to such distribution of the funds, final decree was entered denying the prayer for a permanent injunction, and directing that the fund impounded with the receiver the distributed among the consumers in proportion to their respective contributions to it.\n From this decree appellant alone has appealed. While relying on the findings of the court below that the 45-cent rate is confiscatory, it challenges the finding that the 50-cent rate is just and reasonable, and upon that ground assails the provision of the decree directing distribution to the consumers of the impounded funds made up of collections in excess of the 50-cent rate. It also attacks the denial of a permanent injunction because of appellant's refusal to assent to the distribution of the impounded funds on the basis of that rate. Respondents, while resisting each of these contentions, seek also to sustain the decree denying the injunction on the ground that the 45-cent rate is not confiscatory. See Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S.Ct. 243; United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425\n, 44 S.Ct. 560.\n\n 1. \nThere being no diversity of citizenship of the parties to the litigation, the jurisdiction of the District Court to enjoin the 45-cent rate prescribed by the commission is dependent wholly upon the allegations in the bill that the rate assailed was one prescribed by state authority and violates the Fourteenth Amendment because confiscatory. If the rate were fixed by agreement of the parties disclosed by the franchise contract exhibited in the bill, or if it were fixed by the commission, acting as an arbitrator pursuant to agreement of the parties thus deriving its authority from the contract, it is plain that no federal question would \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n be presented. Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 43 S.Ct. 613; Columbus Ry., Power & Light Co. v. Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399\n, 39 S.Ct. 349, 6 A.L.R. 1648.\n But the 45-cent rate was not one prescribed by the contract. By its terms the only effect of the contract upon rates other than the temporary rates in force pending the proceedings before the commission, was to allow the appellant to promulgate a schedule of rates which were to be effective unless, within a time specified, the city should proceed under the laws of the state to have a rate prescribed by public authority. By sections 201e- 2, 201e-5, 201e-11, 201e-14 of the Kentucky Statutes, the Railroad Commission is clothed with the authority of the state to fix rates for the distribution of natural gas by public service companies and is required, upon complaint, to fix just and reasonable rates. It derived its power to fix the rate in the present case, not from the agreement of the parties to this litigation, but from the state Legislature. It was that power which the city called into action by its complaint to the commission that the rates designated in appellant's rate schedule were excessive. The rate, being prescribed by state authority, was, if confiscatory, an infringement of constitutional limitations. The case made by the bill was, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the court below, and called for its determination of the constitutional issue presented.\n\n 2. \nWhile the jurisdiction of the court was invoked to enjoin the rate because confiscatory, it nevertheless denied any relief from the imposition of the 45-cent rate which it had found to be confiscatory, and directed the return to appellant's patrons of the fund impounded from the collections made in excess of the 50-cent rate. The basis of this action was the finding by the court that the 50-cent rate was just and reasonable, from which it concluded that the appellant was not entitled to retain any amounts collected from its consumers in excess of that rate, and that the \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 271]\n\u00a0\n court might, in its discretion, deny any equitable relief since the appellant itself had refused to do equity by consenting to the rate which the court deemed just and reasonable.\n The power of a court of equity, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to grant, upon equitable conditions, the extraordinary relief to which a plaintiff would otherwise be entitled, without condition, is undoubted. It may refuse its aid to him who seeks relief from an illegal tax or assessment unless he will do equity by paying that which is conceded to be due.

Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269, 294\n, 19 S.Ct. 187. It may withhold from a plaintiff the complete relief to which he would otherwise be entitled if the defendant is willing to give in its stead such substituted relief as, under the special circumstances of the case, satisfies the requirements of equity and good conscience. City of Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 53 S.Ct. 602. It may prescribe the performance of conditions designed to protect the rights of the parties pending appeal, Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 157\n, 3 S.Ct. 136, or to protect temporarily the public interest while its decree is being carried into effect. See Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton (D.C.) 267 F. 231, 273; Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165\n, 42 S.Ct. 264.\n There are nevertheless some limitations upon the extent to which a federal court of equity may properly go in prescribing such conditional relief, which are inherent in the nature of the jurisdiction which it exercises. District Courts may set aside a confiscatory rate prescribed by state authority because forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment, but they are without authority to prescribe rates, both because that is a function reserved to the state, and because it is not one within the judicial power conferred upon them by the Constitution. See Newton \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 272]\n\u00a0\n v. Consolidated Gas Co., supra; Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 397\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047; Honolulu Rapid Transit & Land Co. v. Hawaii, \n211 \nU.S. 282\n, 29 S.Ct. 55; cf. Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n, 43 S.Ct. 445; O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516\n, 53 S.Ct. 740.\n This Court has warned that the power to attach conditions to decrees enjoining state rates should be cautiously exercised. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., supra, page 175 of 258 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 264. The practical effect of a denial of relief unless the plaintiff will submit to a rate, the reasonableness of which he challenges, is to make the surrender of the right to invoke a distinctively state legislative function the price of justice in the federal courts. The practice would tend to curtail the exercise of that function by action of a court which is itself without authority either to exercise it or to prevent the state from doing so. Such interference with the legislative function is not a proper exercise of the discretionary powers of a federal court of equity. See Honolulu Rapid Transit & Land Co. v. Hawaii, supra.\n Such a condition, too, is different from the requirement that a plaintiff shall pay a tax, the amount of which is known and conceded to be due, as a condition of enjoining an excessive tax. In Norwood v. Baker, supra, pages 291, 294 of 172 U.S., 19 S.Ct. 187, this Court pointed out that it would be improper, as a condition of enjoining an unconstitutional special assessment levied by a state authority, to require the plaintiff to tender the amount of such assessment as the court should consider might lawfully be made by state action not yet taken. In Newton v. Consolidated Gas Company, supra, where the Legislature was not in session and had not delegated its power to fix rates, the court sustained a decree enjoining a rate as confiscatory on condition that the plaintiff should impound the rate collected in excess of the confiscatory rate until a specified date, after the assembly of the Legislature, or until a new rate should be fixed by state authority. But the condition was approved \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 273]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that its practical effect was to preserve the rights of the parties pending the appeal.\n Here the rate-making body, the Railroad Commission, is free to perform its function of fixing a just and reasonable rate as soon as the confiscatory rate is enjoined. The rights of the parties are fully protected both by the provision of the franchise contract and the order of the commission in the proceedings brought to fix the rate, not yet terminated, requiring collections by appellant in excess of the 50-cent rate to be impounded with the custodian. The condition imposed here was not calculated to protect the rights of the parties pending an appeal or further action by the rate-making body. Compliance with it would have involved the surrender of rights asserted by appellant to the funds impounded during a period of more than five years. It would have made impossible any court review of the condition, by appeal or otherwise.\n In the circumstances there was no occasion for the court to draw upon its extraordinary equity powers to attach any condition to its decree, and the condition which it did attach was an unwarranted intrusion on the powers of the commission. On the basis of its conclusion that the 45-cent rate was confiscatory, it should have granted appropriate relief, without condition, leaving the commission free to exercise its authority to fix a reasonable rate, and it should have relinquished its control over the impounded fund by directing the receiver to retain it, not as receiver, but in his capacity as custodian appointed by the commission, to await its action in fixing a lawful rate.\n\n 3. \nThe court below based its conclusion that the 45-cent rate was confiscatory and that the 50-cent rate would be just and reasonable upon a valuation of the property included in the rate base as of December 31, 1926, a date shortly preceding the effective date of the franchise, which was February 25, 1927. In choosing this date for establishing \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 274]\n\u00a0\n the rate base the court acted upon consent of the parties, which in interpreted as requiring it to make as of that date all findings and determinations having a bearing upon the effect of the 45-cent rate and the reasonableness of the 50-cent rate. Although the case was not ready for final decree until September, 1932, and the decree, like the commission's order, spoke for the future as well as for the past, the findings upon which it rested were thus restricted to the date which, for all practical purposes, may be treated as the effective date of the franchise.\n In making the findings as of December 31, 1926, the court considered evidence, tending to support them, of earnings and other relevant data during a number of years preceding that date and the year following. In that year the temporary 50-cent rate was in force until December, and until that time no substantial change was shown in the conditions affecting the propriety of the rate fixed by the commission from those prevailing on December 31, 1926. But by December, 1927, the additional pipe line service which, by the franchise, appellant was required to furnish, had been brought into operation and the agreed temporary rate of 60 cents was established. Before that date, the rates paid by appellant for gas purchased for its service from producers had ranged from 10 cents to 20 cents per thousand feet. But the additional pipe line service was procured by contract with another company by which appellant agreed to purchase annually 750 million feet of gas at 40 cents per thousand. As the court considered itself restricted to findings as of December, 1926, it declined to take into account the effect of the increased cost of gas under this contract in making findings as to the propriety of the commission's rate. That restriction also necessarily excluded from consideration the profound changes in values, costs of service, consumption of commodities, and reasonable return on invested capital which we judicially know took place during the period of more than five years while the case was pending before the \n\n[290 U.S. 264, 275]\n\u00a0\n commission and the court. See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146.\n It is apparent that any decree, to be entered here, upon findings so restricted, must be similarly restricted in its operation and should speak of the validity of the commission's rate only as of a time approximating the date when the franchise became effective. Respondents assail the court's findings that the 45-cent rate was confiscatory and that the 50- cent rate was reasonable, and its findings of value and of the amount to be allowed as a deduction from gross revenue for amortization of the appellant's plants. So far as these objections and others are addressed to the weight of the evidence, we are satisfied that the evidence supports the findings as restricted in the manner already indicated. In view of the limited effect which must be given to any decree to be entered, we have no occasion to consider these objections in any other aspect.\n The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded, with instructions to enter a decree enjoining so much of the commission's order as fixes the rate to be charged for gas distributed by appellant to consumers, and relinquishing any further control by the court or its receiver over the impounded fund in his hands by directing that he shall continue to hold such fund, not as receiver, but in his capacity as custodian for the Railroad Commission. The decree will state that it is without prejudice to the right and power of the commission to fix a just and reasonable rate, and that it makes no adjudication of the validity of the 45-cent rate fixed by the commission, so far as it may be affected by changed conditions after February 25, 1927, the effective date of appellant's franchise. Costs, other than in this court, will be awarded in the discretion of the court below.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL TRANSFER CO. v. TERMINAL R. ASS'N OF ST. LOUIS(1933)\nNo. 523\nArgued: February 14, 1933Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Glendy B. Arnold, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. C. S. Burg and H. H. Larimore, both of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Delaware corporation engaged in the transportation of interstate freight in St. Louis, brought suit in the District Court for Eastern Missouri against respondent, Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, and its sixteen constituent members, interstate rail carriers having terminals in St. Louis or East St. Louis, to restrain an alleged violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note). The District Court dismissed the suit after a trial on the merits, on the ground that, as the acts complained of involved matters within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, a suit to enjoin them was unauthorized under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 737, 15 USCA  26, unless brought by the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 61 F.(2d) 546. This Court granted certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 595\n, 53 S.Ct. 313, 77 L.Ed. --.\n For many years before the present suit the respondent rail carriers had maintained in St. Louis and East St. Louis certain 'off track' stations for receipt and delivery of less than carload freight and by the employment of transfer companies, including petitioner, had provided for the transportation of such freight by truck between such stations and their 'on track' stations, and between each of the latter in St. Louis and East St. Louis. Tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission designated all such 'off track' stations and fixed line haul rates for the \n\n[288 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n transportation of freight in less than carload lots between such stations and points on their lines. The 'off track' stations were generally places of business of local transfer companies, including petitioner, and the Columbia Terminals Company, also named as a defendant.\n The several carriers, having proposed, in the interest of economy and efficiency, to reduce the number of 'off track' stations and to employ a single transfer company in interchanging freight, the Interstate Commerce Commission, on May 2, 1927, in response to numerous petitions, ordered a general investigation of the lawfulness of this proposal, and of the methods and practices of the respondents in handling less than carload freight in St. Louis and East St. Louis. On May 25, 1927, the rail carriers filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a proposed tariff under which the number of designated 'off track' stations was to be reduced from twelve to seven in St. Louis, and from two to one in East St. Louis; new schedules of line haul rates, absorbing the allowances paid by the carrier for the interstation haul, were applied between all stations in St. Louis and East St. Louis and points on the lines of the carriers. The only 'off track' stations retained belonged to the Columbia Terminals Company. Those to be abandoned included three operated by petitioner and two operated and one controlled by the Columbia Terminals Company.\n Thereupon, the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted a proceeding for an investigation of the lawfulness of the proposed tariffs and consolidated it with the proceeding for a general investigation already pending. In the course of the consolidated proceeding the Commission made two reports. The first, of May 13, 1929, 155 I.C.C. 129, upheld as reasonable and lawful the proposed reduction in number of 'off track' stations and the employment by the several rail carriers of a single transfer company to do the interstation hauling. The Commis- \n\n[288 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n sion found that these changes in method of handling freight under the proposed rate schedules would effect large savings in transportation costs, and that the arrangement entered into to effect them was not a violation of the anti-trust laws of the United States. The proposed rate schedule was suspended, pending a cost study, at the conclusion of which the Commission, by a second report and order of July 27, 1931, 177 I.C.C. 316, approved the rate schedule as filed.\n Pending the proceedings before the Commission, respondent, the Terminal Railroad Association, acting on behalf of the respondent carriers, on June 1, 1931, entered into a contract with Columbia Terminals Company, embodying the arrangement between the carriers and the Columbia Terminals Company, which is the subject of complaint in this suit. By this contract it was agreed that the reduced number of 'off track' stations named in the filed tariffs, which were places of business of the Columbia Terminals Company, should be designated and maintained as the only 'off track' stations of the carriers; that the Columbia Terminals Company should have the exclusive right to transport less than carload freight between the 'on track' stations and between them and the 'off track' stations; that the carriers should file the necessary amended tarifis with the Interstate Commerce Commission to carry out the agreement and pay for the services rendered at prescribed rates, which were absorbed in the line haul rates ultimately approved by the Commission. The practical effect of the contract was to give the Columbia Terminals Company the exclusive right to operate the 'off track' stations, to haul the interchanged freight, and thus to preclude the employment of petitioner and others in that service.\n Petitioner assails the contract and the consequent refusal of the carriers to employ it and to use its places of business as stations, as creating a forbidden monopoly in \n\n[288 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n restraint of interstate commerce. To this the respondents answer that the contract is concerned with matters within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to which the Clayton Act provides that no one except the United States may maintain a suit for an injunction. The question which we must decide is whether the petitioner is thus precluded from prosecuting the present suit.\n By the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, the government alone was authorized to maintain a suit to restrain violations of its provisions, Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459\n, 37 S.Ct. 718. Private persons were first authorized to bring suits for that purpose by section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  26), but with the proviso 'that nothing herein contained shall be construed to entitle any person, firm, corporation or association, except the United States, to bring suit in equity for injunctive relief against any common carrier subject to the provisions' of the Interstate Commerce Act 'in respect of any matter subject to the regulation, supervision, or other jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n It is not denied that the respondents are common carriers subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. 49 USCA c. 1,  1 et seq. Nor is it denied that by the applicable provisions of the act the maintenance by the carriers of the 'off track' stations, the transportation service rendered in connection with them and between the 'on track' stations, through the exclusive agency of a single transfer company, the restriction of the number of 'off track' stations designated by filed tariffs establishing line haul rates to and from those stations, are all within the jurisdiction of the Commission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner, conceding that the Commission has jurisdiction of the service of the transfer companies in interchanging freight between the stations, insists that the Commission has no jurisdiction or control over the carrier's discretion in selecting their agents to perform that service, and consequently no jurisdiction over a contract by which that discretion is exercised or of a cause of action arising out of its unlawful exercise; that jurisdiction is therefore in the federal court to grant the relief prayed.\n This argument misconceives both the effect and the purpose of section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  26). Under that section jurisdiction of the Commission does not delimit the jurisdiction of the federal courts to restrain violations of the \n\n[288 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Compare United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 17 S.Ct. 540; United States v. Joint Traffic Ass'n, \n171 \nU.S. 505\n, 19 S.Ct. 25. It affects only the capacity of a private party to maintain a suit to restrain violations. See General Investment Company v. New York Central R.R., \n271 \nU.S. 228\n, 46 S.Ct. 496. Its obvious purpose is to preclude any interference by injunction with any business or transactions of interstate carriers of sufficient public significance and importance to be within the jurisdiction of the Commission, except when the suit is brought by the government itself. Here the relief prayed is that performance of the contract be enjoined. Performance necessarily involves the continued designation in the filed tariffs of the Columbia Terminal Company's \n\n[288 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n places of business as the 'off track' stations specified in the contract, and the continued exclusive employment of that company to render the stipulated service; both matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. True, a contract may precede and have existence apart from the several acts required to perform it, and conceivably all of those acts might be done if no contract or agreement to perform them had ever existed. But when they are done in performance of an agreement, there is no way by which the agreement itself can be assailed by injunction except by restraining acts done in performance of it. That, in this case, the statute forbids, not because the contract is within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, but because the acts done in performance of it, which must necessarily be enjoined if any relief is given, are matters subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. See Wheeling & Lake Erie Co. v. Pittsburgh & West Virginia Ry. (C.C.A.) 33 F.( 2d) 390, 392; General Investment Co. v. New York Central R.R. Co.

Viscose Co., \n254 \nU.S. 498\n, 41 S.Ct. 151.\n Section 6(1) (section 6(1), tit. 49, USCA) requires every rail carrier to file schedules of rates applicable between different points on its own route and between points on its own route and on that of any other carrier when a through route has been established. They 'shall plainly state the places between which property and passengers will be carried ... and shall also state separately all terminal charges ... and all other charges which the commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations which ... affect ... any part ... of such aforesaid rates ... or the value of the service rendered to the ... shipper. ...' Tariffs changing the published rates are also required to be filed (section 6(3), and by section 15(7) (section 6(3), 15(7), tit. 49 USCA), the Commission is authorized on its own motion to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of the rate and of any classification, regulation, or practice specified in the tariff.

CO.(1933)\nNo. 559\nArgued: March 20, 1933Decided: May 8, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 334, 335]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Raymond G. Barnett, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Leland Hazard, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n W. S. Dickey Clay Manufacturing Company, a Delaware corporation, owns a stock farm of 300 acres lying near the sewage disposal plant of the city of Harrisonville, Mo. A small, meandering, intermittent stream called Town creek flows through a detached portion of the farm, consisting of 100 acres, devoted solely \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n to pasturage. Since 1923, a drain pipe has discharged into the creek, at a point in the pasture, the effluent from the disposal plant of the city's general sewage system. In 1928, the company brought, in the federal court for western Missouri, this suit against the city, alleging injury to the property through drainage of the effluent from the disposal plant and seeking both damages and an injunction. The land was acquired by the company in 1925 and has been leased ever since. Prior to 1925 it was owned by W. S. Dickey, the president and majority stockholder of the company, who is a resident of Missouri. Jurisdiction of the federal court is based solely on diversity of citizenship. No federal question, constitutional or statutory, is involved.\n The disposal plant consists of an Imhoff tank and the drain. It was installed by the city in 1923, after conference with the public health department of the state; and has since been in continuous use. The tank is a primary method of sewage disposal which removes only 60 per cent. of the putrescible organic matter. An additional plant for further treatment of the sewage, which would have removed 30 per cent. more of such matter, could have been installed in 1923. But such additional treatment was not then common in Missouri; nor was it then recommended by the health department. In 1928, additional treatment of the sewage was recommended by it; but was not required. The population of the city is 2,000; but only about 1,400 of the inhabitants are served by the general sewage system. The cost of the general sewage system and disposal plant was about $60,000. The cost of a secondary disposal plant would be $25,000 to $30,000. It is asserted by the city that it cannot erect such a plant now because it has no surplus revenues and its borrowing capacity is nearly exhausted.\n The District Court found that the detached portion of the company's land used for pasturage is seriously affected by the pollution of Town creek; that the aggregate loss \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n in rental for the five years during which it owned the land had been $500; and that it would cost $3,500 to restore the creek to the condition existing prior to the nuisance. The court, therefore, awarded damages in the sum of $4,000. It held, also, that the company was entitled to an injunction; but allowed the city six months within which to abate the nuisance by introducing some method that would prevent the discharge of putrescible sewage into the creek. Upon an appeal by the city, the Circuit Court of Appeals modified the decree by eliminating therefrom the item of $ 3,500 damages. As so modified the decree was affirmed. 61 F.(2d) 210. The company acquiesced in the modification; and in this court the city did not question the propriety of the award of $500 damages. But, on the ground that the injunction should have been denied, it petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. \n288 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 319, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The city contends that the injunction should not issue, because, according to the law of Missouri, the sewer system and disposal plant constitute a permanent nuisance; that in granting the injunction instead of requiring the company to seek damages for the depreciation of the property, the federal courts acted in direct conflict with the law of the state; and that since the question involved is in essence the extent of rights incident to ownership of real property, the state law is controlling. The company denies that under the decisions of the state courts the nuisance is to be deemed a permanent one; and insists that for this continuing nuisance the remedy of damages is inadequate.\n First. The discharge of the effluent into the creek is a tort; and the nuisance, being continuous or recurrent, is an injury for which an injunction may be granted. Thus, the question here is not one of equitable jurisdiction. The question is whether, upon the facts found, an injunction is the appropriate remedy. For an injunction is \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n not a remedy which issues as of course. Where substantial redress can be afforded by the payment of money and issuance of an injunction would subject the defendant to grossly disproportionate hardship, equitable relief may be denied although the nuisance is indisputable. This is true even if the conflict is between interests which are primarily private. Compare Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & Woolen Co., 2 Black 545, 552, 553.1 Where an important public interest would be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling. \n2\n See Osborne v. Missouri Pacific Railway, \n147 \nU.S. 248, 258\n, 259 S., 13 S.Ct. 299; New York City v. Pine, \n185 \nU.S. 93, 97\n, 22 S.Ct. 592; Cubbins v. Mississippi River Commission (D.C.) 204 F. 299, 307.3 Such we think is the situation in the case at bar. \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n If an injunction is granted, the courses open to the city are (a) to abandon the present sewage disposal plant, erected at a cost of $60,000, and leave the residents to the primitive methods theretofore employed, if the state authorities should permit; or (b) to erect an auxiliary plant at a cost of $25,000 or more, if it should be legally and practically possible to raise that sum. That expenditure would be for a desirable purpose; but the city feels unable to make it. On the other hand, the injury to the company is wholly financial. The pasture land affected by the effluent would be worth it was said, $50 or $60 an acre if the stream were freed from pollution. Denial of the injunction would subject the company to a loss in value of the land amounting, on the basis of the trial court's findings, to approximately $100 per year. That loss can be measured by the reduction in rental or the depreciation in the market value of the farm, assuming the nuisance continues; and can be made good by the payment of money. The compensation payable would obviously be small as compared with the cost of installing an auxiliary plant, for the annual interest on its cost would be many times the annual loss resulting to the company from the nuisance. Complete monetary redress may be given in this suit by making denial of an injunction conditional upon prompt payment as compensation of an amount equal to the depreciation in value of the farm on account of the nuisance complained of. We require this payment not on the ground that the nuisance is to be deemed a permanent one as contended; 4 but because \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n to oblige the company to bring, from time to time, actions at law for its loss in rental would be so onerous as to deny to it adequate relief.\n Second. By the company it is contended that the city should be enjoined because it had the power to condemn the land or its use for sewage purposes. The city questions the existence of that power. We have no occasion to determine this issue of Missouri law. Possession of the right of condemnation would afford added reason why compensation should be substituted for an injunction. \n5\n See Osborne v. Missouri Pacific Ry., \n147 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 13 S.Ct. 299; Winslow v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n188 \nU.S. 646, 660\n, 23 S.Ct. 443; Kamper v. City of Chicago (C.C.A.) 215 F. 706, 708; Woodlawn Trust & Savings Bank v. Drainage District No. 2 (C.C.A.) 251 F. 568, 570.\n Third. By the city it is contended that under the Missouri law a permanent nuisance was created when the disposal plant was installed in 1923; that the cause of \n\n[289 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n action therefor accrued then to the company's grantor; that this cause of action did not pass to the company, and, indeed, has been barred by the statute of limitations; and that, hence, both injunction and damages should be denied. We have no occasion to determine the scope of the doctrine of permanent nuisance as applied in Missouri;6 nor need we consider to what extent the local law on that subject would be accepted as controlling in the federal courts. This nuisance has at all times been removable by the device of secondary treatment of the sewage. It may be hereafter abated at any time by the state health authorities requiring such treatment. The city may itself conclude that this should be done in the public interest, financial, or otherwise.

U.S.(1933)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sigurd Ueland, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Genevieve A. Clark, has been adjudged guilty of a criminal contempt, in that with intent to obstruct justice she gave answers knowingly misleading and others knowingly false in response to questions affecting her qualifications as a juror (D.C.) 1 F.Supp. 747.\n The conviction by the District Court was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit; the proceeding being remanded, however, to correct an error in the sentence. 61 F.(2d) 695. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n287 \nU.S. 595\n, 53 S.Ct. 314, 77 L.Ed. --.\n In September, 1931, there came on for trial in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota an indictment which had been returned against William B. Foshay and others charging them with the use of the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The petitioner was one of the panel of jurors summoned to attend. She did not know when the summons came to her for what case she had been called, and telephoned \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n a sister, Mrs. Brown, that she would like to be excused. She was advised by her sister, who had made inquiry of the clerk of the court, that excuses, if there were any, would have to be presented to the judge. At the same time she was informed that the trial for which she had been summoned was the Foshay trial, and that she would probably not be accepted as a juror since she had been employed by the Foshay Company, a corporation with which the indicted men had been connected as officers.\n On the day appointed for the trial, the petitioner, in company with her husband, reported at the courtroom. The District Judge examined the members of the panel as to their qualifications for service. While the examination was going on, the petitioner stated to several women on the panel that she wished to serve on the jury, that for this she had a special reason, and that she was afraid her former employment by the Foshay Company would disqualify her; that she had worked for the company as a stenographer and typist for about two weeks in the summer of 1929, but did not know or come in contact with any of the defendants personally.\n Her service as stenographer and typist was not the only tie of friendliness that linked her to the ,.foshay firm. There were other contacts or relations that are not without significance, though less direct and personal. Until her marriage in 1922, she had been employed with the title of assistant cashier in a bank at St. Paul, of which Mr. Clark was then the president. Foshay in those years was a customer of the bank as depositor and borrower. Mr. Clark resigned as president in 1925, but his business relations with Foshay continued in the years that followed. Letters that passed between them are printed in the record. The tone is cordial and almost intimate. True, there is nothing to show that the friendly relations had spread to the petitioner. She denies that she had any \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n acquaintance with Foshay or his associates, and the District Court by its findings has accepted her denial. It is next to impossible, however, that her husband, who was with her in the courtroom, had refrained from telling her of his own friendship for one of the prisoners at the bar.\n The petitioner, upon being called to the jury box, was questioned under oath by the judge presiding at the trial. She was asked whether she had ever been in any business of any kind. She answered, 'I have been a stenographer before my marriage, yes.' She was asked in what kind of business she had worked. She answered, 'Well, I did some banking and some real estate and insurance, and I was with an automobile concern, with a Nash agency.' Finally she was asked whether she felt that her mind was free from bias, and whether if accepted as a juror she would be able and willing to base her verdict on the evidence and the law as given to her by the court. To those inquiries she answered that her mind was clear of bias, and that the law and the evidence would govern her in arriving at a verdict.\n The petitioner after thus testifying became a member of the jury, which was thereupon complete. The trial which followed lasted eight weeks. Two officers, a man and a woman, were in charge of the jury from the beginning to the end. During the first week of the trial, the petitioner made the remark to several of her fellow jurors that she regarded Mr. Foshay as a victim of circumstances, that he had gone to New York in the fall of 1929 to borrow $18,000,000, but that, because of the stock market crash, had come back without a dollar. When asked by a juror where she had procured that information, which was not supported by the evidence, she said that it was from a newspaper which she had read before the trial. Later on she gave expression to dissatisfaction with the government because of the way the soldiers were treated after the war. \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n During the deliberations of the jury, after the case was finally submitted, she announced that since the prosecuting attorney had been unable to convince her of the guilt of the accused, the other jurors could hardly be expected to do so. At times she placed her hands over her ears when other jurors tried to reason with her, and argument became useless because she was unwilling to reply. She said of a witness for the government that he had given perjured evidence in the south in an attempt to convict an innocent man. This information had come to her in the course of a conversation with her husband who had seen her at her hotel, in the presence of a bailiff, while the trial was under way. After being kept together for a week, the jury was discharged because unable to agree. The votes of eleven were for conviction. The single vote for acquittal was cast by the petitioner.\n On November 4, 1931, the government filed an information in support of a rule to show cause why the petitioner should not be punished for a criminal contempt. The information charges that her answers upon the voir dire examination were willfully and corruptly false, and that the effect of her misconduct had been to hinder and obstruct the trial. In response to the rule to show cause, the defendant filed an answer denying the misconduct, and alleging that her vote for acquittal had been dictated by her conscience. There was a full and patient hearing by a District Court of two judges. The court found the facts as they have been stated in this opinion. It drew from them the conclusion that the juror had obstructed the administration of justice, when examined on her voir dire, by 'deliberately and intentionally' concealing the fact that she had been employed during the summer of 1929 by the Foshay Company. It drew the conclusion also that she had obstructed the administration of justice by stating falsely that she was free from bias and that her verdict would be based only upon the evidence as \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n introduced, and the law as given by the court. For the contempt thus adjudged there was a sentence of imprisonment and fine.\n\n 1. \nConcealment or misstatement by a juror upon a voir dire examination is punishable as a contempt if its tendency and design are to obstruct the processes of justice.\n There was concealment by the petitioner, and that willful and deliberate. She had been asked to state the kinds of work that she had been doing in other years. She counted off a few, and checked herself at the very point where the count, if completed, would be likely to bar her from the box. There is no room for the excuse of oversight or negligence. She had been warned that disclosure would lead to challenge and rejection. With her mind full of the warning she told the part truth that was useless, and held back the other part that had significance and value. Whether this was perjury or false swearing, there is no occasion to inquire. It was a deliberate endeavor to thwart the process of inquiry, and to turn a trial into a futile form.\n Added to concealment there was positive misstatement. The petitioner stated to the court that her mind was free from bias. The evidence is persuasive that it was hostile to the government. Bias is to be gathered from the disingenuous concealment which kept her in the box. She was intruding into a relation for which she believed herself ineligible, and intruding with a motive. The only plausible explanation is a preconceived endeavor to uphold the cause of the defendants and save them from their doom. Bias, thus revealed at the beginning, is confirmed by everything that followed. While the trial was still in progress, she argued with her fellow jurors that Foshay was a hapless victim of circumstances too strong for him, and went outside the evidence, quoting statements in a newspaper to win them to her view. After the \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n trial was over and deliberations had begun, she waived aside all argument and closed her ears to the debate. She had closed her mind to it before.\n'An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is ... the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest.' White, C.J., in Ex parte Hudgings, \n249 \nU.S. 378, 383\n, 39 S.Ct. 337, 339, 11 A.L. R. 333. The petitioner is not condemned for concealment, though concealment has been proved. She is not condemned for false swearing, though false swearing has been proved. She is condemned for that she made use of false swearing and concealment as the means whereby to accomplish her acceptance as a juror, and under cover of that relation to obstruct the course of justice. There is a distinction not to be ignored between deceit by a witness and deceit by a talesman. A talesman when accepted as a juror becomes a part or member of the court. Ex parte Savin, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S.Ct. 699; United States v. Dachis (D.C.) 36 F.(2d) 601. The judge who examines on the voir dire is engaged in the process of organizing the court. If the answers to the questions are willfully evasive or knowingly untrue, the talesman, when accepted, is a juror in name only. His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted in its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham. What was sought to be attained was the choice of an impartial arbiter. What happened was the intrusion of a partisan defender. If a kinsman of one of the litigants had gone into the jury room disguised as the complaisant juror, the effect would have been no different. The doom of mere sterility was on the trial from the beginning.\n\n The books propound the question whether perjury is contempt, and answer it with nice distinctions. Perjury by a witness has been thought to be not enough where the obstruction to judicial power is only that inherent in the wrong of testifying falsely. Ex parte Hudgings, supra. \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n For offenses of that order the remedy by indictment is appropriate and adequate. On the other hand, obstruction to judicial power will not lose the quality of contempt though one of its aggravations be the commission of perjury. Cf. In re Ulmer (D.C.) 208 F. 461; United States v. Appel (D.C .) 211 F. 495; United States v. Karns (D.C.) 27 F.(2d) 453; United States v. Dachis (D.C.) 36 F.(2d) 601; Lang v. United States (C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 922; Id., \n286 \nU.S. 523\n, 52 S.Ct. 495; United States v. McGovern (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 880. We must give heed to all the circumstances, and of these not the least important is the relation to the court of the one charged as a contemnor. Deceit by an attorney may be punished as a contempt if the deceit is an abuse of the functions of his office (Bowles v. United States (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 848, 851; United States v. Ford (D.C.) 9 F. (2d) 990), and that apart from its punishable quality if it had been the act of some one else. A talesman, sworn as a juror, becomes, like an attorney, an officer of the court, and must submit to like restraints. The petitioner blurs the picture when she splits her misconduct into parts, as if each were a separate wrong to be separately punished. What is punished is misconceived unless conceived of as a unit; the abuse of an official relation by concealment and deceit. Some of her acts or none of them may be punishable as crimes. The result is all one as to her responsibility here and now. She has trifled with the court of which she was a part, and made its processes a mockery. This is contempt, whatever it may be besides. Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 749\n, 49 S. Ct. 471, 63 A.L.R. 1258; Ex parte Savin, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S. Ct. 699.\n\n 2. \nThe admission of testimony as to the conduct of the petitioner during the deliberations of the jury was not a denial or impairment of any lawful privilege.\n The books suggest a doctrine that the arguments and votes of jurors, the media concludendi, are secrets, protected from disclosure unless the privilege is waived. What is said upon the subject in the adjudicated cases is \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n dictum rather than decision. See Woodward v. Leavitt, 107 Mass. 453, 460, 9 Am.Rep. 49; cf. Matter of Cochran, 237 N.Y. 336, 340, 143 N.E. 212, 32 A. L.R. 433; People ex rel. Nunns v. County Court, 188 App.Div. 424, 430, 176 N.Y.S. 858. Even so, the dicta are significant because they bear with them the implications of an immemorial tradition. The doctrine is developed, and the privilege broadly stated, in the writings of a learned author. Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.) vol. 5,  2346. It has recognition to some extent by other authors of repute (Hughes, Evidence, p. 301; Jones, Commentaries on Evidence (2d Ed.)  2212; Chamberlayne, Evidence, vol. 5,  3707), but in a way that has confused it with something very different; the competency of witnesses to testify in impeachment of a verdict. What concerns us at the moment is the privilege alone. There will be need to recur later to the rule as to impeachment. For the origin of the privilege we are referred to ancient usage, and for its defense to public policy. Freedom of debate might be stifled and independence of thought checked if jurors were made to feel that their arguments and ballots were to be freely published to the world. The force of these considerations is not to be gainsaid. But the recognition of a privilege does not mean that it is without conditions or exceptions. The social policy that will prevail in many situations may run foul in others of a different social policy, competing for supremacy. It is then the function of a court to mediate between them, assigning, so far as possible, a proper value to each, and summoning to its aid all the distinctions and analogies that are the tools of the judicial process. The function is the more essential where a privilege has its origin in inveterate but vague tradition, and where no attempt has been made either in treatise or in decisions to chart its limits with precision.\n Assuming that there is a privilege which protects from impertinent exposure the arguments and ballots of a juror \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n while considering his verdict, we think the privilege does not apply where the relation giving birth to it has been fraudulently begun or fraudulently continued. Other exceptions may have to be made in other situations not brought before us now. It is sufficient to mark the one that is decisive of the case at hand. The privilege takes as its postulate a genuine relation, honestly created and honestly maintained. If that condition is not satisfied, if the relation is merely a sham and a pretense, the juror may not invoke a relation dishonestly assumed as a cover and cloak for the concealment of the truth. In saying this we do not mean that a mere charge of wrongdoing will avail without more to put the privilege to flight. There must be a showing of a prima facie case sufficient to satisfy the judge that the light should be let in. \n1\n Upon that showing being made, the debates and ballots in the jury room are admissible as corroborative evidence, supplementing and confirming the case that would exist without them. Let us assume for illustration a prosecution for bribery. Let us assume that there is evidence, direct or circumstantial, that money has been paid to a juror in consideration of his vote. The argument for the petitioner, if accepted, would bring us to a holding that the case for the people must go to the triers of the facts without proof that the vote has been responsive to the bribe. This is paying too high a price for the assurance to a juror of serenity of mind. People ex rel. Nunns v. County Court, supra. \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n We turn to the precedents in the search for an analogy, and the search is not in vain. There is a privilege protecting communications between attorney and client. The privilege takes flight if the relation is abused. A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told. There are early cases apparently to the effect that a mere charge of illegality, not supported by any evidence, will set the confidences free. See, e.g., Reynell v. Sprye, 10 Beav. 51, 54, 11 Beav. 618; In re Postlewaite, 35 Ch. D. 722, 724; cf. Regina v. Bollivant, (1900) 2 Q.B.D. 163, (1901) A.C. 196. But this conception of the privilege is without support in later rulings. 'It is obvious that it would be absurd to say that the privilege could be got rid of merely by making a charge of fraud.' O'Rourke v. Darbishire, (1920) A.C. 581, 604. To drive the privilege away, there must be 'something to give colour to the charge'; there must be 'prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact.' O'Rourke v. Darbishire, loc. cit., supra; also pp. 614, 622, 631, 633 of ( 1920) A.C. When that evidence is supplied, the seal of secrecy is broken. See, also, Regina v. Cox, (1884) 14 Q.B.D. 153, 157, 161, 175; cf. Bujac v. Wilson, 27 N.M. 112, 196 P. 513; In re Niday, 15 Idaho, 559, 98 P. 845. The judgment of the House of Lords in O'Rourke v. Darbishire has given to the whole subject a definitive exposition. Nor does the loss of the privilege depend upon the showing of a conspiracy, upon proof that client and attorney are involved in equal guilt. The attorney may be innocent, and still the guilty client must let the truth come out. Regina v. Cox, supra; Matthews v. Hoagland, 48 N.J.Eq. 455, 469, 21 A. 1054; State v. Faulkner, 175 Mo. 546, 593, 75 S.W. 116; Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Smithhart, 183 Ky. 679, 684, 211 S.W. 441, 5 A.L.R. 972; State v. Kidd, 89 Iowa, 54, 56 N.W. 263; \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n cf. Bank of Utica v. Mersereau, 3 Barb.Ch.(N.Y.) 528, 598, 49 Am.Dec. 189; Coveney v. Tannahill, 1 Hill (N.Y.) 33, 41, 37 Am.Dec. 287.\n With the aid of this analogy, we recur to the social policies competing for supremacy. A privilege surviving until the relation is abused and vanishing when abuse is shown to the satisfaction of the judge has been found to be a workable technique for the protection of the confidences of client and attorney. Is there sufficient reason to believe that it will be found to be inadequate for the protection of a juror? No doubt the need is weighty that conduct in the jury room shall be untrammeled by the fear of embarrassing publicity. The need is no less weighty that it shall be pure and undefiled. A juror of integrity and reasonable firmness will not fear to speak his mind if the confidences of debate are barred to the ears of mere impertinence or malice. He will not expect to be shielded against the disclosure of his conduct in the event that there is evidence reflecting upon his honor. The chance that now and then there may be found some timid soul who will take counsel of his fears and give way to their repressive power is too remote and shadowy to shape the course of justice. It must yield to the overmastering need, so vital in our polity, of preserving trial by jury in its purity against the inroads of corruption. Cf. Attorney General v. Pelletier, 240 Mass. 264, 134 N.E. 407; People ex rel. Hirschberg v. Board of Supervisors, 251 N.Y. 156, 170, 167 N.E. 204; State v. Campbell, 73 Kan. 688, 85 P. 784, 9 L.R.A.( N.S.) 533, 9 Ann.Cas. 1203\n\n\n Nothing in our decision impairs the authority of Bushell's Case, Vaughan, 135, 1670, with its historic vindication of the privilege of jurors to return a verdict freely according to their conscience. There had been a trial of Penn and Mead on a charge of taking part in an unlawful assembly. The jurors found a verdict of acquittal, though in so doing they refused to follow the instructions of the \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n court. For this they were fined and imprisoned, but were discharged on habeas corpus, Vaughan, C.J., pronouncing 'that memorable opinion which soon ended the fining of jurors for their verdicts, and vindicated their character as judges of fact.' Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, p. 167. Bushell's Case was born of the fear of the Star Chamber and of the tyranny of the Stuarts. Plucknett, Concise History of the Common Law, p. 114. It stands for a great principle, which is not to be whittled down or sacrificed. On the other hand, it is not to be strained and distorted into fanciful extensions. There is a peril of corruption in these days which is surely no less than the peril of coercion. The true significance of Bushell's Case is brought out with clearness in declaratory statutes. By one of these, a statute of New York, 'No juror shall be questioned (for any verdict rendered by him), or be subject to any action, ... civil or criminal, except to indictment for corrupt conduct in rendering such verdict, in the cases prescribed by law.' R.S. of N.Y., part 3, c. 7, title 4,  69; Civil Rights Law (Consol. Laws, c. 6)  14. The Revisers tell us in their notes that the statute, though new in form, is declaratory of an ancient principle (R.S. (2d Ed.) vol. 3, p. 741), and so we may assume it is. Matter of Cochran, 237 N.Y. 336, 340, 143 N.E. 212, 32 A.L.R. 433; cf. People ex rel. Nunns v. County Court, supra, 188 App. Div. at page 448, 176 N.Y.S. 858. It would give no help to the petitioner though it were enacted for the federal courts. She has not been held to answer for any verdict that she has rendered, nor for anything said or done in considering her verdict. Matter of Cochran, supra. She has been held to answer for the deceit whereby she made herself a juror, and was thereby placed in a position to vote upon the case at all. What was said and done in the jury room is not the gist of her wrongdoing. What was said and done in the jury room is no more than confirmatory evidence of her state of mind \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n before. One could urge with as much reason that she would be subjected to coercion if she had been indicted and tried for bribery and the same evidence had been accepted in support of the indictment.\n Nor is there anything in our decision at variance with the rule, which is not without exceptions (Mattox v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 140, 148\n, 13 S.Ct. 50; cf. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 5,  2353, 2354; Woodward v. Leavitt, 107 Mass. 453, 9 Am.Rep. 49; Hyman v. Eames (C. C.) 41 F. 676; Fuller v. Fletcher (C.C.) 44 F. 34, 39), that the testimony of a juror is not admissible for the impeachment of his verdict. McDonald v. Pless, \n238 \nU.S. 264\n, 35 S.Ct. 783. Here there was no verdict, and hence none to be impeached. But in truth the rule against impeachment is wholly unrelated to the problem now before us, the limits of the privilege to maintain a confidence inviolate. Wigmore, supra,  2346. Impeachment may be forbidden though the jurors waive their privilege, and combine with the defeated litigant to make the verdict null. Privilege may be asserted though there is nothing to impeach.\n In the record now before us the evidence of guilt is ample, without the happenings in the jury room, to break down the claim of privilege, and thus let in the light. There is the evidence of the concealment of the petitioner's employment with all its sinister implications. There is the evidence of her arguments with the jurors while the trial was going on. There is even the evidence of her vote, for the fact that she had voted for acquittal had been stated in her answer, and to the extent of the voluntary disclosure the privilege had been waived. Indeed what happened in the jury room added so little to the case that the error, if there had been any, in permitting it to be proved, would have to be regarded as unsubstantial and without effect on the result. No one can read the findings of the triers of the facts and hesitate in concluding that even with this evidence omitted \n\n[289 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n there would have been an adjudication of contempt. In considering with all this fullness the merits of the ruling, we have been moved by the desire to build securely for the future.\n\n 3. \nThe oath of a contemnor is no longer a bar to a prosecution for contempt.\n Little was left of that defense after the decision of this court in United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 574\n, 27 S.Ct. 165, 8 Ann.Cas. 265. Since then there has been no purgation by oath where an overt act of defiance is the gist of the offense. The point was reserved whether sworn disavowal would retain its ancient force 'if the sole question were the intent of an ambiguous act.'\n The time has come, we think, to renounce the doctrine altogether and stamp out its dying embers. It has ceased to be a defense in England since 1796. Matter of Crossley, 6 Term Reports 701. It has been rejected generally in the states. Dale v. State, 198 Ind. 110, 150 N.E. 781, 49 A.L.

It has even lost, since the decision in the Shipp Case, the title to respect that comes of a long historical succession. It has taken its place with ordeal and wager of law and trial by battle among the dimly remembered curios of outworn modes of trial.

Levin, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an order made by a deferee in bankruptcy under section 60d of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.  96(d), 11 USCA  96(d), appellants were directed to turn over to the trustee in bankruptcy the sum of $2,000, which was part of an amount paid to them by the bankrupt corporation for legal serv- \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 474]\n\u00a0\n ices rendered shortly before the filing of an involuntary petition. The order was sustained by the District Court (In re David Bell Scarves, Inc., 52 F.(2d) 755) and by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 61 F.(2d) 771. This Court granted certiorari. Conrad, Rubin & Lesser v. Pender, \n289 \nU.S. 715\n, 53 S.Ct. 526, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The only question presented is raised by the appellants' challenge of the jurisdiction of the referee to re-examine the payment under section 60d. The payment was made on November 5, 1930, and the petition in bankruptcy was filed twelve days later. There is no room for controversy as to the facts which are thus stated by the Court of Appeals: The corporation was in financial difficulties and unable to meet its maturing obligations. Prior to retaining the appellants, it had engaged another attorney to negotiate a settlement with its creditors, and a meeting with some of its creditors had been held. Apparently the appellants wee retained to supplement the efforts of that attorney, to whom $750 had already been paid upon a promised fee of $2,000. The testimony of one of the appellants, given at an examination under section 21a (11 USCA  44(a), was to the effect that he was to negotiate with creditors for a 50 per cent. cash settlement and was to assist the corporation in hypothecating its accounts receivable in order to obtain the necessary money to carry out such a settlement. His affidavit, submitted in opposition to the referee's jurisdiction, stated that the most extreme course which was within the contemplation of himself and David Bell, bankrupt's president, was continuance of the business under an equity receivership, although that course was not contemplated if the business could be continued under the supervision of a a committee of creditors or of a representative of the New York Creditors' Adjustment Bureau, Inc. It also appeared that within two weeks prior to November 5th, when the appellants' retainer was paid, David Bell had withdrawn \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n $1,500 from the corporation, and his brother, an employee, had withdrawn $ 750. The cash resources of the corporation were so low that appellants' retainer could not be paid until a sale of merchandise was made, and the purchaser's check for $2,500 was then indorsed to appellants.\n The District Court concluded that the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling motive of the debtor corporation when its president retained appellants. And the Court of Appeals was of the opinion that in these circumstances the payment ws made 'in contemplation' of bankruptcy within the meaning of section 60d. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n That provision has been held to be sui generis. It does not con emplate a plenary suit, but a summary proceeding. In re Wood & Henderson, \n210 U.S. 246\n, 251-253, 28 S.Ct. 621, 624. The class of cases to which it refers is not that of preferences or of fraudulent conveyances. Id. The provision authorizes re-examination of payments or transfers when made by a debtor (1) 'in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or against him,' (2) 'to an attorney and counselor at law, solicitor in equity, or proctor in admiralty,' and (3) 'for services to be rendered.' Such payments or transfers are only to 'be held valid to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the trustee for the benefit of the estate.'\n The language of the provision, and the indicated scope of the legal services embraced within it, distinguish it \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 476]\n\u00a0\n from the provision of section 64b(3), 11 U.S.C. 104(b)(3), 11 USCA  104(b)( 3),2 with respect to the priority of a reasonable attorney's fee in the distribution of an estate in bankruptcy. \n3\n See Furth v. Stahl, 205 Pa. 439, 442, 55 A. 29, 30; Pratt v. Bothe (C.C.A.) 130 F. 670, 673. Section 60d relates to payments and transfers made by the bankrupt prior to bankruptcy from his own property for services to be rendered to him; section 64b(3) to an allowance to be made for legal services out of the estate under administration. See In re Rolnick (C.C.A.) 294 F. 817, 819. The services within the latter provision are those rendered in aid of the administration of the estate and the carrying out of the provisions of the act. See Randolph v. Scruggs, \n190 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 23 S.Ct. 710; In re Kross (D.C.) 96 F. 816; In re Mayer (D.C.) 101 F. 695; In re Rosenthal & Lehman (D.C.) 120 F. 848; In re Christianson (D.C.) 175 F. 867. Section 60d, authorizing a re-examination of payments and transfers by the bankrupt for services to be rendered, has a broader scope. It contains no intimation of an intention to limit the jurisdiction to re-examine to a particular sort of legal services for the payment of which the debtor has disposed of his property. The point of the provision conferring jurisdiction for a summary re-examination is not the specific nature of the legal services to be rendered, but that the \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 477]\n\u00a0\n payment or transfer to provide for them is made 'in contemplation' of bankruptcy. The purpose is shown by the sweeping description of payments or transfers 'to an attorney and counselor at law, solicitor in equity, or proctor in admiralty.'\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that the criteria of jurisdiction to re-examine are distinct from the criteria of the decision on the merits. As to the jurisdiction to re-examine, the controlling question is with respect to the state of mind of the debtor and whether the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction. Compare United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 117\n, 118 S., 51 S.Ct. 446. Tripp v. Mitschrich (C.C.A.) 211 F. 424, 427. If the payment or transfer was thus motivated, it may be re-examined and its reasonableness be determined. Undoubtedly, while the question thus relates to the debtor's motive, the nature of the services which he seeks and for which he pays may be taken into consideration as it may throw light upon his motive. It is not impossible that the services may have been so wholly separate from any exigency of bankruptcy as to indicate that the thought of bankruptcy ws in no sense controlling. But, given the fact that the payment or transfer was in contemplation of bankruptcy, the inducement of the transaction affords, from the standpoint of the statute, sufficient ground for authorizing a summary inquiry into its reasonableness. The manifest purpose of the provision is to safeguard the assets of those who are acting in contemplation of bankruptcy, so that these assets may be brought quickly and without unnecessary expense into the hands of the trustee, and to provide a restraint upon opportunities to make an unreasonable disposition of property through arrangement for excessive payments for prospective legal services. In re Wood & Henderson, supra; Pratt v. Bothe, supra. We said in the case of Wood & Henderson that the statute 'recognizes \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too liberally with his property in employing counsel to protect him in view of financial reverses and probable failure. It recognizes the right of such a debtor to have the aid and advice of counsel and, in contemplation of bankruptcy proceedings which shall strip him of his property, to make provisions for reasonable compensation to his counsel. And, in view of the circumstances, the act makes provision that the bankruptcy court administering the estate may, if the trustee or any creditor question the transaction, re-examine it with a view to a determination of its reasonableness.'\n In this view, we are unable to conclude that the question whether the services for which the payment or transfer is made are 'germane to the aims of the Bankruptcy Act,' as suggested in some of the decisions,4 furnishes the test of the jurisdiction to re-examine. The test of jurisdiction, we repeat, is given by the express language of the statute. In the exercise of jurisdiction, all questions bearing upon the reasonableness of the transaction, including the purpose and nature of the services, are open to consideration. But it is insisted, in the instant case, that the payment to appellants could not properly be regarded as made in contemplation of bankruptcy, and hence within the jurisdiction to re-examine, because the payment was for the purpose of engaging appellants to conduct negotiations with creditors in order to arrange for an extension of time, and, if necessary, for the operation of the business under the creditors' supervision, and thus to avoid a forced liquidation and ultimately to restore the business to a sound basis. We find no ground for saying that the fact that such purposes were in view establishes, as matter of law, that the payment was not in contempla- \n\n[289 U.S. 472, 479]\n\u00a0\n tion of bankruptcy. On the contrary, negotiations to prevent bankruptcy may demonstrate that the thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the payment. 'A man is usually very much in contemplation of a result which he employs counsel to avoid.' Furth v. Stahl, supra. See, also, In re Klein-Moffett Co. (D.C.) 27 F.(2d) 444; Slattery v. Dillon (C.C.A.) 17 F.(2d) 347; In re Lang (D.C.) 20 F.(2d) 239.\n We are of the opinion that the court had jurisdiction to make the order under review.\n Order affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 60d provides as follows: '(d) If a debtor shall, directly or indirectly, in contemplation of the filing of a petition by or against him, pay money or trasnfer property to an attorney and counselor at law, solicitor in equity, or proctor in admiralty for services to be rendered, the transaction shall be reexamined by the court on petition of the trustee or any creditor and shall only be held valid to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the trustee for the benefit of the estate.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 64b(3) provides: '(b) The debts to have priority, except as herein provided, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment shall be ...

Gold, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an original proceeding in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin appellant unsuccessfully sought a writ commanding the judge of the circuit court of Milwaukee county to desist from further proceedings in the cause instituted against it by Katherine Gold to recover principal and interest of certain bonds then in default. The \n\n[289 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n petition disclosed the circumstances under which the original summons and complaint were served upon the president of the corporation and alleged that although the circuit court had not acquired jurisdiction it was about to enter judgment contrary to the inhibition of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n An alternative writ issued. The trial judge-appellee here-made a return in which he incorporated the evidence relied on to sustain his conclusion that jurisdiction had been acquired through service of summons as authorized by statute. The Supreme Court ruled that the statute- Wisconsin Statutes (1931)  262.09-had been properly construed and applied; also that there was nothing to show conflict with the Federal Constitution. Accordingly the prayer for relief was denied. State v. Gregory, 245 N.W. 194. The validity of the statute was adequately challenged: the matter is here by appeal.\n In the circumstances we must ascertain for ourselves the facts disclosed by the record. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 265\n, 37 S.Ct. 280; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 325 S., 42 S.Ct. 124, 27 A.L.R. 375. These appear from the pleadings and three affidavits presented in the trial court on the motion to vacate service of the summons-one by Frederick Rupprecht in support of the motion and two in opposition by Walter L. Gold and Morris Karon.\n It appears:\n The Consolidated Textile Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. It has never been licensed to do business in Wisconsin; has no place of business or property therein, and no officer or agent is stationed in that state. Its principal place of business is New York City and its president, Frederick K. Rupprecht, resides there.\n In 1921 the corporation issued and sold a series of twenty-year, 8 per cent. bonds, with interest coupons payable semiannually. Coupons due December 1, 1930, and \n\n[289 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n thereafter were not paid. A bondholders' committee received on deposit 70 per cent. of the outstanding bonds.\n Walter L. Gold, an attorney with offices in Milwaukee, Wis., and others represented by him, owners of $9,200 of these bonds, declined to deposit them with the committee and caused suit to be brought in the Municipal Court, New York City, to recover interest which fell due December 1, 1930. In that suit motion for summary judgment was granted.\n Rupprecht, president of the corporation, believing that the interest of all bondholders would be subserved if final judgment were withheld, by communications sent from New York sought a conference with Gold at Milwaukee for the purpose of acquainting him with the facts and dissuading him from permitting final judgment. He with reluctance assented. With the sole purpose of engaging in such conference and without intending to submit the corporation to the jurisdiction of the state of Wisconsin, Rupprecht went to Gold's law office in Milwaukee on the morning of January 14, 1932. His intention was to discuss the New York suit and to present facts which he believed would cause Gold to withhold final judgment in the New York case and agree to deposit his own bonds and recommend the deposit of others with the bondholders' committee.\n During an interview lasting one and one-half hours in the attorney's office sundry matters relating to the corporation's affairs were discussed. While there Rupprecht was served with summonses (also complaints) addressed to the corporation commanding that it appear and answer in separate actions instituted by Katherine Gold and six others to recover upon certain of the above-described bonds and interest-all of whom Gold represented. In anticipation of Rupprecht's arrival in Milwaukee the summonses and complaints had been prepared. \n\n[289 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n In his affidavit Gold stated that he had 'been informed that through Consolidated Selling Co., Inc., which is the selling agency for Consolidated Textile Corporation and is a subsidiary wholly controlled by Consolidated Textile Corporation and is an agent of Consolidated Textile Corporation, the Consolidated Textile Corporation sells goods in Wisconsin, to-wit: to Gimbel Bros. in Milwaukee and Sears, Roebuck & Co., in Milwaukee.'\n The unimportance of the statement concerning acts of the controlled corporation-Consolidated Selling Company-is clear enough in the light of what we said in Cannon Mfg. Co. v. Cudahy Packing Co., \n267 \nU.S. 333, 336\n, 337 S., 45 S.Ct. 250.\n In order to hold a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in a state responsible under the process of a local court the record must disclose that it was carrying on business there at the time of attempted service. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 579, 583\n, 585 S., 34 S.Ct. 944\n\n\n'The general rule deducible from all our decisions is that the business must be of such nature and character as to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the state or district where service is attempted.'

That section, which is a re-enactment in identical language of section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 979 (19 USCA  481), declares that officers of the Coast Guard are authorized to stop and board any vessel at any place within four leagues (12 miles) of the coast of the United States 'to examine the manifest and to inspect, search, and examine' the vessel and any merchandise therein; and if it shall appear that any violation of any law of the United States has been committed by reason of which the vessel or merchandise is liable to forfeiture, it shall be the duty of such officers to seize the same.\n On the evening of November 1, 1930, the British motor screw Mazel Tov, a vessel of speed not exceeding 10 miles an hour, was discovered by officers of the Coast Guard within four leagues of the coast of Massachusetts, and was boarded by them at a point 11 1\/2 miles from the nearest land. The manifest was demanded and exhibited. Search followed, which disclosed that the only cargo on board, other than ship stores, was unmanifested intoxicating liquor which had been cleared from St. Pierre, a French possession. The vessel, ostensibly bound for Nassau, a British possession, had, when boarded, been cruising off our coast with the intent that ultimately the liquor should be taken to the United States by other boats. But the evidence indicated that she did not intend to approach nearer than four leagues to our coast; and, so far as ap- \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n peared, she had not been in communication with our shores and had not unladen any part of her cargo. The boarding officers seized the Mazel Tov at a point more than 10 miles from our coast; took her to the Port of Providence; and there delivered the vessel and cargo to the customs officials.\n The Collector of Customs, acting pursuant to section 584 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USCA  1584), assessed against Frank Cook, as master of the Mazel Tov, a penalty of $14,286.18 for failure to include the liquor in the manifest. By section 584, if merchandise not described in the manifest is found on board a vessel 'bound to the United States,' the master is subject to a penalty equal to its value, and the merchandise, belonging or consigned to him is subject to forfeiture. By section 594 of the act (19 USCA  1594), whenever a master becomes subject to a penalty, the vessel may be seized and proceeded against summarily by libel to recover the penalty. The government proceeded, in the federal court for Rhode Island, to collect the assessed penalty by means of libels against both the cargo and the vessel. The cases were consolidated.\n Cook, claiming as master and bailee of the vessel and as consignee and claimant of the cargo, alleged that the Mazel Tov was of British registry and owned by a Novo Scotia corporation. He answered to the merits; and excepted to the jurisdiction on the ground that the 'vessel was not seized within the territorial limits of any jurisdiction of the United States, but, on the contrary, was captured and boarded at a point more than four (4) leagues from the coast,' and that 'it was not the intention at any time to enter any of the territorial limits of the United States.'\n The District Court, having found the facts above stated, dismissed the libels. The Mazel Tov, 51 F.(2d) 292. The government appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the Treaty did not 'effect a change in the customs-revenue laws of the United States, wherein Congress had \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n fixed a fourleague protective zone'; reversed the judgments; and remanded the cases to the District Court for further proceedings. 56 F.(2d) 921, 923. This Court granted certiorari. \n1\n Cook v. U.S., \n287 \nU.S. 581\n, 53 S.Ct. 10, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Cook contends, among other things, that by reason of the Treaty between the United States and Great Britain proclaimed May 22, 1924 (43 Stat. 1761), the seizure was unlawful under the laws of the United States; that the authority conferred by section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 to board, search, and seize within the four-league limit, was, as respects British vessels,2 modified by the Treaty so as \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n to substitute for four leagues from our coast, the distance which 'can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense'; that Congress, by re-enacting section 581 in the Tariff Act of 1930, intended to continue in force the modification effected by the Treaty; and, hence, that the Mazel Tov, being a British vessel of a speed not exceeding 10 miles an hour, could not be lawfully boarded, searched, and seized at a distance of 11 1\/2 miles from the coast because suspected of 'endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States in violation of the laws there in force.'\n The government insists that the Treaty did not have the effect of so modifying section 581 of the act of 1922; and that, if it did, the re- enactment of section 581 without change, by the act of 1930, removed the alleged modification. It contends further that the validity of the seizure was not material; and if ever material had been waived.\n The Treaty (43 Stat. 1761) provides, among other things, as follows:\n'Article I. The High Contracting Parties declare that it is their firm intention to uphold the principle that 3 marine miles extending from the coast line outwards and measured from low-water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters.\n\n'Article II. (1) His Britannic Majesty agrees that he will raise no objection to the boarding of private vessels under the British flag outside the limits of territorial \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n waters by the authorities of the United States, its territories or possessions in order that enquiries may be addressed to those on board and an examination be made of the ship's papers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the vessel or those on board are endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States, its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there in force. When such enquiries and examination show a reasonable ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may be instituted.\n\n'(2) If there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit an offense against the laws of the United States, its territories or possessions prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages, the vessel may be seized and taken into a port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with such laws.\n\n'(3) The rights conferred by this article shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United States its territories or possessions than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense. In cases, however, in which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the one boarded and searched, it shall be the speed of such other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which shall determine the distance from the coast at which the right under this article can be exercised.'\n\n We are of opinion that the decrees entered by the District Court should have been affirmed.\n First. It is suggested on behalf of the government that the power to search and seize within the twelve-mile zone, conferred upon officers of the Coast Guard by section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922, was unaffected by the Treaty, save that the British government agreed not to protest where the seizure was within an hour's sailing distance of the \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n coast. The argument is that the Treaty settled the validity of the seizure only for those cases where it was made within the limits described in the Treaty; and that since this seizure was made beyond one hour's sailing distance from the coast the Treaty did not apply. \n3\n In construing the Treaty its history should be consulted. Compare United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1\n, 16 S.Ct. 725; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606\n, 43 S.Ct. 221; Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 49 S.Ct. 223. Both its language and its history show that the high contracting parties did not intend so to limit its operation. The preamble states that they entered into the Treaty 'being desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise between them in connection with the laws in force in the United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages.' The history reveals that serious differences had arisenbetween the two governments in that connection; and that, for the purpose of resolving them, the parties determined to deal completely with the subject of search and seizure, beyond our territorial limits, of British vessels suspected of smuggling liquors.\n Prior to the Eighteenth Amendment, the United States had never attempted, in connection with the enforcement of our customs laws, to board foreign vessels beyond the three-mile limit, except where consent was implied from the fact that the vessel, being hailed, answered that she was bound for the United States, or where a vessel had been discovered violating our laws within the three-mile limit, and, while endeavoring to escape, was hotly pursued. Although Hovering Acts conferring authority to board and search vessels, foreign and domestic, 'within four leagues of the coast,' had existed since the foundation of our government, see Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35,  31, \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 113]\n\u00a0\n 1 Stat. 145, 164,4 the authority therein conferred had, prior to the Tariff Act of 1922, been in terms limited to inbound vessels; and no statute had purported to confer authority to seize foreign vessels beyond our territorial waters for violation of any of our laws, except in those few instances in which Congress acted pursuant to specific treaties. \n5\n But soon after the Eighteenth Amendment took effect (January 16, 1920), vessels of British registry were found to be engaged in smuggling intoxicating liquors into the United States in violation of our laws. \n6\n In the effort to prevent such violations, British vessels were being boarded, searched, and seized beyond the three-mile limit; 7 and by section 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 Con- \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 114]\n\u00a0\n gress undertook to sanction such action through enlarging the authority to board, search, and seize beyond the three-mile limit so as to include foreign vessels, although not inbound.8.\n Both before and after the passage of the Tariff Act of 1922 it was the consistent policy of our government to release, upon protest, all British vessels seized beyond the three-mile limit and not bound to the United States, unless it appeared that the hovering vessel had, by means of her own small boats and crew, assisted in landing there contraband goods. \n9\n Our government deemed that ex- \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 115]\n\u00a0\n ception an essential to the enforcement of our laws and consistent with the principles of international law. \n10\n But the British government declined to acquiesce in the propriety of the exception; declared that our practice of seizing vessels under those circumstances was not in harmony with the law of nations;11 protested against the seizure of any British vessel outside of the three-mile limit;12 and stated that insistence upon the practice would be regarded as creating 'a very serious situation.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n With a view to removing the British objections, the Secretary of State proposed, on June 26, 1922, that a treaty be entered into 'under which the authorities of each nation would be authorized to exercise beyond the \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 116]\n\u00a0\n three-mile limit of territorial waters a measure of control over vessels belonging to the other' and which would include specifically 'reciprocal provisions authorizing the authorities of each Government to exercise a right of search of vessels of the other beyond the three-mile limit of territorial waters to the extent of twelve miles from the shore.' \n14\n The British government declined definitely to entertain any such proposal. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The decision rendered by this Court on April 30, 1923, in Cunard Steamship Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100\n, 43 S.Ct. 504, 27 A.L. R. 1306, led to the resumption of negotiations. It was there decided that the National Prohibition Act applied to all merchant vessels, foreign or domestic, within the territorial waters of the United States, and that the carrying of intoxicating liquors, either as cargo or as sea stores, through the territorial waters or into the ports and harbors of the United States is forbidden by that act and the Eighteenth Amendment. The embarrassment to British vessels and trade threatened by this decision was serious. \n16\n Recognizing the urgent need of some arrangement between the \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 117]\n\u00a0\n two governments which would permit the conduct by the British of legitimate trade and remove this obstacle to the operation of their vessels in the accustomed manner, the Secretary of State submitted to Great Britain, on June 11, 1923, the draft of a treaty designed to remove the friction between the two governments. The draft did not refer specifically to intoxicating liquors. Article I provided, in general terms, that the authorities of each country should 'within the distance of twelve geographical miles from its coasts' be permitted to board and search private vessels of the other to ascertain whether such vessels were engaged in an attempt to violate its laws 'prohibiting or regulating the unloading near, or importation into its territories of any article'; and 'if there is reasonable cause for belief' that the vessel is so engaged to seize it. Article II, likewise, in general terms, provided that articles on private vessels of either nation listed as sea stores, or as cargo destined to a foreign port, the importation of which is prohibited, might be brought within the territorial waters of the other on condition that they be sealed 'upon arrival of the vessel so destined within twelve geographical miles of the coasts' and be kept sealed continuously thereafter while within the territorial waters.\n This proposal of the Secretary of State also failed to meet with the approval of the British government because it was regarded as involving an extension of the limits of the territorial waters. \n17\n The negotiations were, however, continued; and ultimately the British government submitted a counter proposal, which sought to achieve the same results by different means. The British draft provided that the high contracting parties should \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 118]\n\u00a0\n declare 'their firm intention to uphold the principle that three marine miles measured from low water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters'; and, avoiding all language which could possibly indicate a contrary purpose, it made no reference to the twelve-mile limit. Moreover, the arrangement, instead of applying generally to merchandise subject to prohibitory or regulatory laws, was to be limited specifically to intoxicating liquors; and no reciprocal rights were to be conferred. Each country was to secure the immunity required to satisfy its peculiar need. The need of the United States was to be met by providing that His Britannic Majesty 'will raise no objection to the boarding,' etc., outside the territorial waters at no 'greater distance from the coast of the United States than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of' smuggling. The need of Great Britain was to be met by our allowing 'British vessels voyaging to or from the ports or passing through the waters of the United States to have on board alcoholic liquors listed as sea stores or as cargo destined for a foreign port, provided that such liquor is kept under seal while within the jurisdiction of the United States.' \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The draft of treaty submitted by the British government was accepted with a few purely verbal changes. Thereby, as stated in Ford v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 593, 609\n, 610 S., 47 S.Ct. 531, 536, this country secured 'a definite fixing of the zone of legitimate seizure of British hovering vessels seeking to defeat the laws against importation of liquor into this country from the sea.'\n Second. The Treaty, being later in date than the act of 1922, superseded, so far as inconsistent with the terms of the act, the authority which had been conferred by section 581 upon officers of the Coast Guard to board, search, \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 119]\n\u00a0\n and seize beyond our territorial waters. Whitney v. Robertson, \n124 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 8 S.Ct. 456. For in a strict sense the Treaty was self-executing, in that no legislation was necessary to authorize executive action pursuant to its provisions. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The purpose of the provisions for seizure in section 581, and their practical operation, as an aid in the enforcement of the laws prohibiting alcoholic liquors, leave no doubt that the territorial limitations there established were modified by the Treaty. This conclusion is supported by the course of administrative practice. Shortly after the Treaty took effect, the Treasury Department issued amended instructions for the Coast Guard which pointed out, after reciting the provisions of section 581, that 'in cases of special treaties, the provisions of those treaties shall be complied with'; and called attention particularly to the recent treaties dealing with the smuggling of intoxicating liquors. \n20\n The Commandant of the Coast Guard, moreover, was informed in 1927, as the Solicitor General states, that all seizures of British vessels captured in the rum-smuggling trade should be within the terms of the Treaty, and that seizing officers should be instructed to produce evidence, not that the vessel was found within the four-league limit, but that she was apprehended within one hour's sailing distance from the coast.\n Third. The Treaty was not abrogated by re-enacting section 581 in the Tariff Act of 1930 in the identical terms of the \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 120]\n\u00a0\n act of 1922. A treaty will not be deemed to have been abrogated or modified by a later statute, unless such purpose on the part of Congress has been clearly expressed. Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536\n, 5 S. Ct. 255; United States v. Payne, \n264 \nU.S. 446, 448\n, 44 S.Ct. 352. Here, the contrary appears. The committee reports and the debates upon the act of 1930, like the re-enacted section itself, make no reference to the Treaty of 1924. Any doubt as to the construction of the section should be deemed resolved by the consistent departmental practice existing before its re-enactment. Compare United States v. G. Falk & Brother, \n204 \nU.S. 143\n, 27 S.Ct. 191; Nagle v. Loi Hoa, \n275 \nU.S. 475, 481\n, 48 S.Ct. 160; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510; United States v. Ryan, \n284 \nU.S. 167, 175\n, 52 S.Ct. 65. No change, in this respect, was made either by the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Justice after the Tariff Act of 1930\n\n\n Searches and seizures in the enforcement of the laws prohibiting alcoholic liquors are governed, since the 1930 act, as they were before, by the provisions of the Treaty. Section 581, with its scope narrowed by the Treaty, remained in force after its re-enactment in the act of 1930. The section continued to apply to the boarding, search, and seizure of all vessels of all countries with which we had no relevant treaties. It continued also, in the enforcement of our customs laws not related to the prohibition of alcoholic liquors, to govern the boarding of vessels of those countries with which we had entered into treaties like that with Great Britain.\n Fourth. As the Mazel Tov was seized without warrant of law, the libels were properly dismissed. The government contends that the alleged illegality of the seizure is immaterial. It argues that the facts proved show a violation of our law for which the penalty of forfeiture is prescribed; that the United States may, by filing a libel \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 121]\n\u00a0\n for forfeiture, ratify what otherwise would have been an illegal seizure; that the seized vessel having been brought into the Port of Providence, the federal court for Rhode Island acquired jurisdiction; and that, moreover, the claimant by answering to the merits waived any right to object to enforcement of the penalties. The argument rests upon misconceptions.\n It is true that where the United States, having possession of property, files a libel to enforce a forfeiture resulting from a violation of its laws, the fact that the possession was acquired by a wrongful act is immaterial. Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530, 532\n, 47 S.Ct. 191. Compare Ker v. Illinois, \n119 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 7 S.Ct. 225. The doctrine rests primarily upon the common-law rules that any person may, at his peril, seize property which has become forfeited to, or forfeitable by, the government; and that proceedings by the government to enforce a forfeiture ratify a seizure made by one without authority, since ratification is equivalent to antecedent delegation of authority to seize. Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310; Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205, 206. The doctrine is not applicable here. The objection to the seizure is not that it was wrongful merely because made by one upon whom the government had not conferred authority to seize at the place where the seizure was made. The objection is that the government itself lacked power to seize, since by the Treaty it had imposed a territorial limitation upon its own authority. The Treaty fixes the conditions under which a 'vessel may be seized and taken into a port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with' the applicable laws. Thereby, Great Britain agreed that adjudication may follow a rightful seizure. Our government, lacking power to seize, lacked power, because of the Treaty, to subject the vessel to our laws. To hold that adjudication may follow a wrongful seizure would go far to nullify the purpose \n\n[288 U.S. 102, 122]\n\u00a0\n and effect of the Treaty. Compare United States v. Rauscher, \n119 \nU.S. 407\n, 7 S.Ct. 234.\n The case differs from The Ship Richmond, 9 Cranch, 102, and The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, where forfeitures of vessels wrongfully seized by our Navy were upheld. \n21\n There, the vessels seized were of American registry; and the seizures did not violate any treaty, but were merely violations of the law of nations because made within the territory of another sovereign. In those cases it was held that the illegality of the seizures did not affect the venue of the action or the process of the court. Here, the objection is more fundamental. It is to the jurisdiction of the United States. The objection is not met by distinguishing between the custody of the Coast Guard and the subsequent custody of the Marshal. Nor is it lost by the entry of an answer to the merits. The ordinary incidents of possession of the vessel and the cargo yield to the international agreement.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that in respect of British vessels engaged in smuggling intoxicating liquor into the United States the Treaty of 1924 was not intended to cut down the rights claimed by the United States under the hovering statutes in force since the organization of our government, but that it was the purpose of both countries to extend and enlarge such rights to enable the United States more effectively to enforce its liquor laws, and that therefore the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The view that the Treaty modified the limits within which British vessels might be seized for violation of the laws prohibiting alcoholic liquors is supported by the following cases: The Frances Louise (D.C.) 1 F.( 2d) 1004; The Marjorie E. Bachman (D.C.) 4 F.(2d) 405; The Sagatind (C.C.A .) 11 F.(2d) 673, 675, 45 A.L.R. 1007; The Over the Top (D.C.) 5 F.(2d) 838, 844; Ford v. United States (C.C.A.) 10 F.(2d) 339, 347, affirmed, \n273 \nU.S. 593\n, 47 S.Ct. 531; Hennings v. United States (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 74, 75; United States v.

In other cases the view has been expressed that the treaties did not restrict, at all events the right of seizure. The Vinces (D.C.) 20 F.( 2d) 164, 174, affirmed sub nom. Gillam v. United States (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 296 (compare Id., 27 F.(2d) page 301); The Panama (D.C.) 6 F.(2d) 326, 327; The Resolution (D.C.) 30 F.(2d) 534, 537, 538; The Pescawha (D.C.) 45 F.( 2d) 221, 222. Compare, also, the following cases in which seizure was made within twelve miles, but in which it does not appear whether it was made within an hour's sailing distance or whether the question of the effect of the treaties was raised. The Mistinguette (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 738; United States v. 63 Kegs of Malt (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 741; The Newton Bay (D.C.) 30 F.(2d) 444, affirmed (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 729; The Amaranth (D.C.) 35 F.(2d) 872; The Marion Phillis (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 688; The Deauville (D.C.) 49 F.( 2d) 372; The Throndyke (D.C.) 53 F.(2d) 239; The Miss C.B.(D.C.) 59 F.(2d) 744. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Similar treaties have been entered into with fifteen other countries; Norway, July 2, 1924 (43 Stat. 1772); Denmark, July 25, 1924 ( 43 Stat. 1809); Germany, August 11, 1924 (43 Stat. 1815); Sweden, August 18, 1924 (43 Stat. 1830); Italy, October 22, 1924 (43 Stat. 1844); Panama, January 19, 1925 (43 Stat. 1875); Netherlands, April 8, 1925 (44 Stat. 2013); Cuba, June 19, 1926 (44 Stat. 2395); Spain, November 17, 1926 (44 Stat. 2465); France, March 12, 1927 (45 Stat. 2403); Belgium, January 11, 1928 (45 Stat. 2456); Greece, February 18, 1929 (45 Stat. 2736); Japan, January 16, 1930 (46 Stat. 2446); Poland, August 8, 1930 (46 Stat. 2773); Chile, November 26, 1930 (46 Stat. 2852). The only substantial difference in these treaties is in article 1, dealing with the general principle of a three-mile limit; in the treaties with Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Cuba, Panama, and Japan, the principle is declared to be accepted, while in the others rights and claims in that regard are declared to be reserved. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The argument was advanced by the Solicitor General as representing the view, not of the Department of Justice, but of other lawyers for the government. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Re-enacted by Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22,  54, 1 Stat. 627, 668; and see Rev. Stat.  3067.\n The model for the American statutes was the British Hovering Act of 1736, 9 Geo. II, c. 35,  23, which provided for the forfeiture of vessels under 100 tons into which foreign goods were taken within four leagues of the coast. Compare the earlier British Hovering Acts of 1709 and 1718; 8 Anne, c. 7,  17; 5 Geo. I, c. 11. In 1876 all existing hovering acts were repealed by the Customs Consolidation Act, 39 & 40 Vict., c. 36, which provides in section 159 for the forfeiture of vessels belonging in whole or in part to British subjects or having half the persons on board British subjects, where the vessel is found, or discovered to have been, within three leagues of the coast; and for the forfeiture of other vessels found, or discovered to have been, within one league of the coast.

Jessup, The Law of Territorial Waters and Maritime Jurisdiction, pp. 254-256.\n In reply to a question in the House of Commons on June 6, 1923, concerning the number of British vessels seized, the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs replied: 'Broadly speaking, some 20 or 25 cases are known to His Majesty's Government where vessels, mostly of Canadian registry, have been seized. The seizures have occurred at varying distances from the shore, some within and some without the three-mile limit. The crews have nearly always been detained for varying periods. His Majesty's Embassy at Washington have acted repeatedly, and in the strongest possible manner, to secure the release of vessels seized outside the three-mile limit, or inside it when a genuine case of distress seemed to be made out.' 164 Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 5th Series, col. 2212. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Congressional Record, Vol. 62, Part 11, 67th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 11,593. An amendment to section 581, as reported, was proposed and withdrawn; the amendment would have made the section applicable specifically to searches and seizures for violation of the laws prohibiting alcoholic liquors. As enacted, however, the section did not fall short of the powers which the amendment would have granted in more particular terms. See Philip C. Jessup, The Law of Territorial Waters and Maritime Jurisdiction, p. 214. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Report of the Attorney General, 1923, pp. 89, 90. The practice was adopted of requiring a bond, on release, conditioned on the delivery of the cargo to the ports named in the clearance papers. Ibid. The class of vessels not released was extended, in the case of the Henry L. Marshall, to include a vessel beyond the three-mile limit, where, although the small boats were not the vessel's own, there was unity of control over the vessel and boats. The Henry L.

DASHER(1933)\nNo. 30\nArgued: October 18, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. Edmund Worth, of Tampa, Fla., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Burton G. Henson and W. K. Zewadski, Jr., both of Tampa, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During the night immediately following the filing of a bankruptcy petition, the president of a bankrupt corporation withdrew the bulk of the merchandise by stealth and lodged it in hiding places known only to himself. Part has been retrieved; part is still concealed. The District Court, confirming the report of a referee, made a turnover order for the return by the respondent of the property withheld. On the ground that the order was void for indefiniteness the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed it, except as to a few items no longer contested. 63 F.( 2d) 749. A writ of certiorari, sued out by the trustee in bankruptcy, brings the case here.\n The bankrupt corporation began the business of the sale of drugs on May 26, 1930, and was thrown into bankruptcy the following February. The respondent, Dasher, was its president, and he, his wife, and his infant son were the holders of the shares. The cost of all the merchandise owned by the bankrupt during the life of the business was $72,551.82; the sales, less the gross profts, were $23,056.01. There should have been on hand at the bankruptcy mer- \n\n[290 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n chandise of the value at cost of $49,495.81. Only $29,754.16 in value has come into the possession of the trustee or the receiver. Much of this would have been lost to the creditors if it had not been unearthed from the hiding places where it had been concealed by the respondent. The value at cost of the undelivered residue is nearly $20,000. Of this residue a few items ($583.69) have identifying marks or labels. The propriety of a turnover order as to those is no longer disputed. There is left an ultimate residue ($19,157.66 in value) secreted by the respondent and still withheld from the estate.\n The referee, after giving the respondent an opportunity to account for the disposition of the assets, has ordered the return of this undelivered residue. The findings describe it as the 'balance of merchandise in the hands of the said R. F. Dasher at the time of bankruptcy at a cost price value of $19,157.66, of a class of merchandise shown by the proofs of claim to have been purchased on the credit of the bankrupt corporation and delivered to it, and of such a class of merchandise as is usually carried and sold in a retail drug store, but which is not capable of a more specific description, such more specific description being known only to the respondent in this cause.' The description in the findings is repeated in the order with unimportant verbal changes.\n The respondent has made away with goods belonging to the estate and defiantly withholds them. So the referee has found upon evidence not in the return and hence presumably sufficient. The process of computation and inference outlined in his report and leading up to his conclusion has support in many cases. See, e.g., In re H. Magen Co. (C.C.A.) 10 F.(2d) 91, 93, 94; In re Chavkin (C.C.A.) 249 F. 342; In re Stavrahn (C.C.A.) 174 F. 330, 20 Ann.Cas. 888; In re Levy & Co. (C.C.A.) 142 F. 442; Sheinman v. Chalmers (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 902; In re Cohan (C.C.A.) 41 F.(2d) 632. The abstraction of the merchandise being evidenced by clear and convincing proof, there \n\n[290 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the court to direct a summary return. Oriel v. Russell, \n278 \nU.S. 358\n, 49 S.Ct. 173. The respondent seeks to thwart the exercise of this conceded jurisdiction by the objection that the merchandise is not sufficiently described. He says that instead of the general description in the findings and the order there should be an inventory of items. The drugs, the perfumery, the surgical appliances, and the many miscellaneous articles that make up the stock in trade of a modern drug store should be set forth, the insists, in particular schedules. Only thus, we are told, will the respondent be in a position to understand the mandate to which obedience is due.\n Misunderstanding of the mandate is upon the facts in this record an illusory peril. The order gives the only description that the nature of the case allows. The respondent, and no one else, is in a position to supply a better one. The mandate is addressed to him, and to him its meaning is definite, however indefinite to others. If it is clear enough to be understood, it is clear enough to be obeyed. 'All evidence,' said Lord Mansfield in Blatch v. Archer, Cowper, 63, 65, 'is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.' Kirby v. Tallmadge, \n160 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 16 S.Ct. 349. The validity of this order is to be subjected to a kindred test. Words after all are symbols, and the significance of the symbols varies with the knowledge and experience of the mind receiving them. The certainty of a description is always a matter of degree. Doherty v. Hill, 144 Mass. 465, 11 N.E. 581; Marks v. Cowdin, 226 N.Y. 138, 143, 123 N.E. 139. 'In every case the words used might be translated into things and facts by parol evidence.' Holmes, J., in Doherty v. Hill, supra, 144 Mass. 465, 468, 11 N.E. 581, 583. How many identifying tokens we are to exact the reason and common sense of the situation must tell us. There are times when a restraining order enjoins the commission of \n\n[290 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n acts that are not within the peculiar knowledge of the one to be enjoined. In re Huntley (C.C.A.) 85 F. 889, 893; cf. Ketchum v. Edwards, 153 N.Y. 534, 539, 47 N.E. 918. In that event the requirement of definiteness assumes a new importance, and failure to give heed to it may even make the order void. No doubt it is wise, irrespective of the knowledge of the parties, to make the terms of the order as definite as possible. The findings of the referee show that this is what was done. To insist upon more would be to sacrifice the substance of the right to the magic of a formula. In the ensuing war of words the wrongdoer would be enabled to slip away from his pursuers and take advantage of his wrong.\n An argument is based upon embarrassments that may clog the enforcement of other remedies hereafter. The respondent, it is said, may refuse to comply with the order and may be sent to jail till he obeys. If later he repents and tenders a stock of goods to the trustee, the marshal will not know whether the tender is complete and will be unable to determine whether to hold him or to let him go. See In re Miller & Harbaugh (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 612, 616. Embarrassments such as these, contingent and imaginary, will be resolved when they develop. The description of the merchandise might be much more definite than it is without enabling a marshal to identify a stock in trade, unaided by the advice of those acquainted with the business. Besides, the court is always in reserve, with capacity to act when the dispute becomes acute. If the respondent makes a genuine effort to restore the secreted goods, there will probably be little difficulty in determining whether the tender is sufficient. At present, the marshal is not before us praying for instructions, nor is the respondent yet in jail. We are not to presume that the order will be flouted. Let the respondent yield obedience to a mandate intelligible to him, and his liberty is then assured. The \n\n[290 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n law will not be overpatient with his protest that if he persists in his defiance, he may be caught in his own snares.\n The form of turnover orders in bankruptcy proceedings has been much considered in the federal courts. It has provoked a difference of opinion. In accord with the decision of the court below are decisions of the Court of Appeals for the ninth circuit and the first. In re Miller & Harbaugh (C. C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 612; In re Goldman (C.C.A.) 62 F.(2d) 421, one judge dissenting. The contrary view has been taken in the fourth circuit and the second. Kirsner v. Taliaferro (C.C.A.) 202 F. 51; In re H. Magen Co. (C.C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 91. Many orders not unlike the one in question have been upheld sub silentio in the absence of objection. Prela v. Hubshman, \n278 \nU.S. 358\n, 49 S.Ct. 173; Epstein v. Steinfeld (C.C.A.) 210 F. 236; Sheinman v. Chalmers (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 902; In re Cohan (C.C.A.) 41 F.(2d) 632.\n The order should be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with instructions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCULLEN FUEL CO. v. W. E. HEDGER, INC.(1933)\nNo. 32\nArgued: October 9, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 82, 83]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Horace L. Cheyney, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas H. Middleton and Forrest E. Single, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner owned a deck scow known as Cullen No. 32. The respondent wished to use her to lighter ore from ship-side in New York Harbor to the plant of the Grasselli Chemical Company, the consignee of the ore. A charter for an indefinite term, at a fixed daily rate of hire, was orally arranged by telephone with the petitioner's marine superintendent. The day following the demise, while being loaded from the ship, the scow capsized, dumped her cargo, and damaged an adjacent wharf and vessel. Suits ensued, one of them by the respondent as bailee of the cargo, against the petitioner as owner of the scow. Limitation of liability was sought by the petitioner, but the district court refused a decree for limitation,1 finding that the scow was unseaworthy at the time of the demise.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in this finding and based its affirmance2 of the trial court's decision upon the ground that as the charter was the personal contract of the owner and included an implied warranty of seaworthiness the petitioner was precluded from the benefit of the limitation statutes. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner, conceding that where the owner personally expressly warrants seaworthiness he is not entitled to the benefit of the limited liability statutes (Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 \nU.S. 353\n, 38 S.Ct. 330, Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139\n, 39 S. Ct. 53, 1 A.L.R. 1522), correctly states that despite the decision of this court in Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., \n249 \nU.S. 334\n, 39 S.Ct. 292, the contrariety of opinion which existed in the various circuits prior to \n\n[290 U.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n that case, as to the effect of the implied warranty of the owner,4 still persists. \n5\n We therefore granted certiorari. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We pass, without discussion, the contentions that the court below erred in its rulings that the owner's contract was personal and that the respondent as bailee of the cargo was entitled to recover from the charterer, as we are of opinion that both points were correctly decided ( The Benjamin Noble (D.C.) 232 F. 382; Id. (C.C.A.) 244 F. 95; Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., supra; Pendleton v. Benner Line, supra, pages 355-356 of 246 U.S., 38 S.Ct. 330), and come to the question of petitioner's right of limitation notwithstanding the implied warranty of seaworthiness. The Capitol Transportation Case is an authority against the right. As appears by the opinion of the District Court (The Benjamin Noble, 232 F. 382), the contract of the owner in that case was oral and no express warranty was given.\n We see no reason to restrict or modify the rule there announced. The warranty of seaworthiness is implied from the circumstances of the parties and the subject-matter of the contract and may be negatived only by express covenant. 7 It is as much a part of the contract as any express stipulation. Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. v. Penna. Coal Co., 8 Wall. 276, 288; Grossman v. Schenker, 206 N.Y. 466, 469, 100 N.E. 39; United States v. A. Bentley & Sons Co. (D.C.) 293 F. 229.\n The petitioner urges that the denial of limitation in cases like this will sweep away much of the protection \n\n[290 U.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n afforded to ship owners by the acts of Congress. But this view disregards the nature of the warranty. The fitness of the ship at the moment of breaking ground is the matter warranted, and not her suitability under conditions thereafter arising which are beyond the owner's control.

Co., \n270 \nU.S. 253\n, 46 S.Ct. 212; The Ice King (C.C.A.) 261 F. 897; The Soerstad (D.C.) 257 F. 130.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 F.(2d) 859. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 62 F.(2d) 68. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] R.S.  4283, 4289; Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  18, 23 Stat. 57, U.S. Code, tit. 46,  183, 188, 189 (46 USCA  183, 188, 189). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Quinlan v.

Springston, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Melvin A. McMullen and Thomas Hamilton, both of Clearwater, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action on the common counts and on an account stated brought in the United States District Court for Northern Florida by the receiver of First National Bank of St. Petersburg, Fla., against the People's Bank of Clearwater, Fla., a state bank. In addition to pleas of the general issue, the defendant pleaded specially that the St. Petersburg bank was indebted to the defendant in a sum in excess of plaintiff's claim, by virtue of the delivery to defendant of four drafts drawn by plaintiff on the Chase National Bank of New York to the defendant's order which had been dishonored.\n The plaintiff replied that certain checks or drafts drawn on the St. Petersburg bank or other banks in St. Peters- \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n burg were deposited for collection with the Clearwater bank; were forwarded by the Clearwater bank to the St. Petersburg bank for collection; the St. Petersburg bank collected the items drawn on it by charging the accounts of its depositors and those on other local banks by settlement of balances with them; the four drafts in question were sent to the Clearwater bank as remittances of the amounts so collected, pursuant to the collection letters accompanying the checks; neither bank carried an account or deposit in the other, and for a long period each bank had been sending checks and drafts to the other for collection and remittance; and averred that, by reason of the facts stated, there was no mutuality in the debts or demands existing between the parties at the time the action was brought, and the defendant was not entitled to the set-off sought in its pleas. The District Court sustained a demurrer to the replication, and, as plaintiff refused to plead further, entered judgment for the defendant for the excess of its demand. The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the present respondent was substituted as appellee; the Clearwater bank having gone into liquidation. That court affirmed the judgment (63 F.(2d) 592), and, upon the plaintiff's petition, we granted certiorari.\n The statute of Florida1 permits set-off of 'demands mutually existing ... at the commencement of the action.' The question is whether the debts were mutual. The Circuit Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative, basing the decision on the section of the Florida statutes which provides:2 'The holder of a negotiable instrument \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n may sue thereon in his own name; and payment to him in due course discharges the instrument,' saying that since the Clearwater bank might maintain a suit in its own name for the amount due by the petitioner, the demand might be set off; and that it was a matter of no concern to the petitioner whether the Clearwater bank held the checks for collection or for value. The petitioner urges that this holding bases the right of set- off upon a rule of procedure and ignores the substantive requirement that the demands must be mutual in quality; and says that the debt of the St. Petersburg bank was not to the Clearwater bank, which was a mere collecting agent, but to the depositors. The conclusion is that, while the Clearwater bank individually owed the receiver of the St. Petersburg bank, the latter did not own the former, but at best the claim was made as an agent. If this be true, set-off may not be allowed, for a defendant sued upon his individual debt may not avail himself for this purpose of a demand against the plaintiff held in a fiduciary capacity. Central National Bank v. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n; Libby v. Hopkins, \n104 U.S. 303\n; Western Tie & Timber Co. v. Brown, \n196 \nU.S. 502\n, 25 S.Ct. 339; United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corp., \n267 U.S. 387\n, 394-395, 45 S.Ct. 338; Thomas v. Potter Title & Trust Co. (D.C.) 2 F.Supp. 12.\n Were the cross-demands of the parties of the same quality, or, to state it otherwise, did each claim from the other in the same right? In the ordinary case the unrestricted indorsement and deposit of checks with the Clearwater bank would create the relation of debtor and creditor, and the bank would collect the items, not as agent for the depositors, but as owner. Exchange National Bank v. Third National Bank, \n112 \nU.S. 276\n, 5 S.Ct. 141; City of Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, \n271 \nU.S. 489\n, 46 S.Ct. 554. A statute of Florida, however, requires of the bank of deposit only due diligence in the forwarding of such a check for collection and in the absence of negligence conditions liability for the amount \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n of the check on receipt of final payment from the collecting bank. \n3\n The parties are presumed to have contracted with reference to this statute ( Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160\n, 44 S.Ct. 296, 31 A.L.R. 1261), and the situation is as if they had expressly agreed that the Clearwater bank was to act as agent only and was not to become the debtor of the depositors unless and until it had received actual and final payment of the checks. Since, then, the Clearwater bank acted as the agent of depositors in forwarding checks to the St. Petersburg bank, the depositors have a right of action against the latter for any default in collection or remittance. Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. See, also, City of Miami v. First National Bank (C.C.A.) 58 F. (2d) 561. The Florida courts have reached the same conclusion. Atlantic National Bank v. Pratt, 95 Fla. 822, 116 So. 635; Edwards v. Lewis, 98 Fla. 956, 124 So. 746; Myers v. Federal Reserve Bank, 101 Fla. 407, 134 So. 600.\n Much is made of the absence of any showing that the Clearwater bank did not credit the depositors in account immediately on receipt of the items for collection; but, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume the relation was what the statute made it-one of mere agency rather than one of debtor and creditor. As was said in the Malloy Case, the effect of the statute might \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n be avoided by agreement or by clear and certain custom known to the depositor, but no such agreement or custom was pleaded by the defendant. The replication asserts the checks were deposited with the Clearwater bank for collection and were forwarded to the St. Petersburg bank for collection and remittance, and the defendant's demurrer admits these averments. On this record we are bound to hold that the St. Petersburg bank stands in the relation of agent to the individual depositors of the items and is liable to them for failure to remit cash or equivalent in satisfaction of the amounts collected. The Clearwater bank must therefore sue as representative or agent of depositors, for a recognition of its right to sue as owner would destroy the cause of action of the depositors against the St. Petersburg bank or leave that bank subject to a possible double liability. If the cross-demand is asserted in an agency capacity, the debts are not held in the same right by the two banks, lack mutuality, and the one cannot be set off against the other; if it is asserted by the Clearwater bank as owner of the drafts, the demand cannot be maintained, for the reason that no showing is made that the agency relationship was altered to that of debtor and creditor.\n The respondent, however, seeks to support the judgment on another ground. He says that the Clearwater bank accepted the drafts, forwarded by the St. Petersburg bank, as payment, thus assumed ownership of them, acknowledged the change in the relationship to its depositors from that of collecting agent to that of debtor, and so properly pleads the offset. We think this position cannot be maintained.\n As respects the set-off of cross-demands, the rights of the parties became fixed at the moment of the insolvency of the St. Petersburg bank and consequent suspension of payment, Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 511\n, 13 S.Ct. 148; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 290\n, 16 S.Ct. 502; and the right \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 149]\n\u00a0\n to set off is governed by the state of things existing at the moment of insolvency, not by conditions thereafter arising, Yardley v. Philler, \n167 \nU.S. 344, 360\n, 17 S.Ct. 835, or by any subsequent action taken by any party to the transaction, Evansville Bank v. German-American Bank, \n155 \nU.S. 556\n, 15 S.Ct. 221. What, then, was the situation as disclosed by the record, when the St. Petersburg bank closed its doors? That bank, as subagent for the Clearwater bank's depositors, had made collection and sent the drafts for the amount to the Clearwater bank. It is incorrect to say that the St. Petersburg bank paid the amounts collected by forwarding drafts to the Clearwater bank, or that the Clearwater bank upon receipt of the drafts was bound to accept them as payment and its depositors were likewise thereupon bound to treat the agency of the Clearwater bank and that of the St. Petersburg bank as ended and the relation of debtor and creditor as established between them and the Clearwater bank. Equally inaccurate is the assertion that receipt and retention of the drafts required the Clearwater bank, unless its depositors asserted ownership of them, at once to credit the depositors with the amount of the items represented by the drafts. The bank was not bound to assume the relation of debtor until, in the words of the statute, it had received final payment, i.e., cash or its equivalent, and we should not presume that it did so.\n Until these drafts were paid, the subagent had not discharged the obligation resting upon it, and remained liable to suit by the persons whose checks had been forwarded for collection and remittance. Bank of Washington v. Triplett & Neale, 1 Pet. 25; Wilson & Co. v. Smith, 3 How. 768; Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra. While the drafts were in course of collection, the St. Petersburg bank failed. At the moment of suspension it remained liable as subagent to the depositors of the Clearwater bank, as we have shown. Could it also \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 150]\n\u00a0\n be subjected to an independent liability to the Clearwater bank? Was it not entitled to treat the agency relation originally existing as still in force, in the absence of notice from the owners of the collection items that the status had been altered? Could any position taken by the Clearwater bank of its own initiative affect without the depositor's consent the preexisting relation of principal and subagent between the depositors and the St. Petersburg bank? We think not. Compare Evansville Bank v. German-American Bank, supra. Those depositors had an election either to sue the St. Petersburg bank or to bring action against the Clearwater bank for want of due diligence, or to treat the drafts as payment and hold the Clearwater bank as their debtor, but there is no intimation in the record that they made any election prior to the subagent's insolvency, nor indeed that they then knew whether collection had been effected or remittance received by the Clearwater bank. There is no reason to presume that they elected to stand on their cause of action against the Clearwater bank for lack of due diligence in accepting drafts instead of currency, and thus created a right of action in that bank against the St. Petersburg bank by way of subrogation, or to affirm that the agency had terminated and its status become that of a debtor. Nor is any custom pleaded whereby the Clearwater bank was to become the debtor of the depositors of the checks upon receipt of something other than cash or equivalent from the subagent. Compare Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra.\n This view does not, as claimed, permit the St. Petersburg bank to assert on behalf of the owners of the checks an ownership in the drafts which they have never claimed. On the contrary, the subagent merely asserts its continuing liability to its principals as a reason why the forwarding agent may not, without showing the \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 151]\n\u00a0\n agreement of the principal, seek to assert another and a different cause of action based on alleged ownership of the drafts by the forwarding bank. The question is not one of transference of ownership of the drafts to the customers of the Clearwater bank, but of the attempted use by that bank of the cause of action on the drafts as its own in the teeth of the undenied existence of another cause of action arising out of the same transaction in favor of the bank's principals. Bank of the Metropolis v. New England Bank, 1 How. 234, 239, presented a totally different situation from that here disclosed. In that case the forwarding bank, for all that appeared, was the owner of the paper. There was neither contract nor statute to the contrary. The course of dealing between the forwarding and the collecting bank was for the mutual exchange of items for collection, which each treated as owned by the other, and the credit of the items as received in an account of the sender and periodical settlement of the balances of account. When the forwarding bank failed, it notified the collecting bank that certain items then held for collection belonged to the New England bank. In a suit by the latter against Metropolis bank, the defense was that at the date of the forwarding bank's failure there was due from it to the Metropolis bank more than the amount claimed. The defense was held good, this court saying:\n'We do not perceive any difference in principle between an advance of money and a balance suffered to remain upon the faith of these mutual dealings. In the one case as well as the other, credit is given upon the paper deposited or expected to be transmitted in the usual course of the transactions between the parties.'\n\n But here we have no credit extended by the St. Petersburg bank to the Clearwater bank on the faith of the checks forwarded for collection and no mutual deposit \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 152]\n\u00a0\n accounts, but a mere agency evidenced by a collection letter requiring collection and remittance. The fact that no credit was extended to the forwarding bank by the collecting bank leaves it open to the depositor to assert his claim against the latter, even though it had no notice that the relation between the depositor and the forwarding bank was one merely of agency. See Sweeny v. Easter, 1 Wall. 166; Beaver Boards Cos. v. Imbrie & Co. (D.C.) 287 F. 158, 163.\n The respondent was not entitled to set off an asserted cause of action in its own right based on the drafts drawn by the petitioner. The suggestion that the petitioner's demand was for the amount of checks the Clearwater bank had collected and failed to remit is beside the point. If the petitioner was for that or any other reason not entitled to sue in its own right, the fact would only be a further reason for denying the set-off.\n The judgment must be reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The case was tried upon the pleadings alone, and we are asked to determine an important question of law on only a partial presentation of the facts upon which its correct solution depends. Upon the facts disclosed, it would seem that the petitioner could not rightly defeat respondent's counterclaim by setting up that the drafts, which are the subject of it, are held by the Clearwater bank upon an agency in behalf of some of its depositors which they are not bound and have not chosen to assert. But, even if that could properly be allowed, the burden rests on petitioner to show that the agency of the Clearwater bank, created by the deposit of the items for collection, was continued with respect to the drafts which are the subject of the counterclaim, so that they were held \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 153]\n\u00a0\n by the collecting bank as agent, not as owner. This the petitioner has failed to do.\n From the pleadings it appears that the checks were deposited with the Clearwater bank by its customers, in the usual course, for collection, and were forwarded by it, in turn, to the St. Petersburg bank for collection; that the St. Petersburg bank collected the checks and paid the amount of the collection to the Clearwater bank by the drafts in question, made payable to its order. The two banks had each, for a long time, been sending drafts and checks to the other for collection and remittance, and the demand of the St. Petersburg bank, to which the counterclaim was interposed, was for an amount similarly due for items which had been collected for it by the Clearwater bank. It is not shown what credits were given by the Clearwater bank to the depositors for the checks when received, or that any of them were restrictively indorsed, or that in the transactions between the two banks either appeared to the other to be acting otherwise than as owner of the checks which it forwarded for collection. See Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n271 \nU.S. 489\n, 46 S.Ct. 554. On the argument it was conceded that all were indorsed without restriction. There is no allegation that the Clearwater bank ever held the drafts, received from the St. Petersburg bank, as agent for its depositors, and none that the depositors ever asserted such an agency, or that they have made any claim to the drafts. Whether or not, in the usual course of business, it credited its depositors with the amount of the drafts on their receipt, is not revealed.\n The authority and duty of the Clearwater bank, as an agent for collection, was to receive legal tender in payment of the collection items, and nothing else. In receiving and retaining the drafts made payable to its own order, without designating the bank as agent, it took \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 154]\n\u00a0\n them, not as agent, but for its own account. By taking them in payment it discharged the drawers of the collection items. Having thus precluded collection in legal tender, it at once became the bank's duty to credit its depositors with the items collected. Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160, 165\n, 44 S.Ct. 296, 31 A.L.R. 1261. By thus crediting the drafts it would have performed fully its duty as a collecting agent, for such a credit was all that was expected or could have been required if the collection had been made in legal tender. In either case the agency would then have come to an end beyond recall, the bank would have become a debtor to its depositors and the unqualified owner of the drafts which it had accepted in payment of the collections. See Commercial Bank of Penn. v. Armstrong, \n148 \nU.S. 50, 58\n, 13 S.Ct. 533; Marine Bank v. Fulton Bank, 2 Wall. 252; Planters' Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 501; Phoenix Bank v. Risley, \n111 \nU.S. 125\n, 4 S.Ct. 322; Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 297\n, 25 S.Ct. 243; Douglas v. Federal Reserve Bank, supra. There is no presumption, even under the Florida statute, that an agency of a bank to collect paper for its depositors survives the receipt by it of drafts in payment of the collection. Its survival necessarily depends on special circumstances not here disclosed. It cannot be presumed, in the absence of appropriate allegations or proof that the depositors have claimed any ownership in the drafts or that, in the absence of such claim, the Clearwater bank did not, as it was legally bound to do, credit its depositors with the amount of the drafts on or after their receipt, or that it afterward occupied any relationship to its depositors other than that of debtor. There is thus a failure to allege directly, or by any necessary inference, the essential facts on which the petitioner's case depends to show that the depositors of the Clearwater bank have any right to treat the drafts in its hands as their property. \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 155]\n\u00a0\n But, even if we are to say on this record that the depositors were entitled to claim ownership of the drafts in the hands of the Clearwater bank, they have not done so, and the St. Petersburg bank may not assert for them an interest in the drafts which they are not bound to assert and have never claimed for themselves. Unless Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, supra, on which the opinion of the Court relies, is to be overruled, neither the St. Petersburg bank nor the Clearwater bank could treat the depositors of the latter as owners of the drafts without their consent. In that case, which arose under the statute of Florida involved in the present case, the bank had received paper restrictively indorsed for collection from another bank which had received it from its customer. In turn it forwarded the paper to another bank for collection, from which it took a draft, payable to its own order, in payment of the collection item. This Court held that the bank received the paper as agent to collect it, but that, in receiving the draft as payment instead of legal tender, the forwarding bank acted outside its agency. Hence it could not treat the owner of the paper sent for collection as the owner of the draft which it had thus wrongfully received, without his consent or ratification. Here the rights of the Clearwater bank upon the drafts had accrued before the receivership of either bank. What their rights then were they continued to be, unless they were altered by some act of its depositors. Ownership of the drafts was not in suspension. It had already been lodged in the Clearwater bank by its own unauthorized act. Some affirmative act of ratification or adoption was necessary by its customers before the wrongful act of the Clearwater bank could be relieved of its consequences and before the burden of ownership acquired by it in its own right, because without authority, could be transferred from it to its depositors. Allowance of the counterclaim \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 156]\n\u00a0\n upon the drafts, like payment of them before such an act of adoption, obviously could not result in double liability of the St. Petersburg bank, since the payment or allowance would be made to the one entitled to receive it.\n Other circumstances make the present case an even plainer one for denying to the petitioner any right to assert that the drafts, which the Clearwater bank received and is compelled to hold as owner, are held upon an agency. The two banks, as the court below pointed out, were mutual agents for collection. On the record we must take it that they dealt with each other as the owners of the collection items which each bank received from the other without notice of the interest in them of the other's depositors for collection. In Bank of the Metropolis v. New England Bank, 1 How. 234; Id., 6 How. 212, this Court laid down the rule that, when banks mutually act as agents for collection, each for the other, and paper transmitted for collection appears on its face to be the property of the transmitting bank and remitted for its account, they are entitled to settle their mutual demands for items collected by striking a balance, no matter who the owner of the collected items may be. Each deals, and is entitled to deal, with the other in reliance upon the security of the paper, indorsed without restriction, and transmitted, or expected to be transmitted, in the usual course of the transactions between them. See, also, Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 392\n, 9 S.Ct. 486; Joyce v. Auten, \n179 \nU.S. 591, 597\n, 21 S.Ct. 227. The application here of the principle involved would not seem to be affected by the fact that drafts drawn for balances due from the one bank to the other were sent daily, rather than weekly or monthly. Even though the depositors here might have asserted an ownership in the drafts, which nevertheless they did not assert, it would be a departure from this salutary principle to say that the St. Petersburg bank can deny to the \n\n[290 U.S. 143, 157]\n\u00a0\n Clearwater bank the rights of ownership in the drafts which the latter cannot itself deny.\n Not only has petitioner failed to sustain the burden of showing that the depositors of the Clearwater bank, or any of them, have asked or consented to be treated as owners of the drafts, or otherwise adopted the act of the Clearwater bank, but it appears that it would be to their disadvantage to do so. We need not close our eyes to the obvious fact that the only possible advantage sought in behalf of the St. Petersburg bank by resistance to the counterclaim-the benefit of a distribution by the Clearwater bank to creditors larger than that of the St. Petersburg bank- is identical with the advantage which the depositors will retain by treating the Clearwater bank as their debtor, instead of asserting ownership in the unpaid drafts. In the circumstances, to speak of the Clearwater bank as suing upon its counterclaim as an agent and as not bearing the burden of ownership is to speak in terms of legal fiction, not of reality. Notwithstanding our judgment denying to the Clearwater bank the right to counterclaim upon the drafts because the ownership of them is not in it but in its depositors, the depositors, if they have not already done so, are free to prove their claim against the Clearwater bank as a debtor, because they have never become owners of the drafts. The Clearwater bank, then, has no choice but to bear the burdens of ownership of the drafts which it has received and retains as owner. It should equally be entitled to the benefits. These include the right to set up the drafts as a counterclaim to its indebtedness to the St. Petersburg bank. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'All debts or demands mutually existing between the parties at the commencement of the action, whether the same be liquidated or not, shall be proper subjects of set-off, and may be pleaded accordingly.'

Hughes, of Chicago, Ill., and William Cogger, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner brought suit in the Court of Claims upon a claim that for two years, 1918 and 1919, he had overpaid his income tax. As to the tax for 1918, the claim was dismissed upon the merits. As to the tax for \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n 1919, it was dismissed upon the ground that suit had not been brought within the time prescribed by law. (Ct. Cl.) 59 F.(2d) 842; (Ct. Cl.) 1 F. Supp. 771. A writ of certiorari, restricted to the assessment for 1919, brings the case here. \n288 \nU.S. 597\n, 53 S.Ct. 403, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The Commissioner upon an audit of the petitioner's returns found underassessments for 1916, 1917, and 1920, and overassessments for 1918 and 1919. A notice of the result of the audit was mailed to the petitioner on November 10, 1923, the notice by its terms being provisional and tentative. Later, and on January 31, 1924, the Commissioner signed a schedule of overassessments, $22,151.88 for 1918, and $2,628.26 for 1919, and forwarded the schedule to the collector of the district of Oklahoma, the petitioner's residence. In accordance with the practice of the Bureau, the collector was instructed to examine the accounts of the taxpayer and apply the excess payments as a credit against taxes due for other years. Upon such examination the collector found that there were additional assessments, still unpaid, for 1916, 1917, and 1920, in the sum of $11,277. 24. This left an excess for 1918 of $10,874.64, and one of $2,628.26 for 1919, a total of $13,502.90. Upon that basis the collector made out a schedule of refunds and credits, which he returned to the Commissioner with the schedule of overassessments.\n At this stage complications developed by reason of the tax liability of a partnership of which petitioner was a member. The partnership owed the government more than $50,000, the amount of an excess profits tax for 1917, though the precise extent of the indebtedness was still undetermined. In anticipation of an assessment, petitioner had filed with the Bureau an agreement and direction that any refund due to him individually for the year 1918 (but without mention of any other year) should be applied as a credit upon the taxes owing from the partnership. When the schedule of refunds and credits came back from the collector, the Commissioner over- \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n looked the order, then on file in his office, for the merger of the two accounts, and dealt with them as separate. He made an additional assessment against the partnership for $53,012.47. On the same day, March 29, 1924, he signed an approval of the schedule of refunds and credits without applying any part of the overpayment to the partnership liability, and made out a check to the order of the petitioner for $13,502.90, which he mailed to the collector. The collector discovered the mistake, and, instead of delivering the check, returned it to the Commissioner. Thereupon the Commissioner canceled the check, revoked his earlier instructions, and ordered the collector to apply the overpayments made by the petitioner individually upon the deficiency then owing from the members of the partnership. This order was proper to the extent of $10,874. 64, the 1918 overpayment, for the credit to that extent was in accordance with the petitioner's agreement. It was an error in so far as it included the 1919 overpayment ($2,628.26), for the petitioner's agreement did not cover that year. The collector did what the Commissioner commanded. No notice, however, of his action was transmitted to the taxpayer. There was no delivery to the taxpayer of a certificate of overassessment. There was no delivery of a copy of any schedule of refunds and credits. Six years went by, almost to the day, without demand or protest. Then, on March 28, 1930, the petitioner began this suit, asking judgment for $24,780.14 with interest. He repudiated all the credits against the partnership deficiency, as well as other credits which there is no need to go into, for he allowed them later on. At the trial the contest narrowed down to two items. The first, $10,874.64, is the overpayment for 1918, as it stood before it was applied upon the partnership assessment. The second, $2,628.26, is the overpayment for 1919. The writ of certiorari brings up the second item to the exclusion of any other. \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n By section 3226 of the Revised Statutes as amended by the Revenue Act of 1921, no suit may be maintained for the recovery of any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected unless begun within five years from the date of payment. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 268,  1318, amending R.S.  3226; 26 U.S. Code,  156 (26 USCA  156 and note). This suit was not brought within the time so limited. It is therefore too late, if it is a suit for the recovery of a tax within the meaning of the statute. The petitioner insists that it is not such a suit, but one upon an account stated. The statement of an account gives rise to a new cause of action with a new term of limitation. Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 51 S.Ct. 395. We are thus brought to the question whether there was such a statement here.\n If the traditional tests, familiar to the law of contracts, are to be accepted as our guide, there was no account stated between government and taxpayer. No balance was arrived at as the result of computation and agreement. Volkening v. De Graaf, 81 N.Y. 268, 271. The Commissioner did not inform the taxpayer that the tax had been overpaid in a determinate amount. The taxpayer did not give assent either expressly or by silence to the outcome of the audit. The essentials of an account stated in any strict or proper sense are lacking altogether. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 333; Nutt v. United States, \n125 \nU.S. 650, 655\n, 8 S.Ct. 997; Volkening v. De Graaf, supra; Newburger-Morris Co. v. Talcott, 219 N.Y. 505, 511, 512, 114 N.E. 846, 3 A.L.R. 287. A different situation was disclosed in the Bonwit Teller Case, supra. There the certificate of overassessment had been delivered to the taxpayer. 'Upon delivery of the certificate to plaintiff, there arose the cause of action on which this suit was brought.' Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, supra, page 265 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 395, 398. Cf. W. J. Friday & Co., Inc., v. United States (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 370. \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n The argument is made, however, that the allowance of the schedule of refunds and credits on March 29, 1924, was something near to an account stated, something 'equivalent' thereto, though not the standard article to be marked by the standard label. This doctrine of equivalence is borne out, we are told, by cases in this court and elsewhere, which were cited in the Bonwit Teller Case and are again pressed upon us now. United States v. Kaufman, \n96 U.S. 567\n, 570; United States v. Real Estate Savings Bank, \n104 U.S. 728\n; First National Bank of Greencastle v. United States, 15 Ct.Cl. 225. They fall short by a great deal of teaching such a lesson. The Kaufman Case will serve as typical of the others, for they vary little in their facts. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue had been authorized by statute to make allowance to brewers for the value of tax stamps lost or wasted. He did make such an allowance, and certified his ruling to the Comptroller of the Treasury. The claimant, suing in the Court of Claims to recover the amount of the award, was met by the objection that he must prove his claim anew. This court held that the allowance by the Commissioner was effective without more to make out a prima facie case, and spoke of it as at least 'equivalent to an account stated between private parties, which is good until impeached for fraud or mistake.' There was no question in the case as to the effect of the allowance in lifting the bar of a statute of limitations. The claim had been seasonably filed and diligently pressed. There was no question as to the effect of revocation or rescission. Cf. Ridgway v. United States, 18 Ct.Cl. 707, 714, 715. What had been done by the Commissioner had never been undone. There was only the question as to the probative force of an adjudication by an officer who had been appointed to decide and had definitively decided. The statute had given him the position of an administrative tri- \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n bunal. He had done all that he could do. He had made the allowance and had certified his action to the disbursing agents of the Treasury, whose duty was not to revise, but merely to obey. Notice of his action had been given to the claimant, who had accepted and approved it. Kaufman v. United States, 11 Ct.Cl. 659, 662. The suit was on an award which had all the finality and authority that an award could ever gain.\n A very different situation is laid before us here. No definitive adjudication in favor of this taxpayer was ever made by the Commissioner or by other competent authority. The transaction never went beyond the stage of intradepartmental conference and parley. The Commissioner had put his hand, it is true, to a schedule of refunds and credits, and had transmitted a check to one of his subordinates to be delivered to the claimant. By none of these acts had he so divested himself of control as to generate rights or interests in favor of the taxpayer if there was revocation or rescission in advance of notice or delivery. There had been messages back and forth between the officers and branches of an administrative bureau. There had been none to the outer world. The Commissioner, after signing the schedule, might scratch out his signature, and declare it inadvertent. Cf. Ridgway v. United States, supra; Austin Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 910. This in substance is what he did. After signing a check and mailing it to his agent, he might cancel the check while the agent still held it, and revoke the authority improvidently granted. The matter was still in fieri.\n High public interests make it necessary that there be stability and certainty in the revenues of government. These ends are not susceptible of attainment if periods of limitation may be disregarded or extended. By the ruling in the Bonwit Teller Case a specific limitation applicable to claims for the recovery of taxes is set aside and superseded whenever the statement of an account sustains the \n\n[289 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n inference of an agreement that the tax shall be repaid. As soon as this appears, a fresh term of limitation is born and set in motion. It is a ruling not to be extended through an enlargement of the concept of an account stated by latitudinarian construction.\n Girard Trust Company v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163\n, 46 S.Ct. 229, and United States v. Swift & Company, \n282 \nU.S. 468\n, 51 S.Ct. 202, are pressed upon us by counsel as helpful to the taxpayer. They do not touch the case at hand. In the case of the Girard Trust Company, a statute called for interest on the amount of the refund to the date of allowance. The claimant made the point that allowance was not perfected unless accompanied by payment, and that interest on the refund should be correspondingly extended. The court rejecting that contention held that allowance was complete within the meaning of the statute when the schedule of refunds was approved by the Commissioner. In the case of Swift & Company, a like ruling was made as to the effect of the approval of a credit. In neither case was there any question as to the existence of an account stated, or as to the effect of an improvident allowance, unknown to the taxpayer.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDICKSON v.

P. Dickson, a citizen and resident of Carrollton in that state. Four other cases of like character were, by agreement, consolidated with this one; and the five cases were tried below and are brought here as a consolidated suit. The pleadings, facts, and proceedings stated in respect to the Dickson suit are applicable to all. The petition alleged that Dickson employed the company as a broker to purchase and sell for him grain on the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Winnepeg Exchanges; that he agreed to pay it commissions for such service, and to reimburse it for any advances made; and that upon an account stated there is due a balance of $3,714.06, after crediting amounts received from the proceeds of purchases and sales and as margins.\n Dickson denied the indebtedness, and pleaded further in bar that the transactions out of which the indebtedness is alleged to have arisen were conducted wholly within the state of Missouri and were gambling, illegal under its \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n laws; that no purchase or sale of grain was made for him, and that none for him was contemplated by either party; that the intention of both was merely that the defendant should settle for differences in the market prices; that the transactions were not actual dealings by him in grain futures, but dealings which as to him were wholly fictitious or pretended, and in fact merely gambling on the rise and fall of the market prices of grain.\n The company replied that the obligation sued on arose from transactions in the purchase and sale of grain for future delivery as commonly conducted on boards of trade; that these transactions were carried out on the Boards of Trade of Chicago and Minneapolis, which had been designated by the Secretary of Agriculture under the (Federal) Grain Futures Act, September 21, 1922, c. 369, 42 Stat. 998 (7 USCA  1-17), as 'contract markets'; that the company was a member of each of said boards; and that each of the transactions of purchase and sale made by the company on behalf of Dickson was made by it with another member of the board, and in compliance with the provisions of that act.\n The case was tried by the District Judge without a jury. Dickson contended that none of the alleged contracts made on the boards of trade was entered into on his behalf; that they were devices employed by the company on its own behalf in conducting at Carrollton what was actually a bucket shop in which to gamble in violation of the laws of the state; that he did not employ the company to make any contract for future delivery; that it was understood by him and the plaintiff, in each transaction, that receipt and delivery of the grain would not be required. On evidence which in abbreviated form occupies, besides the exhibits, 125 pages of the printed record, the judge found the facts as alleged in the plea in bar. He found specifically, among other things, that the transactions were wagering contracts 'cloaked in the forms of \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n law'; and that the company's transactions with or for the customers occurred wholly in Missouri. He declined to make any of the findings requested by the company, denied recovery, and entered judgment for the defendant. A motion for a new trial was overruled.\n The company appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals and contended, among other things: (1) That there was no substantial evidence to support the finding that the transactions were fictitious or gambling transactions, and hence invalid under the law of Missouri; and (2) that the Grain Futures Act superseded all relevant state laws relating to the subject of dealings in futures on 'contract markets,' and that the transactions in question, being valid under the federal act, were necessarily valid under the laws of Missouri. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the judgment of the District Court, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. 56 F.(2d) 525. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 581\n, 53 S.Ct. 8, 77 L.Ed. --.\n First. The defense of illegality is predicated not on things done, or to be done, in Chicago or Minneapolis or Winnepeg, but wholly upon things done in Missouri. Uhlmann Grain Company, a member of the Boards of Trade of Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Missouri, and Winnepeg, Canada, was engaged in the grain brokerage business. In 1924 it established a branch office at Carrollton, then a town of about 3,200 inhabitants. It is not disputed that, upon receiving at Carrollton a purported order from Dickson, the Carrollton branch of the grain company communicated with its Kansas City office, and that the company thereupon entered into contracts on some other board of trade for future purchase or sale of grain. The contracts, so far as made within the United States, were entered into on either the Chicago or the Minneapolis Board. Each of these boards had been designated by the Secretary of Agriculture a 'contract market.' The company was a member in good standing \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n of each of the boards. Each contract was made in the name of the company as principal with another member of the board as principal. Each contract was evidenced by a record in writing as prescribed by the Grain Futures Act. And after each such contract was entered into by the company, it mailed, from its office in Kansas City to its customer at Carrollton, a written confirmation of his alleged order and of its execution, which recited the date of the contract, the quantity and kind of grain bought and sold, the contract price per bushel of the commodity, the delivery month, and the place where the contract of purchase or sale was executed. \n1\n The requirements of the federal act appear to have been complied with. There is no suggestion that these contracts violated the law of the place where the exchange was situated. It may be assumed that they were valid as between the Uhlmann Grain Company and its fellow members of the exchanges.\n But there were two distinct agreements: That between customer and company, in which both parties acted as principals; and that between the company and brokers on the exchange, in which both of the parties there likewise acted as principals. It does not follow that because the contracts between the members of the exchanges were \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n valid, those entered into by the company at Carrollton with Dickson and its other customers were valid also. Compare Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 249\n, 250 S., 25 S.Ct. 637. See, also, Harvey v. Merrill, 150 Mass. 1, 22 N.E. 49, 5 L.R.A. 200, 15 Am. St.Rep. 159; Riordon v. McCabe, 341 Ill. 506, 512-515, 173 N.E. 660. Whether the customer, in his agreement with the company, ordered that contracts be entered into in his behalf on the exchange, is the serious issue of fact in the case at bar. If the customer did so order by his agreement, we should have to determine by the law of which state the defense of illegality is governed. If, as Dickson contends, and the trial court found, Dickson's agreement did not contemplate the execution of transactions on the exchange in his behalf, clearly the defense of illegality is governed by the law of Missouri, unless that law has been superseded by the Grain Futures Act.\n Second. There was evidence that the transactions out of which the indebtedness is alleged to have arisen were not in fact orders to enter into contracts on behalf of the defendants to purchase or sell for future delivery, but were devices knowingly employed by the company solely to enable them to gamble. They testified that they were assured by the local manager that they would never have to receive or deliver any grain as a result of their speculations. And there is no lack of evidence to support a finding that in doing so the manager acted within the scope of his authority. It is admitted that no grain was actually delivered by or to the plaintiff's customers. The accounts of the defendants were carried on margin; and the extent of their purported obligations exceeded their financial capacity. It is clear that their purpose was solely to make a profit by reason of the fiuctuations in the market price of grain; and that the plaintiff knew this. The Carrollton office was equipped in a manner common to bucket shops; its furnishings consisted of a desk, chairs, \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n a typewriter, blackboard, and telegraph instrument. The branch manager testified, as did the defendants, that he was active in solicition business among the townspeople. Between 40 and 50 local residents from widely divergent walks of life in no way connected with purchasing or selling grain became customers of the branch. Of the five defendants in the cases consolidated for trial, who were the plaintiff's largest customers at Carrollton, two were farmers, two were clothing merchants, and one was an ice dealer. These defendants, who were not in the grain business, who had never traded on a grain exchange, and who had no facilities for handling grain, purported to buy and sell in amounts up to 50,000 bushels in a single transaction. In a period of nine months the total number of bushels involved in the transactions of four of the defendants, according to one of the plaintiff's witnesses, was 2,360,000. The defendants undoubtedly knew that the company regularly entered into contracts on the exchanges corresponding to the transactions at Carrollton. But the evidence warrants and conclusion that the contracts on the exchange were entered into by the company to enable it to secure the data for the defendants' wagers and to provide the means for determining the defendants' gains and losses; and that both the plaintiff and the defendants so regarded the contracts on the exchanges. So far as concerned the obligations which they undertook, the customers were in the same position as if they had simply wagered against the company on the fluctuations in the prices of grain. Thus, the evidence supports the conclusion that the transactions between the defendants and the company were executed and performed wholly in Missouri; and the law of Missouri accordingly governs, unless prevented by the federal act.\n The burden was on the defendants to establish the defense of illegality under the law of Missouri, Crawford v. Spencer, 92 Mo. 498, 506, 4 S.W. 713, 1 Am.St.Rep. 745; and the evidence \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n was ample to support the conclusion of the trial court that the defense had been sustained. The Missouri Bucket Shop Law, Rev. Stat. (1929),  4316-4323 (Mo. St. Ann.  4316-4323), defines transactions in grain declared to constitute gambling and makes it punishable either to enter into the prohibited transactions or to keep a place where they are entered into. Section 4317 (Mo. St. Ann.  4317), declares that a bucket shop is a place wherein the person carrying on the shop goes through the form of buying and selling certain commodities for other persons 'at prices fixed or pretended to be fixed by trades or transactions made or offered to be made in same on boards of exchange or otherwise, but wherein there is in fact no actual purchase and sale, or sale and purchase of such commodity for or on account of the party or parties thereto.' The statute further provides in section 4318 (Mo. St. Ann.  4318) that all such 'pretended' sales or agreements, 'wherein there is, in fact, no actual purchase and sale or sale and purchase of such commodities for or on account of the party or parties thereto, are hereby declared gambling and criminal acts, whether the order or contract for the pretended purchase or sale of such property purports to be offered, accepted, executed or consummated in this state or in any other state or country: Provided, the offer to make such pretended purchase or sale of said property is placed or given or communicated from this state; and any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a felony.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n The state statute imposed a criminal penalty for the negotiation of what was at common law an illegal contract. Compare Irwin v. Williar, \n110 U.S. 499\n, 508-510, 4 S.Ct. 160; Embry v. Jemison, \n131 \nU.S. 336, 345\n, 9 S.Ct. 776. Under the Missouri statutes it is no defense to a criminal prosecution that the company entered into transactions for future purchases and sales on a contract market, even where the illegality consists in dealing in futures on margin. State v. Christopher, 318 Mo. 225, 2 S.W.(2d) 621.3 In the case at bar the company was a party to the illegal con- \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 198]\n\u00a0\n tracts with its customers; and hence it cannot recover for commissions or for advances. The trial court accordingly was right in entering judgment for the defendants, unless the Missouri law has been superseded by the federal act.\n Third. The Grain Futures Act did not supersede any applicable provisions of the Missouri law making gambling in grain futures illegal. The Grain Futures Act recites in section 3 (7 USCA  5) that transactions in grain involving the sale thereof for future delivery as commonly conducted on boards of trade and known as 'futures' are affected with a national public interest; that they 'are susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control'; and that the resulting obstruction to and burden upon interstate commerce in grain and the products and by-products thereof 'render regulation imperative for the protection of such commerce.' Section 4 (7 USCA  6(b) declares that 'it shall be unlawful' to engage in such transactions except, among other things: '(b) Where such contract is made by or through a member of a board of trade which has been designated by the Secretary of Agriculture as a 'contract market,' ... and if such contract is evidenced by a record in writing which shows the date, the parties to such contract and their addresses, the property covered and its price, and the terms of delivery.'\n The federal act declares that contracts for the future delivery of grain shall be unlawful unless the prescribed conditions are complied with. It does not provide that if these conditions have been complied with the contracts, or the transactions out of which they arose, shall be valid. It does not purport to validate any dealings. Nor is there any basis for the contention that Congress occupied the field in respect to contracts for future delivery; and that necessarily all state legislation in any way dealing with that subject is superseded. The purpose of the Grain Futures Act was to control the evils of manipulation of \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 199]\n\u00a0\n prices in grain. \n4\n Such manipulation, Congress found, was effected through dealings in grain futures. See Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 32\n, 43 S.Ct. 470. Many persons had advocated, as a remedy, that all future trading be abolished. \n5\n Congress took a less extreme position. It set up a system of regulation and prohibited all future trading which did not comply with the regulations prescribed. But it evinced no intention to authorize all future trading if its regulations were complied with. Both the language of the act and its purpose are clear; and they indicate the contrary. The Missouri law is in no way inconsistent with the provision of the federal act. It does not purport to legalize transactions which the federal act has made illegal. It does not prescribe regulations for exchanges. Obviously, manipulation of prices will not be made easier, or the prevention of such manipulation be made more difficult, because the state has declared that certain dealings in futures are illegal, and has forbidden the mainte- \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 200]\n\u00a0\n nance within its borders of places where they are carried on. Since there is nothing in the state law which is inconsistent with, or could conceivably interfere with the operation or enforcement of, the federal law, the statute of Missouri was not superseded. Compare Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S.Ct. 715.6\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n I am unable to join in the decision just announced. My understanding of the evidence constrains me to dissent.\n Sections 4316-4323, Mo. R.S. 1929 (Mo. St. Ann.  4316-4323), prohibit bucket shop transactions in Missouri. Section 4318 denounces as gambling pretended purchases and sales 'wherein there is, in fact, no actual purchase and sale or sale and purchase of such commodities for or on account of the party or parties thereto.' This Court rests its decision solely on that provision.\n Section 4324 denounces as gambling all purchases and sales 'without any intention of receiving and paying for the property so bought, or of delivering the property so sold.' The judgment of the District Court appears to be based upon the conclusion that the transactions between plaintiff and defendants violated that section. But the contracts here involved were executed outside Missouri, and, as shown by the opinion of this Court, are not governed by section 4324. It is not involved. Edwards Brokerage Co. v. Stevenson, 160 Mo. 516, 527, 528, 61 S.W. 617; Atwater v. Brokerage Co., 147 Mo.App. 436, 448, 126 S.W. 823; Hood & Co. v. McCune ( Mo. App.) 235 S.W. 158; \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 201]\n\u00a0\n Claiborne Commission Co. v. Stirlen (Mo. App.) 262, S.W. 387, 388. Cf. State v. Gritzner, 134 Mo. 512. 526, 527, 36 S.W. 39; State v. Christopher, 318 Mo. 225, 237, 2 S.W.(2d) 621.\n The evidence shows affirmatively and without contradiction that plaintiff and defendants did not intend to and did not violate section 4318\n\n\n Plaintiff is not a bucket shop proprietor. It has been engaged for many years in operating grain elevators, including a terminal one of great capacity, and in dealing on its own account in cash grain. It long has been a member of the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Winnipeg Exchanges, and a broker executing customers' orders for the purchase and sale of grain for future as well as for immediate delivery.\n In 1924, from April to late November, it had a branch at Carrollton, Mo., in charge of one McDonough. This branch was connected by private telegraph wire with its Kansas City office, and regularly posted prices at which purchases and sales of grain were being contemporaneously made on the exchanges. McDonough solicited from defendants and others in and about Carrollton orders for the purchase and sale of grain for future delivery to be executed by plaintiff upon the exchanges, and, upon information obtained from plaintiff, gave advice to those desiring to speculate in contracts for the buying and selling of grain on the exchanges.\n He had no authority to bind plaintiff to execute orders and transmitted any obtained by him to the Kansas City office. If plaintiff rejected the order, it notified him at once. An accepted order was sent to plaintiff's office in Chicago and, if for purchase or sale in that city, was executed by its representative in the grain pit on the exchange there. An order for execution at Winnipeg was sent by wire to plaintiff's broker there. Each order forwarded was identified by the customer's name, which for brevity in transmission was usually indicated by the num- \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 202]\n\u00a0\n ber given to his account. Unless the customer stipulated otherwise, it had to be executed on the day it was given.\n In making the purchases and sales on the exchanges, members dealt with each other as principals; but each was required separately to execute each order and, when called on, to furnish the name of his customer to the broker with whom he dealt. The rules of such exchanges required a member to furnish to his customer desiring the information the name of the other broker. And plaintiff made available to defendants' counsel its records disclosing the names of the other parties to the purchases and sales in question.\n Upon the execution of an order, plaintiff promptly wired McDonough the result, and on the same day sent by mail directly to the customer a confirmation showing the kind and quantity of grain, the time specified for delivery, and the price at which it was bought or sold. Each confirmation contained the statement that 'all transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor.' The customer was bound within the specified future month to receive or deliver the grain he had contracted to buy or sell, unless prior to that time he had sold or otherwise closed his contract.\n All the contracts here involved were, when made, intended by the parties to be and in fact were closed by such counter transactions prior to the time fixed for delivery. In accordance with usage prevailing on all contract market exchanges, defendants' contracts of purchase were closed by corresponding sales, and vice versa. And in each instance plaintiff sent a statement to the defendant showing the respective dates of purchase and sale, the quantity and kind of grain, the specified time for delivery, the amounts of plaintiff's commission and of federal taxes, together with the net gain or loss.\n Defendants admit that they intended the orders to be executed on the exchanges, that they were so executed, \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 203]\n\u00a0\n and that the accounts are correct. The advances sued on were made and the commissions claimed were earned. Plaintiff did not sell what defendants bought or buy what they sold. It did not gain when they sustained losses on their contracts to purchase or sell, or lose when they made gains thereon. There was no betting between plaintiff and defendants.\n The trial judge, taking plaintiff's requests for findings as a basis, characterized the transactions as 'purported,' 'pretended,' and 'fictitious.' It quite clearly appears, from the form and language as well as from the substance of the findings* and from his filed opinion, that he held\n * The findings followed the form of plaintiff's requests, and employed the same language, except as indicated below. The words italicized were added by the court; those within brackets were deleted from plaintiff's requests.\n\n 1. \nIn all of the transactions involved in these suits the plaintiff purported to act (acted) as broker for defendants in the purchase and sale of grain for future delivery, and in no case did plaintiff pretend to enter into any other than a brokerage contract with any defendant.\n\n 2. \nEvery pretended purchase and pretended sale was executed by plaintiff for defendant on the Grain Exchange in Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota, or Winnipeg, Manitoba. None of the contracts of purchase or sale involved in these suits purported to have been (was) executed in Missouri.\n\n 3. \nEvery transaction was a pretended contract of purchase or sale of grain for future delivery, purported to have been executed on grain exchanges by plaintiff in behalf of defendants on the one side, in which the plaintiff was a clearing member of the exchange where executed and in which the purported other party to the transaction, either acting for himself or a pretended undisclosed principal, was also a clearing member.\n\n 4. \nEvery pretended contract of purchase or sale executed by plaintiff for defendants was purported to have been carried out in conformity with and in compliance with the rules of the particular grain exchange on which it was pretended to have been closed.\n\n 5. \nEvery contract purported to have been executed by plaintiff on behalf of defendants pretended to call (actually called) for the purchase or sale of grain for future delivery and was evidenced by a memorandum in writing under which, and under the customs and \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 204]\n\u00a0\n that, as actual deliveries were not intended or made, the contracts creating the right to make or call for delivery on specified terms violated section 4324. The characterizations, \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 205]\n\u00a0\n like the statement in the opinion that the transactions were 'wagering contracts ... cloaked with the forms of law,' may not be deemed to be findings of fact. They are \n\n[288 U.S. 188, 206]\n\u00a0\n mere assertions in the nature of conclusions of law. The effect or weight to be given them necessarily depends upon the details and circumstances shown by the evidence. Made as they were through a mistaken view of the applicable law, these declarations may not reasonably be adopted here as findings that no such contracts were made, and that plaintiff and defendants indulged in the make-believe denounced by section 4318.\n There is no evidence of any violation of the bucket shop laws, nor is there any suggestion that the transactions shown can be held illegal, except by force of the Missouri statute. I do not disagree with the majority that the Federal Grain Futures Act (7 USCA  1-17) has not superseded the statutes of Missouri applicable to these transactions.\n I am of opinion that the judgment of the District Court should stand reversed, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The alleged confirmation stated also: 'All transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor. We reserve the right to close these transactions when deposits are running out, without further notice. We also reserve the privilege of clearing all transactions through Clearing Associations, if there be any, from day to day in accordance with the usages, rules and regulations of the Exchange where the trade is made, prevailing at the time. All purchases and sales made by us for you are made in accordance with and subject to the rules, regulations and customs of the Chamber of Commerce or Board of Trade where the trades are made and the rules, regulations and requirements of its Board of Directors, and all amendments that may be made thereto. The contract is made under the authority of the Act of Congress known as 'The Future Trading Act (42 Stat. 187).\" \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The defense rests solely on Mo. Rev. Stat. (1929),  4316 to 4323 ( Mo. St. Ann.  4316-4323); not on  4324-4326, 4329 (Mo. St. Ann.  4324-4326, 4329). The former sections derive from Mo. Laws 1887, p. 171; the latter, from Mo. Rev. Stat. (1889)  3931-3936. See State v. Long, 261 Mo. 314, 316, 169 S.W. 11. The latter sections prohibit the purchase or sale of grain on margin where there is an intention not to make or receive delivery, and declare contracts made in violation of this prohibition void, even if only one of the parties to the contract has an intention not to deliver. Under the latter sections it has been held that such an intention on the part of a customer for whom a broker has executed future contracts is sufficient to defeat the broker's claim for commissions even though he was unaware of that intention, Price v. Barnes, 300 Mo. 216, 229, 231, 254 S.W. 33; but that the provisions do not apply where the execution of the contracts occurred in another state pursuant to orders given to the broker in Missouri. Edwards Brokerage Co. v. Stevenson, 160 Mo. 516, 527-528, 61 S.W. 617. See Connor v. Black, 119 Mo. 126, 141, 24 S.W. 184; Price v.

These cases have no application in the case at bar. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare the statutes enacted in recent years in several states, declaring that contracts for future delivery of grain and other commodities are valid and enforceable if made according to the rules of an exchange, actually executed on the exchange, and performed or discharged according to its rules, and made with or through a member in good standing.

The title of the act is: 'An Act for the prevention and removal of obstructions and burdens upon interstate commerce in grain, by regulating transactions on grain future exchanges, and for other purposes.' A cardinal argument for the passage of the Grain Futures Act was the severe decline in prices on the Chicago Board of Trade subsequent to the decision in Hill v.

That under the custom and practice existing and under the rules of the exchanges, offsetting or ringing purchases or sales under proper circumstances in good faith were permitted in lieu of the actual delivery of grain contracted for. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Every transaction involved in these suits initiated by a purported purchase or sale was offset by a pretended sale or pretended purchase executed in the same manner as the initiating purported purchase or sale. Every pretended purchase or sale was closed out by a purported offsetting transaction before the delivery time arrived and was purported to have been executed by plaintiff on the orders and at the instruction of defendants, save an except as to some of the last transactions, which were closed out by plaintiff without instruction from such defendant at a time when defendant had no cash margin to protect his transactions. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] At all the times in question plaintiff was a member in good standing of the grain exchanges on which the pretended contracts of purchase and sale were executed, and plaintiff constantly maintained a margin with the clearing house of each grain exchange as security for the performance of its bona fide contracts. All transactions of pretended purchase and pretended sale executed by plaintiff for defendants were purported to have been contracted for on the exchanges in the name of plaintiff (plaintiff was responsible for their performance, and in each instance where the sale price was for an amount less than the purchase price, plaintiff acting as defendants' broker paid the difference to the clearing house of the exchange upon which the transactions were carried out. In none of the transactions did plaintiff profit or lose by a loss or profit to defendants. In all of them it acted only as a broker for defendants.) \n[\nFootnote 8\n] None of the pretended purchases or sales were purported to have been executed at Carrollton, Mo. Orders were pretended to have been given by defendants from time to time at Carrollton to plaintiff's local office for purported execution on the grain exchanges at Chicago, Minneapolis, and Winnipeg; but none of these orders were purported to have been accepted by plaintiff at Carrollton. All of them were telegraphed to Kansas City for acceptance or rejection, and, if accepted, were purported to have been carried out by plaintiff \n by telegraphic instructions emanating from Kansas City and by pretended written confirmation of the execution of the order, which pretended written confirmations would be mailed from Kansas City to the customer. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] That no records of the accounts of plaintiff with the defendants were kept at Carrollton; that no moneys were paid out to customers in Carrollton, but remittances were mailed direct by check from Kansas City. All statements, all pretended 'P. & S's,' all pretended confirmations of the purported execution of purchases and sales, were mailed to defendants from Kansas City. The Carrollton office merely pretended to receive(d) and transmit(ted) purported orders to its customers to Kansas City for pretended execution on the Grain Exchange designated in the customer's pretended order. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] All (none) of the transactions of purchase and sale executed by plaintiff for defendant were fictitious transactions. None (all) of them were actually executed between clearing members of the exchange where pretended to have been consummated. (One of whom would be plaintiff acting for defendant.) \n[\nFootnote 11\n] In all (none) of the transactions (did) plaintiff bet with its customers and took (or take) the other side of the deal.\n (In no transaction did plaintiff and defendant settle the gain or loss of defendant other than by ascertaining the actual difference between the price at which the commodity was bought and that at which it was sold. In no transaction of purchase or sale did plaintiff and defendant fix a ficitious profit or loss to defendant by an ascertainment of the difference between the contract price and the market price on the day fixed for delivery.) \n[\nFootnote 12\n] In each transaction, after a pretended order to sell or purchase was purported to have been executed by plaintiff in behalf of defendant, written confirmation thereof was immediately mailed by plaintiff to defendant. Every written confirmation recited that:\n'All transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor.'\n\n The court's findings did not cover other matters included in plaintiff's requests; the scope of its local agent's authority, whether the orders were made and recorded in accordance with the rules and regulations of the contract markets in which they were executed, and the intent of the parties as to receipt and delivery of wheat bought. \n\n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDU PONT v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1933)\nNo. 791\nArgued: May 9, 1933Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. James S. Y. Ivins, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.[ du Pont v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue \n289 U.S. 685\n (1933) ]\n\n\n[289 U.S. 685, 687]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General andMr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, like Burnet, Commissioner, v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670\n, 53 S.Ct. 761, 77 L.Ed. --, decided today, requires us to determine whether section 219(h) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 (26 USCA  960 note) is consistent with the Fifth Amendment in its application to trusts for the payment of premiums on policies of insurance.\n On September 18, 1923, the petitioner, Du Pont, created nine trusts for the benefit of his wife and children, transferring to the trustee thereby two policies of insurance on his life, and shares of stock in a corporation, the income to be used to keep the policies in force. The trusts were to last for three years, during which term they were to be irrevocable. At the end of the term, they might be extended for a like period at the option of the settlor, and successively thereafter. Two such notices were given, with the result that in 1924, 1925, and 1926, the taxable years involved in this proceeding, the trusts were still in being.\n The deeds make provision for the disposition of the policies and separate provision for the disposition of the shares.\n As to the policies, the provision is that, if the trusts shall be terminated before the petitioner's death, all interest in the policies shall vest in certain named beneficiaries. The petitioner is not one of these, nor has he any power to change them. If the petitioner shall die while the trusts are still in force, the trustee is to collect the insurance, and to hold the proceeds in trust for the use of the beneficiaries named in the agreements. \n\n[289 U.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n As to the shares of stock, the provision is that, if the trusts shall be terminated before the petitioner's death, the shares and any income not paid out shall be transferred to the petitioner. If, however, he shall die while the trusts are still in force, the shares are to be divided among the children or their issue.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, following the command of section 219(h) of the applicable statutes (Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253, 26 U.S. Code,  960 (26 USCA  960 note), chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 26 U.S. Code App.  960 (26 USCA  960 note)), made a deficiency assessment by adding to the taxpayer's income the amount expended by the trustee in the preservation of the policies. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the assessment (20 B.T.A. 482), and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. 63 F.(2d) 44. A writ of certiorari was granted by this court. \n289 \nU.S. 715\n, 53 S.Ct. 528, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The case is ruled by our judgment in Burnet, Commissioner, v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670\n, 53 S.Ct. 761, 77 L.Ed. --, upholding the validity of the contested statute. If the income of such a trust may be taxed to the grantor, though he has retained to himself no reversionary interest in the principal of the trust, a fortiori that result must follow where he has made a grant of the estate for a short term of years, reserving the reversion when the term is at an end.\n The provisions of these deeds would require a determination in favor of the government, though Burnet v. Wells had been decided the other way. 'A statute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another.' Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, 108. Here the grantor did not divest himself of title in any permanent or definitive way, did not strip himself of every interest i the subject-matter of the trust estate. During a term of three years, the trustee was to apply the income to the preservation of the policies, and while thus applying the income was to hold the prin- \n\n[289 U.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n cipal intact for return to the grantor unless instructed to retain it longer. The situation in its legal effect would not be greatly different if the trusts had been created for a month or from day to day. One who retains for himself so many of the attributes of ownership is not the victim of despotic power when for the purpose of taxation he is treated as owner altogether.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur upon the reasons stated in the last paragraph. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEDELMAN v.

Jackson, all of Cheyenne, Wyo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. M.

As respondent waived relief by interlocutory injunction, see Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 47 S.Ct. 385, the case was tried before a single judge who upheld the tax and dismissed the case on the merits. 51 F.(2d) 130. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the decree and directed that the petitioners be enjoined from assessing the tax on gasoline procured by respondent by 'purchases completed outside the State of Wyoming and then brought into that state and used in its planes in interstate commerce.' 61 F.(2d) 319, 324. This Court granted certiorari. \n288 \nU.S. 595\n, 53 S.Ct. 386, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The statute1 levis a 'license tax of four cents per gallon ... on all gasoline used or sold in this State ... for domestic consumption' and requires every 'wholesaler' engaged in the 'sale or use of gasoline' within the state to report to the state treasurer each month all the gasoline 'sold or used' by it in the state, and to pay the tax upon it. Gasoline 'exported or sold for exportation from the State' is exempted from the tax. A 'wholesaler' is defined as any person (1) who 'imports or causes to be imported gasoline ... for sale in the State ... to the jobber or consumer, or to the persons ... who, in turn, sell to the jobber or consumer,' or (2) who 'produces, refines, manufactures, blends or compounds gasoline' in Wyoming 'for use, sale or distribution in this State.' In addition the statute provides that 'every person ... who shall use any gasoline in this State upon which the said tax has not been paid by any \n\n[289 U.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n wholesaler in this State,' shall render a like statement and pay a like tax.\n Respondent maintains an airplane service for the transportation in interstate commerce of passengers, mail and express with airports at Cheyenne and Rock Springs. It purchases gasoline both within and without the state, which it intermingles and stores in tanks at the two airports. It pays the tax without objection on all gasoline which it sells within the state at its airports or withdraws from the tanks for local use. But it contends, and the court below held, that the tax cannot validly be applied to the gasoline imported from outside the state, stored in tanks at the airports and used for 'filling' the interstate airplanes in which it is eventually consumed.\n The opinion below leaves us uncertain whether the injunction was granted upon the ground that the taxing statute does not, in any event, apply to gasoline purchased without the state, if not sold within it, or upon the ground that the taxation of gasoline purchased outside the state and used at respondent's airports to 'fill' its interstate planes, though authorized by the statute, is a prohibited burden on interstate commerce. But the bill of complaint sought no relief on the ground that the statute does not apply to the gasoline so used and no question of the applicability of the tax is argued here. Issue is joined on the only question raised by the pleadings, whether the taxation of the gasoline which respondent withdraws from storage and uses for 'filling' its planes imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Hence we confine our decision to that question.\n As the statute has been administratively construed and applied, the tax is not levied upon the consumption of gasoline in furnishing motive power for respondent's interstate planes. The tax is applied to the stored gasoline as it is withdrawn from the storage tanks at the airport and placed in the planes. No tax is collected for gasoline \n\n[289 U.S. 249, 252]\n\u00a0\n consumed in respondent's planes either on coming into the state or on going out. It is at the time of withdrawal alone that 'use' is measured for the purposes of the tax. The stored gasoline is deemed to be 'used' within the state and therefore subject to the tax, when it is withdrawn from the tanks. Compare Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 350, decided February 6, 1933; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472\n, 52 S.Ct. 631; Hart Refineries v. Harmon, \n278 \nU.S. 499\n, 49 S.Ct. 188; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642\n, 41 S.Ct. 606\n\n\n A state may validly tax the 'use' to which gasoline is put in withdrawing it from storage within the state, and placing it in the tanks of the planes, notwithstanding that its ultimate function is to generate motive power for carrying on interstate commerce. Such a tax cannot be distinguished from that considered and upheld in Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Wallace, supra. There it was pointed out that 'there can be no valid objection to the taxation of the exercise of any right or power incident to ... ownership of the gasoline, which falls short of a tax directly imposed on its use in interstate commerce, deemed forbidden in Helson v. Kentucky, supra (\n279 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S.Ct. 279).' As the exercise of the powers taxed, the storage and withdrawal from storage of the gasoline, was complete before interstate commerce began, it was held that the burden of the tax was too indirect and remote from the function of interstate commerce, to transgress constitutional limitations.\n Despite the fact that the statute as applied is identical in operation with that sustained in Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Wallace, supra, respondent contends that as the statute is written, the tax is one on the consumption of gasoline in propelling its airplanes in interstate commerce, invalid under Helson v. Kentucky, supra. In that case a Kentucky statute taxing the use of gasoline was applied to that purchased and placed in the tanks of a ferryboat outside the state for use in operat- \n\n[289 U.S. 249, 253]\n\u00a0\n ing it in interstate commerce. The tax, which was levied only with respect to the gasoline consumed while the ferryboat was within the state, was held to be invalid as, in effect, a direct tax on the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce.DP But the officers of Wyoming, charged with the enforcement of the taxing statute, are giving no such application to it as was given to that in Helson v. Kentucky, supra, and it is not suggested that they will. All that has been done or threatened by them, under their interpretation of the statute, infringes no constitutional right of the complainant. In the circumstances, no case is presented, either by pleadings or proof, calling on a federal court of equity to rule upon the correctness of some other construction which may never be adopted by the state administrative officials or by the state courts.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Wyoming Laws of 1929 (Sp.

We directed the judges to show cause why the leave prayed should not be granted, assigned the case for argument, directed briefs to be filed on or before the day set, stayed proceedings against petitioner, and directed the District Court to continue its term pending the final determination of petitioner's application. The judges made their return to the rule. On the appointed day, there being no material controversy as to controlling facts, we heard oral arguments upon the merits.\n The act of the Arizona Legislature approved by the Governor, May 16, 1912, and on referendum by a majority of the voters of the State November 5, 1912 (chapter 43) being section 647, Revised Code 1928, declares that it shall be unlawful for any company operating a railroad in that state to run over its line any train consisting of more than 70 freight or other cars exclusive of caboose, or any passenger train of more than 14 cars and provides that any company that shall willfully violate any of the provisions of the act shall be liable to the state for a penalty of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 for each offense and that such penalty shall be recovered, and suits therefor brought, by the Attorney General in the name of the state.\n July 24, 1929, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company and the Southern Pacific Company respectively brought suits in the federal court above referred to against K. Berry Peterson, then Attorney General of the state. By its complaint each of the plaintiffs shows that it operates a line of railroad and trains for interstate transportation in and through Arizona, sets forth facts on which it claims that enforcement of the statute against it would violate the Commerce Clause (Const. art. 1 ,  8, cl. 3), the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, various provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and other laws of the United States regulating interstate transportation by railroad (49 USCA  1 et seq.), alleges that, if plaintiff shall operate con- \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 453]\n\u00a0\n sisting of more than the specified number of cars, the defendant unless enjoined will institute numerous prosecutions for recovery of the prescribed penalties, asserts that the damage and injury which it daily sustains by reason of the statute is great and irreparable and prays that defendant be temporarily and permanently enjoined.\n In each case defendant answered and moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that the suit was one against the state prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment. The court consolidated the cases, refused temporary injunctions and denied defendant's motions to dismiss. Southern Pac. Co. v. Peterson, 43 F.(2d) 198. It then appointed a master who heard and reported the evidence together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for decrees in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant filed exceptions to, and moved to suppress, the report. The parties their briefs and the court, in accordance with their stipulation, set down the causes for hearing at San Francisco on February 8, 1933. In the meantime, January 3, 1933, defendant's term of office expired and the petitioner, La Prade, then became the Attorney General of the state. January 30, the plaintiffs delivered to petitioner a copy of an application to the court for an order substituting him as party defendant and gave notice that the application would be presented to the court at the time and place so fixed.\n The applications for substitution were made under 28 U.S.C.  780 (28 USCA  780).1 It provides that, where a suit brought \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 454]\n\u00a0\n by or against a state officer is pending in a federal court at the time of his separation from his office the court may permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or against such officer's successor if within six months it be satisfactorily shown that there is a substantial need for so continuing and maintaining the cause and obtaining an adjudication of the questions involved. The section requires that the officer, unless expressly consenting thereto, be given reasonable notice of the application and an opportunity to present any objection which he may have. As grounds for the substitution plaintiffs' application merely stated that each suit relates to the future discharge of the official duties of the Attorney General of Arizona and, following the language of the statute, that there is a substantial need for continuing and maintaining it and obtaining adjudication of the questions involved.\n Plaintiffs, at the appointed time and place, applied to the court for the order of substitution. The petitioner appeared specially and objected. He insisted that, each of the suits being against his predecessor individually, the questions involved became moot upon the expiration of the latter's term of office; that, there being no pleading \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 455]\n\u00a0\n charging him with having threatened to enforce the state enactment, there was no cause of action against him; that he could not be held for the costs theretofore incurred and that the suits should be dismissed. After hearing the parties the court by an order, merely containing a recital in the general words of the statute as to the need for continuing the suits, made the petitioner defendant in each case.\n Promptly, upon somewhat amplified grounds, he filed a motion that the cases be dismissed. The court denied the motion. Petitioner and his counsel declined to participate in further proceedings in the case. The court heard plaintiffs orally and March 8, 1933, filed its opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered decrees adjudging the statute unconstitutional and enjoining petitioner. It declared that no costs up to and including the entry of the final decree should be assessed against petitioner or his predecessor. The opinion, Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. La Prade, 2 F.Supp. 855, construes the statute to impose the duty of enforcement upon each succeeding Attorney General and declares that, as long as there is an Attorney General in the state the threat of prosecution is always present and the resulting injury, if any, always impends.\n The injunctions sought are not aimed at the state or the office of Attorney General or to restrain exertion of any authority that belongs to either. Each complaint charges that, because of a void enactment and the purpose of defendant under color of his office to enforce it by means of suits which it purports to authorize, plaintiff is prevented from operating trains that are of suitable size and necessary for the proper conduct of the transportation business, and so continuously suffers great and irreparable injury. The suits were brought against defendant not as a representative of the state but to restrain him individually from, as it is alleged, wrongfully subjecting plaintiff to such unauthorized prosecutions. In Ex parte \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 456]\n\u00a0\n Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, page 159, 28 S.Ct. 441, 454, 13 L.R.A.( N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764, the court said: 'The act to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional; and if it be so, the use of the name of the state to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury of complainants is a proceeding without the authority of, and one which does not affect, the state in its sovereign or governmental capacity. It is simply as illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting, by the use of the name of the state, to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional. If the act which the state Attorney General seeks to enforce be a violation of the Federa Constitution, the officer, in proceeding under such enactment, comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.' The principle there stated has since been applied in numerous decisions here. See e.g., Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, \n221 U.S. 636\n, 642 et seq., 31 S.Ct. 654, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 243; Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 36 S.Ct. 7, L.R.A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; Terrace v.

See Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219, 222\n, 42 S.Ct. 293. The suits abated when defendant Peterson ceased to be attorney general. And unless empowered by section 780 the District Court is without jurisdiction to direct that petitioner be substituted and that the suits be continued and maintained against him.

Wendell, \n261 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 313.\n Subdivision (a) of section 780 applies only to proceedings brought by or against officers of the United States or those holding office directly or mediately under the authority of Congress. It is derived from the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  11(a), 43 Stat. 941. It enlarges the Act \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 457]\n\u00a0\n of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822, which was passed after our decision in United States ex rel. Bernardin v. Butterworth, supra. It was there held that a suit to compel the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent abated by the death of the Commissioner and could not be revived so as to bring in his successor even upon consent of the latter. At the conclusion of its opinion the court said (page 605 of 169 U.S., 18 S.Ct. 441, 443): 'In view of the inconvenience, of which the present case is a striking instance, occasioned by this state of the law, it would seem desirable that congress should provide for the difficulty by enacting that, in the case of suits against the heads of departments abating by death or resignation, it should be lawful for the successor in office to be brought into the case by petition, or some other appropriate method.'\n Subdivision (b) applies only to proceedings brought by or against those holding office under state authority. As to such, it authorizes 'similar proceedings' to those specified in subdivision (a). It was passed after our decision in Irwin v. Wright, supra. The opinion shows (page 222 of 258 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 293, 295) that a suit to enjoin a public officer from enforcing a statute is personal and, in the absence of statutory provision for continuing it against his successor, abates upon his death or retirement from office. The court held that the Act of February 8, 1899, did not authorize the substitution of a county treasurer for his predecessor in a suit against the latter to enjoin collection of taxes. We suggested that it would promote justice if Congress were to enlarge the scope of that act so as to authorize substitution in suits by or agaisnt state officers and said: 'Under the present state of the law, an important litigation may be begun and carried through to this court after much effort and expense, only to end in dismissal because, in the necessary time consumed in reaching here, state officials, parties to the action, have retired from office. It is a defect which only legislation can cure.' \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 458]\n\u00a0\n Subdivision (c) extends to all cases covered by (a) and (b). It merely requires that before substitution a nonconsenting officer shall be given notice and opportunity to object. It does not prescribe the showing of facts necessary to warrant an order that the proceedi g be continued by or against the successor. When construing the section, it is to be borne in mind that Congress has authority to direct the conduct of federal officers in proceedings brought by or against them as such and may ordain that they may sue or be sued as representatives of the United States and stand in judgment on its behalf (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon- Washington R. & Nav. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 14, 27\n, 53 S.Ct. 266) but that Congress is not so empowered as to state officers. The section is merely permissive; it does not require but merely authorizes the court to order substitution in the cases covered. It extends only to suits 'relating to the present or future discharge of ... official duties.' At least as to state officers it does not purport to authorize the imposition of liability or restraint upon the successor on account of anything done or threatened by the predecessor individually.\n As shown above the purpose of the suits was to prevent a wrong about to be committed by defendant acting outside, and in abuse of the powers of, his office. The wrongs threatened or committed by him constitute no ground for injunction against petitioner. Plaintiffs did not allege that petitioner threatened or intended to do anything for the enforcement of the statute. The mere declaration of the statute that suits for recovery of penalties shall be brought by the Attorney General is not sufficient. Petitioner might hold, as plaintiffs maintain, that the statute is unconstitutional and that, having regard to his official oath, he rightly may refrain from effort to enforce it. United States Constitution, art. 6, cl. 3; Arizona Revised Code 1928,  63. The statement of Chief Justice Taft writing for the court in Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Wendell, \n\n[289 U.S. 444, 459]\n\u00a0\n supra, is pertinent. He said (page 4 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 313, 315): 'The inherent difficulty in all these cases is not in the liability and suability of the successor in a new suit. It is in the shifting from the personal liability of the first officer for threatened wrong or abuse of his office to the personal liability of his successor when there is no privity between them, as there is not if the officer sued is injuring or is threatening to injure the complainant without lawful official authority. There is no legal relation between the wrong committed or about to be committed by the one, and that by the other.'\n It follows from what has been said that section 780 has no application to the case as presented and that the District Court had no jurisdiction to substitute petitioner as a party defendant in place of his predecessor or to direct that the suits be continued and maintained against him. We have no occasion to decide whether or in what circumstances a successor in office who adopts the attitude of his predecessor and is proceeding or threatening to proceed to enforce the statute may be substituted in a pending suit. That question is not here and is reserved.\n Petitioner's application for leave to file is granted, the case will be docketed and respondents' return filed, and a writ of mandamus will issue commanding the respondents to vacate the decrees against petitioner and to dismiss the suits as to him.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(a) Where, during the pendency of an action, suit, or other proceeding brought by or against an officer of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or the Canal Zone, or of a Territory or an insular possession of the United States, or of a county, city, or other governmental agency of such Territory or insular possession, and relating to the present or future discharge of his official duties, such officer dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold such office, it shall be competent for the court wherein the action, suit, or proceeding is pending, whether the court b one of first instance or an appellate tribunal, to permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or against the successor in office of such officer, if within six months after his death of separation from the office it be satisfactorily shown to the court that there is a substantial need for so continuing and maintaining the cause and obtaining an adjudication of the questions involved.\n'(b) Similar proceedings may be had and taken where an action, suit, or proceeding brought by or against an officer of a State, or of a county, city, or other governmental agency of a State, is pending in a court of the United States at the time of the officer's death or separation from the office.\n\n'(c) Before a substitution under this section is made, the party or officer to be affected, unless expressly consenting thereto, must be given reasonable notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to present any objection which he may have.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE PORESKY(1933)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph Poresky, pro se.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Leave is asked to file a petition for a writ of mandamus requiring District Judge Elisha H.

Jud. Code  266, 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n Petitioner brought suit in the District Court of the United States against Joseph E. Ely, Governor, Joseph E. Warner, Attorney General, and Morgan T. Ryan, Registrar of Motor Vehicles, of Massachusetts, to enjoin the enforcement of chapter 90,  34A et seq., of the General Laws (Ter. Ed .) of Massa \n\n[290 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n chusetts relating to 'compulsory automobile liability insurance,' upon the ground that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Petitioner alleged in his complaint that he is a citizen of Massachusetts; that the Registrar of Motor Vehicles had refused registration and number plates for his car unless he complied with the statute, under which he 'must first post either bond or cash of $5,000, or procure insurance'; that the statute 'is only applicable to cars owned and operated within the State and does not include cars in interstate traffic'; that he cannot comply with the statute; that to disregard it would bring him fine and imprisonment; that he has no adequate remedy at law; and that his inability to comply with the statute 'is the Registrar's only reason for refusing him registration and number plates.'\n The District Judge dismissed the complaint as to Governor Ely and Attorney General Warner upon the ground that they were improperly joined as parties, and later he dismissed the complaint as to the defendant Ryan, Registrar of Motor Vehicles, for the want of jurisdiction, as there was no diversity of citizenship and no substantial federal question.\n The District Judge recognized the rule that if the court was warranted in taking jurisdiction and the case fell within section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), a single judge was not authorized to dismiss the complaint on the merits, whatever his opinion of the merits might be.

But the provision requiring the presence of a court of three judges necessarily assumes that the District Court has jurisdiction. In the absence of diversity of citizenship, it is essential to jurisdiction that a substantial federal question should be presented.

That provision does not require three judges to pass upon this initial question of jurisdiction.\n The existence of a substantial question of constitutionality must be determined by the allegations of the bill of complaint.

The question may be plainly unsubstantial, either because it is 'obviously without merit' or because 'its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.'

Such was his authority in the instant case, in view of the decisions of this Court bearing upon the constitutional authority of the state, acting in the interest of public safety, to enact the statute assailed.

Butler, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. D. Mitchell, of New York City, and Franklin R. Overmyer, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent Godfrey Haggard, his Britannic Majesty's Consul General.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 276, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On complaint of the British Consul, a United States Commissioner for the Northern District of Illinois issued his warrant to hold petitioner in custody for extradition to England, under article 10 of the Webster- Ashburton Treaty of 1842 (1 Malloy's Treaties, pp. 650, 655, 8 Stat. 572, 576), as supplemented by the Blaine-Pauncefote Convention of 1889 (1 Malloy's Treaties, p. 740, 26 Stat. 1508) and certified the evidence in the proceeding before him to the Secretary of State under the provisions of section 651, title 18 USCA. The application for extradition was based on a charge that petitioner, at London, had 'received from Broadstreet Press Limited' certain sums of money, 'knowing the same to have been fraudulently obtained.' Upon application by the petitioner for writ of habeas corpus, and certiorari in its aid, the District Court for Northern Illinois ordered him released from custody on the ground that the act charged was not embraced within the applicable treaties because not an offense under the laws of Illinois, the state in which the was apprehended and held. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court, 61 F.(2d) 626, on the ground that the offense was a crime in Illinois, as had been declared in Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6\n, 36 S.Ct. 487. This Court granted certiorari, \n289 \nU.S. 713\n, 53 S.Ct. 523, 790, on a petition which presented as ground for the reversal of the judgment below that under the Treaty of 1842 and Convention of 1889, extradition may not be had unless the offense charged is a crime under the law of the state where the fugitive is found, and that 'receiving money, knowing the same to have been fraudulently obtained,' the crime with which the petitioner was charged, is not an offense under the laws of Illinois.\n In support of this contention, petitioner asserts that it is a general principle of international law that an offense for which extradition may be had must be a crime both in the demanding country and in the place where \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 287]\n\u00a0\n the fugitive is found, and that the applicable treaty provisions, interpreted in the light of that principle, exclude any right of either country to demand the extradition of a fugitive unless the offense with which he is charged is a crime in the particular place of asylum. See Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 61\n, 23 S.Ct. 781. But the principles of international law recognize no right to extradition apart from treaty. While a government may, if agreeable to its own constitution and laws, voluntarily exercise the power to surrender a fugitive from justice to the country from which he had fled, and it has been said that it is under a moral duty to do so (see 1 Moore, Extradition,  14; Clarke, Extradition (4th Ed.) p. 14), the legal right to demand his extradition and the correlative duty to surrender him to the demanding country exist only when created by treaty. See United States v. Rauscher, \n119 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 412 S., 7 S.Ct. 234; Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 569, 582, 614, 618; United States v. Davis, 2 Sumn. 482, Fed. Cas. No. 14,932; Case of Jose Ferreira dos Santos, 2 Brock. 493, Fed. Cas. No. 4,016; Commonwealth ex rel. Short v. Deacon, 10 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 125; 1 Moore, Extradition,  9-13. Cf. Matter of Washburn, 4 Johns. Ch. (N.Y.) 106, 107, 8 Am.Dec. 548; 1 Kent.Com. 37. To determine the nature and extent of the right we must look to the treaty which created it. The question presented here, therefore, is one of the construction of the provisions of the applicable treaties in accordance with the principles governing the interpretation of international agreement.\n The extradition provisions of the treaty with Great Britain of 18421 are embodied in article 10, which pro- \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 288]\n\u00a0\n vides that each country 'shall ... deliver up to justice all persons who, being charged with' any of seven named crimes 'committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum, or shall be found, within the territories of the other.' The crime charged here is not one of those specified in article 10 and is therefore not an offense with respect to which extradition may be demanded, unless made so by the provisions of the supplemental convention of 1889. That convention recites that it is desired by the high contracting parties that the provisions of article 10 of the earlier treaty should 'embrace certain crimes not therein specified,' and agrees by article 12 that the provisions of article 10 of the earlier treaty \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 289]\n\u00a0\n shall be made applicable to an added schedule of crimes specified in ten numbered classes of offenses and one unnumbered class. In the case of certain offenses, those enumerated in the classes numbered 4 and 10, and in the unnumbered class, article 10 applies only if they are, in the former case, 'made criminal' and, in the latter, \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 290]\n\u00a0\n 'punishable,' 'by the laws of both countries.' No such limitation is expressed with respect to the crimes enumerated in the other eight classes, one of which, the third, includes the crime with which petitioner is charged. Thus, like article 10 of the earlier treaty, article 1 specifies by name those offenses upon accusation of which the fugitive is to be surrendered and it extends to them the obligation of the earlier treaty. But article 1, unlike article 10, singles out for exceptional treatment certain of the offenses named, which in terms are brought within the obligation of the treaty only if they are made criminal by the laws of both countries.\n Notwithstanding this distinction, appearing on the face of the convention, petitioner insists that in no case does it require extradition of a fugitive who has sought asylum in the United States unless the criminal act with which he is charged abroad is similarly defined as a crime by the laws of the particular state, district or territory of the United States in which he is found. The only language in the two treaties said to support this contention is the proviso in article 10 of the Treaty of 1842, following the engagement to surrender fugitives charged with specified of fenses, which reads as follows: 'Provided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offense had there been committed. ...'\n It cannot be said that these words give any clear indication that a fugitive charged with acts constituting a crime named in the treaty is not to be subject to extradition unless those acts are also defined as criminal by the laws of the state in which he is apprehended. The proviso would appear more naturally to refer to the procedure to be followed in the country of the asylum in asserting and making effective the obligation of the treaty \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 291]\n\u00a0\n and particularly to the quantum of proof-the 'evidence'-which is to be required at the place of asylum to establish the fact that the fugitive has committed the treaty offense within the jurisdiction of the demanding country.\n When the treaty was adopted there was no statutory provision of the United States regulating the procedure to be followed in securing extradition of the fugitive, and the necessary procedure was provided in the treaty itself. By the proviso, the observance of the laws of the place of refuge is exacted in apprehending and detaining the fugitive. See Benson v. McMshon, \n127 \nU.S. 457\n, 8 S.Ct. 1240; In re Metzger, 17 Fed. Cas. p. 232, No. 9,511. It prescribes a method of procedure, in conformity with local law, by which compliance with the obligation of the treaty may be exacted at the place of refuge; and sets up a standard by which to measure the amount of the proof of the offense charged which the treaty requires as prerequisite to extradition. The standard thus adopted is that which under local law would determine the sufficiency of the evidence to justify the apprehension and commitment 'if the crime or offence had there been committed.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 276, 292]\n\u00a0\n Were article 10 intended to have the added meaning insisted upon by petitioner, that there should be no extradition unless the act charged is one made criminal by the laws of the place of refuge, that meaning would naturally have been expressed in connection with the enumeration of the treaty offenses, rather than in the proviso which, in its whole scope, deals with procedure. That no such meaning can fairly be attributed to the proviso becomes evident when article 10 is read, as for present purposes it must be, with the supplementary provisions of the Convention of 1889\n\n\n The draftsmen of the latter document obviously treated the proviso as dealing with procedure alone, since they took care to provide in article 1 that fugitives should be subject to extradition for certain offenses, only if they were defined as criminal by the laws of both countries, but omitted any such provision with respect to all the others enumerated, including the crime of 'receiving,' with which petitioner is charged. \n4\n This was an unnecessary \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 293]\n\u00a0\n precaution and one not consistently taken if the proviso already precluded extradition when the offense charged is not also criminal in the particular place of asylum. A less strained and entirely consistent construction is that urged by respondent, that the specification of the crime of 'receiving,' as a treaty offense, without qualification, evidenced an intention to dispense with the restriction applied to other treaty offenses, that they must be crimes 'by the laws of both countries.'\n In choosing between conflicting interpretations of a treaty obligation, a narrow and restricted construction is to be avoided as not consonant with the principles deemed controlling in the interpretation of international agreements. Considerations which should govern the diplomatic relations between nations, and the good faith of treaties, as well, require that their obligations should be liberally construed so as to effect the apparent intention of the parties to secure equality and reciprocity between them. For that reason if a treaty fairly admits of two constructions, \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 294]\n\u00a0\n one restricting the rights which may be claimed under it, and the other enlarging it, the more liberal construction is to be preferred. Jordan v. Tashiro, \n278 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 49 S.Ct. 47; Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 271\n, 10 S.Ct. 295; In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 475\n, 11 S.Ct. 897; Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 22 S.Ct. 195; Asakura v. Seattle, \n265 \nU.S. 332\n, 44 S.Ct. 515. Unless these principles, consistently recognized and applied by this Court, are now to be discarded, their application here leads inescapably to the conclusion that the treaties, presently involved, on their face require the extradition of the petitioner, even though the act with which he is charged would not be a crime if committed in Illinois.\n In ascertaining the meaning of a treaty we may look beyond its written words to the negotiations and diplomatic correspondence of the contracting parties relating \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 295]\n\u00a0\n to the subject-matter, and to their own practical construction of it. Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 49 S.Ct. 223; In re Ross, supra, at page 467 of 140 U.S., 11 S.Ct. 897; United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 16 S.Ct. 725; Kinkead v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 483, 486\n, 14 S.Ct. 172; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 223\n, 44 S.Ct. 15. And in resolving doubts the construction of a treaty by the political department of the government, while not conclusive upon courts called upon to construe it, is nevertheless of weight. Nielsen v. Johnson, supra, page 52 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 223; Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 468\n, 33 S.Ct. 945, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 397. But the exhaustive search, by counsel, through available diplomatic records and correspondence, in response to the invitation of the Court in its order for reargument of this cause, has disclosed nothing in diplomatic history which would afford a basis for any different conclusion.\n Within two years of the proclamation of the Treaty of 1842, our State Department had occasion to construe the provisions of article 10, now under consideration, and to take a definite position as to their scope and meaning. Certain fugitive slaves, charged with robbery and murder by indictment of the grand jury for the District of Florida, had fled to Napan in the Bahama Islands. Requisition was made in due course for their extradition, and the Governor of the Bahamas, in conformity to the local procedure, issued his requisition for the fugitives to the Chief Justice of the Colony. The court over which he presided refused to order the extradition of the fugitives and directed their discharge on the grounds that the indictment was not of itself sufficient evidence of the commission of the offense and that the offense charged, apparently committed by the slaves in effecting their escape, although criminal in Florida, did not appear to be so under British law.\n From the ensuing diplomatic correspondence it clearly appears that this government then asserted that the Treaty of 1842 obligated both parties to surrender fugitives duly charged with any of the offenses specified in \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 296]\n\u00a0\n article 10 without regard to the criminal quality of the fugitive's acts under the law of the place of asylum. This contention was supported by full and cogent argument in the course of which it was specifically pointed out that the proviso of article 10 relates to the procedure to be followed in asserting rights under the treaty and is not a limitation upon the definition of the offenses with respect to which extradition might be demanded. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 276, 297]\n\u00a0\n The political department of the government, before the negotiation of the Convention of 1889, had thus clearly \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 298]\n\u00a0\n and emphatically taken the position that the correct construction of article 10 is that for which respondent contends here, a construction which, as already indicated, is supported and confirmed by the provisions of the Convention of 1889. Our government does not appear to have receded from that position, and while the British government has never definitely yielded to it, except in so far as the arguments addressed to us in behalf of the respondent may be taken to have that effect, that fact or even the failure of Great Britain to comply with the obligations of the treaty would not be ground for refusal by this government to honor them or by this Court to apply them. Until a treaty has been denounced, it is the duty of both the government and the courts to sanction the performance of the obligations reciprocal to the rights which the treaty declares and the government asserts even though the other party to it holds to a different view of its meaning. Charlton v. Kelly, supra, pages 472, 473 of 229 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 945. The diplomatic history of the treaty provisions thus lends support to the construction which we think should be placed upon them when read without extraneous aid, but with that liberality demanded generally in the interpretation of international obligations.\n Other considerations peculiarly applicable to treaties for extradition, and to these treaties in particular, fortify this conclusion. The surrender of a fugitive, duly charged in the country from which he has fled with a nonpolitical offense and one generally recognized as criminal at the place of asylum, involves no impairment of any legitimate public or private interest. The obligation to do what some nations have done voluntarily, in the interest of justice and friendly international relationships, see 1 Moore, Extradition,  40, should be construed more liberally than a criminal statute or the technical requirements of criminal procedure. Grin v. Shine, \n187 \nU.S. 181, 184\n, 23 S.Ct. 98; Yordi v. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 299]\n\u00a0\n Nolte, \n215 \nU.S. 227, 230\n, 30 S.Ct. 90. All of the offenses named in the two treaties are not only denominated crimes by the treaties themselves, but they are recognized as such by the jurisprudence of both countries. \n6\n Even that with which petitioner is charged is a crime under the law of many states, if not in Illinois, punishable either as the crime of receiving money obtained fraudulently or by false pretenses, or as larceny. \n7\n See United States v. Mulligan (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 687. Compare Kelly v. Griffin, supra, page 15 of 241 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 487. It has been the policy of our own government, as of others, in entering into extradition treaties, to name as treaty offenses only those generally recognized as criminal by the \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 300]\n\u00a0\n laws in force within its own territory. \n8\n But that policy, when carried into effect by treaty designation of offenses with respect to which extradition is to be granted, affords no adequate basis for declining to construe the treaty in accordance with its language, or for saying that its obligation, in the absence of some express requirement, is conditioned on the criminality of the offense charged according to the laws of the particular place of asylum. Once the contracting parties are satisfied that an identified offense is generally recognized as criminal in both countries there is no occasion for stipulating that extradition shall fail merely because the fugitive may succeed in finding, in the country of refuge, some state, territory or district in which the offense charged is not punishable. No reason is suggested or apparent why the solemn and unconditional engagement to surrender a fugitive charged with the named offense of which petitioner is accused should admit of any inquiry as to the criminal quality of the act charged at the place of asylum beyond that necessary to make certain that the offense charged is one named in the treaty. See Collins v. Loisel, \n259 \nU.S. 309, 317\n, 42 S.Ct. 469; Grin v. Shine, supra, page 188 of 187 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 98.\n It is of some significance also that the construction which petitioner urges would restrict the reciprocal operation of the treaty. Under that construction the right to extradition from the United States may vary with the state or territory where the fugitive is found although extradition may be had from Great Britain with respect to all the offenses named in the treaty. While under the laws of Great Britain extradition treaties are not self-executing, and effect must be given to them by an act of Parliament designating the crimes, upon charge of which \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 301]\n\u00a0\n extradition from Great Britain and its dependencies may be had, all the offenses named in the two treaties have been so designated by Acts of Parliament of 1870, 33 and 34 Victoria, c. 52, as amended by Act of 1873, 36 and 37 Victoria, c. 60.\n The District Court for Southern New York decided, in 1847, that the proviso in the Extradition Treaty with France of November 9, 1843, like that in article 10, did not require that the treaty offense charged to have been committed in France should also be a crime in New York, the place of asylum. In re Metzger, supra. The precise question now before us seems not to have been decided in any other case and in no case in this Court has extradition been denied because the offense charged was not also criminal by the laws of the place of refuge. In Wright v. Henkel, supra, the offense charged, fraud by a director of a company, was, by paragraph 4 of article 1 of the Convention of 1889, a treaty offense only if made criminal by the laws of both countries. In Collins v. Loisel, supra, and in Kelly v. Griffin, supra, the question was whether the crime charged was a treaty offense. The court so held and the right to extradition was sustained. The offense charged was said to be a crime in both countries, and it seems to have been assumed without discussion, and not questioned, that its criminality at the place of asylum was necessary to extradition. See, also, Bingham v. Bradley, \n241 \nU.S. 511, 518\n, 36 S.Ct. 634. That assumption is shown here to have been unfounded.\n The petitioner also objects that the Dawes-Simon Extradition Treaty with Great Britain of 1932 (47 Stat. 2122), is now in force; that it does not name as a treaty offense the receiving of money, knowing it to have been fraudulently obtained, the crime with which petitioner is charged, and, that by abrogating the earlier extradition treaties between the two countries it has abated this \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 302]\n\u00a0\n proceeding and that for the extradition of the petitioner which was brought while the Treaty of 1842 and the Convention of 1889 were in force.\n The ratifications of the Dawes-Simon Treaty were announced by presidential proclamation of August 9, 1932, which declared that the treaty was made public to the end that 'every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with good faith' by the United States and its citizens. Article 18 provides that: 'The present treaty shall come into force in ten days after its publication in conformity with the forms prescribed by the high contracting parties.' Under the applicable provisions of the British Extradition Act of 1870, 33 and 34 Victoria, c. 52, as amended by the Act of 1873, 36 and 37 Victoria, c. 60, extradition treaties are carried into effect and given the force of law in Great Britain by publication of an Order-in-Council embodying the terms of the treaty, and directing that the Extradition Act shall apply with respect to the foreign state which has entered into the treaty. As appears from the record, and as is conceded, no Order-in-Council has been promulgated with respect to this treaty, and the State Department appears not to have recognized it as in force in either country. See Doe ex dem. Clark v. Braden, 16 How, 635, 656.\n We find it unnecessary to determine whether or not the treaty, as suggested on the argument, is now in force, and binding on the United States, although not binding on Great Britain until proclaimed by an Order- in-Council. For if we were to arrive at that conclusion, we could not say that its obligation would not extend to the offense with which petitioner is charged, or that its substitution for the earlier treaties would abate the proceeding for the extradition of petitioner or the pending habeas corpus proceeding.\n Paragraph 18 of article 3 of the Dawes-Simon Treaty includes among the offenses for which extradition may be \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 303]\n\u00a0\n demanded 'receiving any money, valuable security or other property, knowing the same to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained.' It is insisted that 'receiving money,' knowing the same to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained, is not the equivalent of receiving money, knowing the same to have been fraudulently obtained. It is not denied that the phrase 'unlawfully obtained,' standing alone, is as broad as the phrase 'fraudulently obtained.' But it is asserted that its use in association with the word 'stolen' restricts its meaning to offenses of the same type of unlawfulness as stealing, which it is said involves only those forms of criminal taking which are without the consent or against the will of the owner or the possessor. But we think the words of the treaty present no opportunity for so narrow and strict an application of the rule of ejusdem generis. The rule is at most one of construction, to be resorted to as an aid only when words or phrases are of doubtful meaning. Extradition treaties are to be liberally, not strictly, construed. The words 'steal' and 'stolen' have no certain technical significance making them applicable only with respect to common law larceny. They are not uncommonly used as implying also a taking or receiving of property by embezzlement or false pretenses, offenses which are often embraced in modern forms of statutory larceny. \n9\n Whatever was left vague or uncertain by the use of the word 'stolen' was made certain by the added phrase 'or unlawfully obtained,' as indicating any form of criminal taking whether or not embraced within the term larceny in its various connotations. Even if the word 'stolen' were to be given the restricted meaning for which the petitioner contends, it would be so precise and comprehensive as to exhaust the genus and leave nothing essentially similar on which the general phrase 'or unlawfully obtained could operate. This phrase, like all the other \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 304]\n\u00a0\n words of the treaty, is to be given a meaning, if reasonably possible, and rules of construction may not be resorted to to render it meaningless or inoperative. See Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 553\n, 43 S.Ct. 200.\n As the crime with which petitioner is charged is an extraditable offense under the Dawes-Simon Treaty, the effective promulgation of that treaty and the consequent abrogation of earlier ones would not abate the pending proceedings. The obligation of the later treaty, by its terms, extends generally to fugitives charged with the several offenses named, without regard to the date of their commission. See In re De Giacomo, 12 Blatch. 391, Fed. Cas. No. 3,747; 1 Moore on Extradition,  86. It does not purport to exclude from its operation crimes committed before signature or promulgation, as did article 8 of the Treaty of 1889 (26 Stat. 1510). Hence, it did not by mere force of the abrogation of the earlier treaty relinquish the obligation under it to surrender the petitioner, but continued it by making the offense with which he was charged extraditable even though it antedated the treaty.\n The extradition proceeding has not come to an end. The petitioner's commitment by order of the commissioner was 'to abide the order of the Secretary of State,' and continues in force so long as the Secretary may lawfully order his extradition. Hence, the new treaty, if in force, is authority for the Secretary to issue his extradition warrant under section 653, title 18 USCA. The detention of the petitioner being lawful under treaty provisions continuously in force since his arrest, the proceeding in habeas corpus is not moot and does not abate merely because the obligation to surrender the petitioner for trial upon the offense charged, and for which he is held, originating in one treaty, was continued without change of substance in the other. See Abie State Bank v. Bryan, \n282 \nU.S. 765, 781\n, 51 S.Ct. 252.\n Affirmed. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n I. The decision just announced holds that the United States is bound by treaty to surrender its citizens and others to England there to be prosecuted criminally and punished for that which if committed here would transgress no law-federal or state. And it is so held despite the established rule that England is not by the treaty bound to grant any extradition upon the demand of this country unless the crime charged against the fugitive is also a crime under English law.

Heretofore, this court has steadfastly held that a fugitive, whether alien or a citizen, will not be extradited unless the facts alleged against him in the demanding country are there made criminal, constitute a crime covered by the treaty and are denounced as crime either by some act of Congress or by the laws of the state where the fugitive is found.

Pomeroy, International Law (Ed. by Woodlsey)  198, 199; Biron and Chalmers, Extradition, p. 11; 1 Phillimore, International Law (3d Ed.)  367, p. 521; Moore, Extradition ,  94, 96.\n II. Petitioner, found in Illinois, is accused in England of having received money knowing it to have been fraudulently obtained by the Broad Street Press, Limited. Item 3 of article 1 of the Convention of 1889 (26 Stat. 1508) contains the pertinent words-'receiving any money ... knowing the same to have been ... fraudulently obtained.' Such receiving has not been made criminal by any act of Congress or any law of Illinois. On that ground, petitioner sought discharge on habeas corpus. Kelly v. Griffin, supra, held that acts such as those alleged against petitioner constitute crime in Illinois. England did not contend that local criminality is not essential but relied upon the ruling in that case. District Judge Fitzhenry, deeming himself bound, remanded petitioner.\n At the hearing before the commissioner, petitioner called as witnesses a number of eminent Illinois lawyers. Their testimony shows beyond doubt that receiving money or property knowing the same to have been fraudulently obtained has not been denounced as crime by the laws of Illinois. England relied solely upon Kelly v. Griffin and insisted that the commissioner was bound by that decision. The latter accepted that view. Petitioner sought review and release on habeas corpus. District Judge Carpenter heard the application, found such receiving not a crime in Illionis and ordered petitioner's discharge. On appeal England still insisted that Kelly v. Griffin required a contrary ruling. The Circuit Court of \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 307]\n\u00a0\n Appeals so held. One of the three judges dissented. It was in that court that England first suggested that criminality in Illinois is not essential. 2 The court held against that contention, citing Collins v. Loisel, supra; Kelly v. Griffin, supra, and Wright v. Henkel, supra.\n On the first argument here England adhered to its contention that Kelly v. Griffin ruled the case and also argued that criminality at the place of asylum is not essential. Unable to hold that the acts charged against petitioner constitute crime in Illinois, this court ordered reargument upon all questions and directed attention to a point not theretofore suggested: 'The interpretation placed upon article 10 of the Treaty of 1842 by the Secretary of State of the United States, John C. Calhoun, shortly after the ratification of the Treaty (August 7, 1844, January 28, 1845, MSS. Inst. Gr. Br.), and also to the available diplomatic correspondence relating to article 10 of the Treaty of 1842 and the Treaty of 1889.'\n On reargument petitioner brought forward all diplomatic correspondence available to him. It related, not only to the Treaties of 1842 and 1889, but also to subsequent treaties prior to the Dawes-Simon Treaty 1932. The latter, designed to cover the entire field and to supersede the treaties under consideration, was adopted after extended negotiation. It has been ratified by the Senate and published here. But, while it was duly ratified in England on July 29, 1932, the Order-in- council necessary there to make it effective has not yet been promulgated. Our Secretary of State holds that the treaty is not in force. It results, therefore, that the diplomatic correspondence leading up to its consummation was not available to petitioner. England fails to produce any part of it. She \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 308]\n\u00a0\n appears to attribute to Secretary Calhoun's contentions cited in our order little, if any, greater weight than when they were put aside by Her Majesty's Government nearly a century ago. It is to be presumed that, if correspondence leading up to the Dawes-Simon Treaty would support the idea that local criminality is not essential, England would produce it here.\n On reargument England gave little, if any, support to its claim that the 'receiving' alleged against petitioner is crime in Illinois. And this court, impliedly at least, now holds that it is not, and to that extent overrules Kelly v. Griffin. England's brief on reargument frankly concedes that it has been the policy of both parties to limit extradition to acts made criminal in the place of asylum. It safely may be said that she does not now seek the adoption of a contrary construction. But taking a new hold she insists that the requirement of criminality in both countries is here satisfied. In support of that position she says that petitioner cannot be convicted without proof of guilty knowledge; that the record shows he was a party to the fraud by which the money was obtained, and that, as obtaining by false pretenses and participation in that offense are both criminal in Illinois and extraditable, it must be held that extradition of the petitioner would be within the rule. The court does not take that point and therefore it need not be considered here. It is mentioned for the purpose of disclosing the principal, if not indeed the sole, ground upon which extradition is now claimed.\n III. But the court's decision rests upon the ground that the United States impliedly agreed to extradite for acts not made criminal by its laws or the laws of the state of asylum. Admittedly England did not so agree. There is no warrant for the discrimination. The parties dealt as equals. All their extradition treaties disclose the intention that they shall stand on the same footing. The \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 309]\n\u00a0\n governing principle always has been reciprocity and equality.\n The extradition provisions of the Jay Treaty of 1794, art. 27, 8 Stat. 116, 120, which continued in force 12 years, were: 'It is further agreed, that his Majesty and the United States, on mutual requisitions ... will deliver up to justice all persons, who, being charged with murder or forgery, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum within any of the countries of the other, provided that this shall only be done on such evidence of criminality, as, according to the laws of the place, where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the offence had there been committed. ...' (Italics supplied.)\n The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 (8 Stat. 572) in its preamble declares: 'And whereas it is found expedient, for the better administration of justice and the prevention of crime within the territories and jurisdiction of the two parties, respectively, that persons committing the crimes hereinafter enumerated, and being fugitives from justice, should, under certain circumstances, be reciprocally delivered up.' (Italics supplied.) It repeats the clause, originating in the Jay Treaty, providing for mutual requisitions. It includes five additional crimes making seven in all. They are (article 10, p. 576): Murder, assault with intent to commit murder, piracy, arson, robbery, forgery, and the utterance of forged paper. It also repeats the proviso contained in the Jay Treaty.\n The declaration of purpose that fugitives be 'reciprocally delivered up' and the provision for 'mutual requisitions' mean that neither shall have advantage over the other or be entitled to demand any extradition which under corresponding circumstances it would not be bound \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 310]\n\u00a0\n to grant, and directly negative the notion that the United States alone is bound to extradite for acts not criminal where the fugitive is found.\n The Blaine-Pauncefote Convention of 1889 (26 Stat. 1508) added to the list in the Webster-Ashburton Treaty ten numbered offenses. They are:\n'1. Manslaughter, when voluntary.\n\n'2. Counterfeiting or altering money; uttering or bringing into circulation counterfeit or altered money.\n\n'3. Embezzlement; larceny; receiving any money, valuable security, or other property, knowing the same to have been embezzled, stolen, or fraudulently obtained.\n\n'4. Fraud by bailee, banker, agent, factor, trustee, or director or member or officer of any company, made criminal by the laws of both countries.\n\n'5. Perjury, or subornation of perjury.\n\n'6. Rape; abduction; child-stealing; kidnapping.\n\n'7. Burglary; house-breaking or shopbreaking.\n\n'8. Piracy by the law of nations.\n\n'9. Revolt, or conspiracy to revolt by two or more persons on board a ship on the high seas, against the authority of the master; wrongfully sinking or destroying a vessel at sea, or attempting to do so; assaults on board a ship on the high seas, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\n\n'10. Crimes and offences against the laws of both countries for the suppression of slavery and slave-trading.\n\n'Extradition is also to take place for participation in any of the crimes mentioned in this Convention or in the aforesaid Tenth Article, provided such participation be punishable by the laws of both countries.'\n\n The Supplementary Treaty of 1900 (32 Stat. 1864) added:\n'11. Obtaining money, valuable securities or other property by false pretenses.\n\n'12. Wilful and unlawful destruction or obstruction of railroads which endangers human life.\n\n'13. Procuring abortion.' \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 311]\n\u00a0\n The Supplementary Treaty of 1905 (34 Stat. 2903) added:\n\n'14. Bribery, defined to be the offering, giving or receiving of bribes made criminal by the laws of both countries.\n\n'15. Offences, if made criminal by the laws of both countries, against bankruptcy law.'\n\n IV. The majority opinion notes the absence of any express requirement of criminality in both countries in item 3, which includes the acts alleged against petitioner; it emphasizes 'made criminal by the laws of both countries' qualifying 'fraud' in item 4 and from that it infers that, as to acts not similarly qualified, criminality in the asylum state here is not essential. That indeed is the ground upon which the court's opinion rests.\n But the indefinite terms by which the qualified offenses are designated fully account for the use of the words of limitation. An examination of the list discloses that where there is an express requirement of the criminality in both countries the purpose is to make certain that the acts are criminal or to safeguard against demands for extradition for acts nor criminal in the asylum country. Neither the Jay Treaty nor the Webster-Ashburton Treaty contains any provision expressly limiting extradition to acts made criminal in both countries. No such specification was necessary as the transgressions listed are grave and well known to have been denounced as crimes by the laws of both countries. Qualifying clauses are often used in treaties, statutes, and agreements where the meaning would be the same if they were omitted. Article 2 of the Convention of 1889 furnishes an example. It declares that no fugitive shall be surrendered for any offense of a political character. As no crime of that sort it listed, the provision is unnecessary. That clause, like the expression requiring criminality in both countries, is used, not to add or change meaning, but to \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 312]\n\u00a0\n emphasize and insure adherence to a well known general principle always held applicable in the absence of any such specification. And article 3 declares that a person surrendered cannot be tried in the demanding country for any crime committed prior to extradition other than that for which he was extradited. These clauses add nothing to the protection to which the fugitive has been held entitled in the absence of such stipulations. United States v. Rauscher, \n119 U.S. 407\n, 419-422, 7 S.Ct. 234.\n The history of item 4 negatives any inference such as that drawn by the majority. It was taken from, and omitting 'public' is precisely the same as, a clause in the British Extradition Act. \n3\n As 'public officer of any company' is unknown to our law, the word 'public' was dropped. In the British statute 'fraud' is qualified by 'made criminal by any act for the time being in force.' A corresponding definition of 'fraud' in the treaty was needed for clarification, and so the clause 'made criminal by the laws of both countries' was added. The doubts that reasonably might arise as to the meaning of the words used more than justified this qualification. Fraud may or may not constitute crime. When the word is used without qualification it does not mean a criminal offense. The item extends to numerous classes of persons, even to members of a corporation. The word 'company' is broad enough to include unincorporated associations as well as corporations of all sorts. The laws regulating bankers and others included are well known to lack uniformity and to be subject to frequent changes. Absence of some definitive expression would have left it uncertain whether the 'fraud' listed was a civil or criminal wrong. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 313]\n\u00a0\n The court does not invoke support from the other items in which qualifying expressions are used. And these items show that the implication drawn by the opinion from the qualifying words in item 4 is groundless and that there is no basis for the application of the canon of construction, expressio unius, etc. Springer v. Philippine Islands, \n277 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 48 S.Ct. 480. Let them be examined.\n Item 10 covers 'crimes and offences against the laws of both countries for the suppression of slavery and slave-trading.' If the phrase 'against the laws of both countries' were omitted, the provision would have no meaning.\n The unnumbered item in the Convention of 1889 covers 'participation' in the commission of the crimes listed in that Convention and in the Treaty of 1842. The limitation to such as is made punishable by the laws of both countries was added to bring 'participation' within the general principle. The parties did not intend that one accused of such receiving in England would be extraditable from a state where the act violates no law while the person guilty of participation by aiding, inducing, procuring or commanding him to commit the crime would be entitled there safely to remain.\n The 'bribery' covered by item 14 is limited to such as is defined by the laws of both countries. The correspondence leading to agreement upon that item shows that both parties intended as always to adhere to the principle of limiting extradition to acts made criminal by the laws of both countries. Ambassador Choate for the United States proposed a clause not expressly requiring criminality in both countries. The Marquess of Landsdowne for His Brittanic Majesty proposed the form adopted. Choate accepted and in a carefully prepared letter made it perfectly plain that, upon the principle declared in Wright v. Henkel, supra, the rule requiring criminality in both countries would apply even if not stated in the item. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 314]\n\u00a0\n Offenses against bankruptcy law, if made criminal by the laws of both countries, are covered by item 15. Lack of uniformity in different parts of the Empire and, when no federal act is in force, among the several states in this country, made the qualification of criminality in both countries necessary in the interest of certainty and to maintain the general rule that the asylum country denies extradition for acts not there deemed criminal. Moreover, the qualifying clause is necessary to limit the provision to criminal acts for without it 'offences ... against bankruptcy law' would not necessarily imply criminality, but might include, for example, such transgressions as merely require denial of discharge.\n It is said that, as some states denounce as criminal the receiving of money or property knowing the same to have been fraudulently obtained while others do not, extradition is made to depend upon the place where the fugitive happens to be found. That suggestion gives no support to the decision. The negotiators well knew that criminal laws are not the same throughout the territories involved. England acted for all parts of the British Empire, the United States acted for itself and all the states. Undoubtedly, the criminal laws in England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia, Canada and other territories beyond the seas differ as widely as do those in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and other states. These treaties were made having regard to such lack of uniformity.\n While the proviso in article 10 relates to the quantum of evidence required to support the demand for extradition rather than to the obligations assumed or rights granted, it significantly coincides with the principle that extradition will not be granted by the asylum country for acts not there deemed criminally wrong. Indeed, when taken in connection with the declaration of mutuality and reciprocity and the crimes named in the list, the proviso supports that principle. For obviously, as in substance \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 315]\n\u00a0\n suggested by England and held by the majority, the proviso means that extradition shall only be granted upon such evidence as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive is found 'would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if (the acts constituting) the crime or offence had there been committed.'\n V. The court's decision is in direct conflict with the principle governing the interpretation of extradition treaties as propounded by the United States and as declared by this court in Wright v. Henkel, supra. The solicitor general said (\n190 U.S. 55\n, 56 (23 S.Ct. 781)): 'That the offence must be one made criminal by the laws of both countries is a principle inherent in all extradition treaties. This is obvious because of the reciprocal nature of such engagements and the existence and similarity of crime in all places, whatever the differences as to definition and incidents of any particular crime. ... Treaties plainly imply the doctrine, but do not ordinarily express it. Such is the force of the phrase 'mutual requisitions. Art. X, Webster-Ashburton Treaty.' And, applying the rule to the case then in hand, the brief added: 'No phrase was needed in the treaty of 1889 to explain the crimes of murder, burglary, etc., nor to express the necessity of criminality in both countries. They are criminal in both countries without that. The difference as to clause 4 ... respecting fraud by bailee is that as to that class of offences, not yet completely established as criminal, the two powers decline to engage respecting species still carrying a mere civil liability, and therefore the phrase 'made criminal by the laws of both countries' was used.'\n And this court, speaking through its Chief Justice, said (pages 57, 58 of 190 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 781, 785): 'Treaties must receive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of the contracting parties, and so as to carry out their manifest purpose. ... The general principle of international law is that in all cases of extradition the act done on account of which extradition \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 316]\n\u00a0\n is demanded must be considered a crime by both parties, and, as to the offense charged in this case (fraud covered by item 4), the treaty of 1889 embodies that principle in terms. The offense must be 'made criminal by the laws of both countries.' ... (Page 60 of 190 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 781, 786 .) Where there was reason to doubt whether the generic term embraced a particular variety, specific language was used. As, for instance, ... as to fraud and breach of trust, which had been brought within the grasp of criminal law in comparatively recent times.'\n The principle governing interpretation of extradition treaties so definitely explained by the Chief Justice in Wright v. Henkel, supra, has been uniformly followed here.\n In Kelly v. Griffin, supra, perjury was one of the offenses for which Canada sought extradition of the fugitive from Illinois. That offense is covered by item 5 which contains no express requirement of criminality in both countries. In that respect it is identical with item 3 which covers the receiving here involved. In that country false testimony, whether material or not, constitutes perjury. But materiality is essential in Illinois. This court found that the false testimony alleged to have been given in Canada was in fact material to the matter there in hand, quoted ( page 14 of 241 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 487, 489) from Wright v. Henkel, supra: 'It is enough if the particular variety was criminal in both jurisdictions,' and held for extradition.\n In Bingham v. Bradley, supra, the offense was receiving money knowing the same to have been stolen. That is covered by item 3, the construction of which is here involved. The court assumed as definitely established by prior decisions that criminality in both countries was essential. And, in concluding its decision holding the fugitive extraditable, it said (page 517 of 241 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 634, 637): 'And since the jurisdiction of the Commissioner is clear, and the evidence abundantly sufficient to furnish reasonable ground \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 317]\n\u00a0\n for the belief that appellant has committed within the Dominion of Canada a crime that is an offense under the laws of the Dominion, as well as under those of Illinois ... and is covered by the terms of the treaty, and that he is a fugitive from justice, a fair observance of the obligations of the treaty requires that he be surrendered.'\n In Collins v. Loisel, supra, the offense was obtaining property by false pretenses, covered by item 11, which contains no words requiring criminality in both countries. The court, directly alluding to the established rule, said (page 311 of 259 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 469, 470): 'It is true that an offense is extraditable only if the acts charged are criminal by the laws of both countries.' And further (page 312 of 259 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 469, 470): 'The law does not require that the name by which the crime is described in the two countries shall be the same; nor that the scope of the liability shall be coextensive, or, in other respects, the same in the two countries. It is enough if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions. This was held with reference to different crimes involving false statements in Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 58\n, 23 S.Ct. 781; Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 14\n, 36 S.Ct. 487; Benson v. McMahon, \n127 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 8 S.Ct. 1240; and Greene v. United States, 85 C.C.A. 251, 154 F. 401. Compare Ex parte Piot, 15 Cox, C.C. 208. The offense charged was, therefore, clearly extraditable.'\n VI. Some of the reasons supporting the requirement of criminality in both countries as sound and expedient are stated in the report of a royal commission created in 1877 by Queen Victoria to inquire into and consider the workings and effect of the laws and treaties relating to extradition. \n4\n It says (section IV):\n'The crimes in respect of which \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 318]\n\u00a0\n nations should make common cause against criminals, and refuse them shelter, are those which it is the common interest of all to repress. There are offences against society in respect of person and property, which, in all countries, there will always be found persons disposed to commit, and which can only be kept under by the strong arm of the law. It is these offences which it should be the common purpose of all nations to endeavour to suppress by preventing those who have committed them from escaping from justice. But these offences are known to and dealt with by the law of all civilised nations, though they may be differently dealt with both as to procedure and punishment. If some offence, unknown to the law of other nations-to what may figuratively be called the common law of nations-should be created by the law of a particular people, such an offence would not come within the category of crimes which it is the purpose of extradition to repress.\n\n'If it be asked how it is to be ascertained that the offence charged is known and recognised as an offence, the answer is that our own law will afford a sufficient test, being abundantly comprehensive as to offences against person and property.\n\n'Besides which, there is another reason for seeing that the charge in respect of which extradition is asked for is an offence under our own law. It is and always must be necessary that a prima facie case shall be made out before a magistrate in order to support the application for extradition. But the English magistrate cannot be expected to know or interpret the foreign law. It is not desirable that he should be required to do more than to see that the facts proved constitute prima facie an offence which would have been within judicial cognizance it done in this country.' (Italics added.)\n\n The principle that a nation will not grant extradition for acts not there made criminal is laid down by authoritative writers on the law of extradition. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 319]\n\u00a0\n Biron and Chalmers, in their work on Extradition, p. 11, say: 'As against the State where the fugitive is found his claim for protection is imperative, unless it can be proved that had his act taken place therein it would have involved the transgression of the laws of that State.' Sir Robert Phillimore, 1 International Law (3d Ed.)  367, p. 521, says: 'There are two circumstances to be observed ... in ... cases of Extradition:-1. That the country demanding the criminal must be the country in which the crime is committed. 2. That the act done, on account of which his Extradition is demanded, must be considered as a crime by both States.' Pomeroy, International Law (Ed. by Woolsey)  198, p. 237, says: 'The act done must be such as is regarded as a crime by both states; this would cut off the case of all mere political offenders.' Moore, Extradition,  96, p. 112, says: 'While it is an accepted principle that the acts for which extradition is demanded must constitute an offence according to the laws of both countries, yet the laws which have actually been violated are those of the demanding government.'\n VII. The opinion of the majority leans but lightly upon the construction put upon the treaty by the letters of Secretary Calhoun brought into view by the order for reargument.\n When the historical background and the precise point under consideration are held in mind, it is plain that his contentions have no bearing upon the question before us. For years prior to 1842 the right of owners to have fugitive slaves returned to them had become a matter of grave concern in Southern States. Mr. Calhoun was a leader in the struggle for the vindication of that right and the maintance of slavery. England, having earlier moved to suppress slave-trading, had then quite recently abolished slavery. Many of her people strongly favored abolition in the United States and everywhere. Many slaves had fled from this country to the West Indies and to Canada. Shortly before the case in which Secretary Cal- \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 320]\n\u00a0\n houn wrote the letters in question, it was earnestly maintained by leaders in the House of Lords that slaves who for the purpose of securing their freedom killed their masters were guilty of no offense. \n5\n Some of England's most eminent statesmen and jurists opposed extradition of fugitive slaves for any transgression of our laws. For example, Aberdeen said: 'Not only was a fugitive slave guilty of no crime in endeavoring to escape from a state of bondage, but he was entitled to the sympathy and encouragement of all those who were animated by Christian feelings.' 70 Hansard (3d Series) p. 474.\n The secretary's letters were written, not as rulings, but solely for the purpose of furnishing the American minister arguments to be submitted to Lord Aberdeen as Foreign Secretary. The case was this: Slaves in Florida killed those who held them in service and fled to British West Indies. That state indicted them for murder. The United States, upon the indictment without more, demanded their extradition. The insular court held no ground for extradition had been shown. It said: 'An indictment per se can never be received as evidence. It is not enough for us to know that the American jury thought the parties guilty. We ought to know the grounds upon which they thought them guilty. What may constitute the crime of murder in Florida may be very far from doing so according to the British laws or even in the laws of the northern States of America.'\n The secretary, deeply moved by the implied suggestion that homicide committed by a slave in an effort to secure release from bondage was justifiable or excusable, directed the American minister to present the case to the British \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 321]\n\u00a0\n government. He maintained that, as in this country the Florida indictment was sufficient to justify the apprehension of the person accused and his commitment for trial, then by virtue of the proviso in article 10 the asylum country was bound to hold that the indictment without more was sufficient to require extradition of the fugitive. As shown by our minister's report, Lord Aberdeen merely held that under the Act of Parliament carrying the treaty into effect 'an indictment is not of itself sufficient ground for giving up a fugitive.' And he remarked that the same answer would have been given had the persons demanded been free. The question presented and decided was merely one of evidence. The secretary's suggestions as to requirements of criminality in the asylum country were not germane and therefore without weight as an official interpretation.\n His suggestion, arguendo, that the treaty requires extradition for acts not made criminal in the place of asylum has never been adopted in England. That country has never claimed and does not now maintain that the interpretation so brought forward is binding on the United States. It has never been followed in practice. It is directly repugnant to the contentions of the United States and the opinion of this court in Wright v. Henkel, supra, and conflicts with a long line of judgments following that decision. It is disregarded, indeed impliedly repudiated, in the official correspondence between Ambassador Choate and the Marquess of Lansdowne above mentioned. It follows that Secretary Calhoun's contentions, even if they were pertinent in the case where made, do not make in favor of extradition or lend any support to the court's decision.\n I am of opinion:\n The acts of receiving of which petitioner is accused in England are not made criminal in Illinois where he was found. That is now practically conceded by England. \n\n[290 U.S. 276, 322]\n\u00a0\n The court impliedly so holds and necessarily-even if sub silentio- overrules its decision on that point in Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 15\n, 36 S.Ct. 487.\n The contracting parties, upon adequate grounds and in accordance with uniform usage, have always adhered to the principle that extradition will not be granted for acts that are not deemed criminal in the place of asylum.\n There is nothing in the treaties to support the majority opinion that, while England is not similarly bound, the United States agreed to deliver up fugitives for acts not criminal in the place of asylum.\n The proviso in article 10 prescribes the evidence that the demanding country is required to produce. It impliedly indicates that neither party agreed to extradite for acts not criminal under its laws.\n The letters of Secretary Calhoun pointed to by our order for reargument do not support the majority opinion. They have no bearing upon the question presented.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The applicable provisions of the Treaty of 1842 are as follows:\n'... And whereas it is found expedient, for the better administration of justice and the prevention of crime within the territories and jurisdiction of the two parties, respectively, that persons committing the crimes hereinafter enumerated, and being fugitives from justice, should, under certain circumstances, be reciprocally delivered up. ...' (continued on p. 287) \n\n'ARTICLE X. It is agreed that the United States and Her Britannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them, or their ministers, officers, or authorities, respectively made, deliver up to justice all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum, or shall be found within the territories of the other: provided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had there been committed: and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two Governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, that he may be brought before such judges or other magistrates, respectively, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify the same to the proper executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of such fugitive. The expense of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by the party who makes the requisition, and receives the fugitive.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The applicable provisions of the Convention of 1889 are as follows:\n'Whereas by the Tenth Article of the Treaty concluded between the United States of America and Her Britannic Majesty on the ninth day of August, 1842, provision is made for the extradition of persons charged with certain crimes;\n\n'And Whereas it is now desired by the High Contracting Parties that the provisions of the said Article should embrace certain crimes not therein specified, and should extend to fugitives convicted of the crimes specified in the said Article and in this Convention;\n\n'The said High Contracting Parties have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries to conclude a Convention for this purpose; ...\n\n'Who, after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles: \n\n'ARTICLE I.\n\n'The provisions of the said Tenth Article are hereby made applicable to the following additional crimes:\n\n'1. Manslaughter, when voluntary.\n\n'2. Counterfeiting or altering money; uttering or bringing into circulation counterfeit or altered money.\n\n'3. Embezzlement; larceny; receiving any money, valuable security, or other property, knowing the same to have been embezzled, stolen, or fraudulently obtained.\n\n'4. Fraud by bailee, banker, agent, factor, trustee, or director or member or officer of any company, made criminal by the laws of both countries.\n\n'5. Perjury, or subornation of perjury.\n\n'6. Rape; abduction; child-stealing; kidnapping.\n\n'7. Burglary; house-breaking or shop-breaking.\n\n'8. Piracy by the law of nations.\n\n'9. Revolt, or conspiracy to revolt by two or more persons on board a ship on the high seas, against the authority of the master; wrongfully sinking or destroying a vessel at sea, or attempting to do so; assaults on board a ship on the high seas, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\n\n'10. Crimes and offences against the laws of both countries for the suppression of slavery and slave-trading.\n\n'Extradition is also to take place for participation in any of the crimes mentioned in this Convention or in the aforesaid Tenth Article, provided such participation be punishable by the laws of both countries.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Act of Congress, August 12, 1848, c. 167,  1, 9 Stat. 302, prescribed the procedure before a commissioner or federal judicial officer to secure the apprehension and detention of fugitives whose extradition is demanded under any treaty or convention with any foreign government. This enactment was the source of section 5270, R.S., now section 651, title 18 USCA, which provides: 'If, on such hearing, he deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, that a warrant may issue upon the requisition. ...' It does not require that the act charged as a treaty offense be found to be one made criminal by the laws of the place of asylum. By Act of August 3, 1882, c. 378,  5, 22 Stat. 216, section 655, title 18 USCA, provision was made for receiving in evidence in such proceeding, depositions, warrants and other papers, such as may be received for similar purposes by the tribunals of the foreign country from which the fugitive shall have escaped. This legislation has not been thought to dispense with the necessity of the proviso contained in the Treaty of 1842, which has generally been included in later treaties, see footnote 4, infra, but it has been deemed to have relaxed the procedure exacted by the proviso in favor of the demanding country. Elias v. Ramirez, \n215 \nU.S. 398, 409\n, 30 S.Ct. 131; Bingham v. Bradley, \n241 \nU.S. 511, 517\n, 36 S.Ct. 634; In re Dubroca y Paniagua (D.C.) 33 F.(2d) 181; compare Collins v. Loisel, \n259 \nU.S. 309, 315\n, 316 S., 42 S.Ct. 469. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Supplementary Extradition Treaty with Great Britain of December 13, 1900, Malloy's Treaties, p. 780, 32 Stat. 1864, added three classes to the list of crimes for which extradition could be demanded under the earlier treaties, but omitted any requirement that they be criminal by the laws of both countries. By the Supplementary Extradition Treaty with Great Britain of April 12, 1905, Malloy's Treaties, p. 798, 34 Stat. 2903, two other crimes were added to the schedule of extraditable offenses, as follows:\n'14. Bribery, defined to be the offering, giving or receiving of bribes made criminal by the laws of both countries.\n\n'15. Offences, if made criminal by the laws of both countries, against bankruptcy law.'\n\n By the Dawes-Simon Treaty of 1932 (47 Stat. 2122), not yet promulgated by Great Britain, the proviso, modified and stated in a separate article, reads as follows:\n'The extradition shall take place only if the evidence be found sufficient, according to the laws of the High Contracting Party, applied to, either to justify the committal of the prisoner for trial, in case the crime or offence had been committed in the territory of such High Contracting Party, or to prove that the prisoner is the identical person convicted by the courts of the High Contracting Party who makes the requisition, and that the crime or offence of which he has been convicted is one in respect of which extradition could, at the time of such conviction, have been granted by the High Contracting Party applied to.'\n\n This treaty enumerates twenty-seven classes of extraditable offenses and one unnumbered class, but extradition is conditional upon the offense charged being criminal in the country of asylum in the case of two classes only, as follows: \n'6. Indecent assault if such crime or offence be indictable in the place where the accused or convicted person is apprehended. ...\n\n'Extradition is also to be granted for participation in any of the aforesaid crimes or offences, provided that such participation be punishable by the laws of both High Contracting Parties.'\n\n The extradition treaty with Germany of July 12, 1930, contains a stipulation that fugitives shall be delivered up with respect to all the offenses enuerated in the treaty 'only if they are punishable as crimes or offenses by the law of both countries applicable to the case.' In each of the following treaties the proviso of article 10 of the Treaty with Great Britain of 1842 appears, as does also the distinction made in article 1 of the Convention of 1889 between offenses with respect to which it is specifically provided that they shall be extraditable only if they are defined as criminal by the laws of both countries, and other offenses with respect to which no such requirement is made: Austria, January 31, 1930; Bolivia, April 21, 1900; Brazil, May 14, 1897; Bulgaria, March 19, 1924; Chile, April 17, 1900; Costa Rica, November 10, 1922; Cuba, April 6, 1904, January 14, 1926; Czechoslovakia, July 2, 1925; Denmark, January 6, 1902; Esthonia, November 8, 1923; Finland, August 1, 1924; Greece, May 6, 1931; Latvia, October 16, 1923; Lithuania, April 9, 1924; Netherlands, May 22, 1880, June 2, 1887; Norway, June 7, 1893, December 10, 1904; Panama, May 25, 1904; Poland, November 23, 1927; Portugal, May 7, 1908; Rumania, July 23, 1924; Servia, October 25, 1901; Siam, December 30, 1922; Spain, August 7, 1882, June 15, 1904; Sweden and Norway, March 21, 1860. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In a letter of instructions by Mr. Calhoun, then Secretary of State, to Edward Everett, Minister to Great Britain, of August 7, 1844, the latter was directed to bring the subject to the attention of the British Government, to press upon it this construction of article 10 and to ascertain what construction that government intended to adopt. Department of State: 15 Instructions, Great Britain, 205, No. 99. After quoting the provisions of the article the Secretary of State said: 'It comprehends all persons, charged with the crimes of murder, robbery, etc., etc., committed within the jurisdiction of the party making the requisition, and found in the territory of that on whom the requisition is made. That these words are broad enough to comprehend the case under consideration is beyond doubt; and of course the only possible question which can be made is, whether it is not taken out by the privison which immediately follows. ... '\n And after quoting the proviso he continued:\n'It is too plain to require proof, that it relates to the evidence on which the fugitive is to be given up to justice exclusively without intending to restrict or change the body of the agreement. That having clearly specified, who were to be delivered up to justice, on the requisition of either party, it became necessary, in order to give effect to the agreement, to specify on what evidence it should be done; and to do that accordingly is the sole object of the proviso. It specifies that it should be done on such evidence of criminality as would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial by the laws of the place where the fugitive is found, had the crime charged been there committed; that is, if the crime charged be murder or robbery, as in this case, on such evidence as would justify apprehension and commitment for trial for murder or robbery at the place.\n\n'Taking the body of the agreement and proviso together, it would seem to be unquestionable, that the true intent of the article is, that the criminality of the act charged should be judged of by the laws of the country within whose jurisdiction the act was perpetrated; but that the evidence on which the fugitive should be delivered up to justice, should be by the laws of the place where he shall be found. Both are to be judged by the laws of the place where they occur; and properly so; as they are paramount within their respective limits. And hence it is expressly specified in the body of the agreement, that the crime charged must have been committed within the jurisdiction of the party making the requisition; and, in the proviso, that the evidence, on which the fugitive shall be delivered up, shall be such as is required to apprehend and commit for trial according to the laws of the place where he is found.' \n\n Mr. Everett's report to the Secretary of November 23, 1844 ( Department of State: 53 Despatches, Great Britain, No. 216), of his conversations with Lord Aberdeen, British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, on this subject, being deemed unsatisfactory by the Secretary, he directed that the conversations be renewed in a letter of instructions of January 28, 1845 (Department of State: 15 Instructions, Great Britain, No. 120). After pointing out that the question was equally important with respect to all the crimes enumerated in Article X, he said:\n'It is obvious from the preceding remarks that the question whether the criminality of the Act is to be judged by the laws of the country where the offence was committed or that where the fugitive may be found is one of wide extent, and of the first magnitude in the construction of the treaty. We contend that it must be, by the laws of the place where the crime was charged to have been committed, and not that where the fugitive was found; and hold that such construction is in strict conformity with the wording and true intent of the treaty; ...\n\n'You are accordingly instructed to call again the attention of Her Majesty's government to the subject, and to urge a speedy decision in strong and ernest language.'\n\n The matter appears to have been fully presented to the British government by Mr. Everett. Department of State: Mr. Everett to the Secretary of State, January 31, 1845, 54 Despatches, Great Britain, No. 250; No. 271, March 3, 1845. But as the British Government took the position that the indictment of itself was not sufficient evidence of the commission of the offense in Florida, further inquiry as to the government's construction of article 10 seems not to have been pressed or answered. See also the case of John Anderson, a fugitive slave whose extradition was sought from Canada, discussed in 1 Moore, Extradition,  440. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] President Tyler, in his message transmitting the Treaty of 1842 to the Senate for consideration, referred to article 10 as 'carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agreed to regard as heinous and as destructive to the security of life and property. In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes, the object has been to exclude all political offenses, or criminal charges, arising from wars or intestine commotions.'

But the supreme court of New York, without passing upon that point, discharged Metzger. 1 Barb. 248. It does not appear that he was ever retaken or surrendered for prosecution in France.

CUB FORK COAL CO.(1933)\nNo. 314\nArgued: November 8, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul Y. Davis and Henry H. Hornbrook, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioner.\n Mr. Connor Hall, of Huntington, W. Va., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cub Fork Coal Company and Paragon Colliery Company brought this action in the federal court for southern Indiana to recover from Fairmount Glass Works $32,417, with interest, as damages for breach of a contract to purchase 17,500 tons of coal, at $6.50 per ton f.o.b. mines, deliverable in twelve monthly installments beginning June, 1920. Jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The Glass Works pleaded in bar several defenses; and it also set up a counterclaim in the sum of $2,000 as damages for failure to make delivery as provided by the contract. Three trials before a jury were had. At each of the first two the verdict was for the defendant; and each time the judgment entered thereon was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals with a general direction for a new trial, (19 F.(2d) 273; 33 F.(2d) 420). On the third trial the plaintiffs recovered a verdict for $1; and, after further proceedings, judgment was entered thereon, with costs.\n The plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals 'for the reasons set forth in the assignment of errors.' \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n The errors assigned were the failure to give eleven requested instructions. Nine instructions sought related solely to the question of liability. None of the instructions requested and refused related to the measure of damages. But the first asked for a directed verdict for $42,773.50, and the second asked that if a verdict were rendered for the plaintiffs the damages be set at $42,773.50. The charge given was not otherwise excepted to. It had appeared at the trial that after receiving in installments about 6,330 tons of coal, the defendant refused, on December 4, 1920, to accept further deliveries; and that there was a continuing serious decline in the market price of coal from that date to the end of the twelve months fixed by the contract for delivery. The defendant had insisted upon the several defenses pleaded in bar as well as upon the counterclaim. After the verdict the defendant was allowed to amend the counterclaim, so as to allege that the market price of coal was $11 a ton at the time plaintiffs failed to make the deliveries therein referred to, and that the defendant's damages from such failure were $10,000. The record recites that a motion for a new trial was made by the plaintiffs and overruled, and that the overruling was excepted to; but the grounds of the motion, and of the refusal to grant it, are not stated. The errors assigned do not include any reference to the motion for a new trial; or to the exception which was taken to the allowance of the amendment of the counterclaim after verdict.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals deemed it unnecessary to consider the nine instructions relating to liability, since the verdict for the plaintiffs 'upon the issues which determined liability was amply sustained by the evidence.' Nor did it discuss the two instructions which alone referred to the amount of damages recoverable. But it made an order substantially as follows: If within thirty days the parties shall stipulate that the judgment be \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n modified by substituting for $1 the sum of $18,500 (or other agreed sum), with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. from December 4, 1920, and costs, the judgment as so modified shall be affirmed; otherwise the judgment shall be reversed and a new trial be had 'limited only to an ascertainment ... of appellants' (plaintiffs') recoverable damages and the amount of appellee's counterclaim if upon a new trial it appears that appellee is entitled to any recovery or set-off on its counterclaim.' 59 F.(2d) 539, 540. As the parties did not stipulate for the modification suggested by the Court of Appeals, it ordered that the judgment be reversed with costs, and that the cause be remanded to the District Court with direction to grant a new trial limited as stated. The defendant petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals, in violation of the Seventh Amendment of the Federal Constitution, re- examined the verdict of the jury otherwise than according to the rules of the common law, and reversed the judgment solely for alleged error of fact in the verdict and for the alleged error of the trial court in overruling a motion for a new trial. Certiorari was granted, \n287 \nU.S. 585\n, 53 S.Ct. 24, 77 L.Ed. .\n The reasons assigned by the Circuit Court of Appeals for its action were substantially these: It appears that a large sum is recoverable as damages; that the minimum recoverable may be determined with substantial accuracy by computation, for the defendant 'breached its contract without justification on December 4, 1920,' and 'the market price of coal is shown for each day of the month, and the average price per month is also disclosed, so that the actual amount of damages is quite definitely ascertainable' despite 'a slight discrepancy in the statements of witnesses.' The amount shipped and the amount received are also quite definitely ascertainable, despite a discrepancy 'due apparently to the fact that the railroads confiscated a small amount of the coal on several occa- \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n sions.' Computing plaintiffs' damages 'upon the basis most favorable to' the defendant, and the defendant's damages on the counterclaim also on the basis most favorable to it, plaintiffs appear clearly to be entitled to $ 18,250, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. from December 4, 1920, and costs. As the jury fixed the damages at $1, the verdict should have been set aside and a new trial granted. Since in view of Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364\n, 33 S.Ct. 523, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1029, the court is 'not at liberty to direct judgment for such amount as we believe would fairly represent' plaintiffs' damages, the parties should be given the opportunity of disposing of the case without further litigation by entering into an agreement as to the damages. If the parties do not so agree, a new trial should be granted; limited to the ascertainment of damages, as in Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin, \n283 \nU.S. 494\n, 51 S.Ct. 513\n\n\n If the refusal to grant the motion for a new trial was deemed by the Circuit Court of Appeals plain reversible error, it was at liberty under its rules to notice the error although not assigned;1 and the omission from the record of the grounds of the motion would be no obstacle to a review, since the motion was obviously directed to the failure to award substantial damages. \n2\n But we are of \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n opinion that the action of the District Court was not reversible error.\n First. The rule that this Court will not review the action of a federal trial court in granting or denying a motion for a new trial for error of fact has been settled by a long and unbroken line of decisions;3 and has been frequently applied where the ground of the motion was that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive or were inadequate. \n4\n The rule precludes likewise a review of such action by a Circuit Court of Appeals. \n5\n Its early formulation by this Court was influenced by the mandate of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided in section 22 that there should be 'no reversal in either (circuit or Supreme) court on such writ of error ... for any error in fact.' 6 \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n Sometimes the rule has been rested on that part of the Seventh Amendment which provides that 'no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re- examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law.' 7 More frequently the reason given for the denial of review is that the granting or refusing of a motion for a new trial is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n It has been suggested that a review must be denied because of the historical limitation of the writ of error to matters within the record, of which the motion for a new trial was not a part. \n9\n Compare Judge Learned Hand in Miller v. Maryland Casualty Co. (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 463. But the denial of review can no longer rest upon this ground, since the record before the appellate court has been enlarged to include in the bill of exceptions a motion for a new trial, made either before or after judgment. Compare Harrison v. United States (C.C.A.) 7 F.(2d) 259, 262. Under certain circumstances the appellate court may inquire into the action of the trial court on a motion for a new trial. Thus, its denial may be reviewed if the trial court \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n erroneously excluded from consideration matters which were appropriate to a decision on the motion, Mattox v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 140\n, 13 S.Ct. 50; Ogden v. United States (C.C.A.) 112 F. 523; or if it acted on the mistaken view that there was no jurisdiction to grant it, or that there was no authority to grant it on the ground advanced, Felton v. Spiro (C.C.A.) 78 F. 576, 581; Dwyer v. United States (C.C.A.) 170 F. 160, 165; Paine v. St. Paul Union Stockyards Co. (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 624, 626- 628. It becomes necessary, therefore, to determine whether the circumstances of the case at bar justify an enquiry into the trial court's refusal to set aside the verdict.\n Second. It is urged that the motion for a new trial presented an issue of law. The argument is that on the motion or on the court's own initiative the verdict should have been set aside as inconsistent on its face, since if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover at all they were entitled to substantial, not merely nominal, damages. The case, it is contended, is comparable to one in which the award of damages exceeded a statutory limit, see Southern Ry., Carolina Division v. Bennett, \n233 \nU.S. 80\n, 34 S.Ct. 566; or was less than an amount undisputed, Glenwood Irrig. Co. v. Vallery (C.C.A.) 248 F. 483; Stetson v. Stindt (C.C. A.) 279 F. 209, 23 A.L.R. 302; or was in pursuance \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 484]\n\u00a0\n of erroneous instructions on the measure of damages, Chesapeake & O. Ry. Co. v. Gainey, \n241 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 36 S.Ct. 633;10 or was in clear contravention of the instructions of the trial court, United Press Ass'ns v. National Newspapers Ass'n (C.C.A.) 254 F. 284. Compare American R.R. Co. v. Santiago (C.C.A.) 9 F.(2d) 753, 757, 758.\n To regard the verdict as inconsistent on its face is to assume that the jury found for the plaintiff and failed to perform its task of assessing damages. The trial judge was not obliged so to regard the verdict. The defendant had insisted upon several defenses and had set up a counterclaim. The plaintiffs were not entitled to a directed verdict. The evidence was voluminous; and, on some issues at least, conflicting. The instructions left the contested issues of liability to the jury. The verdict may have represented a finding for the defendant on those issues; 11 the reason for the award of nominal damages may have been that the jury wished the costs to be taxed \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n against the defendant. The defendant did not complain of the verdict. The record before us does not contain any explanation by the trial court of the refusal to grant a new trial, or any interpretation by it of the jury's verdict. \n12\n In the absence of such expressions by the trial court in the case at bar, the refusal to grant a new trial cannot be held erroneous as a matter of law. Appellate courts should be slow to impute to juries a disregard of their duties, and to trial courts a want of diligence or perspicacity in appraising the jury's conduct. Compare Union Pacific R.R. Co. v. Hadley, \n146 \nU.S. 330, 334\n, 38 S.Ct. 318; Dunn v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 390, 394\n, 52 S.Ct. 189.\n Third. It is urged that the refusal to set aside the verdict was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, and hence reviewable. The court of Appeals has not declared that the trial judge abused his discretion. Clearly the mere refusal to grant a new trial where nominal damages were awarded is not an abuse of discretion. This Court has frequently refrained from disturbing the trial court's approval of an award of damages which seemed excessive or inadequate, 13 and the circuit courts of appeals have generally followed a similar polity. \n14\n Whether refusal to set aside a verdict for failure to award substantial damages may ever be reviewed on the ground that the trial judge abused his discretion, we have no occasion to determine. \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The respondents contend that the District Court erred in charging that the measure of damages was the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach, instead of the market prices at the times for delivery; and that this error may be relied upon here in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Compare United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 U.S. 425\n, 435- 436, 44 S.Ct. 560; Langnes v. Green, 282, U.S. 531, 538, 51 S.Ct. 243; Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., \n282 \nU.S. 555, 561\n, 51 S.Ct. 248. There was no request for an instruction on this subject and no objection was made to that given until after the jury had retired. The trial judge was under no obligation to recall the jury. Moreover, the instruction given and the refusal to recall the jury were not assigned as error on appeal to the Court of Appeals; nor did that court mention the matter. Under the rules of both the Court of Appeals and this Court the exception taken after the jury retired came too late to furnish a basis for review. \n15\n We have, therefore, no occasion to consider the meaning of the charge given, its correctness as a matter of law, or the materiality of the error, if any, in giving it.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n A verdict found in contravention of the instructions of the court may be reversed on appeal as contrary to law.\n So much the prevailing opinion apparently concedes. \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 487]\n\u00a0\n The verdict of $1 returned by the jury upon the trial of this cause may not be squared with their instructions, and hence was properly annulled.\n By the instructions of the trial judge they were required, if they found that the defendant had broken its contract, to award to the plaintiffs the difference between the contract price of the coal and its market value, after allowance for the defendant's counterclaim. The evidence most favorable to the defendant, both as to claim and counterclaim, made it necessary, if there was any breach, to return a substantial verdict; the minimum being capable of accurate computation. The distinction is not to be ignored between this case of a breach of contract and the cases cited in the prevailing opinion where the liability was in tort. Here the minimum, if not the maximum, damages are fixed and definite. There the discretion of the jury was not subject to tests so determinate and exact. The question is not before us whether even in such circumstances there may be revision on appeal. Cf. Pugh v. Bluff City Excursion Co. (C.C.A.) 177 F. 399. Enough for present purposes that in the circumstances of the case at hand the verdict for $1 is a finding that the contract had been broken, and this irrespective of the motive that caused the verdict to be given. What the motive was we cannot know from anything disclosed to us by the record. Nothing there disclosed lays a basis for a holding that the nominal verdict for the plaintiffs was designed to save them from the costs which the law would have charged against them if there had been a verdict for defendant. The jury were not instructed as to the liability for costs, and for all that appears had no knowledge on the subject. Nor would such a motive, if there were reason to ascribe it, rescue them from the reproach of disobedience and error. It would merely substitute one form of misconduct for another. It would do this, moreover, in contradiction of the record. By no process of mere \n\n[287 U.S. 474, 488]\n\u00a0\n construction can a verdict that nominal loss has resulted from a breach be turned into a verdict that there had been no breach at all. On the face of the record, the jury found there was a wrong, and then, in contravention of instructions, refused, either through misunderstanding or through wilfulness, to assess the damages ensuing.\n Justice is not promoted in its orderly administration when such conduct is condoned. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 10(4) of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit provides: 'The court may notice a plain error not assigned.' See Reliable Incubator & Brooder Co. v. Stahl (C.C.A.) 105 F. 663, 668. A similar rule obtains in this Court; and in each of the other Circuit Courts of Appeals except the Eighth. For examples of the application of these rules, see United States v. Tennessee & C.R.R. Co., \n176 \nU.S. 242, 256\n, 20 S.Ct. 370; Columbia Heights Realty Co. v.

Review by the Exchequer Chamber of the refusal to grant a new trial was allowed in a limited class of cases by the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, 17 & 18 Vict., c. 125,  35, which provided, however, that 'where the application for a new trial is upon Matter of Discretion only, as on the ground that the Virdict was against the Weight of Evidence or otherwise, no such Appeal shall be allowed.' Since the Judicature Acts, which abolished proceedings in error in civil cases and substituted an appeal (see Judicature Act, 1875, 38 & 39 Vict., c. 77, Order 58(1), appellate procedure has been regulated by rules of court.

GAINES(1933)\nNo. 112\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Peyton R. Evans, of Washington, D.C., and I. M. Bailey, of Raleigh, N.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. M. R. McCown, of Tyron, N.C., for respondent. \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 249]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Irving P. Whitehead, of Baltimore, Md., amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by respondent in the superior court for Polk county, N.C., to cancel a mortgage, given by her to petitioner, as invalid for want of consideration. It presents a question of the construction of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 360 (see 12 USCA  641 et seq.), which was raised and decided upon an agreed statement of facts. Judgment for respondent was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, 204 N.C. 278, 167 S.E. 856. The case comes here on certiorari. 290 U.S. --, 54 S.Ct. 53, 78 L.Ed. -- (certiorari granted October 9, 1933).\n On August 16, 1930, respondent applied to petitioner, through the Columbus Farm Loan Association, for a loan secured by mortgage upon her land, located in Polk county. The loan was approved by the loan association on October 1, 1930, and on that day respondent was admitted to membership in the association. In due course she executed a promissory note to petitioner, secured by mortgage upon her land, both of which she delivered to petitioner as required by the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act. The note, as the statute commands, bore indorsement of the agreement of the association to be liable upon it. Petitioner's check for the amount of the loan, less authorized charges, made payable jointly to the secretary-treasurer of the association and respondent, was delivered by petitioner to attorneys of the respondent together with a 'closed loan statement.' This statement was a detailed report of the loan transaction, including data of the disbursement of its proceeds and of fees charged by the association to the borrower. The secretary-treasurer was to fill out the statement after the loan transaction was completed, procure the borrower's signature to it, and return it to the bank. These documents were delivered by the attorneys to the secretary-treasurer, who, after the check was duly indorsed \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n by the payees, deposited it in a bank to the credit of the association. At the time of the indorsement and before, respondent understood that the check was to be so deposited and the proceeds after collection were to be disbursed by the association for the purposes for which the loan was procured. The bank, immediately after collection of the check, closed its doors, and the proceeds of the collection, with an exception not now material, have not become available either to the association or the respondent.\n The Supreme Court of North Carolina, construing the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act, concluded that the association, organized under its provisions as an intermediary between the borrower and the petitioner, acted as a 'public agent,' and that the receipt by it and the deposit of the check for collection and credit, though it was first indorsed by respondent, was not a receipt of the loan by the borrower or in her behalf such as to establish liability of respondent upon her note.\n The Federal Farm Loan Act was adopted in response to a national demand that the federal government should set up a rural credit system by which credit, not adequately provided by commercial banks, should be extended to those engaged in agriculture, upon the security of farm mortgages. The report of the Senate Committee which drafted the bill enacted as the Federal Farm Loan Act, Report of Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, No. 144, 46th Cong., 1st Sess., emphasizes as features of the proposed national rural credit system the creation of regional federal land banks under control of the Farm Loan Board. The banks were to make loans to farmers, upon the security of farm mortgages, with funds obtained in large part by the sale to investors of long-term bonds. See, also, Report of House Committee on Banking and Currency, No. 630, 64th Cong. 1st Sess. To adapt the system to local needs and to promote co-operation among bor- \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n rowers, it was proposed that the loans should be made through local associations controlled by their membership, composed exclusively of borrowers.\n These proposals were carried out in the Federal Farm Loan Act by providing for the creation of twelve regional federal land banks, section 4, 12 U.S.C.  671-683 (12 USCA  671-683), of which petitioner is one, all under the direction and control of the Federal Farm Loan Board,1 section 3, 12 U.S.C.  651, 652 (12 USCA  651, 652). Each has authority to lend money on the security of mortgages on farms within its own district. Section 13, 12 U.S.C.  781 (12 USCA  781). The banks are authorized to issue farm loan bonds secured by mortgages taken as security for loans. They are without authority to make loans 'except through National Farm Loan Associations,' organized as provided by other sections of the act, section 14, 12 U.S.C.  791 (12 USCA  791),2 or by agents, which are banking institutions organized under state laws. Section 15, 12 U.S.C.  803 (12 USCA  803). They may make loans only for specified agricultural purposes, including the payment of existing loans upon the security of farm lands or the purchase of farm lands or equipment for them or their improvement. Section 12, par. fourth, 12 U.S.C.  771 (12 USCA  771 par. 4th). Loans are made on written applications which are required to \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n designate the purpose for which the loan is to be used, and the borrower is required to agree that the loan shall be used for those purposes. Section 12, par. eighth, 12 U.S.C.  771 (12 USCA  771 par. 8th).\n National farm loan associations are local associations, organized under charters granted by the Federal Loan Board. Section 7, 12 U.S.C.  711, 719 (12 USCA  711, 719). Their membership is restricted to those who are borrowers from federal land banks. They are controlled by boards of directors elected by their members who, with the exception of the secretary-treasurer, the chief executive officer of the association, serve without compensation. Sections 7, 8, 12 U.S.C.  712, 713, 733 (12 USCA  712, 713, 733). They are also authorized to charge fees to borrowers, limited in amount, section 11, 12 U.S.C.  761 (12 USCA  761), 'to indorse, and thereby become liable for the payment of, mortgages taken from its shareholders by the Federal land bank of its district,' section 11, 12 U.S.C.  761 (12 USCA  761) and to receive from the federal land bank 'funds advanced' by the land bank and to deliver them to its members on receipt of first mortgages, sections 7, 11, 12 U.S.C.  720, 761 (12 USCA  720, 761). By section 14, 12 U.S.C.  714 (12 USCA  714), the secretary-treasurer is the custodian of the funds of the association, which are required to be deposited in a bank designated by the board of directors. He is required to 'assure himself ... that the loans made through the national farm loan association of which he is an officer are applied to the purposes set forth in the application of the borrower,' to pay over to borrowers all sums 'received for their account from the Federal land bank upon first mortgage,' and, acting under the direction of the association, 'to collect, receipt for, and transmit to the Federal land bank payments of interest, amortization installments, or principal arising out of loans made through the association,' and to report to the land bank of the district any failure of the borrower to comply with the terms of the application or mortgage, and any delinquent taxes on land mort- \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n gaged to the bank. Expenses of the secretary-treasurer are payable from the funds of the association, and, if such funds are not available, by levy of assessment on the members. Section 7, 12 U.S.C.  715 (12 USCA  715).\n Borrowers from federal land banks through national farm loan associations are required to subscribe and pay for shares of stock in the association to an amount equal to 5 per cent. of the face of the loan, which stock is to be paid off at par and retired upon full payment of the loan. Section 8, 12 U.S.C.  733 (12 USCA  733). The cost of these shares may be included in the loan. Section 9, 12 U.S.C.  742 (12 USCA  742). The association in turn is required 'whenever' it 'shall desire to secure for any member a loan on first mortgage from the Federal land bank of its district' to subscribe and pay for capital stock of the lending federal land bank in like amount, and similarly this stock is to be retired upon payment of the mortgage loan. Section 7, 12 U.S.C.  721 (12 USCA  721).\n In the present loan transaction, carried out in strict conformity with the statute, it was plainly contemplated that petitioner was to be the lender, and as lender it was to become the owner of the note and the mortgage, in which it was named respectively as payee and mortgagee. Respondent, as maker of the note, and the association, by its indorsement agreeing to be liable for its payment, were both to be obligated to pay the loan. As between the two, the association was in the position of a surety or guarantor, entitled to be exonerated by the mortgage security and protected to some extent by the 5 per cent. stock subscription exacted of respondent. If the transaction were unaffected by the provisions of the Farm Loan Act, it would require no argument or citation of authority to support the conclusion that the delivery of the note and mortgage to the lender, and the receipt of the check from the lender, payable to the obligors upon the mortgage indebtedness, and their indorsement and the collection of it, would establish their liability for the pay- \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n ment of the loan, regardless of what might become of the proceeds.\n The state court rested its decision on the characterization of the association as a public agent, but it did not hold that the association was in any sense an agent for the lender bank. It could not well have done so, for neither the provisions of the Farm Loan Act nor the particular circumstances which attended the loan in the present case gave to the petitioner any right of control over the association or any power to recall the check or its proceeds after its delivery and collection. The association was controlled by directors, elected by its own members, who, like the respondent, were borrowers. After the check was delivered to the association, it passed completely from the control of the lender and into the exclusive control of the payees who were the obligors of the mortgage indebtedness.\n It is true that both the petitioner and the association were, in a broad and general sense, public agencies or instrumentalities to carry out a policy of the government-the extension of credit to those engaged in agriculture to be availed of in the furtherance of agricultural undertakings. But those purposes could only be achieved through loans made to private individuals. The borrower is under no legal compulsion to borrow. If he takes the benefit of the privilege extended by the statute, he can do so only in compliance with its requirement that he shall join, with himself as obligor, the local co-operative association of which he is a member. This supplies a strong incentive on the part of the associations to perform the duties commanded by the statute looking to the safety and security of the loan and, as agreed by the borrower and required by the statute, its disbursement for the purposes for which it is made. By applying for the loan and delivering to the lender her mortgage and note, indorsed by the association, in compliance with the act, \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n respondent consented in advance to the procedure for creating and disbursing the loan which the statute prescribes. She renewed that consent when her indorsement of the check was made, with full knowledge that the association, her co-obligor, was to deposit the check to its credit and disburse the proceeds for the purposes for which the loan was made. This consent could not be affected by the closed loan statement which it was intended she should later sign. The statement was to be merely a confirmation or report of what had gone before. The indorsement of the check was the crucial act, for it drew the funds from the control of the petitioner and dedicated them irrevocably to the purposes for which the loan had been secured.\n We can perceive no inconsistency between the public ends to be effected and the purpose plainly exhibited by the statute and the conduct of the parties that they should occupy the position of co-obligors upon the loan indebtedness, with the mutual understanding that one of them, the association, was to disburse the proceeds of the loan for purposes agreed upon. And we can discern no difference between the legal consequence of their acts and that which would have ensued had respondent consented that the loan be received and disbursed by any third person who afterward had lost the money, or, if she had, herself, taken the indorsed check and deposited it to her credit in the insolvent bank. If we thought this conclusion more doubtful, we should regard as persuasive the fact that a different conclusion would break down the scheme of the act to make the mortgages taken by the federal land banks available as collateral for federal land bank bonds sold to investors. Its operation would be seriously impaired if such use of the mortgages taken must await the long period which may often elapse after the lending bank has paid out its money, and before the disbursement of it is completed by the local association. \n\n[290 U.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that there was no failure of consideration for the mortgage and that the judgment of the state court must be\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Farm Loan Board consisted of the Secretary of the Treasury and six members, appointed by the President. Section 3, 12 U.S.C.  652 (12 USCA  652).

Beck, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Johnson-Kennedy Radio Corporation, owning Station WJKS at Gary, Ind., applied to the Federal Radio Commission for modification of license so as to permit operation, with unlimited time, on the frequency of 560 kc. then assigned for the use of Station WIBO, owned by Nelson Bros. Bond & Mortgage Company, and Station WPCC, owned by the North Shore Church, both at Chicago, Ill. These owners appeared before the chief examiner who, after taking voluminous testimony, recommended that the application be denied. The applicant filed exceptions and, on consideration of the evidence, the Commission granted the application and directed a modified license to issue to the applicant authorizing the operation of Station WJKS on the frequency of 560 kc. and terminating the existing licenses theretofore issued for Stations WIBO and WPCC. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the commission's decision upon the ground that it was 'in a legal sense arbitrary and capricious.' 61 App.D.C. 315, 62 F.(2d) 854, 857. This court granted certiorari, \n288 \nU.S. 597\n, 53 S.Ct. 506, 77 L.Ed. --. region which has a population of about 800,000, under section 9 of the Radio Act of 1927 (c. 169, 44 Stat. 1166), as amended by section 5 of the Act of March 28, 1928, c. 263, 45 Stat. 373, \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n 47 U.S.C.  89 (47 USCA  89).1 The findings of fact upon which the commission based its order included the following:\n Gary, Ind., about 30 miles from Chicago, is the largest steel center in the world. It has a population of approximately 110,000 and is located in what is known as the Calumet region which has a population of about 800, 000, 60 per cent. of whom are foreign born and represent over fifty nationalities. Station WJKS is the only radio station in Gary and the programs it broadcasts are well designed to meet the needs of the foreign popula- \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n tion. These programs include 'broadcasts for Hungarian, Italian, Mexican, Spanish, German, Russian, Polish, Croatian, Lithuanian, Scotch and Irish people,' and 'are musical, educational and instructive in their nature and stress loyalty to the community and the Nation.' Programs are arranged and supervised 'to stimulate community and racial origin pride and rivalry and to instruct in citizenship and American ideals and responsibilities.' 'Special safety prevention talks' are given for workingmen, explaining the application of new safeguards of various types of machinery used in the steel mills. The children's hour utilizes selections from various schools. There are 'good citizenship talks' weekly by civic leaders. The facilities of the station are made available to the local police department and to all fraternal, charitable, and religious organizations in the Calumet region, without charge. Sunday programs consist mainly 'of church service broadcast' including all churches and denominations desiring to participate. Although the Calumet area is served by a station at Fort Wayne and by several stations in Chicago, Station WJKS 'is the only station which serves a substantial portion of the area with excellent or even good service.' While Station WJKS 'delivers a signal of sufficient strength to give good reception in its normal service area if not interfered with, heterodyne and cross-talk interference exist to within three miles of the transmitter and constant objection to interference is found in the good service area of the station, particularly to the south, southeast and east.' This interference has increased during the past two years.\n Station WIBO is operated by Nelson Bros. Bond & Mortgage Company separately from its mortgage and real estate business. It employs 55 persons and its total monthly expenses average $17,000. In March, 1931, it earned a net profit of $9,000. It represents a total cost of $346,362.99 less a reserve for depreciation of $54,627.36, \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n and has been operated since April, 1925. Station WIBO was licensed to share time with Station WPCC, the latter being authorized to operate on Sundays during stated hours and by agreement has operated on certain week days in exchange for Sunday hours.\n The licenses for Stations WIBO and WPCC, effective from September 1, 1931, to March 1, 1932, were issued upon the following condition: 'This license is issued on a temporary basis and subject to such action as the Commission may take after hearing on the application filed by Station WJKS, Gary, Indiana, for the frequency 560 kc. No authority contained herein shall be construed as a finding by the Federal Radio Commission that the operation of this station is or will be in the public interest beyond the term hereof.'\n The programs broadcast by Station WIBO include a large number of chain programs originating in the National Broadcasting network and are almost entirely commercial in their nature. The same general type of programs broadcast by WIBO, including National Broadcasting chain programs, are received in the service area of WIBO from many other stations located in the Chicago district.\n Station WPCC, owned by the North Shore Church, has programs made up entirely of sermons, religious music, and talks relating to the work and interests of the church. Contributions are solicited for the use of the church and to advance the matters in which it is interested; it is not used by other denominations or societies. 'Other stations in Chicago, including WMBI, owned by the Moody Bible Institute, devoting more time to programs of a religious nature than WPCC, are received in the service area of that station.'\n'The State of Indiana is 2.08 units or 22 per cent under-quota in station assignments and the State of Illinois is 12.49 units or 55 per cent over-quota in such assignments. \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 273]\n\u00a0\n The Fourth Zone, in which both States are located, is 21.00 units or 26 per cent over-quota in station assignments. The granting of this application and deletion of WIBO and WPCC would reduce the over-quota status of the State of Illinois and the Fourth Zone by .88 unit and .45 unit, respectively, and would increase the quota of Indiana by .43 unit.'\n\n Summarizing the grounds of its decision, the commission found:\n'1. The applicant station (WJKS) now renders an excellent public service in the Calumet region and the granting of this application would enable that station to further extend and enlarge upon that service.\n\n'2. The deletion of Stations WIBO and WPCC would not deprive the persons within the service areas of those stations of any type of programs not now received from other stations.\n\n'3. Objectionable interference is now experienced within the service area of WJKS through the operation of other stations on the same and adjacent frequencies.\n\n'4. The granting of this application and deletion of Stations WIBO and WPCC would not increase interference within the good service areas of any other stations.\n\n'5. The granting of this application and deletion of Stations WIBO and WPCC would work a more equitable distribution of broadcasting facilities within the Fourth Zone, in that there would be an increase in the radio broadcasting facilities of Indiana which is now assigned less than its share of such facilities and a decrease in the radio broadcasting facilities of Illinois which is now assigned more than its share of such facilities.\n\n'6. Public interest, convenience and\/or necessity would be served by the granting of this application.'\n\n The Court of Appeals was divided in opinion. The majority pointed out that the court had repeatedly held that 'it would not be consistent with the legislative policy \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 274]\n\u00a0\n to equalize the comparative broadcasting facilities of the various states or zones by unnecessarily injuring stations already established which are rendering valuable service to their natural service areas'; and they were of opinion that the evidence showed that Stations WIBO and WPCC had been \" serving public interest, convenience, and necessity' certainly to as great an extent as the applicant station' and that 'the conclusively established and admitted facts' furnished no legal basis for the commission's decision. The minority of the court took the view that the court was substituting its own conclusions for those of the commission; that the commission had acted within its authority; and that its findings were sustained by the evidence.\n First. Respondents challenge the jurisdiction of this court. They insist that the decision of the Court of Appeals is not a 'judicial judgment'; that, for the purpose of the appeal to it, the Court of Appeals is merely a part of the machinery of the Radio Commission and that the decision of the court is an administrative decision. Respondents further insist that, if this court examines the record, its decision 'would not be a judgment, or permit of a judgment to be made in any lower court, but would permit only consummation of the administrative function of issuing or withholding a permit to operate the station.'\n Under section 16 of the Radio Act of 1927, the Court of Appeals, on appeal from decisions of the Radio Commission, was directed to 'hear, review and determine the appeal' upon the record made before the commission, and upon such additional evidence as the court might receive, and was empowered to 'alter or revise the decision appealed from and enter such judgment as to it may seem just.' 44 Stat. 1169 (47 USCA  96). This provision made the court 'a superior and revising agency' in the administrative field and consequently its decision was not a judicial judgment reviewable by this court. Federal Radio \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 275]\n\u00a0\n Commission v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464, 467\n, 50 S.Ct. 389, 390. The province of the Court of Appeals was found to be substantially the same as that which it had, until recently, on appeals from administrative decisions of the Commissioner of Patents. While the Congress can confer upon the courts of the District of Columbia such administrative authority, this court cannot be invested with jurisdiction of that character whether for the purpose of review or otherwise. It cannot give decisions which are merely advisory, nor can it exercise functions which are essentially legislative or administrative. Id., pages 468, 469 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 389; Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 U.S. 428\n, 442-444, 43 S.Ct. 445; Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693, 700\n, 47 S.Ct. 284.\n In the light of the decision in the General Electric Case, supra, the Congress, by the Act of July 1, 1930, c. 788, amended section 16 of the Radio Act of 1927 so as to limit the review by the Court of Appeals. 46 Stat. 844, 47 U.S.C.  96 (47 USCA  96).2 That review is now expressly limited to 'questions \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 276]\n\u00a0\n of law' and it is provided 'that findings of fact by the commission, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive unless it shall clearly appear that the findings of the commission are arbitrary or capricious.' This limitation is in sharp contrast with the previous grant of authority. No longer is the court entitled to revise the commission's decision and to enter such judgment as the court may think just. The limitation manifestly demands judicial, as distinguished from administrative, review. Questions of law form the appropriate subject of judicial determinations. Dealing with activities admittedly within its regulatory power, the Congress established the commission as its instrumentality to provide continuous and expert supervision and to exercise the administrative judgment essential in applying legislative standards to a host of instances. These standards the Congress prescribed. The powers of the commission were defined, and definition is limitation. Whether the commission applies the legislative standards validly set up, whether it acts within the authority conferred or goes beyond it, whether its proceedings satisfy the pertinent demands of due process, whether, in short, there is compliance with, the legal requirements which fix the province of the commission and govern its action, are appropriate questions for judicial decision. These are questions of law upon which the court is to pass. The provision that the commission's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive unless it clearly appears that the findings are arbitrary or capricious, cannot be regarded as an attempt to vest in the court an authority to revise the action of the commission from an ad- \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 277]\n\u00a0\n ministrative standpoint and to make an administrative judgment. A finding without substantial evidence to support it-an arbitrary or capricious finding-does violence to the law. It is without the sanction of the authority conferred. And an inquiry into the facts before the commission, in order to ascertain whether its findings are thus vitiated, belongs to the judicial province and does not trench upon, or involve the exercise of, administrative authority. Such an examination is not concerned with the weight of evidence or with the wisdom or expediency of the administrative action. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 30 S.Ct. 155; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R.

Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 49\n, 50 S., 52 S.Ct. 285.\n If the questions of law thus presented were brought before the court by suit to restrain the enforcement of an invalid administrative order, there could be no question as to the judicial character of the proceeding. But that character is not altered by the mere fact that remedy is afforded by appeal. The controlling question is whether the function to be exercised by the court is a judicial function, and, if so, it may be exercised on an authorized appeal from the decision of an administrative body. We must not 'be misled by a name, but look to the substance and intent of the proceeding.' United States v. Ritchie, 17 How. 525, 534; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 479\n, 19 S.Ct. 722; Federal Trade Commission v. Eastman Co., \n274 \nU.S. 619, 623\n, 47 S.Ct. 688; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 278]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 716, 722-724, 49 S.Ct. 499, 501. 'It is not important,' we said in Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra, 'whether such a proceeding was originally begun by an administrative or executive determination, if, when it comes to the court, whether legislative or constitutional, it calls for the exercise of only the judicial power of the court upon which jurisdiction has been conferred by law.' Nor is it necessary that the proceeding to be judicial should be one entirely de novo. When on the appeal, as here provided, the parties come before the Court of Appeals to obtain its decision upon the legal question whether the commission has acted within the limits of its authority, and to have their rights, as established by law, determined accordingly, there is a case or controversy which is the appropriate subject of the exercise of judicial power. The provision that, in case the court reverses the decision of the commission, 'it shall remand the case to the commission to carry out the judgment of the court' means no more than that the commission in its further action is to respect and follow the court's determination of the questions of law. The procedure thus contemplates a judicial judgment by the Court of Appeals and this court has jurisdiction, on certiorari, to review that judgment in order to determine whether or not it is erroneous. Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 819; In re Pacific Railway Commission (C.C.) 32 F. 241, 255; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, supra; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co ., supra; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra.\n Second. In this aspect, the questions presented are: (1) Whether the commission, in making allocations of frequencies or wave lengths to states within a zone, has power to license operation by a station in an 'underquota' state on a frequency theretofore assigned to a station in an 'overquota' state, and to terminate the license of the latter station; (2) whether, if the commis- \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 279]\n\u00a0\n sion has this power, its findings of fact sustain its order in the instant case, in the light of the statutory requirements for the exercise of the power, and, if so, whether these findings are supported by substantial evidence; and (3) whether, in its procedure, the commission denied to the respondents any substantial right.\n\n 1. \nNo question is presented as to the power of the Congress, in its regulation of interstate commerce, to regulate radio communications. No state lines divide the radio waves, and national regulation is not only appropriate but essential to the efficient use of radio facilities. In view of the limited number of available broadcasting frequencies, the Congress has authorized allocation and licenses. The commission has been set up as the licensing authority and invested with broad powers of distribution in order to secure a reasonable equality of opportunity in radio transmission and reception.\n The Radio Act divides the United States into five zones, and Illinois and Indiana are in the fourth zone. Section 2, 47 U.S.C.  82 (47 USCA  82). Except as otherwise provided in the act, the commission 'from time to time, as public convenience, interest, or necessity requires,' is directed to 'assign bands of frequency or wave lengths to the various classes of stations and assign frequencies or wave lengths for each individual station and determine the power which each station shall use and the time during which it may operate,' and to 'determine the location of classes of stations or individual stations.' Section 4(c, d), 47 U.S.C.  84(c, d) 47 USCA  84(c, d). By section 9, as amended in 1928, the Congress declared that the people of all the zones 'are entitled to equality of radio broadcasting service, both of transmission and of reception,' and that 'in order to provide said equality the licensing authority shall as nearly as possible make and maintain an equal allocation of broadcasting licenses, of bands of frequency or wave lengths, of periods of time for operation, and of station power, to each of said zones \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 280]\n\u00a0\n when and in so far as there are applications therefor'; and the commission is further directed to 'make a fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each of the States , ... within each zone, according to population'; and the commission is to 'carry into effect the equality of broadcasting service, ... whenever necessary or proper, by granting or refusing licenses or renewals of licenses, by changing periods of time for operation, and by increasing or decreasing station power, when applications are made for licenses or renewals of licenses.' Section 9, 47 U.S.C.  89 (47 USCA  89).3\n By its General Order No. 40, of August 30, 1928,4 the commission established a basis for the equitable distribution of broadcasting facilities in accordance with the act. That order, as amended, provided for the required apportionment by setting aside a certain number of frequencies for use by stations operating on clear channels for distant service, and other frequencies for simultaneous use by stations operating in different zones, each station serving a regional area, and still others for use by stations serving city or local areas. These three classes of stations have become known as 'clear, regional, and local channel stations.' A new allocation of frequencies, power, and hours of operation was made in November, 1928,5 to conform to the prescribed classification. It was found to be impracticable to determine the total value of the three classes of assignments so that it could be ascertained whether a state was actually 'under or over quota on total radio facilities,' and the commission developed a 'unit system' in order 'to evaluate stations, based on type of channel, power and hours of operation, and all other considerations required by law.' In June, 1930, the \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 281]\n\u00a0\n commission issued its General Order No. 926 specifying the 'unit value' of stations of various types, and in this way the commission was able to make a tabulation by zones and states showing the 'units due,' based on estimated population, and the 'units assigned.' This action called for administrative judgment, and no ground is shown for assailing it. It appears that, with respect to total broadcasting facilities, Indiana is 'underquota' and Illinois is 'over-quota' in station assignments.\n Respondents contend that the commission has departed from the principle set forth in its General Order No. 92, because it has ignored the fact that, both Indiana and Illinois being underquota in regional station assignments, Indiana has more of such assignments in proportion to its quota than has Illinois, and by ordering the deletion of regional stations in Illinois in favor of an Indiana station, the commission has violated the command of Congress, by increasing the underquota condition of Illinois in favor of the already superior condition of Indiana with respect to stations of that type. We find in the act no command with the import upon which respondents insist. The command is that there shall be a 'fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each of the States ... within each zone.' It cannot be said that this demanded equality between states with respect to every type of station. Nor does it appear that the commission ignored any of the facts shown by the evidence. The fact that there was a disparity in regional station assignments, and that Indiana had more of this type than Illinois. could not be regarded as controlling. In making its 'fair and equitable allocation,' the commission was entitled and required to consider all the broadcasting facilities assigned to the respective states, and all the advantages thereby enjoyed \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 282]\n\u00a0\n and to determine whether, in view of all the circumstances of distribution, a more equitable adjustment would be effected by the granting of the application of Station WJKS and the deletion of Stations WIBO and WPCC.\n To accomplish its purpose, the statute authorized the commission to effect the desired adjustment 'by granting or refusing licenses or renewals of licenses, by changing periods of time for operation, and by increasing or decreasing station power.' This broad authority plainly extended to the deletion of existing stations if that course was found to be necessary to produce an equitable result. The context, as already observed, shows clearly that the Congress did not authorize the commission to act arbitrarily or capriciously in making a redistribution, but only in a reasonable manner to attain a legitimate end. That the Congress had the power to give this authority to delete stations, in view of the limited radio facilities available and the confusion that would result from interferences, is not open to question. Those who operated broadcasting stations had no right superior to the exercise of this power of regulation. They necessarily made their investments and their contracts in the light of, and subject to, this paramount authority. This court has had frequent occasion to observe that the power of Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce is not fettered by the necessity of maintaining existing arrangements which would conflict with the execution of its policy, as such a restriction would place the regulation in the hands of private individuals and withdraw from the control of Congress so much of the field as they might choose by prophetic discernment to bring within the range of their enterprises.

Respondents say that as to zones Congress requires an 'equal' allocation, but as between states only 'a fair and equitable' allocation, and that the provision 'for granting or refusing licenses or renewals of licenses' relates to the former and not to the latter. It is urged that this construction is fortified by the proviso in section 9 as to temporary permits for zones. \n7\n We think that this attempted distinction is without basis. The Congress was not seeking in either case 'an exact mathematical division.' \n8\n It was recognized that this might be physically impossible. The equality sought was not a mere matter of geographical delimitation. The concern of the Congress was with the interests of the people-that they might have a reasonable equality of opportunity in radio transmission and reception, and this involved an equitable distribution not only as between zones but as between states as well. And to construe the authority conferred, in relation to the deletion of stations, as being applicable only to an apportionment between zones and \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 284]\n\u00a0\n not between states, would defeat the manifest purpose of the act.\n We conclude that the commission, in making allocations of frequencies to states within a zone, has the power to license operation by a station in an underquota state on a frequency theretofore assigned to a station in an overquota state, provided the commission does not act arbitrarily or capriciously.\n\n 2. \nRespondents contend that the deletion of their stations was arbitrary, in that they were giving good service; that they had not failed to comply with any of the regulations of the commission; and that no proceeding had been instituted for the revocation of their licenses as provided in section 14 of the Act, 47 U.S.C.  94 (47 USCA  94). That section permits revocation of particular licenses by reason of false statements or for failure to operate as the license required or to observe any of the restrictions and conditions imposed by law or by the commission's regulations. There is, respondents say, no warrant in the act for a 'forfeiture' such as that here attempted. But the question here is not with respect to revocation under section 14, but as to the equitable adjustment of allocations demanded by section 9. The question is not simply as to the service rendered by particular stations, independently considered, but as to relative facilities-the apportionment as between states. At the time of the proceeding in question respondents were operating under licenses running from September 1, 1931, to March 1, 1932, and which provided in terms that they were issued 'on a temporary basis and subject to such action as the Commission may take after hearing on the application filed by Station WJKS' for the frequency 560 kc. Charged with the duty of making an equitable distribution as between states, it was appropriate for the commission to issue temporary licenses with such a reservation in order to preserve its freedom to act in the light of its decision on that application. And when \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 285]\n\u00a0\n decision was reached, there was nothing either in the provisions of section 14, or otherwise in the act, which precluded the commission from terminating the licenses in accordance with the reservation stipulated.\n In granting licenses the commission is required to act 'as public convenience, interest or necessity requires.' This criterion is not to be interpreted as setting up a standard so indefinite as to confer an unlimited power. Compare New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 53 S.Ct. 45. The requirement is to be interpreted by its context, by the nature of radio transmission and reception, by the scope, character, and quality of services, and, where an equitable adjustment between states is in view, by the relative advantages in service which will be enjoyed by the public through the distribution of facilities. In making such an adjustment the equities of existing stations undoubtedly demand consideration. They are not to be the victims of official favoritism. But the weight of the evidence as to these equities and all other pertinent facts is for the determination of the commission in exercising its authority to make a 'fair and equitable allocation.'\n In the instant case the commission was entitled to consider the advantages enjoyed by the people of Illinois under the assignments to that state, the services rendered by the respective stations, the reasonable demands of the people of Indiana, and the special requirements of radio service at Gary. The commission's findings show that all these matters were considered. Respondents say that there had been no material change in conditions since the general reallocation of 1928. But the commission was not bound to maintain that allocation if it appeared that a fair and equitable distribution made a change necessary. Complaint is also made that the commission did not adopt the recommendations of its examiner. But the commission had the responsibility of decision and was \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 286]\n\u00a0\n not only at liberty but was required to reach its own conclusions upon the evidence.\n We are of the opinion that the commission's findings of fact, which we summarized at the outset, support its decision, and an examination of the record leaves no room for doubt that there findings rest upon substantial evidence.\n\n 3. \nRespondents raise a further question with respect to the procedure adopted by the commission. In January, 1931, the commission issued its General Order No. 1029 relating to applications from underquota states. This order provided, among other things, that 'applications from underquota States in zones which have already allocated to them their pro rata share of radio facilities should be for a facility already in use in that zone by an overquota State,' and that, since the commission had allocated frequencies for the different classes of stations, 'applications should be for frequencies set aside by the Commission for the character of station applied for.' Respondents insist that these requirements foreclosed the exercise of discretion by the commission by permitting the applicant to select the station and the facilities which it desired; that this 'naked action of the applicant' precluded the commission from 'giving general consideration to the field' and from making that fair and equitable allocation which is the primary command of the statute. We think that this argument misconstrues General Order No. 102. That order is merely a rule of procedural convenience, requiring the applicant to frame a precise proposal and thus to present a definite issue. The order in no way derogates from the authority of the commission. While it required the applicant to state the facilities it desires, there was nothing to prevent respondents from contesting the applicant's demand upon the ground \n\n[289 U.S. 266, 287]\n\u00a0\n that other facilities were available and should be granted in place of those which the applicant designated. If such a contention had been made, there would have been no difficulty in bringing before the commission other stations whose interests might be drawn in question. There is no showing that the respondents were prejudiced by the operation of the order in question.\n Respondents complain that they were not heard in argument before the commission. They were heard before the examiner and the evidence they offered was considered by the commission. The exceptions filed by the applicant to the examiner's report were filed and served upon the respondents in August, 1931, and the decision of the commission was made in the following October. While the request of the applicant for oral argument was denied, it does not appear that any such request was made by respondents or that they sought any other hearing than that which was accorded.\n We find no ground for denying effect to the commission's action. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded with direction to affirm the decision of the commission.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 of the Act of March 28, 1928, 45 Stat. 373 (47 USCA  89), is as follows:\n Sec. 5. The second paragraph of section 9 of the Radio Act of 1927 is amended to read as follows:\n'It is hereby declared that the people of all the zones established by section 82 (2) of this chapter are entitled to equality of radio broadcasting service, both of transmission and of reception, and in order to provide said equality the licensing authority shall as nearly as possible make and maintain an equal allocation of broadcasting licenses, of bands of frequency or wave lengths, of periods of time for operation, and of station power, to each of said zones when and in so far as there are applications therefor; and shall make a fair and equitable allocation of licenses, wave lengths, time for operation, and station power to each of the States, the District of Columbia, the Territories and possessions of the United States within each zone, according to population. The licensing authority shall carry into effect the equality of broadcasting service hereinbefore directed, whenever necessary or proper, by granting or refusing licenses or renewals of licenses, by changing periods of time for operation, and by increasing or decreasing station power, when applications are made for licenses or renewals of licenses: Provided, That if and when there is a lack of applications from any zone for the proportionate share of licenses, wave lengths, time of operation, or station power to which such zone is entitled, the licensing authority may issue licenses for the balance of the proportion not applied for from any zone, to applicants from other zones for a temporary period of ninety days each, and shall specifically designate that said apportionment is only for said temporary period. Allocations shall be charged to the State, District, Territory, or possession wherein the studio of the station is located and not where the transmitter is located.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By this amendment, section 16(d) reads as follows:\n'At the earliest convenient time the court shall hear and determine the appeal upon the record before it, and shall have power, upon such record, to enter a judgment affirming or reversing the decision of the commission, and, in event the court shall render a decision and enter an order reversing the decision of the commission, it shall remand the case to the commission to carry out the judgment of the court: Provided, however, That the review by the court shall be limited to questions of law and that findings of fact by the commission, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive unless it shall clearly appear that the findings of the commission are arbitrary or capricious. The court's judgment shall be final, subject, however, to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari on petition therefor under section 347 of Title 28 (of the Judicial Code) by appellant, by the commission, or by any interested party intervening in the appeal.' 46 Stat. 844, 47 U.S.C.  96(d), 47 USCA  96(d).\n\n In reporting this amendment, the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives stated: 'The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the procedure on appeal to the court from decisions of the Federal Radio Commission, to more clearly define the scope of the subject matter of such appeals, and to insure a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia by the Supreme Court.'

Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas H. Malone, of Nashville, Tenn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings here for consideration six orders made by the Federal Trade Commission under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 719, title 15, U.S.C.,  45 (15 USCA  45), which declares that unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce are unlawful. Proceeding under the act1 the commission filed separate com- \n\n[288 U.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n plaints against respondents, each of whom operates a business, either as a corporation, partnership or an individual, in the city of Nashville, Tennessee. All are engaged in preparing for the market self-rising flour and plain flour and selling the same in interstate commerce. None of them grind from the wheat the flour which they thus prepare and sell, but only mix and blend different kinds of flour purchased from others engaged in grinding. After being mixed and sifted, the flour, either plain or made self-rising, is packed into bags for the market. Most of the concerns grinding wheat into flour and selling in the same market also make self- rising flour and blended plain flour, ground from different sorts of wheat.\n One of the respondents does business under the names, 'Royal Milling Company,' 'Richland Milling Company,' and 'Empire Milling Company.' The others use trade-names of similar import, all containing the words 'milling company,' or 'mill,' or 'manufacturer of flour'-words which are commonly understood by dealers and the purchasing public to indicate concerns which grind wheat into flour.\n There are other concerns engaged in the business of producing plain and self-rising flour, by a process of mixing and blending, and selling the product in the same market in competition with respondents and with the grinders; but these do not name themselves millers, mills, \n\n[288 U.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n or milling companies, or hold themselves out in any way as grinders of grain. The business involved is large and the competition among the several concerns substantial; and the use of the enumerated trade-names by the respondents tends to divert and does divert business from both the grinders and those blenders who do not use such trade-names or an equivalent therefor. Respondents have circulated written and printed circulars among the trade which either directly assert, or are calculated to convey the impression, that their product is composed of flour manufactured by themselves from the wheat. These statements and the use of the trade-names under which respondents do business have induced many consumers and dealers to believe that respondents are engaged in grinding from the wheat the product which they put out. The respondents, early in the proceeding before the commission, offered 'to place on their letterheads, bags, invoices, etc., in conspicuous lettering the words: 'Not Grinders of Wheat.\" This offer the commission evidently thought it unnecessary to consider, in view of the more comprehensive conclusion which it reached as to the remedy.\n The findings of the commission, supported by evidence, in substance embody the foregoing facts, and much else which for present purposes it is unnecessary to repeat. From these findings the commission concluded that the practices of respondents were to the prejudice of their competitors and of the public and constituted unfair methods of competition within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Thereupon, the commission issued its orders against respondents to cease and desist from carrying on the business of selling flour in interstate commerce under a trade-name or any other name which included the words 'milling company,' or words of like import, and from making representations, designed to affect interstate commerce, that they or either of them \n\n[288 U.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n manufacture flour or that the flour sold by them comes direct from manufacturer to purchaser, etc.\n Upon review the Circuit Court of Appeals set aside all orders of the commission, upon the ground that the proceeding by the commission did not appear to be in the interest of the public. 58 F.(2d) 581.\n To sustain the orders of the commission, three requisites must exist: ( 1) That the methods used are unfair; (2) that they are methods of competition in interstate commerce; and (3) that a proceeding by the commission to prevent the use of the methods appears to be in the interest of the public. Fed. Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 646\n, 647 S., 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191. Upon the first two of these we need take no time, for clearly the methods used were unfair and were methods of competition. Federal Trade Comm. v. Winstead Hosiery Co., \n258 U.S. 483\n, 492-494, 42 S.Ct. 384; Fed. Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., supra, at pages 651, 652 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191\n\n\n We also are of opinion that it sufficiently appears that the proceeding was in the interest of the public. It is true, as this court held in Federal Trade Comm. v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19\n, 50 S.Ct. 1, 68 A.L.R. 838, that mere misrepresentation and confusion on the part of purchasers or even that they have been deceived is not enough. The public interest must be specific and substantial. In that case (page 28 of 280 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 1) various ways in which the public interest may be thus involved were pointed out; but the list is not exclusive. If consumers or dealers prefer to purchase a given article because it was made by a particular manufacturer or class of manufacturers, they have a right to do so, and this right cannot be satisfied by imposing upon them an exactly similar article, or one equally as good, but having a different origin. Here the findings of the commission, supported by evidence, amply disclose that a large number of buyers, comprising consumers and dealers, believe that the price or quality or both are affected to their advantage by the fact \n\n[288 U.S. 212, 217]\n\u00a0\n that the article is prepared by the original grinder of the grain. The result of respondents' acts is that such purchasers are deceived into purchasing an article which they do not wish or intend to buy, and which they might or might not buy if correctly informed as to its origin. We are of opinion that the purchasing public is entitled to be protected against that species of deception, and that its interest in such protection is specific and substantial. Federal Trade Commission v. Balme (C.C.A.) 23 F.( 2d) 615, 620. Compare Federal Trade Comm. v. Winstead Hosiery Co., supra; Ohio Leather Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 39, 41. There is nothing in the Klesner Case to the contrary.\n Although we sustain the commission in its findings and conclusions to the effect that the use of the trade-names in question and the misstatements referred to constituted unfair methods of competition within the meaning of the act, and that its proceeding was in the interest of the public, we think under the circumstances the commission went too far in ordering what amounts to a suppression of the trade-names. These names have been long in use, in one instance beginning as early as 1902. They constitute valuable business assets in the nature of good will, the destruction of which probably would be highly injurious and should not be ordered if less drastic means will accomplish the same result. The orders should go no further than is reasonably necessary to correct the evil and preserve the rights of competitors and public; and this can be done, in the respect under consideration, by requiring proper qualifying words to be used in immediate connection with the names. See N. Fluegelman & Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C.C.A. 37 F.(2d) 59, 61; Federal Trade Commission v. Cassoff (C.C.A.) 38 F.(2d) 790, 791; Federal Trade Commission v. Good-Grape Co.

Warshawsky & Co., 257 Ill.App. 571, 584 et seq. This is a matter which the commission has not considered but which, as the body having primary jurisdiction, it should, in the first instance, consider and determine. And in doing so it will be enough if each respondent be required by modified order to accompany each use of the name or names with an explicit representation that respondent is not a grinder of the grain from which the flour prepared and put out is made, such representation to be fixed as to form and manner by the commission, upon consideration of the present record and any further evidence which it may conclude to take. In respect of other particulars, the orders of the commission are sustained.\n The decree below, therefore, will be reversed, and the proceeding remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals to be disposed of in conformity with this opinion.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the decree below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whenever the commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce, and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. ...

Veatch, of Portland, Or., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1929 respondent, for the purpose of procuring a contract with Oregon for highway construction and in compliance with applicable statutes ( 49-701 and 67-1101, Oregon Code 1930), gave to the state a bond on which petitioner was surety conditioned that he would pay for labor and material entering into the work. He failed, and one who had furnished him labor and material sued on the bond and obtained a judgment for $10,000 against \n\n[290 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n principal and surety jointly. Petitioner paid and took an assignment of the judgment. In 1931 respondent, having been adjudged bankrupt, applied for discharge from his debts including that due petitioner on account of such payment. Petitioner filed objections showing that respondent induced it to become surety by means of materially false written statements in respect of his financial condition. Respondent demurred, the District Court sustained the demurrer and entered a decree of discharge. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (61 F.(2d) 607), following decisions of District Courts in that circuit (In re Tanner (D.C.) 192 F. 572, and In re Ford (D.C.) 14 F.(2d) 848).\n The Bankruptcy Act,  14b(3) as amended, 11 U.S.C.  32(b)(3), 11 USCA  32(b) (3), requires denial of discharge if the bankrupt 'obtained money or property on credit ... by making ... a materially false statement in writing respecting his financial condition.' Petitioner's obligation was given in behalf of respondent and inured to his benefit. It was a means by which he procured the contract and was security for the payment of his indebtedness incurred for labor or material required to do the work. But respondent insists that the bond is not property and that his fraud in obtaining it is not within the condemnation of clause (3). 'Property' is a word of very broad meaning, and, when used without qualification, expressly made or plainly implied, it reasonably may be construed to include obligations, rights, and other intangibles as well as physical things.

The Act, while making discharge of bankrupts the general rule, conditions the grant upon adherence by every applicant to the standards of honesty and fair dealing in business transactions that are required or reflected in section 32(b)(1 ), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), 11 USCA. The fraud perpetrated by respondent is of the kind condemned. Giving effect to the rule that legislative intent controls, it is plain that 'property' includes petitioner's obligation according to the terms of the bond to pay respondent's debts. Matter of Dunfee, supra; Gaddy v. Witt (Tex. Civ. App.) 142 S.W. 926; Royal Indemnity Co. v. Cooper, supra. In Gleason v. Thaw, \n236 \nU.S. 558\n, 35 S.Ct. 287, this court held that the professional services on an attorney were not within section 17a(2), 11 USCA  35(2), which excepts from the general discharge liabilities for property obtained by false pretenses. That was a close case. See Gleason v. Thaw (C.C.A.) 185 F. 345, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 894; Id. (C.C.A.) 196 F. 359. The principle of construction there applied may not reasonably be extended to this one.\n It remains to be considered whether the respondent obtained petitioner's obligation 'on credit.' Principal and surety must be held to have had in contemplation all liabilities that naturally might arise from such a contract. Matter of Dunfee, supra. Respondent was bound by agreement, implied by law if not expressly made, that he would make good to petitioner whatever the latter as such surety might be required to pay. Petitioner gave its obligation, not for the premium alone, but also in consideration of respondent's promise to reimburse it. Having regard to the results that at the beginning the parties were reasonably bound to anticipate, it is clear that respondent \n\n[290 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n obtained, and petitioner gave, the bond and obligation on credit. See Swarts v. Siegel (C.C.A.) 117 F. 13, 17; Kobusch v. Hand (C.C.A.) 156 F. 660, 662, 18 L.R.A. (N.S.) 660. While clause (3) seems aimed particularly at false pretenses made by borrowers and purchasers to obtain money or goods on credit (Firestone v. Harvey (C.C.A.) 174 F. 574, 577), it is not limited to such transactions. Respondent's application for discharge should have been denied.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT. BK. OF SHREVEPORT v. LOUISIANA TAX COM'N(1933)\nNo. 293\nArgued: January 12, 1933Decided: March 20, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of Louisiana. \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 61]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard B. Warren and Lewell C. Butler, both of Shreveport, La ., for appellants.\n Mr. Elias Goldstein, of Shreveport, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three national banks, located at Shreveport, La.,-the Commercial National, the First National, and the American National-brought, in a district court of that state, separate suits against the Tax Commission and officials of Caddo parish, to annul the assessment of all taxes, other than upon real estate, which had been imposed upon their corporate property for the year 1930, under Louisiana Act No. 14 of 1917, Extra Sess ., as amended by Act No. 116 of 1922 and Act No. 221 of 1928. The claim in each case was that the statute as applied is void, because other moneyed capital employed in the same locality in competition with the capital of the plaintiff is not taxed at all, or is taxed less heavily, in violation of both section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 USCA  548) and the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n The three cases were by agreement consolidated for trial; and were heard upon the same evidence, which in abbreviated form occupies, with the exhibits, 617 pages of the printed record. In each case judgment was entered for the plaintiff; and in each the defendants took a separate appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which reversed the judgments of the trial court. 175 La. 119, 143 So. 23, 28. The plaintiffs appealed to this court; and the defendants moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs had embraced in a single appeal the separate judgments rendered in the three cases. Consideration of that motion was postponed to the argument on the merits. 53 S.Ct. 521, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The argument for dismissal is that the cases had been consolidated below only for the purpose of trial; that since there was no true consolidation of the causes below, and a separate judgment was rendered in each, the separate causes cannot be brought for review to this court by a single appeal. Compare Brown v. Spofford, \n95 \nU.S. 474, 484\n, 485 S.. The record discloses that a complete consolidation of the causes was effected. Not only were the three cases consolidated for trial in the District Court; they were taken to the Supreme Court of the state on a single transcript; were there docketed and argued as one case; and were there disposed of by a single written opinion. The record shows also that a joint petition for a rehearing was filed and likewise disposed of by a single opinion. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\n The claims of invalidity rest upon the following provisions of the Louisiana laws: The real estate of all banking corporations, state or national, is assessed to the corporation at its full value and the shares are assessed to the stockholders at their book value after deducting the value of the real estate. No other tax is laid on the property of a bank. Corporations other than those engaged in banking are taxed by assessing to them all of their prop- \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n erty not exempt from taxation, in the same manner that the property of an individual is assessed to him. The shares of stock in such corporations are not taxed. The discrimination charged is that under these statutes all banking capital is taxed, whereas a large part of the moneyed capital employed in competition with the plaintiffs by nonbanking corporations escapes taxation, wholly or in part, by reason of the following provisions of the local law:\n\n\n (a)\n Article 10,  4, of the Louisiana Constitution, which exempts from taxation:\n'Cash on hand or on deposit; loans or other obligations secured by mortgage on property located exclusively in the State of Louisiana, and the notes or other evidence thereof; loans by life insurance companies to policyholders, secured solely by their policies; loans by homestead associations to their members, secured solely by stock of such associations; debts due for merchandise or other articles of commerce or for services; obligations of the State or its political subdivisions; household property to the value of one thousand dollars; the legal reserve of life insurance companies organized under the laws of this State.'\n\n\n (b)\n Act No. 24 of the Extra Session of 1918, which allows, in the assessment of credits, an offset for accounts payable, bills payable, and other liabilities of a similar character. Act No. 163 of 1924, which provides that bonds of other states and political subdivisions thereof, bonds of railways, railroads, and other public utilities, manufacturing and industrial corporations, and bonds secured by real estate, except such as are exempt from taxation by law, shall be assessed at 10 per cent. of their market value.\n First. It is contended that the statutes violate, on their face, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since banks are taxed more heavily than loan companies, finance and securities companies, pawn- \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n brokers, homestead and building associations, Federal Joint Stock Land Banks, life insurance companies, real estate mortgage and investment, or bond and investment brokers; and that the court must take judicial notice that all of these other corporations lend money in competition with the plaintiffs. That contention is unfounded. If we may take judicial notice of the functions of these alleged competitors of the plaintiffs, there appears ample basis for the classification, among other things, in this: There is a fundamental difference between banks which make loans mainly from money of depositors, and the other financial institutions, which make loans mainly from the money supplied otherwise than by deposits. Compare Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, \n247 \nU.S. 132, 140\n, 141 S., 38 S.Ct. 444; Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 48 S.Ct. 423.\n Second. It is contended that the statute as applied must be held void under section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, since it appears that, during the tax year, moneyed capital was employed by nonbanking corporations in some lines of business in which the plaintiffs are authorized to engage. In other words, it is claimed that inconsistency of the state statutes with section 5219 may be established without proving the fact that the plaintiffs were actually competing, during 1930, in some line of business in which the nonbanking corporations were engaged. The trial court, in rendering judgment for the plaintiffs, approved this contention. But it is unfounded. To establish the invalidity, it is necessary to prove not only that the plaintiffs were empowered by law and authorized by their stockholders to engage in a competitive line of business, but that, during the tax year, moneys of these national banks were in fact employed in substantial amount in some line of business which was carried on, during the year, by less heavily taxed nonbanking concerns. It is as necessary to prove that the \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n bank's capital was so employed as it is to prove that moneyed capital was actually employed by others in substantial competition with the national banks. Compare First National Bank of Garnett v. Ayers, \n160 \nU.S. 660, 667\n, 16 S.Ct. 412; National Bank of Wellington v. Chapman, \n173 U.S. 205\n, 217-219, 19 S.Ct. 407; Georgetown National Bank v. McFarland, \n273 \nU.S. 568\n, 47 S.Ct. 467. For plaintiffs are entitled to the relief against statutes alleged to be unconstitutional only if the statute as applied discriminates injuriously against them. Supervisors of Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 314. It is argued that national banks might conceivably be prevented from engaging in actual competition with other moneyed capital by reason of the very features complained of in the taxing statutes. Compare People ex rel. Pratt v. Goldfogle, 242 N.Y. 277, 302, 151 N.E. 452. But no suggestion is made that such was the situation in the case at bar.\n Third. The contention mainly relied upon is that, upon the evidence, it appears that moneyed capital of the plaintiffs was employed during the tax year in several lines of business in which moneyed capital was also employed by nonbanking corporations; and that the latter were not taxed thereon.\n\n\n (a)\n The item most strenuously urged upon us is that the plaintiffs were engaged in lending money on mortgages of real estate, a line of business in which many mortgage companies, insurance companies, building and loan associations, and individuals were also engaged; and that the latter escaped taxation thereon. The record discloses that each of the banks held real estate mortgages in a substantial amount. But the fact that the banks held mortgages does not prove that they lent money on the security of those mortgages. These may have been taken to secure pre- existing liabilities or as additional security for personal loans. The Supreme Court found: 'The testimony leaves no doubt that there has been no com- \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n petition with the national banks on the part of any concern lending money on mortgages on real estate, because the national banks will never handle such loans.' The record contains evidence ample to support that finding.\n\n\n (b)\n Other items relate to alleged competition of the banks with the capital employed by loan companies, so-called Morris Plan and Morgan Plan companies, and automobile finance companies, in the making of small loans and the financing of purchases of automobiles and household goods. The record shows that the plaintiff banks conducted small-loans departments. But there was evidence to indicate that those to whom the banks granted such loans differed as a class from those who borrowed from the institutions alleged to be competing. The Supreme Court found: 'The small loan companies, complained of in this suit, are those that make loans not exceeding $300, and that are allowed to charge interest at the rate of 3 1\/2 per cent. per month. The loans, as a rule, are secured by chattel mortgages. The testimony of the officers of these companies, and of the officers of the national banks, leaves no doubt that these small loan companies are not competitors of the national, banks. The business of the small loan companies, the same as that of the pawnbrokers, is not in any class of business done by national banks, and is not in competition with any of the business done by national banks. The business of the Morris Plan Company and that of the Morgan Plan Company is the making of small loans, averaging $180, payable out of the borrower's salary. The testimony of the bank officials shows that the business of such companies is not in competition with the business done or desired by the national banks. And that is true of the so-called finance and securities companies, whose business is to lend money on long series of notes given for the price of automobiles, refrigerators, radios, etc., and secured by \n\n[289 U.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n chattel mortgages. The national banks would never handle such business. They prefer to-and do in fact-lend to such companies.' These findings are supported by the record.\n As we should not be warranted in disturbing these, or any of the other, findings of the Supreme Court complained of (compare Georgetown National Bank v. McFarland, \n273 \nU.S. 568\n, 47 S.Ct. 467), we have no occasion to consider an alternative ground urged for affirmance- that the operation of the taxing system of the state resulted, in fact, in substantial equality between bank shares and other moneyed capital.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There was also, in each case, a claim that a small tax had been laid illegally upon the plaintiff's furniture and fixtures. The rights of each plaintiff in this regard were expressly reserved by the decree of the Supreme Court of the state. \n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFUNK v. UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 394\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 371, 372]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Carter, Jr., of Danville, Va., and Charles A.

Her competency to testify against him is not involved.\n The petitioner was twice tried and convicted in a federal District Court upon an indictment for conspiracy to violate the prohibition law. His conviction on the first trial was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon a ground not material here. 46 F.(2d) 417. Upon the second trial, as upon the first, defendant called his wife to testify in his behalf. At both trials she was excluded upon the ground of incompetency. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained this ruling upon the first appeal, and also upon the appeal which followed the second trial. 66 F.(2d) 70. We granted certiorari, limited to the question as to what law is applicable to the determination of the competency of the wife of the petitioner as a witness.\n Both the petitioner and the government, in presenting the case here, put their chief reliance on prior decisions of this court. The government relies on United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263\n, 12 S.Ct. 617; Hendrix v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 79\n, 31 S.Ct. 193, 196; and Jin Fuey Moy \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 189\n, 41 S.Ct. 98. Petitioner contends that these cases, if not directly contrary to the decisions in Benson v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 325\n, 13 S.Ct. 60, and Rosen v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 467\n, 38 S.Ct. 148, 150, are so in principle. We shall first briefly review these cases, with the exception of the Hendrix Case and the Jin Fuey Moy Case, which we leave for consideration until a later point in this opinion.\n In the Reid Case, two persons had been jointly indicted for a murder committed upon the high seas. They were tried separately, and it was held that one of them was not a competent witness in behalf of the other who was first tried. The trial was had in Virginia; and by a statute of that state passed in 1849, if applicable in a federal court, the evidence would have been competent. Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (28 USCA  725) declares that the laws of the several states, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States in cases where they apply; but the court said that this referred only to civil cases, and did not apply in the trial of criminal offenses against the United States. It was conceded that there was no act of Congress prescribing in express words the rule by which the federal courts would be governed in the admission of testimony in criminal cases. 'But,' the court said (page 363 of 12 How.), 'we think it may be found with sufficient certainty, not indeed in direct terms, but by necessary implication, in the acts of 1789 and 1790, establishing the courts of the United States, and providing for the punishment of certain offences.'\n The court pointed out that the Judiciary Act regulated certain proceedings to be had prior to impaneling the jury, but contained no express provision concerning the mode of conducting the trial after the jury was sworn, and prescribed no rule in respect of the testimony to be taken. Obviously, however, it was said, some certain and \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n established rule upon the subject was necessary to enable the courts to administer the criminal jurisprudence of the United States, and Congress must have intended to refer them to some known and established rule 'which was supposed to be so familiar and well understood in the trial by jury that legislation upon the subject would be deemed superfluous. This is necessarily to be implied from what these acts of Congress omit, as well as from what they contain.' Page 365 of 12 How. The court concluded that this could not be the common law as it existed at the time of the emigration of the colonists or the rule which then prevailed in England, and (therefore) the only known rule which could be supposed to have been in the mind of Congress was that which was in force in the respective states when the federal courts were established by the Judiciary Act of 1789. Applying this rule, it was decided that the witness was incompetent.\n In the Logan Case it was held that the competency of a witness to testify in a federal court sitting in one state was not affected by his conviction and sentence for felony in another state; and that the competency of another witness was not affected by his conviction of felony in a Texas state court, where the witness had since been pardoned. The indictment was for an offense committed in Texas and there tried. The decision was based, not upon any statute of the United States, but upon the ground that the subject 'is governed by the common law, which, as has been seen, was the law of Texas ... at the time of the admission of Texas into the Union as a state.' Page 303 of 144 U.S., 12 S.Ct. 617, 630.\n We next consider the two cases upon which petitioner relies. In the Benson Case two persons were jointly indicted for murder. On motion of the government there was a severance, and Benson was first tried. His codefendant was called as a witness on behalf of the government. The Reid Case had been cited as practically de- \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n cisive of the question. But the court, after pointing out what it conceived to be distinguishing features in that case, said (page 335 of 146 U.S., 13 S.Ct. 60, 63): 'We do not feel ourselves, therefore, precluded by that case from examining this question in the light of general authority and sound reason.' The alleged incompetency of the codefendant was rested upon two reasons, first, that he was interested, and, second, that he was a party to the record, the basis for the exclusion at common law being fear of perjury. 'Nor,' the court said, 'were those named the only grounds of exclusion from the witness stand. Conviction of crime, want of religious belief, and other matters were held sufficient. Indeed, the theory of the common law was to admit to the witness stand only those presumably honest, appreciating the sanctity of an oath, unaffected as a party by the result, and free from any of the temptations of interest. The courts were afraid to trust the intelligence of jurors. But the last 50 years have wrought a great change in these respects, and today the tendency is to enlarge the domain of competency, and to submit to the jury for their consideration as to the credibility of the witness those matters which heretofore were ruled sufficient to justify his exclusion. This change has been wrought partially by legislation and partially by judicial construction.' Attention then is called to the fact that Congress in 1864 had enacted that no witness should be excluded from testifying in any civil action, with certain exceptions, because he was a party to or interested in the issue tried; and that in 1878 (c. 37, 20 Stat. 30 (28 USCA  632)) Congress made the defendant in any criminal case a competent witness at his own request. The opinion then continues (page 337 of 146 U.S., 13 S.Ct. 60, 64):\n'Legislation of similar import prevails in most of the states. The spirit of this legislation has controlled the decisions of the courts, and steadily, one by one, the merely technical barriers which excluded witnesses from the stand have been removed, till now it is generally, \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n though perhaps not universally, true that no one is excluded therefrom unless the lips of the originally adverse party are closed by death, or unless some one of those peculiarly confidential relations, like that of husband and wife, forbids the breaking of silence.\n\n'... If interest and being party to the record do not exclude a defendant on trial from the witness stand, upon what reasoning can a codefendant, not on trial, be adjudged incompetent?'\n\n That case was decided December 5, 1892. Twenty-five years later this court had before it for consideration the case of Rosen v. United States, supra. Rosen had been tried and convicted in a federal District Court for conspiracy. A person jointly indicted with Rosen, who had been convicted upon his plea of guilty, was called as a witness by the government and allowed to testify over Rosen's objection. This court sustained the competency of the witness. After saying that, while the decision in the Reid Case had not been specifically overruled, its authority was seriously shaken by the decisions in both the Logan and Benson Cases, the court proceeded to dispose of the question, as it had been disposed of in the Benson Case, 'in the light of general authority and of sound reason.'\n'In the almost twenty (twenty-five) years,' the court said, 'which have elapsed since the decision of the Benson Case, the disposition of courts and of legislative bodies to remove disabilities from witnesses has continued, as that decision shows it had been going forward before, under dominance of the conviction of our time that the truth is more likely to be arrived at by hearing the testimony of all persons of competent understanding who may seem to have knowledge of the facts involved in a case, leaving the credit and weight of such testimony to be determined by the jury or by the court, rather than by rejecting witnesses as incompetent, with \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n the result that this principle has come to be widely, almost universally, accepted in this country and in Great Britain.\n\n'Since the decision in the Benson Case we have significant evidence of the trend of congressional opinion upon this subject in the removal of the disability of witnesses convicted of perjury, Rev. St.  5392, by the enactment of the federal Criminal Code in 1909 with this provision omitted and section 5392 repealed. This is significant, because the disability to testify, of persons convicted of perjury, survived in some jurisdictions much longer than many of the other common-law disabilities, for the reason that the offense concerns directly the giving of testimony in a court of justice, and conviction of it was accepted as showing a greater disregard for the truth than it was thought should be implied from a conviction of other crime.\n\n'Satisfied as we are that the legislation and the very great weight of judicial authority which have developed in support of this modern rule, especially as applied to the competency of witnesses convicted of crime, proceed upon sound principle, we conclude that the dead hand of the common- law rule of 1789 should no longer be applied to such cases as we have here, and that the ruling of the lower courts on this first claim of error should be approved.'\n\n It is well to pause at this point to state a little more concisely what was held in these cases. It will be noted, in the first place, that the decision in the Reid Case was not based upon any express statutory provision. The court found from what the congressional legislation omitted to say, as well as from what it actually said, that in establishing the federal courts in 1789 some definite rule in respect of the testimony to be taken in criminal cases must have been in the mind of Congress; and the rule which the court thought was in the mind of that body was that of the common law as it existed in the thirteen original \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 379]\n\u00a0\n states in 1789. The Logan Case in part rejected that view, and held that the controlling rule was that of the common law in force at the time of the admission of the state in which the particular trial was had. Taking the two cases together, it is plain enough that the ultimate doctrine announced is that, in the taking of testimony in criminal cases, the federal courts are bound by the rules of the common law as they existed at a definitely specified time in the respective states, unless Congress has otherwise provided.\n With the conclusion that the controlling rule is that of the common law, the Benson Case and the Rosen Case do not conflict; but both cases reject the notion, which the two earlier ones seem to accept, that the courts, in the face of greatly changed conditions, are still chained to the ancient formulae and are powerless to declare and enforce modifications deemed to have been wrought in the common law itself by force of these changed conditions. Thus, as we have seen, the court in the Benson Case pointed to the tendency during the preceding years to enlarge the domain of competency, significantly saying that the changes had been wrought not only by legislation but also 'partially by judicial construction'; and that it was the spirit (not the letter be it observed) of this legislation which had controlled the decisions of the courts and steadily removed the merely technical barriers in respect of incompetency, until generally no one was excluded from giving testimony, except under certain peculiar conditions which are set forth. It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the specific ground upon which the court there rested its determination as to the competency of a codefendant was that, since the defendant had been rendered competent, the competency of the codefendant followed as a natural consequence.\n This view of the matter is made more positive by the decision in the Rosen Case. The question of the testi- \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n monial competency of a person jointly indicted with the defendant was disposed of, as the question had been in the Benson Case, 'in the light of general authority and of sound reason.' The conclusion which the court reached was based, not upon any definite act of legislation, but upon the trend of congressional opinion and of legislation (that is to say of legislation generally), and upon the great weight of judicial authority which, since the earlier decisions, had developed in support of a more modern rule. In both cases the court necessarily proceeded upon the theory that the resultant modification which these important considerations had wrought in the rules of the old common law was within the power of the courts to declare and make operative.\n That the present case falls within the principles of the Benson and Rosen Cases, and especially of the latter, we think does not reasonably admit of doubt.\n The rules of the common law which disqualified as witnesses persons having an interest long since in the main have been abolished both in England and in this country; and what was once regarded as a sufficient ground for excluding the testimony of such persons altogether has come to be uniformly and more sensibly regarded as affecting the credit of the witness only. Whatever was the danger that an interested witness would not speak the truth-and the danger never was as great as claimed-its effect has been minimized almost to the vanishing point by the test of cross- examination, the increased intelligence of jurors, and perhaps other circumstances. The modern rule which has removed the disqualification from persons accused of crime gradually came into force after the middle of the last century, and is to-day universally accepted. The exclusion of the husband or wife is said by this court to be based upon his or her interest in the event. Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, supra. And whether by this is meant a practical interest in the result of the prosecution \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 381]\n\u00a0\n or merely a sentimental interest because of the marital relationship makes little difference. In either case, a refusal to permit the wife upon the ground of interest to testify in behalf of her husband, while permitting him, who has the greater interest, to testify for himself, presents a manifest incongruity.\n Nor can the exclusion of the wife's testimony, in the face of the broad and liberal extension of the rules in respect of the competency of witnesses generally, be any longer justified, if it ever was justified, on any ground of public policy. It has been said that to admit such testimony is against public policy because it would endanger the harmony and confidence of marital relations, and, moreover, would subject the witness to the temptation to commit perjury. Modern legislation, in making either spouse competent to testify in behalf of the other in criminal cases, has definitely rejected these notions, and in the light of such legislation and of modern thought they seem to be altogether fanciful. The public policy of one generation may not, under changed conditions, be the public policy of another. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 306\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263.\n The fundamental basis upon which all rules of evidence must rest-if they are to rest upon reason-is their adaptation to the successful development of the truth. And, since experience is of all teachers the most dependable, and since experience also is a continuous process, it follows that a rule of evidence at one time thought necessary to the ascertainment of truth should yield to the experience of a succeeding generation whenever that experience has clearly demonstrated the fallacy or unwisdom of the old rule.\n It may be said that the court should continue to enforce the old rule, however contrary to modern experience and thought, and however opposed, in principle, to the general current of legislation and of judicial opinion it may \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 382]\n\u00a0\n have become, leaving to Congress the responsibility of changing it. Of course, Congress has that power; but, if Congress fail to act, as it has failed in respect of the matter now under review, and the court be called upon to decide the question, is it not the duty of the court, if it possess the power, to decide it in accordance with present-day standards of wisdom and justice rather than in accordance with some outworn and antiquated rule of the past? That this court has the power to do so is necessarily implicit in the opinions delivered in deciding the Benson and Rosen Cases. And that implication, we think, rests upon substantial ground. The rule of the common law which denies the competency of one spouse to testify in behalf of the other in a criminal prosecution has not been modified by congressional legislation; nor has Congress directed the federal courts to follow state law upon that subject, as it has in respect of some other subjects. That this court and the other federal courts, in this situation and by right of their own powers, may decline to enforce the ancient rule of the common law under conditions as they now exist, we think is not fairly open to doubt.\n In Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 530\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 118, 28 L. Ed.232, this court, after suggesting that it was better not to go too far back into antiquity for the best securities of our liberties, said:\n'It is more consonant to the true philosophy of our historical legal institutions to say that the spirit of personal liberty and individual right, which they embodied, was preserved and developed by a progressive growth and wise adaptation to new circumstances and situations of the forms and processes found fit to give, from time to time, new expression and greater effect to modern ideas of self-government.\n\n'This flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation is the peculiar boast and excellence of the common law. \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 383]\n\u00a0\n ... And as it was the characteristic principle of the common law to draw its inspiration from every fountation of justice, we are not to assume that the sources of its supply have been exhausted. On the contrary, we should expect that the new and various experiences of our own situation and system will mould and shape it into new and not less useful forms.'\n\n Compare Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 385-387, 18 S.Ct. 383.\n To concede this capacity for growth and change in the common law by drawing 'its inspiration from every fountain of justice,' and at the same time to say that the courts of this country are forever bound to perpetuate such of its rules as, by every reasonable test, are found to be neither wise nor just, because we have once adopted them as suited to our situation and institutions at a particular time, is to deny to the common law in the place of its adoption a 'flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation' which was 'the peculiar boast and excellence' of the system in the place of its origin.\n The final question to which we are thus brought is not that of the power of the federal courts to amend or repeal any given rule or principle of the common law, for they neither have nor claim that power, but it is the question of the power of these courts, in the complete absence of congressional legislation on the subject, to declare and effectuate, upon common-law principles, what is the present rule upon a given subject in the light of fundamentally altered conditions, without regard to what has previously been declared and practiced. It has been said so often as to have become axiomatic that the common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions. In Ketelsen v. Stilz, 184 Ind. 702, 111 N.E. 423, L.R.A. 1918D, 303, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 965, the Supreme Court of that state, after pointing out that the common law of England was based upon usages, customs, and institutions of the English \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 384]\n\u00a0\n people as declared from time to time by the courts, said (page 707, of 184 Ind., 111 N.E. 423, 425):\n'The rules so deduced from this system, however, were continually changing and expanding with the progress of society in the application of this system to more diversified circumstances and under more advanced periods. The common law by its own principles adapted itself to varying conditions and modified its own rules so as to serve the ends of justice as prompted by a course of reasoning which was guided by these generally accepted truths. One of its oldest maxims was that where the reason of a rule ceased the rule also ceased, and it logically followed that when it occurred to the courts that a particular rule had never been founded upon reason, and that no reason existed in support thereof, that rule likewise ceased, and perhaps another sprang up in its place which was based upon reason and justice as then conceived. No rule of the common law could survive the reason on which it was founded. It needed no statute to change it but abrogated itself.'\n\n That court then refers to the settled doctrine that an adoption of the common law in general terms does not require, without regard to local circumstances, an unqualified application of all its rules; that the rules, as declared by the English courts at one period or another, have been controlling in this country only so far as they were suited to and in harmony with the genius, spirit, and objects of American institutions: and that the rules of the common law considered proper in the eighteenth century are not necessarily so considered in the twentieth. 'Since courts have had an existence in America,' that court said (page 708 of 184 Ind., 111 N.E. 423, 425), 'they have never hesitated to take upon themselves the responsibility of saying what are the proper rules of the common law.'\n And the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, in Hanriot v. Sherwood, 82 Va. 1, 15, after pointing to the fact that \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 385]\n\u00a0\n the common law of England is the law of that commonwealth except so far as it has been altered by statute, or so far as its principles are inapplicable to the state of the country, and that the rules of the common law had undergone modification in the courts of England, notes with obvious approval that 'the rules of evidence have been in the courts of this country undergoing such modification and changes, according to the circumstances of the country and the manner and genius of the people.'\n The Supreme Court of Connecticut, in Beardsley v. City of Hartford, 50 Conn. 529, 542, 47 Am.Rep. 677, after quoting the maxim of the common law, cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex, said:\n'This means that no law can survive the reasons on which it is founded. It needs no statute to change it; it abrogates itself. If the reasons on which a law rests are overborne by opposing reasons, which in the progress of society gain a controlling force, the old law, though still good as an abstract principle, and good in its application to some circumstances, must cease to apply as a controlling principle to the new circumstances.'\n\n The same thought is expressed in People v. Randolph, 2 Parker, Cr. R. ( N.Y.) 174, 177:\n'Its rules (the rules of the common law) are modified upon its own principles and not in violation of them. Those rules being founded in reason, one of its oldest maxims is, that where the reason of the rule ceases the rule also ceases.'\n\n It was in virtue of this maxim of the common law that the Supreme Court of Nevada, in Reno Smelting Works v. Stevenson, 20 Nev. 269, 21 P. 317, 4 L.R.A. 60, 19 Am.St.Rep. 364, in a well-reasoned opinion, held that the common-law doctrine of riparian rights was unsuited to conditions prevailing in the arid land states and territories of the West, and therefore was without force in Nevada; and that, in respect of the use of water, the applicable rule was based upon the doctrine of prior appropriation for a beneficial use. \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 386]\n\u00a0\n In Illinois it was held at an early day that the rule of the common law which required an owner of cattle to keep them upon his own land was not in force in that state, notwithstanding its adoption of the common law of England, being unsuited to conditions there in view of the extensive areas of land which had been left open and unfenced and devoted to grazing purposes. Seeley v. Peters, 5 Gilman (Ill.) 130.\n Numerous additional state decisions to the same effect might be cited; but it seems unnecessary to pursue the matter at greater length.\n It results from the foregoing that the decision of the court below, in holding the wife incompetent, is erroneous. But that decision was based primarily upon Hendrix v. United States and Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, supra, and in fairness to the lower court it should be said that its decision was fully supported by those cases.\n In the Hendrix Case the opinion does not discuss the point; it simply recites the assignment of error to the effect that the wife of Hendrix had not been allowed to testify in his behalf, and dismisses the matter by the laconic statement, 'The ruling was not error.' In the Jin Fuey Moy Case it was conceded at the bar that the wife was not a competent witness for all purposes, but it was contended that her testimony was admissible in that instance because she was offered, not in behalf of her husband, that is, not to prove his innocence, but simply to contradict the testimony of government witnesses who had testified to certain matters as having transpired in her presence. The court held the distinction to be without substance, as clearly it was, and thereupon disposed of the question by saying that the rule which excludes a wife from testifying for her husband is based upon her interest in the event, and applies without regard to the kind of testimony she might give. The point does not seem to have been considered by the lower court to which the writ of error was addressed ((D. C.) 253 F. 213); nor, as plainly appears, was the real point as it is here involved presented \n\n[290 U.S. 371, 387]\n\u00a0\n in this court. The matter was disposed of as one 'hardly requiring mention.' Evidently the point most in the mind of the court was the distinction relied upon, and not the basic rule which was not contested. Both the Hendrix and Jin Fuey Moy Cases are out of harmony with the Rosen and Benson Cases and with the views which we have here expressed. In respect of the question here under review, both are now overruled.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the judgment of the court below is right and should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFUNKHOUSER v. J. B. PRESTON CO.(1933)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 163, 164]\n\u00a0\n Appeal from the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.\n Mr. George Link, Jr., of New York City, for appellants. \n\n[290 U.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jeremiah A. O'Leary, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 480 of the Civil Practice Act of New York, as amended by chapter 623 of the Laws of 1927, provides for the allowance of interest on the principal sum awarded by verdict, report, or decision for breach of contract whether the principal sum so awarded was 'theretofore liquidated or unliquidated.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This action was brought for breach of a contract, made in 1923, for the sale by appellee to appellants of red slate granules to be delivered in agreed quantities in that year and in the three years following. The trial, in 1930, resulted in a verdict for appellee, to the amount of which interest was added pursuant to the statute. On appeal, the Appellate Division struck out the allowance of interest as not permissible with respect to a claim arising before the statute was enacted. 235 App.Div. 200, 256 N.Y.S. 681. The Court of Appeals entertained the question presented under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (art. 1,  10) and decided that the allowance of interest did not impair the obligation of the contract. 261 N.Y. 140, 184 N.E. 737, 739. The court directed that the item of interest be restored, and from the judgment entered accordingly this appeal is taken. \n\n[290 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n The claim in suit was admittedly for unliquidated damages. There was no provision in the contract with respect to the recovery of interest in case of breach, that is, either for or against such recovery. Thus, the terms of the contract did not in themselves, and apart from the applicable law, create an obligation not to demand interest. The opinion of the Court of Appeals shows that at the time of the making of the contract the law of New York was not clear and certain as to the allowance of interest, citing White v. Miller, 78 N.Y. 393, 397, 34 Am.Rep. 544; Faber v. New York, 222 N.Y. 255, 262, 118 N.E. 609, 610; Blackwell v. Finlay, 233 N.Y. 361, 135 N. E. 600; Prager v. N. J. Fidelity & Plate Glass Ins. Co., 245 N.Y. 1, 7, 156 N.E. 76, 52 A.L.R. 193. The court quoted the statement made in the year 1918 in Faber v. New York, supra, as follows:\n'The question of the allowance of interest on unliquidated damages has been a difficult one. The rule on this subject has been in evolution. To-day, however, it may be said that if a claim for damages represents a pecuniary loss, which may be ascertained with reasonable certainty as of a fixed day, then interest is allowed from that day. The test is not whether the demand is liquidated. Was the plaintiff entitled to a certain sum? Should the defendant have paid it? Could the latter have determined what was due, either by computations alone or by computation in connection with established market values, or other generally recognized standards?'\n\n'This,' said the court in the instant case, 'was the somewhat vague and indefinite law of the state of New York' at the time the parties entered into their contract. The court added that 'it has never been held to be a part of the obligation of the contract that no interest should be allowed on unliquidated demands. ... The amendment to section 480 of the Civil Practice Act changes a rule of the common law but it conflicts with no constitutional guaranty. It prevents an escape through pro- \n\n[290 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n cedural difficulties from the real obligation to make full compensation for breach of contract. ... The rule of law was that if the defendant could not determine on any fixed day what was due, no interest could be recoverable because defendant knew not what, if anything, he should pay. That was a rule of convenience, not an agreement to forego interest. The implied obligation of the contract was to pay interest in accordance with the rules of law existing when the case was tried.'\n\n While it is the duty of this Court, where the contract clause is invoked, to determine for itself what the contract is and whether it has been impaired, 2 we find nothing requiring us to reach a conclusion different from that of the Court of Appeals. The statute in question concrns the remedy and does not disturb the obligations of the contract. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 200; League v. Texas, \n184 \nU.S. 156, 158\n, 22 S.Ct. 475; Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 U.S. 595\n, 601-603, 23 S.Ct. 345, 348; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 530\n, 27 S.Ct. 755; Henley v. Myers, \n215 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 30 S.Ct. 148. Compare Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, \n285 \nU.S. 467, 474\n, 52 S.Ct. 430. The contractual obligation of appellants was to take and pay for the described articles, and the law, in force when the contract was made, required that in case of breach appellants should make good the loss sustained by the appellee. The ascertainment of that loss, and of what would constitute full compensation, was a matter of procedure within the range of due process in the enforcement of the contract. 'To enact laws providing remedies for a violation of contracts' and 'to alter or enlarge those remedies from time to time,' was within the competency of the Legislature. Waggoner v. Flack, supra. The mere fact \n\n[290 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n that such legislation is retroactive does not bring it into conflict with the guarantees of the Federal Constitution (League v. Texas, supra, page 161 of 184 U.S., 22 S.Ct. 475), and when the action of the Legislature is directed to the enforcement of the obligations assumed by the parties and to the giving of suitable relief for nonperformance, it cannot be said that the obligations of the contract have been impaired. The parties make their contract with reference to the existence of the power of the state to provide remedies for enforcement and to secure adequate redress in case of breach. Henley v. Myers, supra.\n Without attempting to review the numerous, and not harmonious decisions upon the allowance of interest in the case of unliquidated claims,3 it is sufficient to say that the subject is an appropriate one for that the subject is an appropriate one for legislative action in order to provide a definite rule. The statutory allowance is for the purpose of securing a more adequate compensation by adding an amount commonly viewed as a reasonable measure of the loss sustained through delay in payment. It has been recognized that a distinction, in this respect, simply as between cases of liquidated and unliquidated damages, is not a sound one. \n4\n Whether the case is of the one class or the other, the injured party has suffered a loss which may be regarded as not fully compensated if he is confined to the amount found to be recoverable as of the time of breach and nothing is added for the delay in obtaining the award of damages. Because of this fact, the rule with respect to unliquidated claims has been in evolution ( Faber v. New York, supra), and in the absence of legislation the courts have dealt with the question of allowing interest according to \n\n[290 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n their conception of the demands of justice and practicality. Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 258\n, 45 S.Ct. 73. 'The disinclination to allow interest on claim of uncertain amount seems based on practice rather than theoretical grounds.' Williston on Contracts, vol. 3,  1413. Whether there shall be a definite rule is a matter within the legislative discretion, as is that of providing for interest upon judgments. Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., \n146 \nU.S. 162, 168\n, 13 S.Ct. 54; Missouri & Arkansas Co. v. Greenwood Dist. of Sebastian County, \n249 \nU.S. 170, 173\n, 39 S. s.Ct. 202.\n The decisive point in the instant case is that the provision for the enlarged remedy was consistent with the substantial rights of the parties under their contract and cannot be regarded as an unreasonable exercise of legislative power.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision is: 'In every action now pending or hereafter brought wherein any sum of money shall be awarded by verdict, report or decision upon a cause of action for the enforcement of or based upon breach of performance of a contract, express or implied, other than a contract to marry, interest shall be recovered upon the principal sum whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated and shall be added to and be a part of the total sum awarded.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Jefferson Branch Bank v.

OKLAHOMA CITY(1933)\nNo. 547\nArgued: March 15, 1933Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma. \n\n[289 U.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Twyford and J. H. Everest, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Harlan T. Deupree, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bill of complaint alleges that plaintiffs (appellants here) are lessees of a tract of land in Oklahoma City, State of Oklahoma, supposed to contain gas and oil; that by the terms of the lease they are required to commence drilling a well within a time fixed; that they have contracted for such drilling and the work has been begun and is now in progress; that they have a permit from the authorities of the city as required by ordinance, but defendants threaten to and will forcibly stop the work, to plaintiffs' irreparable damage, unless they execute and file a bond conditioned as provided by the city ordinance in the penal sum of $200,000, signed by some surety company authorized to transact business within the state; that the ordinance making such requirement is unreasonable and unconstitutional, and if enforced will have the effect of depriving plaintiffs of valuable property rights without due process of law. An answer was filed denying generally the allegations of the bill, and a cross-petition, \n\n[289 U.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n praying that plaintiffs be restrained from continuing the drilling of the well until plaintiffs had executed the bond required by the ordinance. After a hearing, at which evidence was introduced in support of the bill, the trial court denied plaintiffs' prayer for an injunction and granted a permanent injunction against them upon the cross-petition.\n The bill does not in terms charge an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment or of any other provision of the federal Constitution; and the record does not disclose whether the trial court at any time considered or determined that question. Nor is there anything in the present record to show, except inferentially, that the federal question was raised by appellants or considered by the Supreme Court. A basis for our jurisdiction must be found, if at all, in the decision and opinion of the state Supreme Court upon a prior appeal in the same case from a decree granting an interlocutory injunction. Gant v. Oklahoma City, 150 Okl. 86, 89, 6 P.(2d) 1065. It there appears that an attack upon the ordinance as infringing the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was argued before and considered by that court, and the ordinance sustained as valid under that clause as well as under the due process clause of the state Constitution. An appeal to this court followed but was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction, the decree not being final. \n284 \nU.S. 594\n, 52 S. Ct. 203. After the remand to the state court of first instance, final decree on the merits was rendered against appellants. From that decree an appeal was taken to the state Supreme Court, which affirmed on the authority of its prior decision. 15 P.(2d) 833. In effect, the earlier decision was thereby read into, and made a part of, the later one. Appellants, by this appeal, therefore, have invoked the jurisdiction of this court at the first opportunity open to them, and the federal question, having been considered by the state Supreme Court, is properly here.

McCabe, \n213 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 29 S.Ct. 430.\n The ordinance, so far as pertinent, provides that no well shall be drilled within the limits of the city until there shall be filed with the city clerk a bond in the sum of $200,000 covering each well, executed by 'some bonding or indemnity company authorized to do business in the State of Oklahoma,' conditioned for the payment of damages on account of injuries to property, bodily injuries, etc., suffered by any one and resulting from the drilling, operation or maintenance of any well or any structures, etc., appurtenant thereto.\n In view of the peculiar dangers incident to the drilling and operation of an oil or gas well within the limits of a city and of the large interest involved if the well be successful, neither the requirement for a bond nor the amount fixed can be declared arbitrary or unreasonable. Indeed, the objection to the ordinance on these grounds was but indifferently urged at the bar. The point stressed was that the provision of the ordinance requiring the bond to be given by a bonding or indemnity company authorized to do business in the state, and thereby excluding the furnishing of personal sureties, is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to constitute a denial of due process of law. That contention also is without merit. The most that can be said is that whether the guaranty of a bonding or indemnity company operating under state law and subject to state regulation, is of greater worth than that of personal sureties, is a question about which opinions reasonably may differ. But the question is one primarily addressed to the judgment of the law-making body, and that body having determined that the former is so far superior that the latter should be excluded from eligibility altogether, there is nothing in the due \n\n[289 U.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which requires the courts to upset the conclusion. 'While the courts must exercise a judgment of their own, it by no means is true that every law is void which may seem to the judges who pass upon it excessive, unsuited to its ostensible end, or based upon conceptions of morality with which they disagree. Considerable latitude must be allowed for differences of view, as well as for possible peculiar conditions which this court can know but imperfectly, it at all.' Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 608\n, 609 S., 23 S.Ct. 168, 170.\n Whether the judgment of the common council of the city in the present case was wise, or whether the requirement will produce hardship in particular instances, are matters with which this court has nothing to do. It is impossible for us to say that the provisions of the ordinance are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. It there be room for fair debate, this court 'will not substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body charged with the primary duty and responsibility of determining the question.' Zahn v. Bd. of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 594, 595; Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S.Ct. 430.\n There is evidence in the record tending to show that conditions were imposed by surety companies of an onerous character, with which appellants were unable to comply. But it also appears that other operators within the city limits were able to comply with all conditions imposed and had procured and filed bonds in accordance with the ordinance. So far as the record discloses, appellants stood alone in their inability to satisfy the requirements of the bonding companies. The fact that appellants, for reasons peculiar to themselves, could not meet the imposed requirements, does not militate against the constitutionality of the ordinance. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 145\n, 44 S.Ct. 257; Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, supra, at page 586 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 430; Hodge Co. v.

An otherwise valid statute or \n\n[289 U.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n ordinance conferring a privilege, is not rendered invalid merely because it chances that particular persons find it hard or even impossible to comply with precedent conditions upon which enjoyment of the privilege is made to depend.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGE A.

Lowell and a jury, respondent obtained judgments, and petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The records on the appeals contained what purported to be bills of exceptions signed by the attorneys for the respective parties and initialed by the District Judge as follows: 'Allowed August 20, 1930, J.A.L., D.J.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments upon the sole ground that the bills of exceptions were not sufficiently authenticated, and that it was too late to send the cases back for amendment, as the term for which the judgments were entered had expired and the District Court had lost jurisdiction. 57 F.(2d) 44. This Court granted certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 586\n, 53 S.Ct. 80, 77 L.Ed. --. \n\n[288 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n There is no question that District Judge Lowell affixed his initials to the bills of exceptions and intended in this manner to authenticate them as allowed. Apparently, in connection with petitioner's application for a rehearing in the Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Lowell addressed a communication to the judges of that court stating that the bills had been seasonably presented to him, and that he had signed them with his initials intending that they should have full legal effect; he requested that the bills should be returned to him for correction. \n1\n There was also submitted to the Circuit Court of Appeals a certificate by the clerk of the District Court in which it was stated: 'It has been the practice in this district for a long time for judges, the clerk and deputy clerks and the bar to treat as sufficiently allowed for appellate purposes bills of exceptions signed by the trial judge with either his full name or his initials.' The petition for rehearing was denied.\n Under the statute of Westminster 2, 13 Edw. I, ch. 31, it was essential that exceptions should be authenticated by the seal of the trial justice. Enfield v. Hills, 2 Lev. 236; 2 Inst. 427, 428; 2 Bac. Abr., 326, 327; 2 Tidd's Pr., 789; Nalle v. Oyster, \n230 \nU.S. 165, 176\n, 33 S.Ct. 1043; Krauss Bros.

In the practice of the federal courts, however, it was held that a seal was unnecessary; the signature of the trial judge being sufficient Generes v. Campbell, 11 Wall. 193, 198; Herbert v. Butler, \n97 U.S. 319\n, 320. Compare Mussina v. Cavazos, 6 Wall. 355, 363; Young v. Martin, 8 Wall. 354, 357. The Act of June 1, 1872, c. 255,  4 (17 Stat. 197, R.S.  953) expressly dispensed with the necessity of a seal, but retained the requirement of the signature of the judge of the court in which the cause was tried. Herbert v. Butler, supra; Malony v. Adsit, \n175 \nU.S. 281, 286\n, 287 S., 20 S.Ct. 115; Krauss Bros. Co. v. Mellon, supra. As amended by the Act of June 5, 1900, c. 717 (31 Stat. 270, 28 U.S.C.  776 (28 USCA  776)), the statute provides for the signature of another judge of the court in certain contingencies. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n The statute does not prescribe the form of signature. The manifest purpose is authentication by the proper judge. In the absence of such authentication there is no bill of exceptions which the appellate court may consider. Malony v. Adsit, supra; Metropolitan Railroad Co. v. District of Columbia, \n195 \nU.S. 322, 330\n, 25 S.Ct. 28; McCuing v. Bovay (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 375, 376. Compare Christy v. Pridgeon, 4 Wall. 196, 201, 202. Appropriate disapproval of the practice of signing by initials such important documents as bills of exceptions, and insistence upon a method of signature more in keeping with the formal character of the proceeding, do not reach the question now presented. That question is not whether the signature is informal, but whether there is a signature. If the attempted authentication by Judge Lowell be deemed to be merely informal or irregular, but not a nullity, the defect could be disregarded or cured by amendment. R.S.  954, 28 U.S. C.  777 (28 USCA  777). See, also, 28 U.S.C.  391 (28 USCA  391). Thus, in Idaho & Oregon Land Co. v. Bradbury, \n132 \nU.S. 509\n, 10 S.Ct. 177, the clerk of the court below in attempting to authenticate the record had appended the seal of the court but had failed to comply with the rule of this court in affixing his signature. The court said (page 513 of \n132 U.S. 10\n S.Ct. 177, 178): 'The question presented is not one of no authentication, but of irregular or imperfect authentication; not of jurisdiction, but of practice. It is therefore within the discretion of this court to allow the defect to be supplied.' And as it appeared to be then 'too late to take a new appeal or writ of error,' the court permitted the record to be withdrawn 'for the purpose of having the certificate of authentication perfected by adding the signature of the clerk.' A defect or inaccuracy in mere matters of form can be corrected, notwithstanding the end of the term. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, 35 S.Ct. 16.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals felt constrained to reach its conclusion, that the attempted authentication was a nullity, by reason of the decisions of this Court in Origet \n\n[288 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n125 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 244 S., 8 S.Ct. 846, 848, and Kinney v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n222 \nU.S. 283, 284\n, 32 S.Ct. 101, 102. Neither of these decisions is strictly in point. In the Origet Case, at the foot of a paper entitled 'Bill of Exceptions,' appeared the following: 'Allowed and ordered on file November 22, '83. A.B.' Referring to the Act of 1872 (R.S.  953) the court said: 'This provision merely dispensed with the seal. The necessity for the signature still remains. We cannot regard the initials 'A.B.' as the signature of the judge, or as a sufficient authentication of the bill of exceptions, or as sufficient evidence of its allowance by the judge or the court. Therefore the questions purporting to be raised by the paper cannot be considered.' In the Kinney Case, the record did not contain any bill of exceptions. There was a paper styled 'Exceptions to the Charge to Jury,' which was initialed 'J. B. McP., Trial Judge,' and signed by the plaintiff. The court said that this paper was 'not a bill of exceptions,' citing the Origet Case, but the court added that 'if it were to be treated as a bill of exceptions' it could not avail, as all the matters in question depended upon 'examination of the evidence, which is not in the record,' and hence the court had 'no means of determining whether reversible error arose from an action of the court on any of the subjects to which the paper refers.' Thus, in the Kinney Case, the present question was not necessarily involved, and in the Origet Case the court was unable to regard the initials as to signature of the judge. In the instant case, it appears that the trial judge did affix his initials in order to authenticate the bills of exceptions, and he added the initials 'D.J.' for the obvious purpose of referring to his office and characterizing his action as official. So far as the statements in the opinions of the Origet and Kinney Cases may be taken to imply that such an authentication by the trial judge is void and that bills of exceptions so allowed cannot be consid- \n\n[288 U.S. 170, 176]\n\u00a0\n ered, or the informality be corrected, the statements are not approved.\n The statute contains no indication that the word 'sign' is used in other than the ordinary sense. The statute gives neither definition nor qualification. Signature by initials has been held to be sufficient under the Statute of Frauds3 and the Statute of Wills, and in other transactions. 4 It has been held in some states5 that a different rule obtains in the case of the official signature of certain judicial officers, but the Congress has not established such a rule for the judges of the federal courts. Nor, in the absence of special statutory requirement, is there a uniform custom in relation to official signatures. It may be assumed that a requirement of the officer's signature, without more, means that he shall write his name or his distinctive appellation; but the question remains as to what writing of that character is to be deemed sufficient for the purpose of authenticating his official act. There is no rule that he shall adhere to the precise form of his name as it appears in his commission. The full name of \n\n[288 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n the officer may or may not be used. Not infrequently christian names are omitted, in part or altogether, or are abbreviated or indicated by initials. In some of the most important communications on behalf of the federal government, only the surname of the officer is used. When an officer authenticates his official act by affixing his initials he does not entirely omit to use his name; he simply abbreviates it; he uses a combination of letters which are part of it. Undoubtedly that method is informal, but we think that it is clearly a method of 'signing.' It cannot be said in such a case that he has utterly failed to 'sign,' so that his authentication of his official act, in the absence of further statutory requirement, is to be regarded as absolutely void.\n We do not approve the signing of bills of exceptions merely by the initials of the judge, but we regard the question as one of practice; of regularity, not of validity. In the instant cases, the District Judge authenticated his allowance of the bills of exceptions by a form of signature easily and actually identified as his. No one was misled or injured. We perceive no reason why petitioner should lose its right to have the rulings upon the trial appropriately reviewed by the appellate court, merely because the District Judge failed to sign his full name. This is precisely the sort of defect which the Congress has provided shall not impair the substantial rights of the parties. 28 U.S.C.  391 (28 USCA  391). At most, in the interest of a better practice, the bills of exceptions could have been returned for a more formal signature; but even that course was not necessary.\n The judgments are reversed, and the causes are remanded to the Circuit court of Appeals for hearing upon the merits.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] District Judge Lowell's communication contained the following:\n'It has been called to my attention that I signed the bills of exceptions in the above two cases with my initials only instead of with my full signature. They were seasonably presented to me for allowance and I told counsel for the Appellant presenting them, after examination of them, that I allowed them, did nothing more with respect to them in counsel's presence and counsel departed. I later signed them intending so to sign them that they should have their full intended legal effect but not knowing any better I signed them only with my initials; that was my personal mistake to which neither the Appellant nor its counsel in any way contributed. I desire if I have the power and your permission now to correct my personal inadvertence by completing my signature so that my allowance of each bill may have my full signature and as of August 20, 1930. I therefore request, so far as I properly may, that the record be returned to the District Court for such correction by me as now within my power to make.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 953 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1900, c. 717, 31 Stat. 270, 28 U.S.C.  776 (28 USCA  776), provides:\n'A bill of exceptions allowed in any cause shall be deemed sufficiently authenticated if signed by the judge of the court in which the cause was tried, or by the presiding judge thereof if more than one judge sat at the trial of the cause, without any seal of the court or judge annexed thereto. And in case the judge before whom the cause has heretofore been or may hereafter be tried is, by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, unable to hear and pass upon the motion for a new trial and allow and sign said bill of exceptions, then the judge who succeeds such trial judge, or any other judge of the court in which the cause was tried, holding such court thereafter, if the evidence in such cause has been or is taken in stenographic notes, or if the said judge is satisfied by any other means that he can pass upon such motion and allow a true bill of exceptions, shall pass upon said motion and allow and sign such bill of exceptions, and his ruling upon such motion and allowance and signing of such bill of exceptions shall be as valid as if such ruling and allowance and signing of such bill of exceptions had been made by the judge before whom such cause was tried; but in case said judge is satisfied that owing to the fact that he did not preside at the trial, or for any other cause, that he can not fairly pass upon said motion, and allow and sign said bill of exceptions, then he may in his discretion grant a new trial to the party moving therefor.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Salmon Falls Manufacturing Co. v.

A demurrer by the collector was sustained in the District Court upon two grounds: First, that the payment of the taxes had been made without protest; and, second, that the original claim for refund filed with the Commissioner was defective, and that amendment came too late. The Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision upon the second ground without passing on the first. 61 F.(2d) 605. The case is here on certiorari. \n289 \nU.S. 714\n, 53 S.Ct. 522, 77 L.Ed. --.\n On April 1, 1918, the petitioner filed its return for the year 1917, disclaiming any tax liability. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, auditing the return, found a tax liability in the sum of $6,871.18, and assessed a tax accordingly. The respondent, after notice of the assessment, made demand upon the taxpayer, giving notice that there would be distraint and sale unless payment was made within ten days. On November 5, 1923, the taxpayer yielded to the demand, moved by the desire to avoid the seizure of its property, but without protest to the collector that the tax was illegal, either wholly or in part. Four years later, on November 5, 1927, if filed a claim for refund with the Commissioner, and on November 13, 1928, an amended claim, amplifying and making more specific the statements of the first one. The claims were rejected by the Commissioner, though a revenue agent had reported that a refund was due in the sum of $4,551.01. The petitioner alleges that the payment was excessive to that extent, and sues the collector for the moneys overpaid.\n\n 1. \nAt common law, and for many years under the federal statutes, protest at the time of payment was a condition precedent to the recovery of a tax. Elliott v. \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 153; Curtis's Adm'x v. Fiedler, 2 Black, 461; Chesebrough v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 253\n, 24 S. Ct. 262; United States v. N.Y. & Cuba Mail S.S. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 488\n, 26 S.Ct. 327. The rule persisted till 1924, when it was abolished by the Revenue Act of that year, with a proviso that pending suits should be unaffected by the change. Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 343,  1014, amending R.S.  3226;1 26 U.S.C.  156 (26 USCA  156). This suit was not begun till March, 1931, and is thus outside of the proviso. Even so, the payment to be recovered was made in 1923, when protest was still necessary. The petitioner contends that the new rule applies to all suits begun after the adoption of the amendment. The government contends that the old rule survives if the payment was before the amendment, though the suit was begun afterwards. \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n We think the intention of the Congress was to remove the requirement of protest in any suit thereafter brought, irrespective of the date of the underlying payment. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The tokens of intention are within the statute and outside of it.\n Of the tokens within the statute, the saving clause, (b) of section 1014 (26 USCA  156 note), is entitled to a leading place. 'This section shall not affect any proceeding in court instituted prior to the enactment of this Act.' The implication is that any proceeding not covered by the exception is to be subject to the rule. Moses v. United States (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 791, 794. Cf. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 438. But there are other tokens, and tokens still within the statute, that point the same way. The phraselogy of the section in all its parts imports a regulation of procedure. No suit 'shall be maintained' until a claim for refund or credit has been filed with the Commissioner. If such a claim has been filed, suit may be 'maintained,' though there was neither protest nor duress. Even pending actions would commonly be covered by such words. 'To maintain a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suit already begun.' Smallwood v. Gallardo, \n275 \nU.S. 56, 61\n, 48 S.Ct. 23. If suits already begun are taken out by an exception, to 'maintain' can mean no less than to prosecute with effect, without reference to the date of the transaction at the root. The Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 14. In saying this we speak of the inference to be drawn when the balance is not shifted by countervailing weights. None can be discovered here. There could \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n be no denial by any one that transactions antedating the statute would be subject to the rule that the suit is not maintainable without the filing of a claim. The inference is cogent that the same transactions are covered when it is said in the same sentence that the suit may be maintained without evidence or averment of protest or duress. There is a unity of verbal structure that is a symptom of an inner unity, a unity of plan and function. The field of operation is not shifted between the clauses of a sentence.\n If we turn to extrinsic tokens of intention, and view the statute in the light of its history and aims, the signposts are the same. The requirement of protest as it stood before the statute was not limited to suits against a collector of internal revenue or other public officer. It extended and was often applied to suits against the government itself. Even in suits against the collector, the United States almost always the genuine defendant; the liability of the nominal defendant being formal rather than substantial. In this situation the government was unjustly enriched at the expense of the taxpayer when it held on to moneys that had been illegally collected, whether with protest or without. So at least the lawmakers believed, and gave expression to that belief, not only in the statute, but in Congressional reports. Senate Report, No. 398, 68th Congress, First Session, pp. 44, 45; 3 House Report, No. 179, 68th Con- \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n gress, First Session, pp. 33, 34. The amendment was designed to right an ancient wrong. It did not draw a distinction between suits against the body politic and suits against a public officer who was to be paid out of the public purse. It put them in a single class, and made them subject to a common rule. A high-minded government renounced an advantage that was felt to be ignoble, and set up a new standard of equity and conscience. There was no thought to discriminate between payments made and those to come. A fine sense of honor had brought the statute into being. We are to read it in a kindred spirit. United States v. Emery, \n237 \nU.S. 28, 32\n, 35 S. Ct. 499.\n The argument is made that power was lacking, though intention be assumed. Defect of power is not suggested where the claim for restitution is against the government itself. The case assumes another aspect, we are told, when the suit is against an officer who is to be personally charged. Until 1924, a collector was not liable to a taxpayer for a tax illegally collected unless protest gave him notice that he was a party to a wrong. The government suggests that there is an infraction of the Fifth Amendment, a denial of due process, if liability is cast upon him after the event. There is a subsidiary point that at least the doubt is so great as to canalize construction along the course of safety. United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568, 574\n, 51 S.Ct. 278; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S.Ct. 658, 659. 'A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra. But avoidance of a difficulty will not be pressed to the point of disingenuous evasion. Here the intention of the Congress is revealed too distinctly to permit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to power. The problem must be faced and answered. \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 380]\n\u00a0\n As applied to this respondent in the circumstances of his official action stated in the record, the statute is constitutional, though its effect is to broaden liability both for the past and for the future. As the law stood before later statutes, the taxpayer's protest was notice to a collector that suit was about to follow, and was warning not to pay into the Treasury the moneys collected. Elliott v. Swartwout, supra; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 42 S.Ct. 1. Statutes first enacted in 1839 (Act of March 3, 1839, c. 82,  2, 5 Stat. 348) and progressively broadened (R.S.  3210, 26 U.S.C.  140 (26 USCA  140)), made it the duty of collectors to pay the money over to the government, whether there had been protest or no protest. At first this was thought to have relieved them of personal liability (Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra), but later acts of Congress established a different rule, though maintaining the duty to make remittance to the Treasury. (Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 731; Curtis's Adm'x v. Fiedler, 2 Black, 461, 479; The Collector v. Hubbard, supra; Arnson v. Murphy, \n109 \nU.S. 238, 241\n, 3 S.Ct. 184; 5 Stat. 727; 12 Stat. 434, 725, 729; 12 Stat. 741,  12; 13 Stat. 239; 14 Stat. 329,  8). Along with the duty there went a pledge of indemnity by the government itself, a pledge not absolute, it is true, but subject to a condition. 12 Stat. 741,  12; United States v. Sherman, \n98 U.S. 565\n; Philadelphia v. The Collector, supra, page 733 of 5 Wall.; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra. The condition was that a certificate be granted by the court either ( a) that there was probable cause for the act done by the collector or other officer, or (b) that he acted under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury or other proper officer of the government. 12 Stat. 741,  12, Act of March 3, 1863. In that event no execution was to issue upon the judgment, but the amount of the recovery was to be paid out of the Treasury. The pledge of indemnity was carried forward into \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 381]\n\u00a0\n the Revised Statutes with only verbal changes (R.S.  989), and stands upon the books to-day. 28 U.S.C.  842 (28 USCA  842).4 The effect of the certificate, when given, is to convert the suit against the collector into a suit against the government. United States v. Sherman, supra.\n This collector did act under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, or other proper officer of the government, in the collection of the tax. The complaint shows upon its face that the tax had been duly assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In that situation the collector was under a ministerial duty to proceed to collect it. R.S.  3182, 26 U.S.C.  102 (26 USCA  102); Erskine v. Hohnbach, 14 Wall. 613. There was nothing left to his discretion. Other duties less definitely prescribed may leave a margin for judgment and for individual initiative. Cf. Agnew v. Haymes (C.C.A.) 141 F. 631. There was no such margin here. His duty being imperative, he is protected by the command of his superior from liability for trespass (Erskine v. Hohnbach, supra; Haffin v. Mason, 15 Wall. 671, 675; Harding v. Woodcock, \n137 \nU.S. 43, 46\n, 11 S.Ct. 6), and is entitled as of right to a certificate converting the suit against him into one against the government (United States v. Sherman, supra). His position could be no better if there had been protest at the time of payment. He would still have been under a duty to obey the command of his superior and collect the tax assessed. Also he would \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 382]\n\u00a0\n still have been under a duty to make prompt remittance to the Treasury. There had been confided to him no power to review or to revise. Erskine v. Hohnbach, supra; Harding v. Woodcock, supra. The case is not one for a certificate of probable cause, as it might be if the officer had trespassed under a mistaken sense of duty. In such circumstances a certain latitude of judgment may be accorded to the certifying judge, though even then it is enough that a seizure has been made upon grounds of reasonable suspicion. Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch, 339; Agnew v. Haymes, supra; Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 149\n, 45 S.Ct. 280, 39 A.L.R. 790; Dumbra v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 435, 441\n, 45 S.Ct. 546. One does not speak of probable cause when justification is complete. Here the certifying judge will be subject to a specific duty upon the facts admitted by the demurrer to relieve the collector of personal liability and to shift the burden to the Treasury. This court has often held that a pledge of the public faith and credit will permit the seizure of property by right of eminent domain, though what is due for compensation must be ascertained thereafter. Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380\n, 16 S.Ct. 43; Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 \nU.S. 290\n, 32 S.Ct. 488; Joslin Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668, 677\n, 43 S.Ct. 684; Dohany v. Rogers, \n281 \nU.S. 362, 366\n, 50 S.Ct. 299, 68 A.L.R. 434; Hurley v. Kincaid, \n285 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 105 S., 52 S.Ct. 267. The assurance of indemnity is as ample, the reparation prompter and more summary, upon the facts before us here.\n A suit against a collector who has collected a tax in the fulfillment of a ministerial duty is to-day an anomalous relic of bygone modes of thought. He is not suable as a trespasser, nor is he to pay out of his own purse. He is made a defendant because the statute has said for many years that such a remedy shall exist, though he has been guilty of no wrong, and though another is to pay. Philadelphia v. The Collector, supra, page 731 of 5 Wall.. There may have been utility in such procedural devices in days when the government was not suable as freely as now. \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 383]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Emery, supra; Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 452\n, 49 S.Ct. 411; Act of February 24, 1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612 ,  1 and 9; Judicial Code,  145, 28 U.S.C.  250 (28 USCA  250); Judicial Code,  24(20), 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 USCA  41(20). They have little utility to-day, at all events where the complaint against the officer shows upon its face that in the process of collecting he was acting in the line of duty, and that in the line of duty he has turned the money over. In such circumstances his presence as a defendant is merely a remedial expedient for bringing the government into court.\n The case comes down to this: In its application to this collector the amendment of 1924 has left the law the same as it had been for many years. There has been no change to his detriment in the definition of rights and wrongs. His conduct must have been the same though the statute had been on the books from the beginning. There has not even been any change to his detriment in the law of remedies. Execution can never issue against him upon any judgment recovered in favor of the taxpayer. The government has enlarged the remedy against itself by dispensing with what was once an indispensable formality. As to subordinate officials who have acted in the line of duty it has made the change innocuous by assuming liability. One who is brought before the court as a formal party only will not be heard to object that there has been a denial of due process in enlarging the liability to be borne by some one else. Enough that the legislation is valid as to him, whether it be valid or invalid in its bearing upon others.\n The decision of this case does not require us to determine whether the act of 1924 would affect the respondent's liability if the certificate of the court converting the suit into one against the government were dependent upon controverted facts, or upon facts permitting different inferences or calling upon the judge to exercise discretion. \n\n[289 U.S. 373, 384]\n\u00a0\n No such situation is presented by the record now before us. Indeed, no such situation, it would seem, can ever be presented where a collector has done no more than accept payment of a tax assessed by a superior who has been invested by the statute with power to command. Our duty does not require us to deal with problems merely hypothetical. If a case should develop where a certificate might issue as a matter of discretion, other questions would be here. There would then be need to consider whether the objection of a denial of due process would be open to a collector until a request for the certificate had been made and refused. 'Due process requires that there be an opportunity to present every available defense; but it need not be before the entry of judgment.' American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 102; York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 11 S.Ct. 9. There would be need also to consider whether in its application to an officer acting of his own motion, and not in the fulfillment of the command of a superior, the requirement of protest is a procedural limitation upon the remedy for a wrong, or one of the substantive elements of the wrong itself. We leave those questions open.\n\n 2. \nThe government contends that the claim for refund filed by the petitioner with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was not subject to amendment after the time had gone by when a claim wholly new would have been barred by limitation.\n The claim in its original form gave notice of specific errors in the adjustment of invested capital. It gave notice also in general terms that aside from any errors in the adjustment of the capital there had been an erroneous assessment of net income at the sum of $16,940.18, when in fact there had been a loss. We think the statements as to income were subject to amendment. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S. Ct. 278; United States v.

No such suit or proceeding shall be begun before the expiration of six months from the date of filing such claim unless the Commissioner renders a decision thereon within that time, nor after the expiration of five years from the date of the payment of such tax, penalty, or sum, unless such suit or proceeding is begun within two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim to which such suit or proceeding relates.

An Act of the General Assembly approved March 9, 1933 (38 St. at Large S.C. p. 1174), was held to forbid the maintenance of the proceeding. The appellant, who was plaintiff in the suit asserts that the act impairs the obligation of contract in violation of the Constitution of the United States. We cannot consider this contention since in his pleading the appellant relied solely on the provisions of the state Constitution (art. 1,  8) with respect to the obligation of contracts, and made no reference to section 10, of article 1 of the Federal Constitution; and the Supreme Court, in disposing of the case, did not mention or discuss that section. Rev. St.  709, U.S.C. tit. 28,  344 (28 USCA  344) Chicago & Northwestern Ry. v. Chicago, \n164 \nU.S. 454, 457\n, 17 S.Ct. 129; Levy v.

Scott, \n233 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 34 S.Ct. 769\n\n\n The statute was also assailed below and is challenged here as depriving the appellant of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. A brief statement of the facts is requisite to an understanding of appellant's argument. Prior to March 9, 1933, the statutory provision as to state banks was, in summary, this: A state official, known as a bank examiner, had general supervision of the operation of these institutions. If a bank became embarrassed or insolvent he might, upon an order of a court, take possession of the assets and business for a period of thirty days, during which time no suits \n\n[290 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n could be brought against the bank. He might restore the bank to the management of its officers, or, if liquidation were required, apply to a court for the appointment of himself or another as receiver. The affairs of the bank were then to be liquidated by the receiver under the suppervision of the court. Stockholders were liable to creditors other than depositors only to the extent of any unpaid balance on their shares; but to depositors, in an amount equal to the face value of their shares. It was the duty of the receiver to demand and collect for the benefit of creditors and depositors the amount due from stockholders, and, if necessary, to sue the stockholders individually and collectively therefor. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Shortly after the declaration of a banking holiday by the President on March 4, 1933, the Governor of South Carolina issued a proclamation temporarily closing the banks in that state. The General Assembly passed, and on March 9 the Governor approved, an act suspending for eighteen months legislation then applicable to the conduct and liquidation of banks, vesting in the Governor plenary power over state banks, empowering him to extend the time for payment of deposits as the condition of each institution might require; to direct the creation of special trust accounts for receipt of deposits, which should be held separate from other assets and be subject to withdrawal on demand; to determine whether the overhead expenses of any bank exceed its net income, and, if so, to compel it to reduce the expenses or to order immediate liquidation, as might best serve the depositors' interests; and to make all necessary rules and regulations to carry out the intent of the act. The examiner was prohibited from taking possession of any bank unless authorized so to do by the Governor, and all persons were forbidden, while the Governor remained in control of the banks, to institute any action \n\n[290 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n against a bank, except by the Governor's consent. The Governor was authorized to appoint a board of bank control, with whom he might advise and consult, and to whom he might delegate powers under the act. Pursuant to this legislation the Governor appointed a board of bank control and promulgated regulations which provided, inter alia, that upon advice of the board he might, where necessary, appoint a conservator for any bank to conserve its assets for the benefit of depositors and creditors, who should posses himself of all books, records, and assets, and take all necessary action to preserve the property, 'pending further disposition of its business as provided by law.' The regulations provided: 'Such conservator ... shall have all the rights, powers and privileges now possessed by or hereafter given Receivers of insolvent state banks. ... During the time that such conservator ... shall remain in possession of such bank, the rights of all parties with respect thereto shall, subject to the other provisions of this order, be the same as if a receiver had been appointed therefor.' Further regulations dealing with the reopening of solvent banks and reorganization of banks were promulgated, but these are irrelevant to the present case.\n The appellee Zimmerman was appointed conservator of the Central Union Bank and entered upon his duties. The appellant, on behalf of himself and other depositors, filed a bill in the common pleas court averring the bank's insolvency, charging that the Act of March 9 is invalid so far as it purports to prevent appellant and other depositors from prosecuting the suit, and praying the appointment of a receiver who should proceed to enforce the stockholders' statutory liability to depositors. The defendants named were the conservator, the Governor, and the state treasurer, who was also a member of the board of bank control. The court issued a temporary injunction and a rule on the defendants to show cause. \n\n[290 U.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n At this juncture the defendants in the common pleas court prayed a writ of prohibition from the state Supreme Court, addressed to the appellant and to the judge of the common pleas court, to stay the equity proceeding. The judge made return submitting himself to such order as the Supreme Court should enter. The appellant filed a demurrer and motion to dismiss, and a return denying the validity of the Act of March 9 and the regulations, and asserting that his right to proceed for the collection of stockholders' liability was a vested property right, to be enforced through a receiver, of which he could not lawfully be deprived; that the conservator was engaged in receiving and paying trust cash deposits, and the expense of conducting this branch of the business would deplete assets available for payment of depositors. The writ of prohibition was granted.\n Subsequent to the judgment of the state Supreme Court certain official action occurred of which we may take judicial notice. On May 16, 1933, there was approved an Act of the General Assembly (38 St. at Large S. C. p. 489), empowering the Governor, whenever he should determine, after advising with the board of bank control, that any bank for which a conservator had been or hereafter might be appointed, was insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency, and liquidation was therefore required to protect depositors and creditors, to order liquidation, which should be accomplished by the conservator, who was to have all the powers and be under all the duties of a receiver, and might apply to a court for instructions on question arising in liquidation. All appointments of conservators theretofore made were ratified and confirmed. On June 22 the Governor issued an order finding the Central Union Bank insolvent, or in imminent danger of insolvency, reciting that he had consulted with the board of bank control and had found that the overhead expense of the bank exceeded its net income, and directing its liquidation. \n\n[290 U.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n The appellant says the Act of March 9 arbitrarily deprives him of a remedy for the enforcement of stockholders' liability, which remedy was his property, and was taken from him without due process. But although a vested cause of action is property and is protected from arbitrary interference (Pritchard v. Norton, \n106 \nU.S. 124, 132\n, 1 S.Ct. 102), the appellant has no property, in the constitutional sense, in any particular form of remedy; all that he is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is the preservation of his substantial right to redress by some effective procedure. Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 16 S. Ct. 344; Backus v. Fort St. Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 571\n, 18 S.Ct. 445 S.Ct. \n214 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 42 S. Ct. 214; Hardware Dealers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 158\n, 52 S.Ct. 69.\n Under the Act of March 9, and the regulations, the conservator was endowed with all the functions of a receiver, one of which is the enforcement on behalf of depositors of stockholders' excess liability. If under that act and the regulations power was lacking the defect was cured by the Act of May 16. Nothing is shown to indicate that the conservator will prosecute the claim against the stockholders in a manner different from that to be pursued under the old law by a receiver or that the state courts will refuse him process to that end. The Act of March 9, the regulations, and the Act of May 16, do not purport, and, so far as we can perceive, do not operate, to deny the depositors participation in the distribution of assets, or in the benefit of the stockholders' excess liability. It is not alleged that the proceedings of the conservator will impose upon creditors of the bank greater burden or expense than would have been the case if a receiver were functioning. The substantive rights existing under the old law are preserved. In no proper sense can it be said that any property of the appellant has been taken, injured or destroyed. \n\n[290 U.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n The appellant, however, insists that after the conservator took possession, he accepted special trust deposits which were segregated and against which the depositors were allowed to draw, and in conducting this restricted business the overhead expenses of the institution exceeded its net income. So long as this condition existed, he says his position as a creditor was being jeopardized for the fund to which he must look for payment was being depleted. But he has not averred that the conservator's activities will deplete the bank's resources to such extent that depositors cannot be paid in full; and whatever injury might have been inflicted by a continuation of the business has now been abated for the future by the Governor's order of June 22 directing liquidation. No present advantage could accrue to the appellant from the ousting of the conservator and the appointment of a receiver, who could only liquidate by the methods obligatory on the conservator. In this aspect the case is now moot.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Civil Code of South Carolina (1932)  7843, 7844, 7848, 7852, 7854, 7855, 7868. \n\n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGLENN v.

The statute was assailed as being in violation of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the state and of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The District Court, composed of three judges (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)) granted an interlocutory injunction and on final hearing entered a decree making the injunction permanent.\n The District Court held that the statute, although in the form of a taxing law, was in reality a prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine in Kentucky and hence was invalid under the state constitution. The question presented under the Federal Constitution was not decided. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S.Ct. 451; Hurn v.

At the time of his death he and his wife held as joint tenants certain real estate in Illinois, title to which vested in them by conveyance on October 5, 1909. The commissioner valued this real estate at $ 90,000, and included the whole of it in the value of decedent's gross estate as being within the reach of section 402(d). Upon appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, that tribunal, disapproving in part the commissioner's determination, held that the value of only decedent's one- half of the property could be included for the purposes of the tax. 23 B.T.

Emery, 62 F.(2d) 591. \n\n[290 U.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n Whether this application of the statute gives it a retroactive effect is the sole question here involved; and with that we find no difficulty. Under the statute the death of decedent is the event in respect of which the tax is laid. It is the existence of the joint tenancy at that time, and not its creation at the earlier date, which furnishes the basis for the tax. By the judgment under review, only half of the value, that is to say, the value of decedent's interest, has been included, leaving the survivor's interest unaffected. After the creation of the joint tenancy, and until his death, decedent retained his interest in, and control over, half of the property. Cessation of that interest and control at death presented the proper occasion for the imposition of a tax. See Gwinn v. Commissioner, \n287 \nU.S. 224\n, 53 S.Ct. 157, and cases cited. And since that is all that is sought to be reached by the tax here in question, the complaint that the statute has been given a retroactive application obviously is without substance. The statute as applied does not lay a tax in respect of an event already past, but in respect of one yet to happen.\n Petitioners insist that Knox v. McElligott, \n258 \nU.S. 546\n, 42 S.Ct. 396, is to the contrary; but, clearly, it is not. There the tax return included the value of decedent's one-half of the jointly owned property, but did not include the value of the half which had been owned and enjoyed by the surviving joint tenant. Nevertheless, the commissioner undertook to impose a tax in respect of the value of this latter half as well. This court held that to do so was to apply the statute retroactively, and that this, under the circumstances of that case, could not be done. It did not hold, or intend to hold, that the statute was retroactive in so far as the value of the decedent's half of the joint estate was concerned. That question was not there involved. It is the only question here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGROSS v. IRVING TRUST CO.(1933)\nNo. 680\nArgued: April 12, 1933Decided: May 8, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Merritt Lane, of Newark, N.J., for petitioners.\n Mr. Samuel Kaufman, of Newark, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 13, 1931, the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, upon a bill of complaint previously filed, appointed receivers for Crosby Stores, Inc. The receivers took possession of the assets located in New Jersey and operated the business. On October 14, 1931, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the corporation was filed in a federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the Irving Trust Company was appointed receiver in bankruptcy by that court. The corporation was ad- \n\n[289 U.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n judged a bankrupt, and the trust company was continued as trustee in bankruptcy and later sold all the assets of the bankrupt, including those which had passed into the hands of the New Jersey receivers. On December 11, 1931, the federal District Court ordered the New Jersey receivers to show cause (rule made absolute December 14th) why they should not turn over all the assets to the trustee in bankruptcy and account to the federal court. On December 14th the state Chancery Court made allowances to its receivers and their counsel in sums aggregating $10,350. Subsequently (December 21, 1931), the federal District Court enjoined the receivers from interfering with the trustee and from disposing of the moneys paid to them as allowances under the order of the state Chancery Court.\n The trustee then filed its petition in the federal District Court, sitting as a court in bankruptcy, averring that the payments to the receivers were void as in violation of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA), and that application must be made to the bankruptcy court for allowances of compensation for any services rendered by the receivers and their counsel inuring to the benefit of the bankrupt's estate. An appropriate order was asked against the receivers and their counsel and was granted by the federal District Court, and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 61 F.( 2d) 812. This court granted certiorari. \n288 \nU.S. 598\n, 53 S.Ct. 507, 77 L. Ed. --.\n The sole question presented for our determination is: Did the state Chancery Court have the power to fix the compensation of its receivers and their counsel after bankruptcy had supervened within four months of the filing of the bill of complaint in, and the appointment of receivers by, that court?1 \n\n[289 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n The state courts of New Jersey have steadily held in the affirmative, and that view is not without support. We deem it unnecessary, however, to review these decisions. They are not in harmony with the views expressed by this court or with other decisions, which, in our opinion, state the true rule.\n Upon adjudication of bankruptcy, title to all the property of the bankrupt, wherever situated, vests in the trustee as of the date of filing the petition in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction, and that court's possession and control of the estate cannot be affected by proceedings in other courts, state or federal. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & T. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734, 737\n, 51 S.Ct. 270, and cases cited. Such jurisdiction having attached, control of the administration of the estate cannot be surrendered even by the court itself. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & T. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 739\n, 51 S.Ct. 270. 'The filing of the petition is a caveat to all the world and in effect an attachment and injunction.' May v. Henderson, \n268 \nU.S. 111, 117\n, 45 S.Ct. 456, 459, and citations. And see generally Moore v. Scott (C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 863; In re Diamond's Estate (C.C.A.) 259 F. 70.\n The fact that the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is paramount effectually distinguishes that class of cases which hold that as between courts of concurrent jurisdiction property already in the hands of a receiver of one of them cannot rightfully be taken from him without that court's consent by a receiver subsequently appointed by the other court. In Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 341, the rule is stated to be that 'whenever property has been seized by an officer of the court, by virtue of its process, the property is to be considered as in the custody of the court, and under its control for the time being; and that no other court has a right to interfere with that possession, unless it be some court which may have a direct supervisory control over the court whose process has first taken possession, or some superior jurisdiction in the premises.' \n\n[289 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n And see Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 180\n, 4 S.Ct. 355. The present case falls within the italicized exception, since the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is paramount and not concurrent.\n Nevertheless, due regard for comity-which means, in this connection, no more than judicial courtesy between the courts undertaking to deal with the same matter-would suggest that ordinarily the trustee in bankruptcy might well be instructed by the bankruptcy court, before taking final action, to request the state court to recognize the exclusive jurisdiction of the former and set aside any orders already made conflicting therewith, as was done with good results in the case of In re Diamond's Estate, supra ( C.C.A.) 259 F. 70, 72, 75. In the present case, however, such a course would probably have been futile, in view of the fixed attitude of the state courts on the subject.\n The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court being paramount, the power of the state court to fix the compensation of its receivers and the fees of their counsel necessarily came to an end with the supervening bankruptcy. When the bankruptcy court acquired jurisdiction, the sole power to fix such compensation and fees passed to that court. In re Diamond's Estate, supra (C.C.A.) 259 F. 70, 74; Moore v. Scott, supra; Silberberg v. Ray Chain Stores (D.C.) 54 F.(2d) 650, affirmed (C.C.A.) 58 F.(2d) 766. We adopt, as stating the correct rule, the language used in Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 640, 642\n, 43 S.Ct. 641, 642, although it was not strictly necessary to that decision: 'Even where the court which appoints a receiver had jurisdiction at the time, but loses it, as upon supervening bankruptcy, the first court cannot thereafter make an allowance for his expenses and compensation. He must apply to the bankruptcy court.' See authorities cited in the footnote following this statement.\n Order affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is assailed as erroneous upon the further ground that that court held that the District Court had power to proceed in a summary proceeding in bankruptcy, although the receivers and their counsel were adverse claimants. We do not consider this contention, because it appears from the record that the point was abandoned in the District Court. \n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUARANTY TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK v. BLODGETT(1933)\nNo. 217\nArgued: December 15, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Superior Court of Fairfield County, State of connecticut. \n\n[287 U.S. 509, 510]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gregory Hankin, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 509, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ernest L. Averill, of Branford, Conn., and Farwell Knapp, of Hartford Conn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Connecticut succession tax act of 1923 contains the following provision:\n'All property and any interest therein owned by a resident of this state at the time of his decease, ... which shall pass by will or inheritance under the laws of this state; and all gifts of such property by deed, grant or other conveyance, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of such grantor or donor, shall be subject to the tax herein prescribed.' Chapter 190,  1, Pub. Acts 1923\n\n\n\n On December 28, 1926, while this act was in force, Harriet D. Sewell executed an irrevocable deed of trust to appellant, transferring certain securities, by which deed it was provided that the trustee collect the income and pay it to Mrs. Sewell during her life. Thereafter the income was to be paid to her husband for his life, and upon his death the trustee was directed to pay and transfer the \n\n[287 U.S. 509, 512]\n\u00a0\n principal of the trust absolutely to their daughter if she survived, but, if not, then to the issue of the daughter, with a gift over in default of such issue. Mrs. Sewell died May 20, 1930, domiciled in Connecticut.\n The state Supreme Court held that the statute recognized the distinction between taking effect in possession or enjoyment and vesting in right, title, or interest, and intended to reach a shifting of the enjoyment of property, although such shifting followed necessarily from a prior transfer of title inter vivos; that, within the meaning and description of the statute, the transfer in question was a gift intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the donor, and therefore was subject to the succession tax; and that the imposition of such tax did not offend against the Fourteenth Amendment or any other provision of the Federal Constitution. 114 Conn. 207, 158 A. 245.\n Appellant first contends that, while the court below expressly upheld the tax under the act of 1923, it nevertheless gave effect to the later and more specific act of 1929 (Pub. Acts, c. 299,  1 and 2), and thereby the contract impairment clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  10, cl. 1) was infringed. This contention must be rejected. We are not at liberty to disregard the explicit holding of the state court as to the basis of its decision, except for convincing reasons, which here we are unable to find. Compare Columbia Ry., Gas & Electric Co. v. South Carolina, \n261 U.S. 236\n, 245-247, 43 S.Ct. 306. The entire effort of the court upon this point plainly was directed towards sustaining the view that the event sought to be taxed fell within the provisions of the act of 1923. There is a reference to the act of 1929, but the decision is definitely put upon the act of 1923, and is supported by considerations of such weight as to leave no occasion for dependence upon the later act; and the supposition that in fact effect was given to it is without warrant. \n\n[287 U.S. 509, 513]\n\u00a0\n Since the court below construed the act of 1923, without regard to the act of 1929, as embracing the event sought to be taxed, and since in that view the question of contract impairment does not arise, we are bound by the decision of that court as though the meaning as fixed by the court had been expressed in the statute itself in specific words. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co. (December 5, 1932) \n287 \nU.S. 358\n, 53 S.Ct. 145; Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432.\n In that view the tax was imposed upon an event generated by the death of the decedent. That such a tax does not conflict with any provision of the Federal Constitution is clearly stated by this court in Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582, 596\n, 51 S.Ct. 306, 309. There a similar tax was held bad because the state statute imposing it was passed after the creation of the trusts; but the court said: 'Undoubtedly the state has power to lay such an excise upon property so passing after the taking effect of the taxing act.' While, strictly, that statement was not necessary to the decision, we follow it as expressing the settled conviction of this court, and, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, sustain the validity of the act of 1923 as construed by the state court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAWKS v. HAMILL(1933)\nNo. 147\nArgued: December 9, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. C. Lewis, of Oklahoma City, Okl., Purman Wilson, of Purcell, Okl., and J. Berry King, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles B. Cochran, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondents, claiming to be the owners of a perpetual franchise to collect tolls for the use of a bridge across the Canadian river, brought suit in the United States District Court against the members of the state highway commission of Oklahoma, the Attorney General of that state, the county attorneys of McClain and Cleveland counties, and other persons, residents of the neighborhood, to restrain a threatened interference with the maintenance of the bridge or the collection of tolls. 50 F.(2d) 628. The jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked upon the ground of diversity of citizenship. The defendants (petitioners in this court) made a motion, without answering, to dismiss the complaint. The complainants moved at the same time for an injunction pendente lite. The District Court denied the motion for an injunction, and granted the motion to dismiss. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the decree and directed judgment in favor of the complainants for the relief demanded in the complaint. 58 F.(2d) 41, 47. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n287 \nU.S. 582\n, 53 S.Ct. 16, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The facts exhibited in the bill are these: On April 22, 1911, the county commissioners of McClain county, Okl., adopted a resolution whereby there was granted to Carter and Halsell, or their assigns, a franchise to construct and operate a tollbridge across the Canadian river at the city of Purcell, the bridge to be erected within the time prescribed by law. The tolls enumerated in a \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n schedule were not to be increased 'by the bridge company,' though they might be reduced. By the terms of the resolution, the grant was to be 'perpetual,' subject only to such limitations as were provided by law. The grantees were to be at liberty to transfer their rights and privileges to 'any individual or corporation,' with the same effect as if the grant had been made to the assigns directly. On May 16, 1911, the county commissioners of Cleveland county on the other side of the Canadian river adopted a like resolution for the grant of a like franchise to the same grantees. On May 18, 1911, Carter, one of the grantees, together with Walling and Hamill, the present respondents, caused a corporation, known as the Purcell-Lexington Toll Bridge Company, to be organized under the laws of Oklahoma, with a corporate life of twenty years. Thereafter in December, 1911, while the bridge was in course of construction, the grantees of the franchises, together with the respondents, conveyed the bridge, its approaches, and all the rights and privileges embraced within the franchises or either of them, to the Purcell-Lexington Toll Bridge Company, its successors and assigns. The corporate life of the Purcell- Lexington Toll Bridge Company was to expire, as we have seen, on May 18, 1931. Before that time, and on April 2, 1931, the bridge company conveyed to the respondents and to Carter, and their assigns, the bridge and the accompanying franchises; the respondents receiving afterwards from Carter an assignment of his interest, whatever it might be. Thereupon the defendants, who are the petitioners here, gave notice that on May 18, 1931, the bridge would become a free bridge and part of the free highway system of the state of Oklahoma. The members of the state highway commission, the Attorney General, the county attorneys, as well as the neighboring residents, who, it seems, are also the county commissioners, announced a purpose to prevent the collection of tolls by the respond- \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n ents, and to cause the bridge to be kept open for free and unimpeded passage. This suit for an injunction followed.\n The District Court held that the county commissioners were without authority to grant a franchise to individuals except in trust for a corporation organized under the bridge law; that the term of the corporate life was also the limit of the duration of the privilege to charge and levy tolls; that a perpetual franchise, if intended, would be void under article 2,  32, of the Constitution of Oklahoma, prohibiting 'perpetuities'; and that the bill should be dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing this judgment, held that the franchises were not invalid because granted to individuals; that, upon assignment to a corporation organized for a term of twenty years, the franchises were not cut down in respect of their duration, but continued in full force when conveyed by the assignee to others; that the term 'perpetuities' as used in article 2,  32, of the Constitution of Oklahoma, had in view the creation of future estates, and did not limit the enjoyment of a privilege or franchise; and that the complainants should have an injunction as prayed for in the bill.\n Article 2,  32, of the Constitution of Oklahoma, provides: 'Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free government, and shall never be allowed, nor shall the law of primogeniture or entailments ever be in force in this State.' Construing that provision, the Court of Appeals said: 'We do not doubt that the word 'perpetuities' ... was not intended to mean or be equivalent to perpetual franchises, but was intended to limit the power to pass titles that would vest in futuro.' But the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has not circumscribed the word so narrowly. It has said that a forbidden perpetuity is created when there is granted to an individual or corporation a perpetual privilege or franchise. \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n It has gone farther; it has said that a privilege or franchise is perpetual if indefinite in duration, though it be subject to revocation at the pleasure of the Legislature. The question came before the court in City of Okmulgee v. Okmulgee Gas Company, 140 Okl. 88, 282 P. 640. The Legislature of Oklahoma had passed an act whereby a public service corporation holding a franchise from a municipality for a fixed term of years was to be at liberty to exchange it for a revocable permit. The court said that such a permit, if viewed as a grant from the municipality, was forbidden by article 18,  5(a), which provides in effect that no franchise shall be granted by a municipal corporation for a longer term than twenty-five years. On the other hand, if the permit could be viewed as one proceeding directly from the state, the court said that it would then be a perpetuity within the prohibition of article 2,  32. The permit was not saved by the reservation to the Legislature of a power to revoke it. In the view of the court (page 98 of 40 Okl., 282 P. 640, 649), a franchise 'not limited in its existence to a fixed and definite period of years' is to be classified as 'a perpetual franchise,' and hence an unlawful perpetuity. To avoid misapprehension, the court at the end of its opinion summarized its conclusions (page 100 of 140 Okl., 282 P. 640, 651). 'Any act of the Legislature which provides for issuing a license, revocable permit, indeterminate permit, or other instrument in the nature of a franchise, which is not limited as to its time of existence, violates section 32 of article 2 of our Constitution.' See, to the same effect, In re Okmulgee Gas Company, 141 Okl. 98, 284 P. 70; In re Oklahoma Power Company, 141 Okl. 100, 284 P. 12.\n We do not now determine what meaning we would give to the Oklahoma Constitution if the question were before us as an original one, unhampered by any pronouncement of the courts of that state. Much can be said in support of the respondents' position that the perpetuities denounced are those arising from the creation of future \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 57]\n\u00a0\n estates or from restraints upon alienation without reasonable limit. The question is one distinctively local in origin and content. The prohibition is embodied in the local Constitution. Not only that, but it is designed to give effect to 'the genius' of the government, an impalpable existence that can best be apprehended and defined by perceptions and experiences sharpened and developed through the associations of the vicinage. 'In a case involving local history as this does we should be slow to overrule the decision of Courts steeped in the local tradition even if we saw reason for doubting it.' Jackman v. Rosenbaum Company, \n260 \nU.S. 22, 32\n, 43 S.Ct. 9, 10. Cf. Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 105\n, 106 S., 43 S.Ct. 286, 288. To define a 'perpetuity' for a young and developing community, there must be recourse to something more than the pages of a dictionary. The word to be defined, in common with words generally, will have a color and a content that will vary with the setting. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S.Ct. 158, L.R.A. 1918D, 254; Int. Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S.Ct. 19; Surace v. Danna, 248 N.Y. 18, 21, 161 N.E. 315. It comes down to its interpreters freighted with subtle implications, with the 'tacit assumptions,' the 'unwritten practices,' the 'thousand influences' and 'values' that 'logic and grammar never could have gotten from the books.' Diaz v. Gonzalez, supra. Out of two or more meanings that were possible and plausible the state of Oklahoma has picked the one comporting best in the thought of her official spokesmen with the 'genius' of her history. The mists of our own uncertainties are scattered when pierced by this authentic evidence of the law of the locality. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R.R. v. Risty, \n276 \nU.S. 567, 570\n, 48 S.Ct. 396; People of Sioux County v. National Surety Co., \n276 \nU.S. 238\n, 48 S.Ct. 239. Cf. Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n287 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 132, December 5, 1932\n\n\n We are urged by the respondents to exert a power of independent judgment though the law to be interpreted be a constitution or a statute, and not merely the form of \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 58]\n\u00a0\n law which has come to be spoken of as general. Cf. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20\n, 2 S.Ct. 10. The power, we are told, exists because at the grant of these franchises in 1911, the courts of Oklahoma had not yet spoken as to the meaning of the Constitution by defining the 'perpetuities' within the zone of its restraints. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co ., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S.Ct. 140; Moore-Mansfield Construction Co. v. Electrical Installation Co., \n234 \nU.S. 619, 625\n, 34 S.Ct. 941; Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458, 463\n, 45 S.Ct. 543. Obedience is due to the courts of the state if the decisions claiming fealty are so many and unequivocal as to make out a 'rule of property.' Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, supra, at pages 463, 464, of 268 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 543. As to this there is no denial. The argument is that the fetters of obedience are released when there is only a single state decision, and this subsequent to the transaction out of which rights and duties have developed. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., supra; Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, supra. One hurdle, it is said, will be overleaped if there are no barriers beyond.\n Choice is not so free as the argument assumes. If the single decision interpreting a constitution or a statute is clear and unequivocal, submission to its holding has developed in these days into a practice so nearly uniform that there is little need to consider whether under pressure of extraordinary circumstances there is a privilege to deviate. Whatever doubt as to the practice may have prevailed in days gone by has been dispelled by recent judgments. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R.R. v. Risty, supra; People of Sioux County v. National Surety Co., supra. Indeed, the radiating potencies of a decision may go beyond the actual holding. A wise comity has decreed that deference shall at times be owing, though there may be lacking, in the circumstances, a strict duty of obedience. Cf. Sim v. Edenborn, \n242 \nU.S. 131, 135\n, 37 S.Ct. 36. An opinion may be so framed that there is doubt whether the part of it invoked as an authority is to be ranked as a definitive hold- \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n ing or merely a considered dictum. What was said in City of Okmulgee v. Okmulgee Gas Co., supra, as to the meaning of perpetuities was probably intended to be a definitive holding. Cf. 141 Okl. 98, 284 P. 70; 141 Okl. 100, 284 P. 12. To be sure there is room for argument that limiting distinctions will have to be drawn in the future. We must leave it to the courts of Oklahoma to declare what they shall be. But the result will not be changed though the definition of perpetuities be something less than a decision. At least it is a considered dictum, and not comment merely obiter. It has capacity, though it be less than a decision, to tilt the balanced mind toward submission and agreement. Cf. Sim v. Edenborn, supra; Lankford v. Platte Iron Works Co., \n235 \nU.S. 461, 474\n, 35 S.Ct. 173. No controversy is here as to the impairment of the obligation of a contract in violation of the restraints of the Federal Constitution. We are not to confuse the standards of independent judgment appropriate in such conditions (Coombes v. Getz, \n285 \nU.S. 434, 441\n, 52 S.Ct. 435; Shriver v. Woodbine Bank, \n285 \nU.S. 467, 475\n, 52 S.Ct. 430) with those appropriate where the only basis of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship. The Oklahoma decision as to the validity of a grant in perpetuity is not an act of legislation, and would not have impaired the contract embodied in the grant though it had overruled a contrary decision previously rendered. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, \n263 \nU.S. 444\n, 44 S.Ct. 197; Fleming v. Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29\n, 44 S.Ct. 246; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358\n, 53 S.Ct. 145, December 5, 1932. What is at issue in this case is not an actual or even a claimed impairment of any right or privilege assured to the respondents by the Constitution of the nation. What is at issue is the validity of a privilege or claim of privilege to obstruct a bridge across a public stream. The case does not call for a decision as to the ownership of the structure of the bridge or the right of the complainants to tear it down hereafter. Cf. State ex rel. Green v. Lawrence Bridge Co., 22 Kan. 438, 463. The decision that is called for is one as to \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n the privilege of the complainants, while maintaining an obstruction of navigable waters, to exact payments from the public. The statutes of Oklahoma are explicit that tolls may never be collected unless permitted by a franchise (Wagon Road Act, Compiled Oklahoma Statutes,  5627; Toll Bridge Corporations Act, Compiled Oklahoma Statutes,  5367). In controversies so purely local, little gain is to be derived from drawing nice distinctions between dicta and decisions. Disagreement with either, even though permissible, is at best a last resort, to be embraced with caution and reluctance. The stranger from afar, unacquainted with the local ways, permits himself to be guided by the best evidence available, the directions or the counsel of those who dwell upon the spot.\n The case thus far has been considered from the viewpoint of the substantive law, the basic rights and duties contested by the litigants. There is another path of approach that brings us to the same goal, an approach along the line of the law of equitable remedies. Caution and reluctance there must be in any case where there is the threat of opposition, in respect of local controversies, between state and federal courts. Caution and reluctance there must be in special measure where relief, if granted, is an interference by the process of injunction with the activities of state officers discharging in good faith their supposed official duties. In such circumstances this court has said that an injunction ought not to issue 'unless in a case reasonably free from doubt.' Mass. State Grange v. Benton, \n272 \nU.S. 525, 527\n, 47 S.Ct. 189, 190. The rule has been characterized as an 'important' one, to be 'very strictly observed.' 272 U.S. at pages 527, 529, 47 S.Ct. 189. Compare Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159\n, 49 S.Ct. 282; Cavanaugh v. Looney, \n248 \nU.S. 453, 456\n, 39 S. Ct. 142. It is such interference by the process of injunction with the activities of state officers that the respondents now seek. The members of the state highway commission believe it to be \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 61]\n\u00a0\n their official duty to take possession of the bridge, and purpose to act accordingly. The Attorney General of the state is about to institute proceedings at law and in equity to vindicate the public rights or what he believes to be such rights. The county attorneys of McClain and Cleveland counties propose to sue for fines and penalties. All these activities the respondents ask us to enjoin. Indeed all have been enjoined by the decree under review. Only a case of manifest oppression will justify a federal court in laying such a check upon administrative officers acting colore officii in a conscientious endeavor to fulfill their duty to the state. A prudent self-restraint is called for at such times if state and national functions are to be maintained in stable equilibrium. Reluctance there has been to use the process of federal courts in restraint of state officials though the rights asserted by the complainants are strictly federal in origin. Mass. State Grange v. Benton, supra; Stratton v. St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 530\n, 52 S.Ct. 222; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. There must be reluctance even greater when the rights are strictly local; jurisdiction having no other basis than the accidents of residence. The need is clamant in such circumstances for cautious hesitation. If there were to be a concession arguendo that the meaning of 'perpetuities' is still an unsettled question after the decisions in Oklahoma, there is surely no room for a contention that a meaning in opposition to those decisions is reasonably free from doubt. Our process does not issue unless the path is clear.\n What has been written has had its basis in the assumption that an indeterminate franchise is a perpetuity within the meaning of the Constitution of Oklahoma, or at the very least that state officers acting in that belief are not subject to an injunction at the instance of the federal courts. The case for the respondents would be beset, however, with other doubts and difficulties, if all these were \n\n[288 U.S. 52, 62]\n\u00a0\n to be removed. There would still remain the uncertainty whether the franchise granted by the county was to the grantees for their own use or for the use of a corporation to be organized thereafter; whether the corporation was to be one under the 'Wagon Road' Law, with an indeterminate duration, or under the 'Bridge Companies' Act, with a duration of twenty years; and whether the public policy of Oklahoma, disclosed by her statutes and decisions, and irrespective of decisions elsewhere, sets a limit upon the toll right, or what is known as the secondary franchise, coterminous with the primary franchise to exist and engage in business in a corporate capacity. By the statement of these questions, we convey no hint as to the answer. We do no more than emphasize the complexities of law as well as of policy in which the respondents' title is involved, and the unwisdom of superseding the official acts and powers of the agents of the vicinage by writ out of a federal court.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEALY v.

DIAMOND ALKALI CO.(1933)\nNo. 476\nArgued: February 10, 1933Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioners.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question whether, where the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has granted special assessments of profits taxes pursuant to section 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1093), a court, in an action for a refund, may recalculate the taxpayer's net income and recompute the tax by applying to the corrected net income the rate per cent. used by the Commissioner in his computation of the tax.\n The Alkali Company filed returns for income and profits taxes for 1918 and 1919 and paid the tax shown to be due. The Commissioner proposed certain changes in income and capital as reported, principally due to decreases in amortization and depreciation allowances. At some date not disclosed by the record the company asked that its profits taxes be computed pursuant to sections 327 and \n\n[288 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n 328 of the act (40 Stat. 1093). The request was denied and correspondence and conferences ensued between the Commissioner and the taxpayer in an effort to settle the disputed items. The demand for computation of the taxes pursuant to the special assessment sections was pressed by the company. Twice during the period of negotiation the Commissioner advised that until the true net income was ascertained the propriety of special assessment could not be determined. Finally, in July, 1927, as a result of audits and investigations, he found the company's net income, and decided that, owing to abnormal conditions affecting its capital or income, assessment according to the usual method under section 301 would work an exceptional hardship, and relief should be granted pursuant to sections 327 and 328. He so notified the respondent, inclosing a calculation of the taxes made by him pursuant to section 328. The taxpayer protested on several grounds, amongst others, that the net income as determined under section 301 was excessive, and that the ratio of tax to net income obtained by the Commissioner by comparison with the taxes of other representative corporations, as provided in section 328, was too high. It did not, however, as was its right, appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals from the determination of new income.\n In November, 1927, the Commissioner made an assessment in accordance with his findings and demanded payment of a deficiency thereby disclosed. The respondent paid under protest and filed claims for refund, asserting the same objections it had previously urged. The claims were rejected and the respondent brought suits to recover the alleged overpayments. The District Court found that additional amounts should have been allowed for amortization, reduced the net income as determined, thereupon recomputed the taxes on the reduced income by applying the rate per cent. used by the Commissioner in his com- \n\n[288 U.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n putation, and rendered judgment in favor of the respondent. Both parties appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals increased the amortization allowance, made additional deductions from gross income for depreciation, found a net income much less than that fixed by the District Court, and held that the tax should be recomputed by applying the rate used by the Commissioner to the new figure found as the net income, 60 F.(2d) 505.\n Section 327(d), so far as here material, enacts that, 'where upon application by the corporation the Commissioner finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without benefit of this section would, owing to abnormal conditions affecting the capital or income of the corporation, work upon the corporation an exceptional hardship evidenced by gross disproportion between the tax computed without benefit of this section and the tax computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328,' the tax shall be computed as provided in the latter section. Section 328 declares that the tax shall be 'the amount which bears the same ratio to the net income of the taxpayer' as the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business bears to their average net income, and directs that in computing the tax the Commissioner shall compare the taxpayer only with representative corporations whose invested capital can be satisfactorily determined in accordance with section 326, which are as nearly as may be 'similarly circumstanced with respect to gross income, net income, profits per unit of business transacted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and circumstances.'\n In Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S.Ct. 587, it was decided that the allowance of special assessment is a matter of administrative discretion; and it \n\n[288 U.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n was further said that the selection for comparison of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business is also a question of discretion. The Commissioner cannot make an administrative finding upon the question for decision under section 327(d) or that under 328 until he has determined the net income of the taxpayer. See United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., Inc., \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, 53 S.Ct. 283, decided January 9, 1933. He must compare the income of the taxpayer with that of corporations he deems representative in order to determine abnormality or gross disproportion between capital and income. When he comes to compute the ratio or rate of tax to be applied to the taxpayer's net income, as prescribed in section 328, he obviously will consider as a factor the ratio of tax to net income of the same representative corporations he examined for the purpose of deciding whether he should grant special assessment under section 327(d).\n The parties are in agreement that the Williamsport Wire Rope Co. Case, supra, precludes revision, correction, or abrogation of the Commissioner's administrative discretionary findings, where, as here, there is no allegation of fraud. On the one hand the petitioners claim that the decisions below amount to such abrogation and the making of a new finding as to the right of special assessment and a fresh computation of the tax upon revised net income; on the other, the respondent says that the courts recognized the binding character of the Commissioner's findings, enforced rather than set aside his allowance of relief, and adopting the rate found by him, applied it to the true statutory net income as judicially determined in accordance with law.\n We think the petitioners' position is correct. The taxpayer's true net income was an essential factor in the problem. Until that was known the Commissioner could make no proper or satisfactory comparison with conditions prevailing in other corporations similarly circum- \n\n[288 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n stanced. We cannot say that if the income had been substantially less than the figure he used he would have granted special assessment under section 327(d). Moreover, with a different net income, he might well have had to compare the relevant conditions in respondent's business with the operating results of corporations other than those he selected on the basis of respondent's net income as found, and might have concluded that a different ratio of tax to net income was applicable in respondent's case.\n The grant of special assessment and the ascertainment of the rate or ratio of tax to be applied to the net income of the taxpayer are indissolubly connected by the terms of the statute. The exercise of the discretion in both aspects is committed to the Commissioner and to the Board of Tax Appeals upon review of his action. That discretion cannot be reviewed by the courts, nor exercised by them in place of the administrative officer designated by law. It is beyond the power of a court to usurp the Commissioner's function of finding that special assessment should be accorded, and equally so to substitute its discretion for his as to the factors to be used in computing the tax. The courts below were in error in adopting the rate chosen by the Commissioner and applying it to a net income other than that which he used in making his comparisons and arriving at the rate. The respondent's tax could only be computed in accordance with section 301 or under section 328. The former prescribes the elements to be considered, and error in the computation remains subject to judicial correction; the latter grants the taxpayer the benefit of discretionary action by the Commissioner, and precludes judicial revision or alteration of the computation of the tax.\n The judgments must be reversed and the cases remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

Also, the identical provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 32, 33 (26 USCA  960 note); and the substantially similar ones of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 838,  161 and 162 ( 26 USCA  2161, 2162).\n In each cause the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed the portion of the income from the trust created by the husband's will which had been paid to the widow. The trustees claimed credit therefor. The Board of Tax Appeals approved the assessments. The Circuit Courts of Appeals held otherwise.\n Causes Nos. 75, 76, and 78 involve the same point of law. The undisputed facts are similar and it will suffice to state those of No. 75. The record in No. 77 presents another question and the facts there will be set out.\n No. 75.\n William B. Butterworth, resident of Pennsylvania, died October 5, 1921. After certain bequests, his will gave the residue of the estate to respondents as trustees, with directions to pay the net income to the widow. She accepted under the will and surrendered the rights granted her by the state laws. During 1924 and 1925 the trustees paid her the income from the trust. The aggregate of these and antecedent payments was less than the estimated \n\n[290 U.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n value of her statutory rights in the estate. In order to ascertain the taxable income of the trust, the respondents claimed the right to deduct from the gross amount payments made to the widow. The Commissioner denied this and the Board of Tax Appeals approved his action. The court below reversed the judgment.\n Prior to Warner v. Walsh (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 367, United States v. Bolster (C.C.A.) 26 F.(2d) 760, 59 A.L.R. 491, and Allen v. Brandeis (C.C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 36o, the Commissioner ruled that distributions from the income of a trust estate to the widow who elected to take under the husband's will in lieu of her statutory interest were taxable to her. These cases held that by relinquishment of her rights, she came to occupy the position of the purchaser of an annuity. They decided that payments to her were not subject to taxation until her total receipts from the trust estate amounted to the value of what she relinquished-her alleged capital. Thereafter, in similar cases, the Commissioner refused to give credit to the trustee for such payments and thus the present causes arose.\n We cannot accept the reasoning advanced to support the three cases just cited. The evident general purpose of the statute was to tax in some way the whole income of all trust estates. If nothing was payable to beneficiaries, the income without deduction was assessable to the fiduciary. But he was entitled to credit for any sum paid to a beneficiary within the intendment of that word, and this amount then became taxable to the beneficiary. Certainly, Congress did not intend any income from a trust should escape taxation unless definitely exempted.\n Is a widow who accepts the provisions of her husband's will and receives part or all of the income from an established trust in lieu of her statutory rights a beneficiary within the ambit of the statute? We think she is. It is unnecessary to discuss her rights or position under other circumstances. We are dealing with a tax statute and seeking to determine the will of Congress. \n\n[290 U.S. 365, 370]\n\u00a0\n When she makes her election the widow decides to accept the benefits of the will with the accompanying rights and liabilities. In no proper sense does she purchase an annuity. For reasons satisfactory to herself, she expresses a desire to occupy the position of a beneficiary and we think she should be so treated.\n The trustees in Nos. 75, 76 and 78 were entitled to the credits claimed and the judgments of the courts below therein must be affirmed.\n No. 77.\n Calvin Pardee, a resident of Pennsylvania, died March 18, 1923. His will provided: 'I also give unto my said wife an annuity of Fifty thousand Dollars ($50,000.), to be computed from the date of my decease and to be paid in advance in quarterly payments.' The total amount paid by the trustees to the widow under the will during the tax years 1924 and 1925 and prior thereto did not aggregate the value of the interest to which she would have been entitled had she declined to take under the will. When computing the taxable income of the estate the trustees deducted the amounts paid to the widow, claiming credit therefor under section 219. The Commissioner's refusal to allow this was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals. The court below ruled otherwise.\n The annuity provided by the will for Mrs. Pardee was payable at all events. It did not depend upon income from the trust estate. She elected to accept this in lieu of her statutory rights. She chose to assume the position of an ordinary legatee. Section 213(b)(3), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 267, 268 (26 USCA  954 and note), exempts bequests from the income tax there laid. Payments to Mrs. Pardee by the fiduciary were not necessarily made from income. The charge was upon the estate as a whole; her claim was payable without regard to income received by the fiduciary. Payments to her were not distribution of income; \n\n[290 U.S. 365, 371]\n\u00a0\n but in discharge of a gift or legacy. The principle applied in Burnet v. Whitehouse, \n283 \nU.S. 148\n, 51 S.Ct. 374, 73 A.L.R. 1534, is applicable.\n The Commissioner rightly refused to allow the credits claimed by the trustee and the judgment of the court below must be reversed.\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting.\n I agree with the opinion of the Court in Nos. 75, 76, and 78. I am unable to agree with the opinion in No. 77. In that case, the testator created a trust for the benefit of his wife, children, and grandchildren. The income of the trust, by its express terms, was to be paid to his wife to the extent of $50,000 a year. While the payment of this annual amount was also charged on the principal of the estate, resort could not be had to the principal if the income of the trust was sufficient. Johnston's Estate, 264 Pa. 71, 76, 107 A. 335. The widow was in every sense of the word a beneficiary of the trust, and the amounts paid to her out of the income of the trust were paid to her as a beneficiary. These amounts were thus deductible by the trustees, under the express provision of section 219(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  960 note), from the gross income of the trust. As to this, I think it makes no difference whether or not the widow was taxable on the amount of the income she received. The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 275:\n Section 219.

Wofford Wait, of Tampa, Fla., and J. N. Nathans and John P. Grace, both of Charileston, S.C., for appellant.\n Mr. Irvine F. Belser, of Columbia, S.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railroad Commission of South Carolina brought this suit in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the state seeking the enforcement of the state statutes regulating transportation by motor vehicles. \n1\n The peti- \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n tion alleged that the respondents below, including the present appellant, fell within Class F of motor vehicle carriers, that is, those known as contract carriers of property, not proposing to operate upon a regular schedule or over a regular route, and that they were carrying on their business on the public highways without having obtained the required certificates or paying the prescribed license fees. Appellant demurred to the petition and also made return and answer. The petitioners filed reply. Appellant contended that the statutory requirements, as applied to him as a private contract carrier, denied the equal protection of the laws and deprived him of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also, as he was engaged in interstate transportation, were repugnant to the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the state decided the federal questions adversely to these contentions. 168 S.C. 440, 167 S.E. 674, 679.\n First. It was competent for the state in exercising its control over the use of the highways to make reasonable regulations governing that use by private contract carriers. These regulations may require on the part of interstate as well as intrastate carriers the payment of reasonable license fees and the filing of insurance policies to protect the interests of the public by securing compensation for injuries to third persons and their property from the negligent operations of such carriers. Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 365\n, 366 S., 52 S.Ct. 595, 81 A.L.R. 1402; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 274\n, 277 S., 53 S. Ct. 181. The statutory requirements, in this instance, do not compel private contract carriers to become common carriers. Stephenson v. Binford, supra, 287 U.S. pages 265, 275, 53 S.Ct. 181. The contention that private contract carriers are required to carry 'cargo insurance' (Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 577\n, 45 S.Ct. 191, 36 A.L.R. 1105) is unavailing in view of the construction to the contrary placed upon the statute by the state court. That court said: \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n 'Our statute, however, like that construed in the Stephenson Case, expressly recognizes the distinction between common carriers and private contract carriers; and from an examination of the entire act it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to put common carriers and private contract carriers on the same footing with regard to the matters here complained of. We think, and so hold, that in the case of private carriers, or contract carriers, the provisions of section 8511 extend no further than to require such carriers to execute an indemnity bond, as the commission may prescribe under the provisions of the act, for the protection of the public receiving injury, either in person or in property, by reason of any act of negligence of such private or contract carriers. We do not think it was the intent of the Legislature, in the passage of the act, to require contract carriers to obtain and carry cargo insurance, and we construe the act as not imposing upon them such requirement.'\n Appellant complains of this construction of the statute as being contrary to its terms, but that question is not for us. The decision of the state court is controlling as to the meaning and extent of the statutory requirements. St. Louis, Southwestern R. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S.Ct. 99; Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 33 S., 44 S.Ct. 432; American Railway Express Co. v. F. S. Royster Guano Co., \n273 \nU.S. 274, 280\n, 47 S.Ct. 355. Nor does the statute as construed exhibit a fatal defect of indefiniteness. Its requirements as to the appellant, as the state court has defined them, are not uncertain.\n Another objection, that the Railroad Commission was authorized to regulate the rates of private contract carriers, was answered by the state court in saying that the Commission had never exercised such a power, 'if any it has under the act,' and hence that appellant had no ground for complaint. This is an adequate answer here, \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n on the present showing, as the Court does not deal with academic contentions. Stephenson v. Binford, supra, 287 U.S. page 277, 53 S.Ct. 181.\n Second. Appellant insists that an undue burden is placed upon interstate commerce because the license fees are based on the 'carrying capacity' of the vehicles. The state court held that the fees 'are collected, as provided for by section 8517, for the purpose of maintaining the public highways over which such motor vehicles shall operate, as compensation for their use.' The statute provides for the segregation, for this purpose, of the moneys collected. See Clark v. Poor, \n274 U.S. 554\n, 555-557, 47 S.Ct. 702. In this view the fees are not open to the objection raised in Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 188 S., 51 S.Ct. 380. Carrying capacity, the size and weight of trucks, unquestionably have a direct relation to the wear and hazards of the highways. It is for this reason that the authority of the state to impose directly reasonable limitations on the weight and size of vehicles, although applicable to interstate carriers, has been sustained. Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S.Ct. 548; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 389 S., 52 S.Ct. 581. As the state may establish such regulations directly, the state may adjust its license fees, otherwise valid as being reasonable and exacted as compensation for the use of the highways, according to carrying capacity in furtherance of the same purpose. Clark v. Poor, supra.\n Third. The contention that appellant has been denied the equal protection of the laws is based on the discrimination resulting from the exemption of 'farmers or dairymen, hauling dairy or farm products; or lumber haulers engaged in transporting lumber and logs from the forest to the shipping points.' Section 8508. Reliance is placed on our decision in Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, 587. In that case, the statute applied to all carriers for compensation over regular routes and exempted from its provisions 'any \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 174]\n\u00a0\n transportation company engaged exclusively in the transporting agricultural, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and Salt Fish and Oysters and Shrimp from the point of production to the assembling or shipping point enroute to primary market, or to motor vehicles used exclusively in transporting or delivering dairy products.' This distinction was thus established between all carriers, and between private carriers, notwithstanding the fact that they were 'alike engaged in transporting property for compensation over public highways between fixed termini or over a regular route.' The court was unable to find any justification for this discrimination between carriers in the same business and operating under like circumstances, that is, between those who carried for hire farm products, or milk or butter, or fish or oysters, and those who carried for hire bread or sugar, or tea or coffee, or groceries in general, or other useful commodities. Id., 283 U.S. pages 566, 567, 51 S.Ct. 582\n\n\n In Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra, 286 U.S. pages 372, 373, 52 S.Ct. 595, 602, 81 A.L.R. 1402, the statutory exemption ran to one 'who is carrying his own live stock and farm products to market or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle.' Attention was called to the factual basis for the distinction as it had been pointed out by the District Court, which found a practical difference between the case of those 'who operate fleets of trucks in the conduct of their business and who use the highways daily in the delivery of their products to their customers' and that of 'a farmer who hauls his wheat or live stock to town once or twice a year.' This Court said that the Legislature in making its classification was entitled to consider frequency and character of use and to adapt its regulations to the classes of operations which by reason of their habitual and constant use of the highways brought about the conditions making regulation imperative and created the necessity for the imposition of a tax for maintenance and reconstruction. The Court \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n quoted the observation in Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 513\n, 514 S., 51 S. Ct. 273, 274, 75 A.L.R. 9: 'The distinction between property employed in conducting a business which requires constant and unusual use of the highways and property not so employed is plain enough.'\n The exemptions in the instant case are not as limited as that in Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, but they differ materially from that found to be objectionable in Smith v. Cahoon. The state court thus construed the scope, and described the effect, of the exemption in favor of farmers and dairymen: 'Unquestionably, the use by farmers and dairymen for the transportation of farm and dairy products is seasonal and involves only a moderate use of the highways; and the exemption here is further limited by the fact that it can apply only to one whose principal business is that of a farmer or dairyman and not to one merely incidentally engaged in farming or dairying.' Further, in its pleading, the Railroad Commission averred that it had uniformly construed the statute 'as exempting farmers and dairymen only when hauling their own product, or only when hauling them occasionally and not as a regular business' and had adopted a formal regulation to that effect. \n2\n In support of its pleading, and \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 176]\n\u00a0\n made a part of it, the Commission presented an affidavit by the Superintendent of the Motor Transportation Division of the Commission showing the manner in which the statute had been applied.\n The state court in its opinion said that it reached its conclusion as to the validity of the statutory provision 'independently of the construction placed by the Railroad Commission upon the contested provision of the act.' And the Court pointed out that that construction was 'in part' unsound inasmuch as 'one hauling his own products in his own motor vehicle' did not come within the purview of the act and no provision for his exemption was necessary. 'The exemption,' said the Court, 'can refer only to farmers and dairymen hauling farm and dairy products for compensation.' The state court, however, did not express disagreement with the Commission's construction set forth in its regulation, that the exemption applied 'to farmers and dairymen who occasionally, but do not regularly as a part of an established business, haul farm and\/or dairy products for others for hire, but that persons who may also be engaged in part in farming operations but who make a regular business of transporting farm and\/or dairy or other products for others for hire are not to be deemed farmers or dairymen for the purpose of this Act, and hence are required to comply with the Act, and hence spects like other persons engaged in motor transportation for hire.' Nor have we anything before us to show that the statute is being enforced and the exemption construed in any other sense. Upon the present record, it appears that the exemption is applied with two limitations, first, that, as construed by the state court, it can refer only 'to one whose principal business is that of a farmer or dairyman and not to one merely incidentally engaged in farming or dairying,' and, second, under the construction of the Commission in enforcing the statute-a construction not disapproved by \n\n[290 U.S. 169, 177]\n\u00a0\n the state court-that it applies only to farmers and dairymen who occasionally, and not as a regular business, transport farm or dairy products for compensation. We cannot say that a classification based on such a use of the highways is an arbitrary one and thus encounters constitutional objection.\n The exemption in favor of those hauling lumber and logs 'from the forest to the shipping points' relates to a limited class of transportation simply to places of shipment and does not appear to be unreasonable. See Sproles v. Binford, supra, 286 U.S. page 394, 52 S.Ct. 581.\n The judgment of the state court is affirmed.

Hays, of New York City, for respondent Oursler. \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Pepper, of New York City, for respondents Lewis & Harris.\n Mrs. Emily Holt, of New York City, for respondent Brentano.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners brought this suit to enjoin respondents from publicly producing, presenting, or performing a play called 'The Spider,' on the ground that it infringed a copyrighted play of petitioners, called 'The Evil Hour.' There was also a prayer for damages and an accounting. The bill, as amended, alleged that 'The Evil Hour' had been composed by petitioners and duly copyrighted under the laws of the United States; that the play thereafter was revised, but the revision was uncopyrighted; that the play, both in its copyrighted and its revised uncopyrighted form, was submitted to certain of the respondents, who considered and discussed its production; that the feature of the play consisted in the representation of a spiritualistic seance on the stage, with the audience taking part therein; that respondents were the owners of 'The Spider,' also copyrighted, but as originally produced containing no representation of a spiritualistic seance of any kind; that respondents, instead of producing petitioners' play, altered their own by incorporating therein the idea of a spiritualistic seance on the stage, and also certain incidental 'business and effects' and certain portions of 'The Evil Hour'; that their action in that respect was a violation of the copyright laws of the United States, and also constituted 'unfair business practices and unfair competition against the (petitioners).' The parties are citizens of the same state.\n The trial court, considering the claim of infringement on the merits, found that 'The Spider' did not infringe in any way 'The Evil Hour,' in contravention of the copyright law of the United States, and concluded that, \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 240]\n\u00a0\n in view thereof, the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the allegations in so far as they were based upon claims other than for a violation of the copyright law. A decree followed dismissing the bill. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed upon the authority of cases cited. 61 F.( 2d) 1031\n\n\n It is apparent from the language of the trial court that the claim of unfair competition in respect of the copyrighted play, as well as in respect of the uncopyrighted version, was rejected, not on the merits, but for lack of jurisdiction. In that view the decree of the court was assailed and defended here.\n One. We consider the question first from the standpoint of the copyrighted play. While, as presently will appear, the claim of unfair competition is without merit and the dismissal must stand in any event, it is important that, if the determination of the court was put upon the wrong ground, we should so declare, that it may not be followed as a precedent.\n The unfair competition in respect of the copyrighted play, according to the allegations, results from the same acts which constitute the infringement and is inseparable therefrom. The court below proceeded upon the theory that the allegations of the bill in respect of infringement presented a substantial federal question. Certainly, the question is not plainly unsubstantial; and the jurisdiction of the federal court was rightly upheld. Disposal of the infringement, therefore, on the merits was proper; and the precise question for determination is whether the claim of unfair competition was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or, likewise, should have been considered and disposed of on the merits.\n A multitude of cases in the lower federal courts have dealt with the question in its various phases and have reached different conclusions. The opinions present a great variety of views and of differences. We shall not \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 241]\n\u00a0\n undertake to review these cases. A few out of many are mentioned in the footnote1 as illustrative of the confusion and as indicating the importance of attempting to formulate some rule on the subject. And to that end we first direct attention to certain decisions of this court which seem most nearly in point.\n In Stark Bros. Nurseries & Orchards Co. v. Stark, \n255 \nU.S. 50\n, 41 S. Ct. 221, suit was brought for infringement of a trade-mark and unfair competition. The Circuit Court of Appeals limited damages to the date when notice was given of the registered mark, and refused to allow damages for earlier injuries. This court point out that the suit was for infringement of a \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n registered trade-mark, not simply of a trade-mark, and that this was the scope of the federal jurisdiction. Agreeing with the lower court that the cause of action for the earlier damages lay outside the federal jurisdiction, this court assumed, though without deciding, that plaintiff 'could recover for unfair competition that was inseparable from the statutory wrong, but it court not reach back and recover for earlier injuries to rights derived from a different source.'\n In that view, so far as the unfair competition alleged was thus inseparable from the statutory wrong, it would seem that a failure to establish the infringement would not have deprived the federal court of jurisdiction of the claim of unfair competition, but would have left that matter to be disposed of upon the merits. And that is the effect of the decision of this court in Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 U.S. 593\n, 607-610, 46 S.Ct. 367, 45 A.L.R. 1370. In that case federal jurisdiction was invoked under the federal anti-trust laws. The answer set up a counterclaim nonfederal in character, but arising out of the same transaction. This court held that, although the allegations of the bill were insufficient to make a case under the federal law, they were not plainly unsubstantial so as to deprive the federal court of jurisdiction, and sustained a dismissal of the bill on the merits and not for the want of jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we held, under Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA  723), that the counterclaim was so much a part of the case sought to be stated in the bill that the dismissal of the latter on the merits did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to dispose of the former on the merits. We think the question there and the one here, in principle, cannot be distinguished. That a statement of the particular counterclaim there was required by the rule is not material, since the federal jurisdiction can neither be extended nor abridged by a rule of court. \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n As early as Osborn v. Bank of U.S., 9 Wheat. 738, 823, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said:\n'We think, then that when a question to which the judicial power of the Union is extended by the constitution, forms an ingredient of the original cause, it is in the power of congress to give the circuit courts jurisdiction of that cause, although other questions of fact or of law may be involved in it.'\n\n In Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S.Ct. 451, 455, the bill sought to enjoin the enforcement of an order made by the Railroad Commission of Kentucky fixing intrastate rates of transportation upon the railroad of the company. The validity of the order was assailed on the ground that the Kentucky statute under which the commission assumed to act was violative of the Federal Constitution in several particulars, and upon the further ground that such order was unauthorized by the state statute. This court held that the Circuit Court, having acquired jurisdiction by reason of the federal questions involved, 'had the right to decide all the questions in the case, even though it decided the Federal questions adversely to the party raising them, or even if it omitted to decide them at all, but decided the case on local or state questions only.'\n Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256\n, 39 S.Ct. 454, involved, among other things, the validity of an ordinance assessing an annual occupation tax upon gas companies in the city. The ordinance was attacked on the ground that it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also upon grounds of state law. The federal District Court held that the ordinance violated the Constitution of Nebraska, and upon that ground granted a permanent injunction against its enforcement. This court, in disposing of the appeal, said (page 264 of 250 U.S., 39 S.Ct. 454, 456): ' ... If the bill presented a substantial controversy under the Constitution of the United States, and the requisite \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n amount was involved, the jurisdiction extended to the determination of all questions, including questions of state law, and irrespective of the disposition made of the federal questions.'\n These decisions are illustrative of many cases where the rule has been stated and restated in substantially the same way. See Louisville & Nash. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 303\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 586\n, 587 S., 34 S.Ct. 372; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S.Ct. 673, Ann.Cas.1917E, 88; Louisville & Nash. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, 37 S.Ct. 683, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 97; Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478, 482\n, 42 S.Ct. 164; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 393\n, 394 S., 53 S.Ct. 190.\n Leschen & Sons Rope Co. v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., \n201 \nU.S. 166\n, 26 S.Ct. 425, is said to establish a different doctrine. In that case the plaintiff alleged that it owned a duly registered trade-mark which had been infringed by defendant. Upon demurrer the bill was dismissed on the ground that it disclosed that the trade-mark was not a lawful and valid trade-mark. This court sustained the dismissal for want of jurisdiction, holding that the jurisdiction of the federal court depended entirely upon whether the registered trade-mark was valid. Having held that the lower court was without jurisdiction because of the invalidity of the trade-mark, the court further said that jurisdiction of the case could not then be assumed as one wherein the defendant had made use of the device for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and palming off its goods as those of plaintiff's manufacture.\n Whether the court was right or wrong in denying jurisdiction to consider the claim of infringement, the ground of the decision seems to be that such denial necessarily carried with it, also for lack of jurisdiction, any claim of unfair competition dependent upon the same facts. That is to say, if the court had no jurisdiction of the former claim, it followed that it had no jurisdiction of the latter. Whether the federal question averred by the bill was plainly unsubstantial was not considered. The court \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n summarily disposed of the matter (page 172 of 201 U.S., 26 S.Ct. 425, 427) in a single sentence: 'Our jurisdiction depends solely upon the question whether plaintiff has a registered trademark, valid under the act of Congress, and, for the reasons above given, we think it has not.' This is a broad statement, which, taken literally, applies whether the invalidity of the registry so appears on the face of the bill as to render the federal question plainly unsubstantial, or, the bill being sufficient to meet this test, such invalidity is otherwise disclosed.\n Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., \n179 \nU.S. 665, 677\n, 21 S.Ct. 270, 275, goes no further than to recognize the same doctrine, the court simply saying: 'Was it a lawfully registered trademark? If the absolute right to the word as a trademark belonged to appellant, then the circuit court (89 F. 487) had jurisdiction under the statute to award relief for infringement; but if it were not a lawfully registered trademark, then the circuit court of appeals (94 F. 667) correctly held that jurisdiction could not be maintained.'\n We shall not attempt to harmonize the two cases last cited with the Siler and the other cases following it. It is not easy to do so unless on the ground that cases involving patents, trade-marks, and copyrights constitute an exception to the general rule stated in the Siler and other like cases. And accepting the view that this is the effect of the Leschen & Sons Rope and the Elgin Nat. Watch Cases, supra, we are of opinion that such a distinction is altogether unsound. The Siler and like cases announce the rule broadly, without qualification; and we perceive no sufficient reason for the exception suggested. It is stated in these decisions as a rule of general application, and we hold it to be such-as controlling in patent, trade-mark, and copyright cases as it was in the cases where it is announced.\n But the rule does not go so far as to permit a federal court to assume jurisdiction of a separate and distinct nonfederal cause of action because it is joined in the \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 246]\n\u00a0\n same complaint with a federal cause of action. The distinction to be observed is between a case where two distinct grounds in support of a single cause of action are alleged, one only of which presents a federal question, and a case where two separate and distinct causes of action are alleged, one only of which is federal in character. In the former, where the federal question averred is not plainly wanting in substance, the federal court, even though the federal ground be not established, may nevertheless retain and dispose of the case upon the nonfederal ground; in the latter it may not do so upon the nonfederal cause of action.\n The case at bar falls within the first category. The bill alleges the violation of a single right; namely, the right to protection of the copyrighted play. And it is this violation which constitutes the cause of action. Indeed, the claims of infringement and unfair competition so precisely rest upon identical facts as to be little more than the equivalent of different epithets to characterize the same group of circumstances. The primary relief sought is an injunction to put an end to an essentially single wrong, however differently characterized, not to enjoin distinct wrongs constituting the basis for independent causes of action. The applicable rule is stated, and authorities cited, in Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 600. 'A cause of action does not consist of facts,' this court there said (page 321 of 274 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 600, 602), 'but of the unlawful violation of a right which the facts show. The number and variety of the facts alleged do not establish more than one cause of action so long as their result, whether they be considered severally or in combination, is the violation of but one right by a single legal wrong. ... 'The facts are merely the means, and not the end. They do not constitute the cause of action, but they show its existence by making the wrong appeal.\" \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 247]\n\u00a0\n Thus tested, the claims of infringement and of unfair competition averred in the present bill of complaint are not separate causes of action, but different grounds asserted in support of the same cause of action.\n We do not mean by what has just been said to lay down a hard and fast test by which to determine in all situations what constitutes a cause of action. 'A 'cause of action' may mean one thing for one purpose and something different for another,' United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S.Ct. 278, 280, decided January 9, 1933; but, for the purpose of determining the bounds between state and federal jurisdiction, the meaning should be kept within the limits indicated. Compare Baltimore & O.S.W.R. Co. v. Carroll, \n280 \nU.S. 491, 494\n, 495 S., 50 S. Ct. 182, and cases cited.\n It is entirely plain that the holding of the trial court disposing of the claim of infringement on the merits also disposed of the claim of unfair competition in respect of the copyrighted play, since both depended upon the same allegations of wrongful appropriation of certain parts of, and conceptions embodied in, petitioners' play. The finding of the court is comprehensive-' That no version of the defendants' play 'The Spider' infringed in any way, either with respect to plot, material, arrangement or sequence of events, or incidents, or otherwise, the plaintiffs' copyrighted play.' This finding-not challenged here-contains every essential element necessary to justify the conclusion that there was likewise no unfair competition in respect of the copyrighted play, since it negatives the allegations of the bill made for the purpose of establishing by the same facts an infringement of the copyrighted play and unfair competition in relation thereto. Upon this finding the court was right in dismissing the bill in so far as it set up a claim of unfair business practices and unfair competition; but was wrong in dismissing it for the want of jurisdiction. It \n\n[289 U.S. 238, 248]\n\u00a0\n should have been dismissed, as was the infringement claim, upon the merits. Since a decree to that effect must follow, upon this record, as a matter of course, no further proceedings in the District Court are necessary. Accordingly the decree will be modified in the respect suggested, and as so modified, will be affirmed.\n Two. During the pendency of the suit petitioners amended their bill so as to make its allegations apply to the uncopyrighted version of their play, namely, that the wrongful acts of respondents were in violation of the rights of petitioners and constituted unfair business practices and unfair competition with respect to that version as well as to the original. Since that claim did not rest upon any federal ground and was wholly independent of the claim of copyright infringement, the District Court was clearly right in dismissing it for want of jurisdiction. The bill as amended, although badly drawn, sets forth facts alleged to be in violation of two distinct rights, namely, the right to the protection of the copyrighted play, and the right to the protection of the uncopyrighted play. From these averments two separate and distinct causes of action resulted, one arising under a law of the United States, and the other arising under general law. For reasons that have already been made manifest, the latter is entirely outside the federal jurisdiction and subject to dismissal at any stage of the case. It is hardly necessary to say that a federal court is without the judicial power to entertain a cause of action not within its jurisdiction, merely because that cause of action has mistakenly been joined in the complaint with another which is within its jurisdiction.\n Decree modified in accordance with the foregoing opinion, and, as modified, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE think the decree should be affirmed without modification. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some cases seem to hold that, however intimately the claims of unfair competition and infringement are related, the federal court is without power to consider the former. Planten v. Gedney (C.C.A.) 224 F. 382, 386; Recamier Mfg. Co. v. Harriet Hubbard Ayer, Inc. (D.C.) 59 F.(2d) 802, 806. This is what is sometimes spoken of as the 'second circuit rule,' and has been followed in a large number of cases. Other cases have denied jurisdiction on the ground that the two claims constitute separate causes of action, although in some the separateness does not clearly appear. United States Expansion Bolt Co. v. H. G. Kroncke Hardware Co. (C.C.A.) 234 F. 868, 872-875. Compare Moore v. N.Y. Cotton Exchange, \n270 U.S. 593\n, 607, et seq., 46 S.Ct. 367, 45 A.L.R. 1370; Dickinson Tire & Machine Co. v. Dickinson (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 493. In Onondaga Indian Wigwam Co. v. Ka-Noo-No Indian Mfg. Co. (C.C.) 182 F. 832, the rule of the Siler Case, \n213 \nU.S. 175\n, 29 S.Ct. 451, was definitely applied to a case where the acts of defendant were alleged as constituting an infringement of a patent and also unfair competition. Some courts have taken jurisdiction of unfair competition in infringement suits as an element constituting 'aggravation of damages.' Ludwigs v. Payson Mfg. Co. ( C.C.A.) 206 F. 60, 65; W. F. Burns Co. v. Automatic Recording Safe Co. (C. C.A.) 241 F. 472, 486; Payton v. Ideal Jewelry Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 7 F.(2d) 113. Relief has been denied for unfair competition where the patent or trademark has been held valid but not infringed-Sprigg v. Fisher (D.C.) 222 F. 964; Detroit Showcase Co. v. Kawneer Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 250 F. 234, 240; Taylor v. Bostick (C.C.A.) 299 F. 232, while the contrary is stated with much force in Vogue Co. v. Vogue Hat Co. (C.C.A.) 12 F.(2d) 991, 992- 995.

UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 767\nArgued: April 21, 1933Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and\n Mr. Seth W. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edgar Watkins and Mac Asbill, both of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The claim of the Chestatee Pyrites & Chemical Corporation for compensation under the War Minerals Relief ct, March 2, 1919, c. 94,  5, 40 Stat. 1272, 1274 (50 USCA  80 note), is here for the fourth time. \n1\n Before the World War the company \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n owned a pyrites mine. In 1918, it made extensive enlargements of its plant at the request of the Secretary of the Interior. As hostilities ceased soon thereafter, the undertaking resulted in a large loss. Prior to 1922, it made applications for relief from the losses suffered. These applications resulted in awards aggregating $737,765.24. Of this amount $ 223,529.17 was paid by the government on October 25, 1919; $469,784.62 on October 5, 1922; and $44,451.45 on March 14, 1932.2\n The demand now presented is for the further sum of $524,276.43, alleged to have been due December 31, 1931; and for additional amounts which cannot be stated definitely because they are accruing daily. These sums, claimed as items of loss, represent interest paid or accrued since March 2, 1919, on a contract to repay with interest $645,000 borrowed by the corporation in 1918, mainly in order to pay for enlarging the plant. \n3\n In 1922, the Secretary had, in calculating losses suffered, refused to allow any sum paid for interest on borrowed money. The corporation thereupon sought, by mandamus, to compel the award of interest. In that proceeding this court held, in 1925, that mandamus must be denied, because the act made the determination of the Secretary conclusive. \n4\n Work v. U.S. ex rel. Chestatee Pyrites & Chemical Corporation, \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n \n267 \nU.S. 185\n, 45 S.Ct. 256. The proceeding at bar is a second petition for mandamus, filed pursuant to an amendment of the act made February 13, 1929, c. 182, 45 Stat. 1166, which authorized a claimant thereunder to 'petition the Supreme Court of the District Court of Columbia to review the final decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon any question of law which has arisen or which may hereafter arise in the adjustment, liquidation and payment of his claim under said Acts.'\n The corporation sought in the second petition for mandamus, as in the first, to compel the Secretary to consider, in determining the amount of net losses, interest payable on borrowed money. The trial court denied the mandamus. Its judgment was reversed by the District Court of Appeals, 60 App.D.C. 62, 47 F. (2d) 424; and in sustaining the reversal, in Wilbur v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 231, 237\n, 238 S., 52 S.Ct. 113, 115, we said: 'The amount of interest that at the time of the passage of the Relief Act March 2, 1919, had been paid or incurred by relator for money borrowed and lost in producing and preparing to produce pyrites upon the specified conditions, is to be taken into account in determining the amount of its net loss as of that date.' Thereupon, the Secretary made an award of $44,451.45, this amoun being, as stated by him, 'the amount of interest that at the time of the passage of the act of Congress of March 2, 1919, had been paid on the obligations incurred by the relator for money borrowed and lost in producing and preparing to produce pyrites ... and preparing to produce pyrites ... and for which in justice and equity the relator was entitled to receive reimbursement. ...'\n The corporation insists that there should, as stated, be allowed as part of its net loss, on account of interest payable on borrowed money, the further sum of $524,276.43, and, also, additional amounts which cannot be \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n definitely stated now. The $524,276.43 represents interest paid or accrued between March 2, 1919, and December 31, 1931, growing out of obligations for borrowed money outstanding March 2, 1919. The claim for additional unascertained amounts represents the interest which has accrued on those obligations since December 31, 1931, plus that which will accrue hereafter on such parts thereof as may, from time to time, be outstanding. To enforce this demand, the corporation secured a rule upon the Secretary to show cause why he had not complied with the decree entered pursuant to our decision in the Wilbur case. The Secretary averred that he had fully complied therewith, by allowing all interest paid or accrued to March 2, 1919; and that this was all the interest 'for which in justice and equity the relator was entitled to receive reimbursement from the appropriation made by Congress for the payment of such losses.' The District Court sustained the position of the Secretary. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District, 61 App.D.C. 324, 62 F.(2d) 863. This Court granted certiorari, \n289 \nU.S. 715\n, 53 S.Ct. 527, 77 L.Ed. --. We think the District Court was right.\n First. The corporation contends that in computing losses which 'have been suffered' as of March 2, 1919, no distinction can be drawn between the principal of the loan and the interest thereon; that as the amount of the principal was included without question in ascertaining the loss as of March 2, 1919, although the loan was not then due, the amount of the interest should similarly be included, whether it had been paid or had accrued as of that date or had accrued later. The argument rests upon a misconception.\n Congress did not authorize or direct the Secretary of the Interior to pay any loan of a claimant. Section 5 of the War Minerals Relief Act, March 2, 1919, authorized \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary to 'adjust, liquidate, and pay such net losses as have been suffered by any person, firm, or corporation, by reason of producing or preparing to produce ... pyrites ... in compliance with the request or demand of the Department of the Interior ... to supply the urgent needs of the Nation in the prosecution of the war.' \n5\n The $645,000 capital raised by the loan, like some other capital of the corporation, was wiped out by the deficit in operation and the shrinkage of capital assets. And for the loss thus sustained, the corporation was reimbursed by the payments under the award made. The cost to the corporation of carrying the loan after March 2, 1919, was not part of the net losses which had 'been suffered.'\n The method of determining the net losses in such businesses during a particular period, or in a particular adventure, is well settled. \n6\n The net losses consist of any deficit from operations plus any shrinkage in value of the plant investment. In calculating the loss for a period it is immaterial whether items entered as operating expense or as investment have been paid or are still owed for. If the capital employed by the corporation during the period, whether owned or borrowed, was sunk, its loss \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n will necessarily be reflected either in the deficit from operations or in the shrinkage in value of the capital assets. In calculating the operating deficit during the period ending March 2, 1919, interest paid or accrued on the borrowed capital was treated as an operating charge. Interest accruing thereafter on any loan then outstanding is comparable to the cost of caring, after that date, for property retained-or to a lessening, after that date, of the value of that property. Such items enter into the determination of the losses of a later period; and with these the government has no concern. Hence, the Secretary property refused to consider interest accrued after March 2, 1919, in calculating losses during the period ending that day.\n Second. The corporation insists that the act should be construed as requiring the Secretary to include as an item in the loss suffered before March 2, 1919, all interest thereafter accruing on an 'obligation incurred' before that date. It argues that a liberal construction of the act requires this conclusion, United States v. New York, \n160 \nU.S. 598, 620\n, 16 S.Ct. 402, particularly in view of related legislation. \n7\n In support of that construction, it points to provisos of section 5 which declare (1) that 'no claim shall be allowed or paid' by the Secretary 'unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said Secretary that the expenditures so made or obligations so incurred ... were made in good faith' and (2) 'that moneys were invested or obligations were incurred subsequent to' April 6, 1917, and \n\n[289 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n prior to November 11, 1919.8 These provisos did not by referring to obligations 'incurred' enlarge the Secretary's authority to 'pay such net losses as have been suffered.' On the contrary, their purpose was to make clear that, where expenditures were alleged, the Secretary must be satisfied that payment therefor had actually been made or that there was a valid agreement to pay therefor.\n When this court stated in the Wilbur Case that in determining the loss as of March 2, 1919, there shall be taken into account 'the amount of interest which has been paid or incurred by relator for money borrowed and lost,' the word 'incurred' was used to mean interest accrued on that date, as well as interest paid. The language of the opinion was correctly construed by th Secretary when he limited the additional award, on account of interest, to $44,451.45.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Work v.

BOARD(1933)\nNo. 356\nArgued: Decided: February 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John H. Miley, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioner.\n Mr. Hugh Webster, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent Board of Equalization of Tulsa County, Okl.\n Mr. Ernest F. Jenkins, of Stillwater, Okl., for respondent Board of County Com'rs of Payne County, Okl.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question of the validity of ad valorem taxes upon crude oil belonging to petitioner, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, and held by it in its storage tanks in Tulsa County and Payne County, Oklahoma. In each case, the tax was challenged upon the ground that the oil was exempt because in its production petitioner was operating as an instrumentality of the United States. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma sustained the taxes (13 P.(2d) 585; 14 P.(2d) 929); and the cases come here on writs of certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 223, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The facts are shown by agreed statements. The oil in question was assessed under the general laws of the State for annual ad valorem taxes as a part of the personal property of petitioner within the respective counties. It constituted petitioner's share of oil which petitioner had produced from restricted Indian lands in Seminole County, Oklahoma, under leases which had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of Congress of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312. In the Tulsa County Case (No. 356), the assessment was for the year \n\n[288 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n 1929 and included 51,630 barrels of crude oil which had been produced from the restricted lands above mentioned during the period from March 31, 1927, to June 16, 1927. This oil on production had been commingled with oil from petitioner's 'commercial' or unrestricted leasehold properties in Seminole County and had been immediately piped into petitioner's storage tanks in Tulsa County where it had remained. At the time of the removal of the oil, petitioner paid to the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes for the lessors the agreed royalty of 12 1\/2 per cent. of the gross proceeds, and the Indians owned no part of the oil in storage on January 1, 1929, the date of assessment, nor will they receive any part of the proceeds when the oil is sold by petitioner. In the Payne County Case (No. 357), the question concerns 383,307 barrels of crude oil produced from the restricted lands prior to January 1, 1928 (the assessment date) and piped, with other oil, into petitioner's storage tanks in Payne County and there held.\n In Jaybird Mining Company v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S.Ct. 592, an ad valorem tax upon ores mined under a lease of restricted Indian land and in the bins on that land on the assessment date was held to be invalid. The tax 'was assessed on the ores in mass, and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated.' Id., page 612 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 592, 593. In these circumstances the tax was regarded as an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government. That decision is not controlling in the instant case. Here, payment had been made for the share of the Indian lessors and they had no further interest in the oil. It had been commingled with other oil, had been transported from the restricted lands to petitioner's storage tanks in the taxing counties, and was there held exclusively in the interest and for the convenience of petitioner.\n There is a recognized distinction between a non-discriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of govern- \n\n[288 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n ment, albeit the property is used in, or has relation to, the business of the agency-where there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government-and a tax which is deemed to impose a direct burden upon the exertion of governmental powers.

Query, \n288 \nU.S. 178\n, 53 S.Ct. 326, decided February 6, 1933. In this instance, the tax is not on the oil leases (Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522, 530\n, 36 S.Ct. 453), or upon the privilege of extracting the oil or upon the income derived therefrom. Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. Co. v.

Such immunity as petitioner enjoyed as a governmental instrumentality inhered in its operations as such, and being for the protection of the Government in its function extended no further than was necessary for that purpose. The holding of the oil in question, which had been segregated and withdrawn from the restricted lands as petitioner's exclusive property, awaiting disposition at petitioner's pleasure, was for its sole advantage and cannot be said to be so identified with its operations as a governmental instrumentality as to entitle it to exemption from the general property taxes imposed by the State in return for the protection the State afforded. With respect to these taxes, this oil was in no different case from that of the other oil of petitioner with which it was commingled.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COM'N v. U. S. EX REL. CAMPBELL(1933)\nNo. 748\nArgued: April 21, 1933Decided: May 8, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Daniel W. Knowlton and Edward M. Reidy, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. Henry Walter and Johnston B. Campbell, both of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon a complaint filed by the Birch Valley Lumber Company against carriers by rail engaged in interstate commerce, the Interstate Commerce Commission determined that rates maintained by the carriers were unduly prejudicial to the complainant and unduly preferential to its competitors, but that the record would not support an award of damages. Thereupon the complainant sued in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus commanding the Commission to make an award of damages in accordance with stated formula. The Court of Appeals, reversing the determination of the lower court, held that the writ should issue. 61 App. D.C. 382, 63 F.(2d) 358. The case is here on certiorari. \n289 \nU.S. 714\n, 53 S.Ct. 524, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The complainant before the Commission, the respondent in this court, is a lumber company engaged in business at Tioga, West Virginia. Transportation service to and from Tioga is supplied by the Strouds Creek & Muddlety Railroad Company (the S.C. & M.), a short line railroad running from Delphi, West Virginia, to Allingdale in that state, a distance of nine and a half miles. The terminus of this road at Allingdale is a junction point with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (the B. & O.), and through it with connecting lines beyond. Lumber dealers on the route of the B. & O. have had the benefit of blanket \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n or group rates established by that road and others jointly. The complainant has had to pay the group rate, and in addition a charge for carriage on the S.C. & M., the short line connection. The result has been to put it at a disadvantage as compared with competitors in the same producing territory. 'Complainant,' it is found, 'does not question the reasonableness per se of the blanket or group rates for Allingdale or the other points in the group, but assails only what it terms the relatively high through rates from Tioga and Delphi. It also admits that the charge of the S.C. & M. is not unreasonably high.' The controversy hinges upon the effect of an unlawful preference.\n For rate-making purposes the producing territory tributary to the B. & O. in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia is divided into several groups. One of these groups known as the Richwood group has its terminus at Allingdale. So also has another group known as No. 9. Lumber dealers competing with the complainant do business within this territory, and pay the group or blanket rate, which takes no heed of distances within the group area. Cf. United States v. Ill. Central R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 522\n, 44 S.Ct. 189. In some instances the blanket rate has been extended to short line connections, but this has been exceptional, and has not included any points on the S.C. & M. The additional charge paid by the complainant for the short line connection between Allingdale and Tioga (7. 1 miles) is $15 per car. Another lumber company, engaged is business at Delphi, intervened in the proceedings and joined in the complaint. Both the complainant and the intervening shipper were 'forced to base their prices on the group rates and absorb the charges of the S.C. & M.'\n The Commission found that the failure of the carriers to establish joint or group rates over the short line connections had the effect of an undue preference to lumber companies doing business within the group territory, \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n though apart from the preference the rates were not unreasonable. Accordingly it made an order directed to the B. & O. and other connecting railroads to 'cease and desist' from the unlawful practice. There was no award of damages. 'The record,' the Commission held, 'will not support an award of reparation based on the undue prejudice found to exist\n The Interstate Commerce Act makes it unlawful for a carrier to give any undue or unreasonable preference to a person or locality, or to subject any person or locality to an undue disadvantage (24 Stat. 380,  3, and 41 Stat. 479,  408, 49 U.S.C.,  3 (49 USCA  3)), and charges the offender with liability for the full amount of damages resulting from the unlawful act. Section 8 (49 USCA  8). Upon the hearing of a complaint, the Commission is empowered to ascertain the damages and award them. Section 16(1), 49 USCA  16(1). The respondent by its complaint to the Commission invoked this dual jurisdiction, the administrative jurisdiction to prescribe a rule for the future (Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 42 S.Ct. 477; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, \n288 \nU.S. 448\n, 53 S.Ct. 441, March 13, 1933), and the judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction to give reparation for the past. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, supra. In dismissing such a complaint, the Commission speaks with finality. Its orders purely negative-negative in form and substance-are not subject to review by this court or any other. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235\n, 51 S.Ct. 429; Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229\n, 53 S.Ct. 124; Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Brady, supra. Damages for discrimination denied by the Commission are not recoverable somewhere else.\n The respondent, conceding these restrictions upon the remedies available in the courts, professes to abide by them. The argument is that damages were found by the \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n Commission, and after being found were arbitrarily withheld. Damages were found, it is said, because the evidentiary facts set forth in the findings lead to a conclusion of damage in a determinate amount, and lead to that conclusion as an inference of law. Damages, being found, were arbitrarily withheld, because discretion is excluded when the loss is ascertained. In that view, the denial of an award is the breach of a ministerial duty to be corrected by mandamus, as if a court after determining in favor of a suitor the amount of his recovery were to refuse him execution.\n\n 1. \n'The record will not support an award of reparation based on the undue prejudice found to exist.' This is not a finding that damages in the sum of $15 per car or in any other sum have been suffered by the complainant, but will not be awarded. This is a finding that upon the evidence before the Commission, which is not before us, there is not a sufficient basis for a finding of any damage whatever. Nothing in the recital of evidentiary facts is inconsistent as a matter of law with this negation of loss. The Commission does not find, and the complainant does not assert, that the rate was unreasonable in the sense that it would be subject to condemnation if a like rate had been charged to others similarly situated. What is unlawful in the action of the carriers inheres in its discriminatory quality, and not in anything else. When discrimination and that alone is the gist of the offense, the difference between one rate and another is not the measure of the damages suffered by the shipper. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184\n, 33 S.Ct. 893, Ann.Cas. 1915A, 315; Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247, 258\n, 33 S.Ct. 916; Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 534\n, 38 S.Ct. 186; Keogh v. C. & N.W.R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156, 165\n, 43 S.Ct. 47; Cf. Postal Tel.-Cable Co. v. Associated Press, 228 N.Y. 370, 379, 380, 127 N.E. 256. It is evidentiary circumstance to be viewed along \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n with others in the setting of the occasion. It is not the measure without more. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra; Keogh v. C. & N.W.R. Co., supra.\n Overcharge and discrimination have very different consequences, and must be kept distinct in thought. When the rate exacted of a shipper is excessive or unreasonable in and of itself, irrespective of the rate exacted of competitors, there may be recovery of the overcharge without other evidence of loss. 'The carrier ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum.' Southern Pac. Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., supra, page 534 of 245 U. S., 38 S.Ct. 186. But a different measure of recovery is applicable 'where a party that has paid only the reasonable rate sues upon a discrimination because some other has paid less.' Southern Pac. Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., supra. Such a one is not to recover as of course a payment reasonable in amount for a service given and accepted. He is to recover the damages that he has suffered, which may be more than the preference or less (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra, pages 206, 207 of 230 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 893), but which, whether more or less, is something to be proved and not presumed. Ibid, page 204 of 230 U.S., 33 S. Ct. 893. 'Recovery cannot be had unless it is shown, that as a result of defendants' acts, damages in some amount susceptible of expression in figures resulted.' Keogh v. C. & N.W.R. Co., supra, page 165 of 260 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 47, 50. The question is not how much better off the complainant would be today if it had paid a lower rate. The question is how much worse off it is because others have paid less.\n The answer to that question is not independent of time and place and circumstance. It calls for something more than the use of a mathematical formula. If by reason of the discrimination, the preferred producers have been \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n able to divert business that would otherwise have gone to the disfavored shipper, damage has resulted to the extent of the diverted profits. If the effect of the discrimination has been to force the shipper to sell at a lowered market price (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra, page 207 of 230 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 893; Hoover v. Penn. R.R., 156 Pa. 220, 244, 27 A. 282, 22 L.R.A. 263, 36 Am.St.Rep. 43), damage has resulted to the extent of the reduction. But none of these consequences is a necessary inference from discrimination without more. This complainant was in competition with producers in the Allingdale group. It was in competition, however, with many other producers doing business in distant territory, for its dealings were far flung. It had markets in Canada, Kentucky, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and the New England States. The finding is that 'the lumber is sold in competition with that produced throughout the country,' though 'especially with that produced in the same general territory.' For all that appears the prices charged for lumber by producers within the group were the market prices current generally throughout the entire field of competition. \n1\n If that is so, the producers in the favored territory were not making use of the preference to mark the price down to an equivalent extent, and thus deprive the complainant, less favorably situated, of a reasonable return. They were letting the price stand as it would have been if the tariff had been equal, and taking advantage of the preference to increase the profit for themselves. \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n That was gain to them but it was not loss to the complainant.\n The truth of this is seen more clearly when we keep in mind the varying methods available to remove discrimination and restore equality. The respondent argues as if there were one method, and one only, and this by cutting down the Tioga and Delphi rates and thus reducing them to the level of the rates within the group. But that is to ignore the other methods of adjustment open to the carriers. The discrimination might be removed either by cutting one set of charges down, or by lifting the other up, or by establishing a new rate intermediate between them. United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra, at page 521 of 263 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 189; American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S.Ct. 656. The situation comes out into clear relief if we assume recourse to be had to the second of these methods. Rates within the favored territory might be raised to the same level as those outside of it, and yet after the change the complainant would be no better off, if the discrimination had not tended to hold market prices down. The profit of the favored shippers would in that event be less, just as it would be if they had been receiving a rebate from the published tariff ( Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra); but because their profit would be less, the conclusion would not be inevitable that the complainant's would be greater. The two would not fluctuate in any constant ratio. There would be no necessary correspondence between preference and damage. In varied situations the Interstate Commerce Commission has thus interpreted the doctrine of the International Coal Case, and so given or withheld relief. The rulings of the Commission are consistent to the effect that the absorption by a complainant of a discriminatory charge does not avail to establish damage, or to measure its extent, in the absence of a showing that prices were affected by the differential \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n rate. \n2\n There must be full disclosure of the conditions of the business, or of those affecting competition, including, in particular, the capacity of the preferred producers to fix the prices for the market. Only then will the ultimate fact of damage emerge from the evidentiary facts as an appropriate conclusion. One cannot say from this record that there was that disclosure here.\n\n 2. \nThe result, however, would be the same if we were to assume, arguendo, that there was error of law in the refusal to find the ultimate fact of damage as an inference from the evidentiary facts set out in the decision. The respondent even then is faced with the difficulty that the Commission did not think the inference permissible, and so declined to make it. One has only to read the opinions in Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra, and the cases that have followed it, to see how much the rule of damages is beset by delicate distinctions, how pre-eminently in applying it there is a call upon the judge to think and act judicially, to use judgment and discretion. Errors of law in the discharge of a function essentially judicial are not subject to be corrected through the writ of mandamus any more than errors of fact. If the Commission had declined to listen to the claim for reparation, or finding reparation due had declined to order payment, mandamus might have been available to hold it \n\n[289 U.S. 385, 394]\n\u00a0\n to its duty. That is not what happened. The Commission heard the complaint and proceeded to a decision. If the mandamus were to stand, the result would not be to compel the Commission to adjudicate the cause, for that it has already done; the result would be to compel an adjudication in a particular way. The rule is elementary that this is not the function of the writ. Mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel a judicial officer to act. It may not be used as a substitute for an appeal or writ of error to dictate the manner of his action. Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States ex rel.

Stanley Payne, of Washington, D.C., and I. H. Van Winkle, of Salem, Or., for appellant Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 14, 21]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. C.

Hampson, of Portland, Or., for other appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Public Service Commission of Oregon filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission, against eleven railroads, including the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company, asserting they had failed and refused to provide reasonable and adequate transportation facilities to an area of some 33,000 square miles within the state. The prayer was that one or more of them be required to extend or build a line of railroad from a point near Crane to Crescent Lake or some adjacent point. Several municipalities and commercial organizations, and the Public Utilities Commission of Idaho, were given leave to be heard in support of the petition. The respondents answered that public necessity and con- \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 22]\n\u00a0\n venience would not be served by the proposed construction, and that there was no authority in law for granting the requested relief. After hearing, the Commission entered an order requiring Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company to 'extend its line of railroad, now terminating near Burns, Oreg., from, or near, a station thereon designated as Crane, Oreg., to a connection with the Cascade line of the Southern Pacific Company at, or near, Crescent Lake, Oreg.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Oregon-Washington Company thereupon filed a petition against the United States, in the District Court, to set aside, annul, and suspend the order, and to enjoin the government, its officers and agents, from enforcing the Commission's mandate. The Southern Pacific Company intervened in support of the petition, and the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Public Utilities Commissioner (the successor of the Public Service Commission) of Oregon, and the Public Utilities Commission of Idaho, were permitted to intervene, and participated in the defense of the suit. From a decree setting aside the order and granting an injunction, the three intervening defendants appealed. The United States refused to join in the appeal, and a summons and severance was duly served upon it. The appellees insist that if we should reverse the decree as to the appellants the United States would remain bound by its terms; that we may not pass upon the merits in the absence of the government, a necessary party, and should therefore dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. We shall first dispose of the question thus presented.\n Before the Commerce Court was established, suits to enjoin orders of the Commission were brought against that body, and appeals from the judgments rendered were \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 23]\n\u00a0\n prosecuted by it, in its own name. \n2\n The Act of June 18, 1910,3 created the Commerce Court, defined the jurisdiction and regulated the procedure of that tribunal, and authorized a direct appeal to this court. The Urgent Deficiencies Act,4 under which this suit was instituted, abolished the Commerce Court, transferred the jurisdiction theretofore vested in it to the several District Courts, and made the procedure therein the same as that previously followed in the Commerce Court. Existing statutes were repealed only in so far as inconsistent with the new jurisdiction conferred on district courts. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Section 4 of the Commerce Court Act (36 Stat. 542, see 28 USCA  48) directed:\n'That all cases and proceedings in the commerce court (now District Court) which but for this Act would be brought by or against the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be brought by or against the United States, and the United States may intervene in any case or proceeding in the commerce court (District Court) whenever, though it has not been made a party, public interests are involved.'\n\n Other sections permit the Commission, or complainants before the Commission, or any party in interest in a proceeding before that body, or any other interested party, to become parties to a suit involving the validity of an order of the Commission; forbid the Attorney General \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 24]\n\u00a0\n to control, dispose of, or discontinue the suit against the objection of any one as becoming a party; allow the intervener to prosecute, defend, or continue the proceeding unaffected by the action or nonaction of the Attorney General; and accord to any aggrieved party the right of appeal to this court. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission, by entering its appearance in the District Court, became a party defendant, as did the two State Utilities Commissions. The court below decided adversely to all these bodies. They are aggrieved parties granted a review by section 2; the Interstate Commerce Commission for the reason that the decree set aside its order, \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 25]\n\u00a0\n the state commissions because they officially represent the interest of their states in obtaining adequate transportation service.\n Through the present appellants were parties in the court below, as of right, and not by grace or favor, were aggrieved by the decree, and have a right of appeal, the appellees maintain this court may not hear and decide the case in the absence of the United States. While admitting interveners' right to be heard as to the substance of the decree the District Court entered against the government, the appellees assert the appellants have no standing in this court to ask modification or reversal of the decree as it affects the United States when the latter seeks no review.\n We may concede that, unless the act so directs, a reversal at the suit of the appellants will not affect the judgment as respects the United States. The injunction will stand as against the United States and its agents, because unchallenged by that defendant. Summons and severance does not cure the defect, for, though the United States has been severed by that process, if this court should reverse the decree as to other parties, but allow it to remain in force against the government, the appeal would be a vain thing. The appellants, however, contend that the legislation creates an exception to the ordinary rule governing our jurisdiction. They assert that the purpose of Congress is to permit proper parties in the District Court to carry the litigation to a final conclusion in this court.\n The statute clearly provides that, in the trial of the case, the intervening parties shall not be foreclosed by the action or nonaction of the Attorney General. Even though he concludes not to defend, they are permitted to do so. If, notwithstanding their defense, a decree goes against them and the United States, can it have been the purpose of Congress that the failure of the Attorney \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 26]\n\u00a0\n General to prosecute an appeal concludes such interveners? We think not. So to hold would render meaningless and superfluous section 2 of the act, which permits a review of the action of the court below 'if appeal to the Supreme Court be taken by an aggrieved party. ...' The section can be given effect only by holding that an aggrieved party may challenge the decree not only to vindicate his own rights, but those of the United States as well. Congress evidently intended the Attorney General should represent and protect the interests of the United States as such, but should not at any stage control the litigation against the objection of the other parties and to their disadvantage, and that any aggrieved party might obtain a decree which the United States could have secured had it defended the action or prosecuted an appeal.\n This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the form of section 5 of the Commerce Court Act as first presented and as subsequently altered by amendment. The section as originally introduced precluded the Commission and its attorneys from taking any part in suits brought to review its orders. This provision was stricken out in committee. The clause giving the Attorney General control of such cases was also modified. The stated purpose of the amendments was to prevent his forestalling the Commission or any other interested party desiring to litigate the questions involved. 7 The movers of the amendments which were ultimately incorporated in the act insisted that a party affected by the order should have the right to follow the case 'through the Commerce Court and Supreme Court,' and that 'A party litigant should always have the right to follow his case to final judgment.' \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 27]\n\u00a0\n An official may be designated to stand injudgment on behalf of the United States, so that a decree against him binds the government. \n8\n As has been stated, this was the accepted practice in suits by and against the Commission prior to the adoption of the Commerce Court Act. The new legislation might have left the rights of the United States arising out of orders of the Commission to be thus determined in the court of first instance and on appeal. But Congress had undoubted power, in naming the United States as the defendant in such suits, to give the Commission, and others having an interest authority to litigate the validity of such orders, and, regardless of joinder by the Attorney General, to obtain by appeal a review effective as to the United States. The act plainly exhibits this purpose. Should a reversal be required, the mandate may vacate the judgment against the United States though it did not join in the appeal. We think that review may not be denied for want of a necessary party, and we are therefore brought to a consideration of the merits of the cause.\n The Oregon Short Line owns all of the capital stock of the Oregon- Washington Company, and the Union Pacific owns all the capital stock of the Short Line; these three companies, with the Los Angeles and Salt Lake, make up the Union Pacific System. The main lines of the Union Pacific Railroad extend from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Kansas City, Mo., to Ogden, Utah. The Short Line runs from a connection with Union Pacific at Granger, Wyo., to Huntington, Or. From Huntington, the Oregon-Washington follows a northwesterly direction to the Columbia river, thence along the south bank of that stream to Portland. Branches extend southerly and westerly from the main line between Huntington and Portland, east of the Cascade Mountains, but the company \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 28]\n\u00a0\n operates no lines south of Portland and west of the Cascade Range. Crane, just beyond which the required extension would begin, is in Eastern Oregon on a line known as the Ontario-Burns Branch, which connects with the Oregon Short Line at Ontario, 40 miles south of Huntington, and runs westward to Crane, 127 miles, and thence northwest 30 miles to Burns. The extension would run west from Crane across Central Oregon a distance of 185 miles to Crescent Lake, which is on the Cascade Line of the Southern Pacific. The latter operates lines from Ogden, Utah, and New Orleans, La., to San Francisco, and from Roseville, Cal., on the Ogden-San Francisco Line, to Sacramento and Portland. To Portland it has two alternate main lines between Black Butte, Cal., and Eugene, Or., that on the west, the original main line, passing through Medford, Grants Pass, and Roseburg, and a newer line to the east, known as the Cascade or Natron cut-off, passing through Klamath Falls, Kirk, Chemult, Paunina, Crescent Lake, the western terminus of the required extension, and Natron.\n Prior to 1913, the railways of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific were jointly operated under control of the Harriman interests. A cross- state line was then planned to run from Malheur Junction, just south of Ontario, Or., to Eugene. The Natron cut-off between Eugene and Weed was also in contemplation. In 1911 construction of the cross-state road was begun at both ends. 73.6 miles were completed from Ontario to Juntura; and eastward from Eugene 40 miles were built as far as Oakridge. Work on the Natron cut-off was begun and proceeded through Klamath Falls to Kirk, 127 miles. The line would have joined with the Natron cut-off at Odell Lake, just north of Crescent Lake, the present proposed terminus.\n In January, 1913, this court, in United States v. Union Pacific R. Co ., \n226 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S.Ct. 53, Id., \n226 \nU.S. 470\n, 33 S.Ct. 162, declared control of South- \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 29]\n\u00a0\n ern Pacific by Union Pacific through stock ownership offensive to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note), and the combination was dissolved. All work on the Oregon projects ceased and was not resumed, except that in 1915 the Ontario-Juntura line was extended to Riverside, 92. 7 miles, and in 1916 to Crane, an additional 34 miles.\n After the passage of the Transportation Act, the Oregon Public Service Commission applied to the Commission under paragraph 21 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 USCA  1(21), asserting that the cross-state line was needed, and asking that some one or more of the respondents named in the complaint be ordered to build it, and further requesting that the Commission require completion of the Natron cut-off and order certain other railroad construction in Central Oregon. The Southern Pacific voluntarily assumed the completion of the Natron cut-off, and to that end was granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 1(18). The Oregon-Washington also applied for and obtained a certificate for construction of the branch from Crane to Burns. Other applications by various carriers were granted. The Commission then dismissed the complaint, holding that the record was not adequate to support the requested order. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n On May 24, 1927, the Oregon Commission filed the present complaint against eleven railroads, including the Oregon-Washington, the Oregon Short Line, the Southern Pacific, and others serving the state, and also the Union Pacific. The failure and refusal to provide railroad facilities to a large area of Central Oregon was the gravamen of the complaint. Consequences of the neglect to build this line were enumerated as prevention of the development of a vast area, hindrance of exploitation of the natural resources of the state, unreasonably circuitous routes, with consequent delays, and car shortages, all causing \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 30]\n\u00a0\n losses to the people of Oregon. The relief prayed was an order that one or more of the respondents be required to construct the cross-state line, from Crane to Crescent Lake.\n This line, 185 miles in length, after leaving Crane, would traverse about 20 miles of swampy area and 15 miles of alkali flats, and would then pass over the Great Sandy or High Desert for 115 miles. The region is in part sparsely settled and in part wholly uninhabited, and contains no towns except Crescent and Crescent Lake, at the western extremity, neither of which has a population of 100. There is no town within 20 miles north or south of the proposed line. Certain of the lands have possibilities of cultivation through irrigation, and the evidence for complainants is that, if the railroad were built, such activity would be stimulated. There seems to be no dispute that traffic to be obtained from the region will fall far short of supporting the line. The appellants are of opinion that sufficient traffic for this purpose may be secured by diverting to the new line freight originating west of the Cascade Range, and now moving east on the Southern Pacific through Ogden. In the total haul between Crescent Lake and Granger, Wyo., the route via the cross-state line would be some 214 miles, or 11 per cent., shorter. Neither the Oregon-Washington nor any other portion of the Union Pacific System serves the territory south of Portland and west of the Cascade Mountains. The Southern Pacific lines cover this area. Freight may, however, be routed either over the Southern Pacific via Ogden, or over the Union Pacific via Portland and Granger, Wyo. The latter furnishes a reasonably short route with adequate and quick service. Inasmuch, however, as the freight originates in Southern Pacific territory, very little is sent over the Union Pacific; the Southern Pacific routing it so as to obtain the long haul. The contention is that, even if the proposed line were constructed, the same condition \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 31]\n\u00a0\n would obtain, and that the Union Pacific System could get little or none of the traffic from Western Oregon, unless in addition to the cross-state line the Oregon-Washington should build across the Cascade Range into the agricultural counties now served by the Southern Pacific. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The Union Pacific System, composed as above stated, has a total trackage of 15,045.17 miles. The required extension would add 1.2 per cent. to the existing mileage, and can be constructed at a cost of between $9, 900,000 and $11,700,000. The finding of the Commission is that operation of the line will not seriously affect the ability of the Union Pacific System adequately to serve the public. Recognizing that the Oregon- Washington has not the necessary funds, and perhaps cannot borrow them, the order permits the financing of construction by advances from the Union Pacific Railroad, which is found to be in position to make them. Union Pacific and the Oregon-Washington consider the venture unprofitable and wasteful, and have refused to make the investment. In the Commission's judgment, if constructed, the railroad, while not profitable at first, will ultimately obtain valuable traffic for the Union Pacific System, will aid the Ontario-Burns Branch, which now operates at a serious deficit, and consequently prove a remunerative investment. The court below held,11 as we must, that these findings, based upon evidence, may not be disturbed. \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 32]\n\u00a0\n The appellees' challenge of the order as beyond the power of the Commission was sustained by the District Court, and this decision is assigned as error. The Commission thought its authority to order extension of existing lines was without limitations, save the two which are expressed in paragraph 21-that public necessity and convenience require the construction, and that the building and operation of the road will not impair the ability of the carrier to render adequate public service. Having determined that the requested extension complied with both conditions, the Commission ordered the road built.\n Prior to the adoption of the Transportation Act, 1920 (41 Stat. 456), the Commission had no authority to authorize or to compel extensions of existing lines of railroad. Such power as existed in that behalf rested in the states. In a number of cases this court passed upon and defined the authority of a state to require extensions of existing service and facilities. \n12\n Orders made were attacked as compelling the companies, against their will and judgment, to devote property to the public service without compensation, con- \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 33]\n\u00a0\n trary to the guaranty of due process. They were sustained, however, upon the express ground that the railroads had undertaken the service and must supply facilities adequate and reasonably necessary to its performance. The requirements were found not to involve the rendition of a new or different service from that to which the owners had agreed when they dedicated their property to a public use. Where, however, the state's mandate involved the rendition of a service beyond the agreement of the carrier, the order was annulled. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The regulations adopted by the states were not uniform; statutory authority to order additions and extensions existed in some states and not in others. Congress was informed of this condition, and urged to exercise the federal power to promulgate a uniform system of regulation of interstate commerce. 14 Legislation to effectuate this purpose was enacted. \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 34]\n\u00a0\n By Act of May 29, 1917,15 new paragraphs were added to section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act; and by the Transportation Act, 1920,16 these were amended and others inserted. As a result paragraphs 10 to 17, inclusive, all dealing with car service, were given their present form. Paragraphs 18 to 20, inclusive, first appear in the Transportation Act. They regulate voluntary extensions of lines or building of new lines, require a certificate of convenience and necessity therefor, and prescribe the procedure for obtaining it. The paragraph with which we are here concerned, numbered 21, was also added by the Transportation Act,  402 ( 49 USCA  1(21). It is:\n'The commission may, after hearing, in a proceeding upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, authorize or require by order any carrier by railroad subject to this chapter, party to such proceeding, to provide itself with safe and adequate facilities for performing as a common carrier its car service as that term is used in this chapter, and to extend its line or lines: Provided, That no such authorization or order shall be made unless the commission finds, as to such extension, that it is reasonably required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as to such extension or facilities that the expense involved therein will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public. Any carrier subject to this chapter which refuses or neglects to comply with any order of the commission made in pursuance of this paragraph shall be liable to a penalty of $100 for each day during which such refusal or neglect continues, \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 35]\n\u00a0\n which shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil action brought by the United States.'\n\n The appellants maintain that, if the Commission finds the conditions stated in the proviso exist, the power given to compel a carrier 'to extend its line or lines' is unlimited, and the way is open for an order to extend for any distance, at any cost, for the purpose of developing virgin territory hitherto unreached by railroads, or for supplying competition in a remote region served by other carriers.\n The phrase 'and to extend its line or lines' is part of a single sentence committing to the Commission the power to require carriers to provide safe and adequate facilities for car service as defined in the act. The reasonable conclusion is therefore that the extensions mentioned have to do with car service, and are not intended to create a wholly independent subject of jurisdiction. In the proviso the furnishing of facilities and extension of lines are blended as belonging in a single class. We should expect, if Congress were intending to grant to the Commission a new and drastic power to compel the investment of enormous sums for the development or service of a region which the carrier had never theretofore entered or intended to serve, the intention would be expressed in more than a clause in a sentence dealing with car service. As said in Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States ex rel. Los Angeles, \n280 \nU.S. 52, 70\n, 50 S.Ct. 53, 57:\n'If Congress had intended to give an executive tribunal unfettered capacity for requisitioning investment of capital of the carriers and the purchase of large quantities of land and material in an adverse proceeding, we may well be confident that Congress would have made its meaning far clearer and more direct than in the present meager provisions of the Transportation Act.'\n\n Moreover, if the purpose were that claimed by the Commission, support should be found in legislative history. But none has been called to our attention. In the \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 36]\n\u00a0\n report to Congress for 1919, the Commission reiterated an outline of the policies previously suggested for legislative action in view of the approaching termination of federal control. \n17\n No intimation is given that carriers should be required to build into territory they had not undertaken to serve. The scope of the recommendation was not enlarged in the testimony before the committee of the Senate having the Transportation Act in charge. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The terms of paragraph 18, by contrast, throw light on the meaning of paragraph 21. The former presupposes voluntary action by a carrier, and provides that no company shall undertake 'the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require' the construction and operation thereof. 49 USCA  1(18). The difference of phraseology in the two paragraphs emphasizes the distinction between extensions and new lines. The diversity is significant.\n The purpose of Congress in enacting paragraph 18, as repeatedly explained by this court, was that, though a carrier should desire to extend existing facilities or to construct new ones in territory not previously served, the free \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 37]\n\u00a0\n exercise of discretion should not be permitted, but the Commission must be convinced that the proposed venture would not drain the railroad's resources and disable it from performing those duties of public service under which it then rested, with consequent detriment to the public in the matter of service and rates. \n19\n If a railroad company can prove that the proposal either presently or in the reasonably near future will be self- sustaining, or so nearly so as not unduly to burden interstate commerce, the Commission may issue a certificate authorizing the proposed line. Paragraph 21 (49 USCA  1(21), on the other hand, contains no provision whatever for new lines. If the power be as broad as contended by the Commission, there seems to be no good reason for the omission. The same principles and the same needs might equally require the building of a new line as the extension of an existing one, unless, indeed, Congress recognized a radical difference between compelling embarkation in a new venture and ordering a mere extension of facilities required as the natural concomitant and complement of those presently used for the rendition of the service to which the carrier has committed itself.\n That paragraph 21 refers to the service the carrier has bound itself to render is further emphasized by the omission to make the future public convenience a factor to be considered. A presently existing public need is expressly stated as prerequisite to the compulsory extension of a line. On the other hand, paragraph 18, which covers voluntary construction, conditions approval on present or future convenience or necessity. Congress therefore drew a distinction between what might be permitted and what compelled. These differences in the two sections were \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 38]\n\u00a0\n disregarded by the Commission, and are overlooked by the appellants.\n We are told that, if paragraph 22 (49 USCA  1(22) be given due weight, the word 'extend' in 21 must have a broader connotation than we attribute. This paragraph enacts that the powers conferred upon the Commission by paragraphs 18 to 21, both inclusive, are not to 'extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one State. ...' The argument is that, if the phrase 'to extend its line' be so limited as to apply only to existing commitments of the carrier, it becomes synonymous with the matters excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction by paragraph 22, with the result that the one becomes contradictory of the other in the matter of line extension. The practice in the application of paragraphs 18 and 21 negatives this view. In Alabama & V.R. Co. v. Jackson & E.R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S.Ct. 535, an order of the Commission made under paragraph 21 was sustained which directed the building of a connection between two railroads for interchange of traffic near the outskirts of Jackson, Miss. In Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S.Ct. 376, Id., \n283 \nU.S. 380\n, 51 S.Ct. 553, it was held that under paragraphs 18-21 a certificate was required for the necessary rearrangement of main tracks to comply with an order of the Railroad Commission of California that the interstate carriers entering Los Angeles should combine in the construction and use of a union depot. The court called attention (\n264 \nU.S. 345\n, 44 S.Ct. 376) to the palpable distinction between the main line tracks of an interstate carrier and its spur, industrial, switching, or side tracks, and declared the act exhibited the legislative intent to retain within the control of the Commission any substantial change in the former. Although under the station plan the proposed extensions of lines and main tracks were not great in distance, they involved a new intramural desti- \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 39]\n\u00a0\n nation for each railway, attended by great expense. As was said, the necessary outlay might well be such as to cripple the railroads and hamper their service. Such an extension was held to require the finding of the Interstate Commerce Commission that the changes would not impair the ability of the carriers to perform their public duties. Compare Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S.F.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263.\n From what has been said, it is plain that an extension, though something other than a team, switching, industrial, or side track, need not, in order to be distinguished therefrom, be a building into a new and previously unserved locality.\n The cases above cited, dealing with the powers of state authorities in the matter of extensions of lines and service, furnish a background which must have been in the minds both of the Commission and of the Congress at the time of the passage of the Transportation Act. Those decisions show that due process is denied by requiring service which goes beyond the undertaking of the carrier. Orders for extensions of line were sustained whenever reasonably required in the interest of car service and for interchange of traffic. No extension ordered for the service of new territory had been approved. \n20\n Wherever the state attempted to enforce a regulation or demand extension of \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 40]\n\u00a0\n facilities outside the company's undertaking to serve the public, the power was negatived for the very reason that the attempted exercise called on the railroad company for something beyond its agreement. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n The act, reasonably construed, distinguishes between three sorts of facilities-new lines, or extensions, voluntarily undertaken (paragraph 18); compulsory extensions within the area which the carrier has bound itself to serve (paragraph 21); and spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks located wholly within one state, which are left within state control (paragraph 22). The second class is distinct from the others, and embraces, as the decisions show, a substantial field. But this field is not, as the Commission holds, coterminous with that created by paragraph 18. If it were, power would exist to compel a carrier having lines reaching Chicago and St. Louis, but none connecting those cities, to build a railroad between them. Though in truth a new line, the appellants would call this an extension of the existing lines. If the grant of authority is broad enough to support the order in the present case it would also justify such a hypothetical requirement as we have supposed. We cannot so read the statute, but think the power granted by paragraph 21 is confined to extensions within the undertaking of the carrier to serve, and cannot be extended to embrace the building of what is essentially a new line to reach new territory.\n There is another consideration which supports the construction adopted. Our duty is to construe the statute, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score. \n22\n The views advanced by the appellants, to say the least, raise serious questions in this respect. The rail- \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 41]\n\u00a0\n roads, though dedicated to a public use, remain the private property of their owners, and their assets may not be taken without just compensation. 23 The Transportation Act has not abolished this proprietorship. State courts have uniformly held that to require extension of existing lines beyond the scope of the carrier's commitment to the public service is a taking of property in violation of the Federal Constitution. \n24\n The decisions of this court will be searched in vain for the announcement of any principle of constitutional interpretation which would support the order of the Commission. The statements in New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S.Ct. 270, and Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472, in respect of the purposes of the Transportation Act, on which appellants rely, must be read having in mind the situations there presented and the nature of the orders approved. Care was taken in those cases to demonstrate that the sections upheld did not, in application, go beyond the regulation of rates and the disposition of the excess over a fair return collected by a carrier, and it was shown that no taking or confiscation of property resulted. Those decisions are far from sustaining the validity of an order which seeks to require the investment of millions of dollars in a new venture in undeveloped areas. Such a compulsion imposes upon the carrier and its property 'burdens that are not incident to its engagement.' Northern Pacific R. Co. v. North Dakota, 236 U.S. at page 595, 35 S.Ct. 429, 433, L.R.A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. The \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 42]\n\u00a0\n construction we adopt makes it unnecessary to pass upon the grave questions of constitutional validity raised by appellants' argument.\n It is urged that, as the order involved trackage amounting to only 1. 2 per cent. of that now maintained by the Union Pacific System, the requirement may properly be considered an extension rather than a new line, though a different view might prevail if the Oregon-Washington alone be considered. But whether the order be treated as a command to the Oregon- Washington Company as a separate corporate entity, or as an injunction to the Union Pacific System, it is an attempted exertion of a power not conferred. Assuming, without deciding, that the Commission was entitled to treat the Oregon-Washington Company as an instrument of the Union Pacific System, and the required extension, therefore, as one adding only a small percentage to the present mileage of the system, still the purpose is to compel a new investment for the development of a new area at the request and in the interest of the state of Oregon, whose desire is that its natural resources shall be exploited. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n Finally it is claimed that, however narrowly the power to compel extensions be construed, the order was justified by the facts developed before the Commission. They are said to disclose an undertaking by the Oregon-Washington Company to serve the region in question. Much \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 43]\n\u00a0\n is made of the circumstance that, when the complaint was filed, the company had a charter under which it was authorized to build a line on the location of that which the order describes. The possession of the franchise is said to give rise to an implied agreement to serve the district. The company's having in contemplation the building of the road would in this view render the Commission's action unassailable. But authority to build the line, if the company were so minded, involved no commitment to construct it. \n26\n Though by appropriate legislation the state might forfeit the charter for nonuser, the continued existence of the franchise imposed no obligation to exercise the charter powers. The Oregon- Washington Company chose not to serve the territory which the cross-state line would reach; has not desired and does not now desire to enter upon the project. The possession of a charter which would have made the building of a railroad legal is insignificant as to the company's actual undertaking. Whether the railroad held itself out to serve the region in question must be decided in the light of all the facts. The record demonstrates that the territory to be traversed was one the company had neither actually nor impliedly agreed to serve with transportation facilities.\n The decree is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n Unable to concur in the decision of the Court, I place upon record without extended argument the grounds of my dissent.\n The Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 456) was framed with the design of securing to the United States an adequate and \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 44]\n\u00a0\n efficient system of railroad transportation. Everything contained in it with reference to extensions, voluntary and involuntary, is tributary to that end, and, unless related thereto, is misconceived and misapplied. On the one hand, the carriers are to be permitted to make voluntary extensions of their lines, but only with the consent of the Commission, lest waste may otherwise ensue. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S.F.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 278 S., 46 S.Ct. 263. On the other hand, they are made subject to a correlative duty, if so ordered by the Commission, to build extensions, even though unwillingly, when transportation will otherwise be inefficient or inadequate. The limits of this duty are not appropriately defined by dividing the field into extensions big and little, with a power of regulation excluded from the one section and admitted in the other. On the contrary, the word 'extension' is to be taken in no forced or artificial sense, but with the meaning attributed to it in the common speech of men. It does not fairly connote a prolongation so vast ans sudden as to work an utter transformation of the character of the road, making what was extended the incident and the extension the principal. The action of the Commission must have a basis in reason, and its order must be viewed with reference to the length and other conditions of the line or lines to be enlarged. No doubt there is a point at which the enlargement of a road becomes 'the construction of a new line' (section 1, par. 18, Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  1(18), rather than the extension of an old one. On the other hand, the power of the Commission is not limited to extensions that are merely trivial. The purpose of the Congress to make the power more than this, to make it an effective instrument for the development of railroad transportation, is revealed at every step. It is revealed in the legislative history of the measure, and particularly in the report of the Commission explaining the mischiefs to be remedied and recommending the fitting \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 45]\n\u00a0\n cure. \n27\n It is revealed very distinctly on the face of the statute, which provides that the extension may not be ordered without a certificate of convenience and necessity, nor ordered even then if the expense to be incurred 'will impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public,' a precautionary proviso that was omitted in the requirement of adequate facilities for car service contained in the same section, and that would surely have been thought to be superfluous if the subject- matter of the extension was to be a short or unimportant spur. In the case at hand, the proposed addition increases only by 1.2 per cent. the mileage of the Union Pacific System, and is to be laid across a region which the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company, the subsidiary most directly affected, had marked out in its certificate of incorporation as territory that it planned to serve. An increment thus related to the thing to be increased is not so extraordinary in size, so lacking in proportion, as to remake or transform under the guise of improving or extending. New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 \nU.S. 345\n, 38 S.Ct. 122; People of State of New York ex rel. Woodhaven Gas Light Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S.Ct. 83; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 309 S., 49 S.Ct. 150.\n Another basis of division, in addition to that of size, is put forward in argument as separating the extensions that \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 46]\n\u00a0\n Congress had in view from others so substantial that they are to be taken as excluded. We are to find the test, so it is said, in the expectation or intention, presumable or actual, of the corporators or stockholders. The test, however, is illusory. If expectation or intention is the measure of the power of the nation, development must always wait upon the pleasure of the carrier affected. By hypothesis, the territory already served is the only territory that the carrier has evinced a willingness to serve. If its road is to be built for a greater distance or between other points, there is a frustration of its purpose that the terminus for construction shall be wherever stockholders and directors have willed that it shall be. In the thought of the lawmakers, the power of the government was not to be conditioned upon consent. It was to operate by compulsion upon whatever came within its sphere. The railroads of the nation had been brought together by the Transportation Act into a system of transportation national in its dimensions and under national control. Not the wishes of the component units, but the needs of the public which they are organized to serve, were to give the rule and measure for command and for obedience. Let expectation be the test, and cases such as New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, supra, People of State of New York ex rel. Wood-haven Gas Light Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, and United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra, must have been decided otherwise than they were. In these instances and others, carriers serving a particular territory were compelled to serve another in response to a public need that the field of service be enlarged. Railroad Commission of California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S.Ct. 376, is cited as pointing another way, but its implications are misread. Its precise holding is that an order of a state commission cannot coerce an interstate carrier to make extensive changes and relocations of its main tracks at great expense in connection with the construction of a \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 47]\n\u00a0\n new union station, but that the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission is necessary in such circumstances even though the new tracks are short. The case is far from holding, however, that the relevant sections of the Transportation Act apply to short additions to the exclusion of all others. On the contrary, the fact that the additions were 'not great in distance' (page 346 of 264 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 376, 379), even though expensive, is recognized as giving color to the argument that no consent is necessary. 'It is argued,' wrote Chief Justice Taft (page 344 of 264 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 376, 379), 'that paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 402 refer only to extensions of a line of railroad having the purpose to include new territory to be served by the interstate carrier and do not refer to an extension of new main track for the mere purpose of rearranging terminals within the same city. We do not think the language of paragraphs 18 to 21 can be properly so limited.' In such words there is surely no suggestion that the power of the federal Commission is inadequate to compel an extension into territory not served, nor any acceptance of the test of presumable intention.\n If the test proposed were not illusory, it would none the less be inappropriate. The time has gone by when the subjection of a public service corporation to control and regulation by the agencies of government is to have its origin and justification in the terms of a supposed contract between the corporation and the state. The origin of the subjection and its justification are to be found, not in contract, but in duty, a duty imposed by law as an incident to the enjoyment of a privilege. The discretion of managers and stockholders, at one time nearly absolute, is now subject in countless ways to compulsion or restraint in the interest of the public welfare. No longer may the carrier abandon any portion of its road without the consent of the Commission, though the portion to be abandoned has been operated at a loss. 41 Stat. 477,  402( 18); 49 U.S. Code  1(18), 49 USCA  1(18). No longer, without the consent of \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 48]\n\u00a0\n the Commission, may it extend the length of its road by its voluntary act. 49 U.S. Code,  1(18). No longer may securities be issued, in the form either of stock or of evidences of debt, unless the Commission has found the proposed action of the carrier to be compatible with the public good. 49 U.S. Code,  20a (49 USCA  20a). All these limitations upon ancient rights and privileges have had the approval of this court. The new act, said the Chief Justice in Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 172, 33 A.L.R. 472, 'puts the railroad systems of the country more completely than ever under the fostering guardianship ... of the Commission which is to supervise their issue of securities, their car supply and distribution, their joint use of terminals, their construction of new lines, their abandonment of old lines, and by a proper division of joint rates, and by fixing adequate rates for interstate commerce, and in case of discrimination, for intrastate commerce, to secure a fair return upon the properties of the carriers engaged.' The argument is not persuasive that alone among all these inroads upon the freedom of managerial discretion the provision for compulsory extensions is to be struck down as ineffective. As long as governmental orders are kept within the range of reason, their operation is unaffected by expectation or desire.\n The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution is invoked by the carriers, but invoked without avail. Consistently with that Amendment Congress may delegate to the Commission the power to force upon unwilling carriers an extension of their lines into fields of old service and of new. Much of what has been written in this opinion as to the meaning of the statute is pertinent also to an inquiry as to power. Again the thought is to be kept before us that the need of the public, not the acquiescence of the carrier, is the measure of the service, provided only that for such service there is adequate requital. Whether such requital has been assured is a question not susceptible of answer \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 49]\n\u00a0\n except in the setting of the circumstances. Objection that it is lacking is to be viewed in the light of the entire scheme and framework of the act of 1920, and of all the relevant provisions for the carriers' protection. There must be kept in view the provision whereby rates are to be maintained at such a level as to yield to the carriers of the country, or to the several groups into which they are to be divided, a fair and reasonable return, and whereby the surplus earnings of the strong roads may be recaptured and applied to the use of weaker ones. True indeed it is that courts are wont to lean to the construction of a statute that will avoid serious doubts of its validity, though they might hold it to be valid if pressed to a decision. United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568, 574\n, 51 S.Ct. 278; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S.Ct. 658. Even so, they will not carry hesitation to the point of devitalizing the essence to preserve the husk alone. When the scheme of the act is viewed in the totality of its meaning and probable operation, there is a quick end to the objection that in fixing the bounds of duty to render service to the public, the area of the possible must coincide, at least generally and roughly, with that of the actual and voluntary. Congress does not transcend the limits of the Constitution when it establishes a national system of transportation by rail. It does not transcend those limits when, in aid of the system thus established, it lays a duty upon the railroads to furnish the extensions requisite for the attainment of the end in view. The conclusion is the same whether the immediate purpose of the order is to develop the resources of the country in territory contiguous to roads already built, or to promote the convenience of communities served imperfectly or not at all.\n I have said that governmental orders to be valid must be kept within the range of reason. The record gives no support to a contention that those bounds have been exceeded. The cost of the improvement 'will not impair \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 50]\n\u00a0\n the ability of the carrier or carriers involved to perform their duty to the public.' So the Commission finds, and the fact is not disputed. The improvement when made will be 'a valuable asset to the Union Pacific System,' and will be 'an effective feeder for that system after a reasonable development period.' This finding brings us into the realm of prophecy, and so, not unnaturally, into the field of contention and uncertainty. Much deference is due to the judgment of the Commission, 'a tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Central R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700, 704; Virginia R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 47 S.Ct. 222. The conclusion that it has expressed is no arbitrary judgment, but has a basis of fact and reason in the pages of this record. But, if doubt were greater than it is, the binding force of the decision would not thereby be defeated. The order of the Commission does not depend for its validity upon the certainty of a prophetic judgment as to all the consequences to follow. Once more we are to keep in mind the changes that have been wrought by the Transportation Act of 1920. In cases unaffected by that act, two lines of decisions, following separate and yet neighboring channels, are to be found in the reports. The first, represented by Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 595\n, 35 S.Ct. 429, L.R.A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1, and Brooks Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 \nU.S. 396\n, 40 S.Ct. 183, is made up of cases where the return for particular services was considered in isolation without reference to earnings generally. The second, represented by St. Louis & San Francisco R. Co. v. Gill, \n156 \nU.S. 649, 667\n, 15 S.Ct. 484, 491, 573, Puget Sound Traction, Light & Power Co. v. Reynolds, \n244 \nU.S. 574\n, 37 S.Ct. 705, and United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra, is marked by the cases where the compulsory enlargement of the range of public service has been held to be permissible if the combined return is adequate for the system as a whole. By force of the act of 1920, the zone has been narrowed for the application of \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 51]\n\u00a0\n the principle which has illustration in the first group, and correspondingly widened for the application of the principle which has illustration in the second. Irrelevant, or nearly so, are the decisions of this court defining the jurisdiction of the Commission as it stood before the act of 1920 had brought a new system into being. Irrelevant also are the decisions of state courts or of the lower federal courts determining the validity of very different statutes under which there are no compensatory guaranties to mitigate the burden of statutory duties; the carriers affected being viewed as separate units and not as members of a group. See, e.g., Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Town of Calhoun (D.C.) 287 F. 381; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 173 Cal. 577, 160 P. 828, 2 A.L.R. 975; Hollywood Chamber of Commerce v. Railroad Commission, 192 Cal. 307, 219 P. 983, 30 A.L.R. 68. For the first time in the history of our railroads a nationalized system of interstate transportation has made it necessary to consider the earnings of the system, or at least the earnings of the group, in determining whether rates or profits have been unreasonably reduced. There is nothing in this record to justify, still less to necessitate, the conclusion that as a result of the proposed extension the appellees, or the group of railroad carriers including them, were to be placed, in such a position that it would be impossible thereafter, through any action of the Commission increasing rates or otherwise, to assure to them 'a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in ... transportation.' Interstate Commerce Act,  15a(2), 49 USCA  15a( 2).\n This Court has said of the Transportation Act of 1920 that it 'seeks affirmatively to build up a system of railways prepared to handle promptly all the interstate traffic of the country.' Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 172, 33 A.L. R. 472.\n The end is placed in jeopardy by a construction of the statute that debilitates the means. \n\n[288 U.S. 14, 52]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the District Court should therefore be reversed, and the order of the Commission reinstated.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Public Service Comm. v.

Some of the States have not vested such authority in any State official. Ordinarily such extensions would be desired for the purpose of facilitating or making possible the transportation of interstate traffic. The desirability of uniformity is obvious. The exercise of Federal authority should not depend upon whether or not the State has acted and should not be different as to the State that has legislated on the subject and the State that has not so legislated. It therefore seems desirable that the Congress should exercise its jurisdiction in this regard in a plenary way and that where such extensions are desired in connection with the movement of presently existing or prospective interstate traffic and the carrier is unwilling to construct them, it may, upon proper showing and after full hearing, be required to do so by the Federal tribunal.'\n\n Compare Alabama & Vicksburg R.

U.S.(1933)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 13, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles C. Moore, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner Jacobs and the testator of petitioner Gunter owned farms lying along Jones creek, a tributary of the Tennessee river, in Jackson county, Ala. Across this river the United States constructed Widow's Bar Dam under authority of Acts of Congress, 39 Stat. 399; 40 Stat. 1282. Surveys by the government showed that the construction of the dam caused an increase in the occasional overflows of petitioners' lands, and negotiations followed for the purchase of easements of flowage. Offers of settlement being deemed to be inadequate, petitioners brought separate suits under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 USCA  41(20) to recover compensation for the property taken. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the judgment of the District Court in the suit of Jacobs, held that he was entitled to compensation. 45 F.(2d) 34. Thereupon the two suits were consolidated and petitioners had judgment. The District Court found that they were entitled to the amount of damage caused by the construction of the dam as of the date of its completion (October 1, 1925), 'together with interest thereon at 6 per cent from the date of said taking until now as just compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n\n[290 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n States.' On appeal by the government, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that interest was not recoverable. 63 F.(2d) 326. This Court granted certiorari. \n289 \nU.S. 719\n, 53 S.Ct. 688\n\n\n The only question before us is as to the item of interest. The government contemplated the flowage of the lands, that damage would result therefrom, and that compensation would be payable. A servitude was created by reason of intermittent overflows which impaired the use of the lands for agricultural purposes. 45 F.(2d) page 37; 63 F.(2d) page 327. There was thus a partial taking of the lands for which the government was bound to make just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 327-329, 37 S.Ct. 380; United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 470\n, 23 S.Ct. 349; Hurley v. Kincaid, \n285 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 52 S.Ct. 267. The Circuit Court of Appeals, distinguishing the present suits from condemnation proceedings instituted by the government, held that the suits were founded upon an implied contract, and hence that interest could not be allowed, citing United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330\n, 40 S. Ct. 518.\n This ruling cannot be sustained. The suits were based on the right to recover just compensation for property taken by the United States for public use in the exercise of its power of eminent domain. That right was guaranteed by the Constitution. The fact that condemnation proceedings were not instituted and that the right was asserted in suits by the owners did not change the essential nature of the claim. The form of the remedy did not qualify the right. It rested upon the Fifth Amendment. Statutory recognition was not necessary. A promise to pay was not necessary. Such a promise was implied because of the duty to pay imposed by the amendment. The suits were thus founded upon the Constitution of the United States. 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 USCA  41(20).\n The amount recoverable was just compensation, not inadequate compensation. The concept of just compensa- \n\n[290 U.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n tion is comprehensive, and includes all elements, 'and no specific command to include interest is necessary when interest or its equivalent is a part of such compensation.' The owner is not limited to the value of the property at the time of the taking; 'he is entitled to such addition as will produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking.' Interest at a proper rate 'is a good measure by which to ascertain the amount so to be added.' Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 43 S.Ct. 354, 356. That suit was brought by the owner under section 10 of the Lever Act (40 Stat. 279), which, in authorizing the President to requisition property for public use and to pay just compensation, said nothing as to interest. But the Court held that the right to just compensation could not be taken away by statute or be qualified by the omission of a provision for interest where such an allowance was appropriate in order to make the compensation adequate. See, also, United States v. Rogers, \n255 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 41 S.Ct. 281.\n The principle was restated in Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341\n, 47 S.Ct. 611. There the suit was brought in the Court of Claims (61 Ct.Cl. 1044), and that court gave judgment for the value of the property as it was found to be at the time of the requisition. Plaintiffs insisted that they were entitled to an additional amount to produce the equivalent of the value of the property 'paid contemporaneously,' and that, for this purpose, interest as a reasonable measure should be allowed. This Court sustained the claim. The Court held that judgment in 1926 for the value of the use of the property in 1918 or 1919, without more, was not sufficient to constitute just compensation, that the claim was not for 'interest' within the meaning of section 177 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S. C.  284 (28 USCA  284)), and that that provision did not preclude the recovery of the additional amount asked. To the same effect are Brooks- Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \n\n[290 U.S. 13, 18]\n\u00a0\n \n265 \nU.S. 106, 123\n, 44 S.Ct. 471; Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 215\n, 47 S.Ct. 581.\n The case of United States v. North American Transp. & Trad. Co., supra, cannot be regarded as establishing a different rule for the instant case. See Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, supra, page 305 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 354; Phelps v. United States, supra, pages 343, 344 of 274 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 611. The North American Case rested upon its special facts. There the original taking was tortious, and created no liability on the part of the government. Subsequent action was held to create a liability which rested upon an implied contract. The Court said that the suit was not founded upon the Fifth Amendment. 253 U.S. pages 334, 335, 40 S.Ct. 518. Suits brought to enforce the constitutional right to just compensation are governed by the later decisions which are directly in point.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN K. & CATHERINE S. MULLEN BENEV. CORP. v. UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 32\nArgued: October 20, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Branch Bird and W. G. Bissell, both of Gooding, Idaho, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the District Court for Idaho (40 F.(2d) 937), under the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505), to recover a balance due on improvement district bonds issued by the village of American Falls, Idaho, for sidewalk and sewer construction. The theory of the petitioner, holder of the securities, was that the liability of the United States arose out of its acquisition of land in the districts for the construction of the American Falls reservoir under the authority of the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388. The Circuit Court of Appeals (63 F.( 2d) 48) reversed a judgment in petitioner's favor, and the case was brought here by certiorari.\n In 1915 and 1916 the village (now city) of American Falls duly created local improvement districts Nos. 1 and 2 for the construction of sewers, and local improvement district No. 8 for the laying of sidewalks, authorized bond issues to finance the work, and levied against the several parcels of land in the districts assessments totaling an amount calculated to suffice for the payment of principal and interest of the bonds. All of the bonds of the three \n\n[290 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n districts were purchased from the village by J. K. Mullen, who in 1925 transferred to the petitioner certain of the bonds of each district. Beginning in 1920 the respondent acquired all the real property within the three districts for the construction of the reservoir. In some cases title passed by condemnation, but in most instances by deeds from the then owners. The acquisition was completed prior to January 1, 1927. As title to each lot was obtained the United States paid or caused to be paid all existing assessments against the lot. There was general knowledge prior to 1927 that the total of the assessments would be insufficient to pay all the bonds. The petitioner asserts and we may assume that statutory authority exists, in case of a deficiency arising from causes shown by the record, to reassess the property within the districts for the amount of the deficiency. By ordinances enacted July 3, 1928, and proceedings pursuant to them, the city reassessed all the land within the districts. But as the land was then owned by the United States, the assessment was a nullity. Van Brocklin v. State of Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 6 S.Ct. 670. At some time between 1920 and January 1, 1927, the agents of the government responsible for the acquisition of the reservoir site learned that the original assessments were insufficient to pay the outstanding bonds. This knowledge led them to require vendors to leave part of the purchase price on deposit with the United States pending determination of the government's liability for probable reassessments. Subsequent to the institution of the present suit, these officials, apparently upon advice that assessments made after the conveyances could not affect the title of the United States, caused the moneys so withheld to be paid to the vendors. The total so retained and ultimately paid over was in excess of the amount due upon the petitioner's bonds.\n The petitioner argues that the bonds were property and were taken by the respondent and, in the alternative, that \n\n[290 U.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n they were liens, actual or inchoate, on the realty, and as the lien could not be foreclosed against lands owned by the United States, the respondent's acquisition of the lots destroyed the value of the securities and gave rise to an implied promise to pay the sums remaining due to the bondholders. The respondent replies that the bonds were not taken, were not liens upon the real estate acquired, but only upon the existing assessments, or to the amount of these assessments, all of which were cleared from the land at the time of the conveyances to the government; the United States recognized no lien of the bonds upon the tracts in question and made no contract express or implied to pay the bonds or any future assessments; suit was not brought within the time limited by the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505); the cause of action, if any, was in Mullen, the owner of the bonds at the time title passed to the United States, and Rev. St.  3477 (31 USCA  203) forbids assignment to the petitioner. An understanding of the status of the bonds and the rights of their owner as respects the real property in the improvement districts is necessary to a solution of some of the questions presented.\n The Idaho statutes provide for the creation by municipal action of improvement districts for constructing public works of the character with which we are here concerned (Idaho Compiled Statutes 1919,  3999-4151, inclusive1). The first step is an ordinance declaring the intention to create the improvement, describing the section to be improved, estimating the cost, and declaring that the cost is to be assessed against the contiguous property (section 4003). Protests may be made and are to be heard and considered, and thereafter an ordinance is passed creating the district and providing for the improvement and for taxation and assessment of the cost \n\n[290 U.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n upon all parcels of land within the district, in proportion to benefits ( section 4005). 'Whenever any expense or cost of work shall have been assessed on any land the amount of said expenses shall become a lien upon said lands ...' (section 4007). The municipality may provide for payment by installments instead of levying the entire assessment at one time, and in that case may issue in the name of the municipality improvement bonds of the district payable in installments within ten years (section 4014). Provision is made for annual levies to meet installments and interest ( section 4017), for the form of the bonds (section 4018), and for the redemption of their lots by the respective owners. If so redeemed the property affected is not thereafter to be liable for further special assessments for the same improvement except as in section 4024 provided ( section 4019). Reassessment on all the property in the district is permitted by section 4024, 'whenever, for any cause, mistake or inadvertence the amount assessed shall not be sufficient to pay the cost of the improvement made and enjoyed by owners of property in the local assessment district where the same is made. ...' It was under this section that the reassessments were made in the instant case.\n The municipality is not liable for the amount of the bonds (section 4026). Its only duty is to collect the assessments and place them in a separate fund set apart for payment of principal and interest. In fulfillment of this obligation the city may bring suit to recover out of each lot the amount of any assessment against it (section 4007), and if the municipality fails or neglects to collect, the bondholder may proceed to do so in his own name, and may foreclose the lien of the assessment ( section 4023). The section provides that the bonds 'shall transfer to the ... owner or holder, all the right and interest of such municipality in and with respect to every such assessment, and the lien \n\n[290 U.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n thereby created against the property os such owners assessed,' and shall authorize the holder 'to receive, sue for and collect, or have collected such assessment embraced in any such bond. ...' The bonds are to provide that the principal sum and interest is payable out of the local improvement fund created for the making of the improvement by assessment, and not otherwise (section 4018), and 'the holder of any such bond shall look only to the fund provided by such assessment for the principal or interest of such bond' (section 4025). The lot owner is not personally liable for the assessment.\n The bondholder is in equity the owner of the assessment fund and as the real party in interest may, in event of the city's default in collection, enforce the city's right to collect the assessment out of the land. The bonds have no general lien upon the lands in the district and save through the assessment no special lien on any tract. New First Nat. Bank v. City of Weiser, 30 Idaho, 15, 22, 166 P. 213.\n The petitioner insists that the bonds are property and were in legal effect taken by the respondent. The argument is that the sole source of payment was a reassessment upon the lots in the improvement districts, and as the action of the respondent rendered such procedure vain, the United States as effectually destroyed the chose in action as if it had seized the instruments evidencing the right. But the bonds were not taken. At the date of acquisition by the government the real estate was subject to be assessed in the future for sundry taxes, amongst them taxes in the nature of reassessments for sewers and sidewalks. It is true these could not thereafter be levied on property which had passed to the United States, but this does not mean that the government appropriated the right to assess them in futuro, nor that it took the benefit which might accrue to bondholders consequent on such future levies. By purchase of the lands the United States \n\n[290 U.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n at most frustrated action by the city to replenish the assessment fund to which alone the bondholder must look for payment of his bonds. But this was not a taking of the bondholder's property. Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502\n, 43 S.Ct. 437.\n What has been said shows that the respondent did not take or detroy any lien belonging to the petitioner. None remained upon the land, when the purchases were consummated. The reassessments were the result of proceedings begun thereafter. They were ineffective to create a lien upon lands owned by the government. United States v. City of Buffalo (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 471.\n The respondent did not expressly contract with the petitioner to make good any unpaid balance on the outstanding bonds. Can an implied contract of that nature be spelled out of the acts of the government's agents? We think not. Care was taken to free the lands of all liens, including the assessments then unpaid. The vendors were under no legal liability at the date of transfer for any future reassessments. United States v. City of Buffalo, supra; Brown v. Silverton, 97 Or. 441, 190 P. 971; Beezley v. Astoria, 126 Or. 177, 184, 269 P. 216, 60 A.L.R. 504. The withholding of a portion of the purchase money pending an investigation of the possibility that the realty would be liable for a reassessment, falls far short of indicating that the government intended to pay the bondholders if it should develop that no lien existed at the date of acquisition. A purpose to pay only valid subsisting liens negatives an agreement to pay something which had no such character. Compare Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121\n, 39 S.Ct. 56, Alabama v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 502\n, 51 S.Ct. 225. P These views render unnecessary discussion of the contentions with respect to the timeliness of the suit and the assignability of the cause of action.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reference will be made only to the sections dealing with sidewalks, etc., since those applicable to sewers are of similar import. \n\n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON OIL REFINING CO. v. STATE OF OKLAHOMA EX REL. MITCHELL(1933)\nNo. 22-24\nArgued: October 17, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeals from the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma.\n Messrs. A. A. Davidson and Preston C. West, both of Tulsa, Okl., and Charles Y. Freeman and J. F. Dammann, both of Chicago, Ill., and J. A. McCollum, of Pawnee, Okl., for petitioner. \n\n[290 U.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ed. Waite Clark, of Pawnee, Okl., J. Berry King, Atty. Gen., Carl D. McGee, Co. Atty., of Pawnee, Okl., and F. M. Dudley, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question of the validity of property taxes laid in Pawnee county, Oklahoma, under the state statute, upon the entire fleet of appellant's tank cars. The challenge in each case was under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution upon the ground that the cars did not have their situs within the state and hence that the state had no jurisdiction to tax them. The taxes in Nos. 22 and 23 were on 380 cars for the years 1925 to 1928; in No. 24, on 381 cars for the year 1931. The assessments in Nos. 22 and 23 were made by the county treasurer and upheld by the county court. In No. 24 the assessment was made by the local board of equalization and was reduced by the district court of the county to an assessment on 64 cars, which that court held to be the average number present in the county on any one day during the year. The three cases (with a fourth, which is not before us, from another county) were consolidated for hearing on appeal in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. That court sustained the assessments on the entire fleet of cars, thus affirming the judgment of the county court and reversing the judgment of the district court. 162 Okl. 185, 19 P.(2d) 168. The cases come here on appeal.\n Appellant, Johnson Oil Refining Company, is an Illinois corporation having its principal office in Chicago, and its refinery at Cleveland in Pawnee county, Oklahoma. The Supreme Court of the state reached the conclusion that all the cars had their 'taxable situs' at the latter place. As the asserted federal right turns upon the determination of the question of situs, it is our province to analyze \n\n[290 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n the facts in order to apply the law, and thus to ascertain whether the conclusion of the state court has adequate support in the evidence. Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S.Ct. 54.1\n The essential facts are not in dispute. The tank cars are operated in transporting refined products from appellant's factory at Cleveland, Oklahoma, to various points of delivery throughout a large part of the United States. They are almost exclusively engaged in interstate commerce. They are very infrequently used in connection with an oil plant appellant owns in Illinois. They are sometimes loaded at refineries located in states other than Oklahoma. The cars are stenciled 'When empty return to Johnson Oil Refining Company, Cleveland, Oklahoma,' or 'Johnson Refining Company, Cleveland, Oklahoma,' and with each shipment go instructions to return the car to Cleveland. The cars are thus billed back to Cleveland unless ordered to another point. At that place appellant has repair trackage which can accommodate from 12 to 15 cars for minor repairs and maintains such a stock of materials as can be utilized for repairs outside of a railroad shop. Besides the above-mentioned repair trackage, appellant has trackage at Cleveland with a capacity for about 67 cars.\n The cars are almost continuously in movement. Returning to Cleveland to be reloaded, the cars remain on the tracks from twenty-four hours to ten days depending on the season of the year and the volume of products handled. They are on the tracks for reloading purposes twenty-four hours. Each of the cars makes about one \n\n[290 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n and one-half trips every thirty days, that is, 'each car is loaded at the Cleveland refinery, sent to the point of delivery, returns to the Cleveland plant, is reloaded and sent out again to a point of delivery each thirty days.' Each car is outside of Pawnee county and the state of Oklahoma from twenty to twenty-nine days out of each month. It was variously estimated at the trial in No. 22 that the daily average number of cars in Pawnee county during the years 1925 to 1928 was between 37 and 66. The agreed statement of facts in No. 24 states that that daily average during the years 1929 and 1930 was 64; that is, about 16 per cent. of the cars owned by appellant were in Pawnee county and about 84 per cent., on a daily average, were 'somewhere in transit outside' of that county.\n Although rolling stock, such as these cars, is employed in interstate commerce, that fact does not make it immune from a nondiscriminatory property tax in a state which can be deemed to have jurisdiction. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 8 S.Ct. 1037; Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 \nU.S. 70, 82\n, 19 S.Ct. 599, 604; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 \nU.S. 149, 152\n, 20 S.Ct. 631; Union Tank Line v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 39 S.Ct. 276. Appellant had its domicile in Illinois and that state had jurisdiction to tax appellant's personal property which had not acquired an actual situs elsewhere. 'The state of origin remains the permanent situs of the property, notwithstanding its occasional excursions to foreign parts.' See New York Central R.R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584, 597\n, 26 S.Ct. 714, 717; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 69\n, 32 S.Ct. 13. But the state of the domicile has no jurisdiction to tax personal property where its actual situs is in another state. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 211 S., 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 30 S.Ct. 190; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 489\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316. While, in this instance, \n\n[290 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n it cannot be doubted that the cars in question had acquired an actual situs outside the state of Illinois, the mere fact that appellant had its refinery in Oklahoma would not necessarily fix the situs of the entire fleet of cars in that state. The jurisdiction of Oklahoma to tax property of this description must be determined on a basis which is consistent with the like jurisdiction of other states.\n The basis of the jurisdiction is the habitual employment of the property within the state. By virtue of that employment the property should bear its fair share of the burdens of taxation to which other property within the state is subject. When a fleet of cars is habitually employed in several states-the individual cars constantly running in and out of each state-it cannot be said that any one of the states is entitled to tax the entire number of cars regardless of their use in the other states. When individual items of rolling stock are not continuously the same but are constantly changing, as the nature of their use requires, this Court has held that a state may fix the tax by reference to the average number of cars found to be habitually within its limits. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., supra. This principle has had frequent illustration. It was thus stated in American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, supra: 'It having been settled, as we have seen, that where a corporation of one state brings into another, to use and employ, a portion of its movable personal property, it is legitimate for the latter to impose upon such property thus used and employed its fair share of the burdens of taxation imposed upon similar property used in like way by its own citizens, we think that such a tax may be properly assessed and collected, in cases like the present, where the specific and individual items of property so used and employed were not continuously the same, but were constantly changing, according to the exigencies of the business, and that the tax may be fixed by an appraisement and valuation of the average amount of the property thus habitually \n\n[290 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n used and employed.' See, also, Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, supra; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Germania Refining Co. v. Auditor General, 184 Mich. 618, 151 N.W. 605, affirmed \n245 \nU.S. 632\n, 38 S.Ct. 63; Union Tank Line v. Wright, supra.\n Applying these principles, no ground appears for the taxation of all the cars of the appellant in Oklahoma. It is true that the cars went out from and returned to Oklahoma, being loaded and reloaded at the refinery, but they also entered and were employed in other states where the oil was delivered. Oklahoma was entitled to tax its proper share of the property employed in the course of business which these records disclose, and this amount could be determined by taking the number of cars which on the average were found to be physically present within the state.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma are reversed, and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v.

There was no such rule respecting receivers in suits in equity, and the District Judges all regarded themselves as free in appointing such receivers to select any individual or trust company deemed competent and suitable for the particular task. But not infrequently they selected as an equity receiver the trust company which was designated by rule as a standing receiver in bankruptcy proceedings. The nature and importance of the equity receiverships for which a trust company was selected are not clearly disclosed in this record, but it is reasonably apparent that in no instance was the receivership at all comparable in scope or importance with the railroad receivership with which the present litigation is concerned.\n In 1930, the Senior Circuit Judge, acting under 28 U.S.C.  22 (28 USCA  22), and reciting that the public interest required it, assigned himself to hold at any time a session or sessions of the District Court for that district, for the purpose of trying causes and entertaining and disposing of any matter which might come before him.\n In June, 1932, at the suggestion of counsel in an intended suit in equity for the appointment of receivers for the Fox Theatres Corporation, the Senior Circuit Judge \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n sought informally to persuade one or more of the District Judges that a trust company ought not to be selected as receiver, but failed to secure an acceptance of his view. Thereupon, acting under his assignment of 1930, he entertained the application for a receiver and appointed individual receivers.\n This action of the Circuit Judge was followed a few days later by the adoption and promulgation by the District Judges of two new rules, known as 1-a and 11-a, effective July 1, 1932, and pparently designed to limit or restrict the action of assigned judges in that district. These rules will be set forth later on.\n August 25, 1932, counsel representing the parties in an intended suit in equity by the American Brake Shoe & Foundry Company, against the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, informed the Senior Circuit Judge that an application for the appointment of receivers would be made in that suit, and laid before him an affidavit, entitled therein, alleging generally that a trust company or other corporation would not be a suitable receiver, and particularly that the defendant company's complicated and involved daily operations, its enormous staff of operating officials and employees, its contracts and relations with the city of New York, and the use of its facilities by the public, required that the receiver or receivers be a competent individual or individuals who could give constant and undivided attention to the matter. Thereupon the Senior Circuit Judge, conceiving that a District Judge might select a corporate receiver and that this would be unwise and should be prevented,1 concluded to assign, and did assign, himself to hold a District Court for the Southern District, 'particularly to hear and determine all applications and proceedings' in the intended \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n suit for a period beginning that day and continuing until the suit came to an end. This assignment, like that of 1930, recited that it was made under 28 U.S.C.  22 (28 USCA  22), and that the public interest required it.\n The statute referred to in the two assignments provides:\n Sec. 22. 'The Chief Justice of the United States, or the circuit justice of any judicial circuit, or the senior circuit judge thereof, may, if the public interest requires, designate and assign any circuit judge of a judicial circuit to hold a district court within such circuit. ...\n'During the period of service of any judge designated and assigned under this chapter, he shall have all the powers, and rights, and perform all the duties, of a judge of the district, ... to which he has been assigned (excepting the power of appointment to a statutory position or of permanent designation of newspaper or depository of funds).'\n\n The new rules adopted by the District Judges declare:\n'1-a. Any judge designated to sit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, shall do such work only as may be assigned to him by the senior district judge.'\n\n'11-a. All applications for the appointment of receivers in equity causes, in bankruptcy causes and any other causes (except a receiver in bankruptcy may be appointed by a referee as provided in the Bankruptcy Rules), shall be made to the judge assigned (meaning assigned by the District Judges in their division of business) to hold the Bankruptcy and Motion Part of the business of the court and to no other judge.'\n\n Immediately after making the assignment last mentioned, the Senior Circuit Judge turned to 28 U.S.C.  27 (28 USCA  27), which declares:\n'In districts having more than one district judge, the judges may agree upon the division of business and assign- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n ment of cases for trial in said district; but in case they do not so agree, the senior circuit judge of the circuit in which the district lies, shall make all necessary orders for the division of business and the assignment of cases for trial in said district.'\n\n And he then made and signed the following order:\n'And whereas, Martin T. Manton, a Circuit Judge of the Second Judicial Circuit of the United States designated and assigned to hold a District Court in the Southern District of New York in said Circuit, and acting as District Judge for the Southern District of New York in this Second Judicial Circuit, does not agree upon the division of business and assignment of cases for trial in the Southern District of New York, as provided in and pursuant to th rules of court for the Southern District of New York, heretofore adopted by the then United States District Judges for the Southern District of New York; it is hereby\n\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed that, for a period of thirty days beginning with this day, all applications for the appointment of receivers in equity causes in the Southern District of New York may be made not only to the district judge designated to hear such application pursuant to Rule 11-a of the General Rules of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, but also to Martin T. Manton, Circuit Judge designated to act as District Judge to hold a District Court for the Southern District of New York.'\n\n That order was filed and entered in the District Court, and on August 26 the American Brake Shoe & Foundry Company filed therein its bill of complaint against the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, together with the affidavit before mentioned. The bill disclosed that the plaintiff was a simple contract creditor, suing on its own behalf and on behalf of all other creditors who might choose to join in the suit, and that the defendant was en- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n gaged as a public carrier in operating an extensive system of transportation within the city of New York and its environs; set forth with much detail that the defendant was in greatly embarrassed financial condition, had made default in the payment of taxes and other claims, and could not avoid making default in the payment of installments of interest and principal about to fall due upon bonds and other obligations secured by mortgages; alleged that its properties were in danger of being dismembered and largely wasted through competitive efforts by its many creditors to obtain satisfaction of their claims, that such wasteful strike would seriously impair and interfere with the discharge of its duties as a public carrier, that its properties could be preserved for equitable distribution among those entitled thereto only through the intervention of a court of equity, and that such intervention would make for a realization for all of the creditors of a substantially larger amount than if that relief were not granted. The prayer was that receivers be appointed to take charge of and preserve the defendant's properties, continue the operation of its railroad system for the accommodation of the public, and collect and properly appropriate the income until the final decree, and that the court marshal and administer the assets and by its decree ascertain and enforce the rights, liens, and equities of the several creditors.\n The suit plainly was within the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court. The parties were citizens of different states and the amount or value in controversy was in excess of the minimum prescribed in the jurisdictional statute.\n Immediately after the bill was filed the defendant appeared and, conformably to a resolution of its board of directors, answered the bill, admitted the allegations therein, joined in the plaintiff's prayer and consented to the appointment of receivers. \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n Later in the same day, August 26, the parties appeared before the Senior Circuit Judge, sitting under the assignment and order of the day before; and, after examining the bill, affidavit and answer, the judge made an interlocutory order appointing temporary receivers and granting the usual temporary injunction against the institution of suits against the defendant company, except on leave granted in that suit. The order also directed (1) that on September 22, the parties show cause before him, as such assigned Circuit Judge, why the receivership should not be continued during the pendency of the suit, and (2) that at that hearing 'any other creditor of the defendant or other party in interest may be heard.'\n The receivers took possession of the properties and have since been operating them under orders made from time to time by the Senior Circuit Judge in that suit.\n September 6, the Manhattan Railway Company petitioned for leave to intervene as a efendant in the Interborough receivership suit and set forth in the petition many facts showing the Manhattan's serious financial embarrassment; and alleged that it owned a substantial part of the property held and operated by the Interborough Company and included in the receivership, and that the same was held and operated by the Interborough Company under a lease from the Manhattan Company. The petition referred to and claimed the benefit of various provisions in the lease defining the obligations of the Interborough Company thereunder, and pointed out that in several particulars the Interborough had made default in the performance of its obligations, and that these defaults were admitted by the Interborough's answer. The petition prayed that the Manhattan Company be made a party defendant in the receivership suit for the protection of its interests and those of its creditors; that the receivership be extended so as to embrace the interest of the Manhattan Company, but without prejudicing or impairing \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n any of its rights against the Interborough Company or the latter's receivers, and that such receivers be required to keep separate accounts in respect of the railroads owned by the Manhattan Company. Upon the presentation of this petition the Senior Circuit Judge made an interlocutory order granting its several prayers, appointing a separate temporary receiver for the Manhattan Company and its assets, and granting the usual injunction. This order also required the parties to show cause on September 22 why the extension of the receivership to the Manhattan Company and its assets should not be continued during the pendency of the suit, and provided that upon such hearing 'any other creditor of the defendant or other party in interest may be heard.'\n Several committees representing different groups of creditors, some of the Interborough Company and others of the Manhattan Company, were permitted to intervene and become parties, and many orders were made relating to the employment of counsel for the receivers and the conduct of the receivership.\n On the return day of the rules to show cause the parties and many others in interest appeared and were heard by the Senior Circuit Judge; but Benjamin F. Johnson and Lillian Boehm, to be mentioned presently, were not among those who appeared. Both refrained from participating in the hearing or otherwise appearing in the suit. As a result of the hearing, the Senior Circuit Judge, on September 28, made an order or decree continuing the receiverships of the Interborough and Manhattan during the further pendency of the suit.\n In the meantime another separate suit for the appointment of receivers of the Manhattan and Interborough Companies was commenced, and that suit needs now to be described.\n On September 21, Benjamin F. Johnson, a minority shareholder of the Manhattan Company, filed in the Dis- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 490]\n\u00a0\n trict Court an independent bill against that company and its temporary receiver, the Interborough Company and its temporary receivers, and the American Brake Shoe & Foundry Company. He sued on behalf of himself and all other shareholders in the Manhattan Company who might join; and his right to sue the Manhattan and Interborough Companies and their temporary receivers was based upon an order giving him leave so to do, which was made by the District Judge sitting in the motion part of the court, notwithstanding the injunction granted by the Senior Circuit Judge when the temporary receivers were appointed. Johnson in his bill asserted a cause of action on behalf of the Manhattan Company against the Interborough Company arising out of the lease before described, and also a right to an accounting in that connection. He further asserted there was an urgent need for receivers for both companies and prayed for the appointment of separate receivers for each of them. By his bill he also assailed the authority of the Senior Circuit Judge to entertain the suit of the American Brake Shoe Company or to appoint receivers or make any order or decree therein; and asserted that all of the orders and decrees passed by that judge were those of an usurper and wholly void, (1) because there was no public interest requiring the assignment of a Circuit Judge to sit in the suit, and therefore the assignment under which the judge was acting was without lawful basis and void; (2) because the District Judges were not in disagreement, but in full accord, respecting the division of business, and therefore the order of the Senior Circuit Judge respecting a division of business, whereby he directed that applications for the appointment of receivers in equity might be made to him, was without lawful basis and void; (3) because he was a designated judge within the meaning of rule 1-a of the District Court, and under that rule could do 'such work only' as might be committed to him by the Senior \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n District Judge, and none had been so committed; and (4) because rule 11-a of the District Court required all applications for the appointment of receivers in equity to be made to the judge assigned by the District Judges to hold the motion part of the court, and 'to no other judge,' and not only was the Senior Circuit Judge not assigned to that part of the court, but a District Judge duly assigned thereto was sitting therein at the time, and willing and ready to act upon any such application. Upon these grounds Johnson prayed that the Senior Circuit Judge's assignment to the District Court for the purpose of hearing matters in the American Brake Shoe Company's suit, his division of business order directing that applications for the appointing of receivers in equity might be made to him, his orders appointing temporary receivers for the Interborough Company and a temporary receiver for the Manhattan Company, and all other orders made by him in the suit, be held void and vacated.\n On the same day, September 21, Lillian Boehm was given leave, by the District Judge sitting in the motion part of the court, to intervene as a party plaintiff in Johnson's suit, which she did. She was a stockholder in the Manhattan Company and a secured creditor of the Interborough Company. In her bill of intervention she asserted there was imperative need for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of and to preserve the property of the Interborough Company, continue the operation of its railroad system for the accommodation of the public, and collect and properly appropriate the income thereof until the final decree; assailed the orders of the Senior Circuit Judge in the American Brake Shoe Company's suit upon the same grounds that were set forth in Johnson's bill; and joined in the prayers of his bill.\n Johnson and Boehm both subsequently filed petitions supplemental to their original bills, and in these supplements the Senior Circuit Judge's order of September 28, \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 492]\n\u00a0\n continuing the Interborough and Manhattan receiverships, was assailed as void upon the grounds theretofore advanced against the orders appointing temporary receivers. Thenceforth the assault was directed chiefly against the order continuing the receiverships, the orders naming temporary receivers having served their purpose and being superseded.\n In their bills and supplements Johnson and Boehm also complained that the receivers appointed for the Interborough and Manhattan Companies in the earlier suit of the American Brake Shoe Company had theretofore had, or then had, relations with the Interborough and Manhattan Companies and with particular groups of the creditors of one or the other of those companies which would tend to prevent them from discharging their duties impartially and with due regard to the rights of all who were parties in interest. But there was no claim that either Johnson or Boehm had presented this complaint in the suit wherein the receivers were appointed and in which they were acting.\n In the Johnson suit Johnson and Boehm separately procured, from the District Judge, sitting in the motion part of the court, rules requiring the defenda ts in that suit to show cause on October 4 why orders should not be granted vacating (1) the Senior Circuit Judge's assignment of himself to sit in the District Court to hear matters in the Maerican Brake Shoe Company's suit, (2) his division of business order directing that applications for the appointment of receivers in equity might be made to him, and (3) his several orders in the American Brake Shoe Company's suit, including those appointing receivers; and why independent receivers for the Manhattan Company, and likewise for the Interborough Company, should not be appointed in the Johnson suit.\n On the return day of these rules to show cause the parties appeared before the District Judge sitting in the \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 493]\n\u00a0\n motion part of the court, and were heard by him. At that time answers to the bills and supplements had not been filed and as yet were not due. Affidavits were tendered by the defendants to refute the complaint questioning the personal fitness of the receivers for the service for which they were appointed. But the District Judge put this and related questions of fact to one side as being outside the scope of the hearing, which he ruled was confined to the question whether the Senior Circuit Judge could entertain the application for receivers in the suit of the American Brake Shoe Company and make the orders which were assailed.\n The outcome of the hearing was that the District Judge held that the Senior Circuit Judge's assignment of himself to the District Court to hear and determine all matters in the American Brake Shoe Company's suit was void, because, even if empowered by section 22 to make a general assignment of himself to hold the District Court, he was without authority to make a selective assignment, as by designating the case which he was to hear or the part of the court in which he was to sit; that his division of business order was void, because under section 27 a failure of the District Judges to agree upon the division of business is a condition precedent to action on that subject by the Senior Circuit Judge, and there had been no such failure to agree; that rules 1-a and 11-a of the District Court are valid and operate to limit the jurisdiction of all judges assigned to the District Court, whether they be District Judges or Circuit Judges, and as the orders of the Senior Circuit Judge in the American Brake Shoe Company's suit were all made in contravention of those rules they were void; and that these orders could not be supported on the theory that he was a de facto judge, for he was not such but merely an intruder. \n2\n The District \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 494]\n\u00a0\n Judge accordingly passed a decree, on Ocotober 18, vacating all decrees and orders made by the Senior Circuit Judge in the Maerican Brake Shoe Company's suit. But just before giving that decree the District Judge passed another, on his own motion and over the objection of the parties to the suit of the American Brake Shoe Company, consolidating that suit and the Johnson suit. Consolidation was ordered, because, as the District Judge said, there was in his mind 'a residuum of doubt' whether, so long as the suits remained separate, an order properly could be passed in the Johnson suit vacating the orders made in the other and earlier suit.\n On appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals the consolidating decree and the vacating decree were both reversed. \n3\n Johnson and Boehm then separately petitioned this court for a review on certiorari and the petitions were granted. \n289 \nU.S. 714\n, 53 S.Ct. 524, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Counsel for petitioners now assume that in granting the petitions this court intended to review the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the appeal from the consolidating decree, as well as its decision on the appeal from the vacating decree; but the assumption is without any basis. In the petitions complaint was made of the reversal of the vacating decree, but not of the reversal of the consolidating decree; and the reasons advanced to obtain a review related only to the reversal of the vacating decree. Plainly the petitions sought a review of the latter, and of it only; and obviously the review granted was not intended to be broader than that sought in the petitions.\n In turning to the particular questions presented, the Circuit Court of Appeals accurately and concisely observed:\n'The controversy does not touch the substantial relief asked by any of the parties; all acknowledge that the two \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 495]\n\u00a0\n railways are in such financial straits that a court of equity must take over their assets, to prevent their dismemberment by execution, attachment and the like. The plaintiffs, and those who have intervened (in the Johnson suit), ask for receivers, just as do the parties to the American Brake Shoe Company suit. The dispute touches merely who shall be the receivers, and who the judge to have charge of the receivership.'\n\n One question claiming attention is whether the attack made in the Johnson suit on the orders in the American Brake Shoe Company suit was direct or collateral. The suits were distinct, although directed to the same main end. Johnson purposely brought his suit as a separate and independent suit, and Boehm purposely intervened in it as such. Both were invited by the orders in the other suit to appear therein and show cause, if any they had, why the temporary receivership should not be continued. Had they appeared they would have been entitled to object that the judge sitting at the time was acting without authority or in contravention of applicable court rules, and to object that the persons temporarily named as receivers were not suited to the task and ought not to be continued; and had the receivership been continued without giving effect to these objections they would have been entitled to appeal. \n4\n In thus seeking a correction of errors claimed to have been committed in continuing the receiverships they would have been engaged in a direct attack. But they chose to make the objections in a distinct receivership suit of their own, not on any recognized equitable ground, such as fraud, imposition, or mistake, but on the ground of alleged error. In this they were engaged in a collateral attack. That their suit was brought in the \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 496]\n\u00a0\n same court where the other suit was pending did not make the attack any the less collateral. \n5\n Of course, under Equity Rule 37 (28 USCA  723), they could not intervene as parties in the other suit, save 'in subordination to, and in recognition of, the propriety of the main proceeding'; but this restriction put no obstacle in their way. \n6\n They were not objecting to a receivership such as was sought in the other suit, but were themselves asserting its propriety upon the same grounds and to the same general end that were set up in that suit. Their objections went only to the particular judge sitting in the hearing and to the particular receivers. In these circumstances it is plain that the attack was collateral. \n7\n And, this being so, there was need for heeding the familiar rule that such an attack can be successful only where and to the extent that it discloses a want of power as distinguished from error in the exertion of power that was possessed. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The District Judge, as shown in his opinion, was in doubt whether the attack was direct or collateral, but conceived that the doubt could be removed and the attack made direct by ordering a consolidation of the two suits, which he did on his own motion over objections by the parties to the American Brake Shoe Company suit. The order of consolidation has since been reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals; but, quite apart from the reversal, the consolidation did not alter the nature of the attack. Under the statute, 28 U.S.C.  734 (28 USCA  734), consolidation is permitted as a matter of convenience and economy in administration, but does not merge the suits into a \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 497]\n\u00a0\n single cause, or change the rights of the parties, or make those who are parties in one suit parties in another. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Next in order are the questions respecting the Senior Circuit Judge's assignment of himself to sit in the District Court to hear matters in the American Brake Shoe Company suit. The statute, 28 U.S.C.  22 (28 USCA  22), provides that the Chief Justice, or the Circuit Justice of the circuit, or the Senior Circuit Judge thereof, may, 'if the public interest requires,' designate and assign 'any circuit judge' of the circuit to hold a District Court therein. The same authority to assign that is given to the Chief Justice and the Circuit Justice, respectively, is also given to the Senior Circuit Judge; and that authority is to assign 'any Circuit Judge' of the particular circuit. There are no restrictive words. There can be no doubt that under this section the Chief Justice may assign the Senior Circuit Judge of the circuit, he being one of the Circuit Judges thereof; and equally there can be no doubt that the Circuit Justice may do the same. May the Senior Circuit Judge assign himself? The words of the section, taken literally, mean that he may do so; and only by implying restrictive words which are not there can the section be held to mean otherwise. But the real meaning is not reflected alone in the words of the section, for there are other considerations which point to the literal meaning as the true one.\n Section 22 was first enacted as part of the Judicial Code, effective January 1, 1912, which abolished the old Circuit Courts and transferred their jurisdiction to the District Courts. When the proposed Code was pending before the Congress, differences of opinion arose over the proposed abolition of the Circuit Courts. There was op- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 498]\n\u00a0\n position to this on the ground chiefly that it would take Circuit Judges out of work in which they were accustomed to participate, and as to much of which there would be reason for their continued participation. These differences led to the inclusion in the proposed Code of the assignment provision now embodied in section 22. Members of the committees having the bill in charge and members of the conference committee to which it ultimately was referred explained in their respective Houses that the provision was intended to establish a liberal and flexible plan under which Circuit Judges could sit in the District Courts; and that under it any Circuit Judge readily could be assigned to hold a District Court within his circuit whenever occasion therefor might arise, whether from a pressure of business in a District Court, from the presence therein of particular cases of special importance, from an absence of business in the Circuit Court of Appeals, or from any other situation, if the Senior Circuit Judge, or the Circuit Justice, or the Chief Justice, deemed the assignment to be in the public interest. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Since the Judicial Code went into effect it has been the practice of most of the Senior Circuit Judges to assign themselves, as well as other Circuit Judges, to sit in District Courts within their circuits whenever they deemed that the public interest required it. The practice was initiated early in 1912 by the then Senior Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit and has been followed by each of his four successors. In the other circuits the Senior Circuit Judges, with a notable exception,11 adopted that \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 499]\n\u00a0\n course of action. Some of the assignments were generally to hold a District Court in a named district; others were to hold a particular division of a District Court, or a term of such court at one of several places fixed by law; and still others were to hold a District Court to hear and determine a designated cause or causes.\n Early in 1912 the Senior Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit assigned himself to sit in a District Court to hear matters arising in a specified receivership suit. While he was sitting in that suit an intervener challenged his authority to make the assignment or act under it. A hearing was had on the question, after which the judge in a considered opinion, published at the time,12 upheld the assignment and denied the motion presenting the chal- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 500]\n\u00a0\n lenge. A review was not sought, nor was the question further agitated.\n The practice of the Senior Circuit Judges here described and the decision just mentioned amounted to a practical construction of the provision in question in keeping with its literal meaning. In 1922, after that construction had prevailed and been acted on for several years, the provision was re-enacted by the Congress as part of an act dealing with other assignments of judges to the District Courts. \n13\n The re-enactment was without any change indicative of a disapproval of the prior construction by the Senior Circuit Judges. In such circumstances, as this court often has pointed out, re-enactment operates as an implied legislative approval of the prior construction-in other words, as a re-enactment of the statute as before construed. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n It is said that section 22 gives no authority for making a selective designation, as by designating the case which the assigned judge is to hear or the part of the court in which he is to sit. To this assent cannot be given. It has no support in the words of the section, is contrary to the plain import of the legislative proceedings before noticed, and is opposed to the settled practice of the Senior Circuit Judges. Assignments to hear particular cases have been made in all the circuits. Such an assignment was involved in United States v. Gill, 292 F. 136, and was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The earliest assignments in the Second Circuit were thus limited-not only the one assigning the Senior Circuit Judge already noticed, but also those assigning other Circuit Judges. It is easily conceivable that there may be compelling reason in the public interest to make \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 501]\n\u00a0\n an assignment for a particular case, or for one of several divisions of the court, or for a limited period such as thirty or sixty days. The section makes the public interest, as found by the assigning authority, the criterion. If that interest is found to require only a limited assignment, it would seem that the action taken should be limited accordingly. The succeeding section (23) requires a Circuit Judge who is assigned under section 22 to discharge all the judicial duties 'for which he is so appointed, during the time for which he is so appointed.' In this there is a plain implication that the assignment may be for particular duties and for a limited time.\n The District Judge did not rule on the part of the attack wherein it was contended that the assignment was invalid because there was no public interest requiring it; but the Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the contention on the ground that the recital or finding in the assignment that public interest required it is conclusive in this proceeding. Plainly the Circuit Court of Appeals was right. By section 22 the decision as to requiring public interest is left to the one having the power to assign. The duty and the responsibility are with him-as well when he is a Senior Circuit Judge as when he is the Chief Justice or a Circuit Justice. His decision that there is a requiring public interest is not open to a collateral attack such as is here presented. \n15\n And were it so open, no litigant could with any safety submit any matter to an assigned judge-a situation which would involve intolerable uncertainty and embarrassment to both public and private interests. \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 502]\n\u00a0\n In the course of his opinion the District Judge suggested that the assault on the assignment and on the Senior Circuit Judge's authority to act under it 'sounded in quo warranto,' and so might possibly be regarded as being direct rather than collateral. But the suggestion was ill grounded. Quo warranto is addressed to preventing a continued exercise of authority unlawfully asserted, not to a correction of what already has been done under it or to a vindication of private rights. It is an extraordinary proceeding, prerogative in nature, and in this instance could have been brought by the United States, and by it only, for there is no statute delegating to an individual the right to resort to it. \n16\n Besides, such a proceeding, to reach its objective in a situation like that here disclosed, must be brought against the person who is charged with exercising an office or authority without lawful right. \n17\n The Johnson suit was not against the judge acting under the assignment, but was wholly between others who were private litigants. So, granting that an attack in a quo warranto proceeding would have been direct, and not merely collateral, it must be held that the suit before the District Judge was not such a proceeding.\n It follows from the views already expressed that there was no jurisdictional infirmity in the Senior Circuit Judge's orders in the American Brake Shoe Company suit, unless such an infirmity arose from his disregard of rules 1-a and 11-a of the District Court. His status when making the orders was that of a Circuit Judge specially assigned to and sitting in the District Court to hear and determine all applications and proceedings in the suit wherein the orders were made; and his powers and duties \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 503]\n\u00a0\n in that connection were just what they would have been had he been so assigned by the Chief Justice or the Circuit Justice, instead of by himself. No doubt he was under a duty to recognize and respect all valid rules of the District Court which were applicable to the proceedings before him; but he was not under a duty to give effect to rules which were either invalid or inapplicable.\n One of the rules disregarded, 1-a, provides that an assigned judge shall 'do such work only as may be assigned to him by the senior district judge.' In this there is an attempt to invest the senior judge of the district with a discretion to determine what work an assigned judge shall do, and also an attempt to exclude him from any other work. Here the Circuit Judge was sitting in the District Court under an assignment specially designating the work which he was to do. The rule says in effect that this work could not be done by him unless the senior judge of the district approved the special designation; and it means that this judge may either approve or disapprove. In short, it attempts to give him a power of veto over the designation and thus to interfere with the work specified. By statute, 28 U.S.C.  731 (28 USCA  731), the power of the District Courts to make rules is confined to such as are 'not inconsistent with any law of the United States'; and it obviously would be thus limited even without the statute. \n18\n Not only does section 22 authorize a special assignment such as is shown here, but section 23 requires the assigned judge to discharge the duties for which he is so assigned. It is apparent, therefore, that, as applied to such an assignment, the rule operates as an interference with the discharge of those duties and is in that regard inconsistent with sections 22 and 23 and invalid.\n The other rule which was disregarded, 11-a, provides that all applications for the appointment of receivers in \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 504]\n\u00a0\n equity causes shall be made to the judge holding the motion part of the court, and 'to no other judge.' As it is sought to be applied here, this rule is subject to objections like those just assigned for condemning the application sought to be made of rule 1-a. The judge to whom the application for receivers was presented was sitting in the District Court on the equity side. Under section 22 he was specially assigned to that court to hear and determine all proceedings in the suit in which the application was made; and section 23 laid on him a duty to conform to the assignment. The rule forbids him to hear the application notwithstanding his special a signment. Thus the rule conflicts with sections 22 and 23 and must fall.\n What has been said shows that the collateral attack cannot succeed, and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed. But in the interest of right judicial administration, and to avoid any misapprehension as to what is here decided, something more needs to be said.\n The possession of power is one thing; the propriety of its exercise in particular circumstances is quite a different thing. This is true of the power of a Senior Circuit Judge to assign himself to sit in a particular case in a District Court. In its very nature this power is one which should be sparingly exercised, and then only in special exigencies and with commensurate care and discretion. The occasions are rare in which the matter cannot be referred to the Chief Justice or the Circuit Justice and committed to his consideration and judgment. A receivership is not grantable as of course, but only for reasons strongly appealing to the judge to whom the application is made. When large properties are involved a receivership usually involves widely conflicting interests and presents questions fraught with difficulty and exceptional delicacy. This was true of the receivership here in question. It involved properties, estimated to approximate $500,000,000 in value, which were held and used by a public carrier em- \n\n[289 U.S. 479, 505]\n\u00a0\n ploying thousands of persons in its work and carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers each day. The carrier was in greatly embarrassed condition, had thousands of creditors whose interests were divergent, and was confronted with possible forfeiture of some of its franchises. All this shows that the situation was one in which the assignment of a judge to take charge of the receivership, if one was to be assigned, was a task which needed to be performed upon careful consideration and with the utmost impartiality. The difference of opinion, between the Senior Circuit Judge and the District Judges, respecting the relative fitness of individuals and trust companies as equity receivers, was not a proper ground for taking the cause away from the District Judge before whom it ordinarily would come, and bringing it before the assigning Senior Circuit Judge. \n19\n Granting that the latter was most sincere in what he did, there was yet no compelling reason for assigning himself. Had he reflected he probably would not have made such an assignment; but he acted hastily and evidently with questionable wisdom. This action has embarrassed and is embarrassing the receivership. If he were now to withdraw from further participation in the receivership proceedings the embarrassment would be relieved; and the belief is ventured here that, on further reflection, he will recognize the propriety of so doing and, by withdrawing, will open the way for another judge with appropriate authority to conduct the further proceedings.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in the result.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS did not hear the argument or participate in the decision. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See American Brake Shoe & Foundry Company v.

Sanborn was long the Senior Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit and during much of that period the Justice delivering this opinion was the Circuit Justice for that circuit. The files of this Circuit Justice are the basis for the following statement:\n In 1912, Judge Sanborn was requested by the other Circuit Judges in that circuit, and by the District Judge who was specially concerned, to take charge of an important railroad receivership suit in one of the districts within the circuit. Judge Sanborn indicated that he would be willing to undertake the service if he were assigned thereto by the Chief Justice or the Circuit Justice, but that he was quite unwilling to assign himself to the District Court for the purpose, because such an assignment would have a personal side approaching impropriety. One of the Circuit Judges and the District Judge of the particular district then applied to the Circuit Justice to make an assignment of Judge Sanborn, which was done. Judge Sanborn's indisposition to assign himself continued; and in like circumstances he was assigned by the Circuit Justice to District Courts in that circuit on twelve different occasions in the years 1912 to 1923, each assignment being limited to a particular year, but otherwise general. The receiverships of the Wabash Railroad and the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad were among the matters which came before Judge Sanborn under those assignments.\n Judge Sanborn's successor as Senior Circuit Judge accepted and conformed to the general practice. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Pennsylvania Steel Company v.

STAR(1933)\nNo. 282\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Texas.\n Mr. Spearman Webb, of Sherman, Tex., for appellants.\n Mr. William Andress, Jr., of Dallas, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to March 13, 1931, appellants obtained a judgment for $113.20 against the Dallas Showcase & Manufacturing Company. On that day the latter, being insolvent and having unsecured indebtedness of about $11,000, made to appellee a voluntary assignment of all its property for the benefit of its creditors. Appellants refused to accept under the assignment, and brought garnishment proceedings in justice court against the appellee. He answered that as such assignee, acting under title 12 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes 1925, he had converted the assigned property into cash and had $582.63 which, as he insisted, was not subject to garnishment. The justice of the peace held him liable. He appealed to the county court, and there the case was submitted on an agreed statement showing the facts aforesaid. The court held the state law in conflict with the Bankruptcy \n\n[287 U.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n Act, and that therefore the amount on hand was subject to garnishment. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed, 44 S.W.(2d) 429, and the Supreme Court, approving its opinion, denied writ of error. 47 S.W. (2d) 608.\n The sole question is whether, as construed by its highest court, articles 261-274 of title 12 are repugnant to the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA).\n These provisions are derived from an Act of March 24, 1879, (Acts 1879, p. 57, c. 53) as amended, Acts 1883, p. 46, c. 56. Evidently, that statute was intended to take the place of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517), which was repealed in 1878 (20 Stat. 99). Cunningham v. Norton, \n125 \nU.S. 77, 81\n, 8 S.Ct. 804. It established a complete system for the administration of property conveyed by insolvent debtors for the benefit of their creditors. Tracy v. Tuffly, \n134 \nU.S. 206, 223\n, 10 S.Ct. 527. Every such assignment is required to provide for ratable distribution of the insolvent's estate among the consenting creditors, and, whether or not so specified, is deemed sufficient to pass all the assignor's property to the assignee. Article 261. 'A debtor may make such assignment and shall thereupon stand discharged from all further liability to such consenting creditors. ... Such debtor shall not be discharged from liability to such creditor who does not receive as much as one-third of the amount ... allowed in his favor. ...' Article 263. Nonassenting creditors take nothing under the assignment, article 265, but may garnishee any excess remaining after full payment of consenting creditors and the expenses of executing the assignment. Article 271.\n'The statute in question is in no sense an insolvent law, providing for the discharge of a debtor by a compliance with its terms without the consent of the creditor; but is a statute which, for the better protection of creditors, prescribes a mode for the administration of the estates of insolvents under assignments made by the debtors themselves, which would be good at common law, \n\n[287 U.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n unaided by the statute, and, like any other trust, could be enforced in a court of equity in the absence of a statute providing a mode of administration.' Keating v. Vaughn (1884) 61 Tex. 518, 524. And see Leon & H. Blum v. Welborne (1882) 58 Tex. 157, 161. McKee v. Coffin (1886) 66 Tex. 304, 309, 1 S.W. 276. Fant v. Elsbury (1887) 68 Tex. 1, 5, 2 S.W. 866. And in a case arising after the passage of the present Bankruptcy Act a lower court propounded the question whether this law was suspended by the Bankruptcy Act. The Supreme Court, after reference to Boese v. King, \n108 \nU.S. 379\n, 2 S.Ct. 765, said: 'The effect of the ruling (in that case) is that, in so far, at least, as an insolvent law of a state provides for a release by the creditors, it is suspended by a bankrupt law of the United States, but that if the assignment convey all the debtor's property, subject to the payment of his debts, for the equal benefit of all his creditors who may accept under it, it is otherwise valid, except as against proceedings seasonably taken under the bankrupt act.' Patty- Joiner & Eubank Co. v. Cummins (1900) 93 Tex. 598, 604, 57 S.W. 566, 568. And in a later case the court held that, though the statute, in so far as it makes provision for exacting releases should be held to be an insolvent law, and therefore suspended by the Bankruptcy Act, one who had accepted and received one-third of the amount of his claim under an assignment good at common law, though exacting such release, where no proceedings were had under the Bankruptcy Act, thereby discharged the debtor from liability. Haijek & Simecek v. Luck (1903) 96 Tex. 517, 74 S.W. 305.\n\n In the case at bar the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fifth District observed the differences between state insolvency laws and those merely regulating voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors, and, following the rule established by the Texas Supreme Court that nonconsenting creditors may not seize property covered by such assign- \n\n[287 U.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n ments, held that the fund in the hands of the assignee was not garnishable. And the Supreme Court, approving that decision and disapproving one to the contrary announced by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth District, Johnson v. Chapman Milling Co., 37 S.W.(2d) 776, held that the questions at issue have been definitely settled by this court in the cases of Patty- Joiner & Eubank Co. v. Cummins, supra, and Haijek & Simecek v. Luck, supra.\n Accepting as we do that court's construction of the provisions in question, we are of opinion that they are not repugnant to the Bankruptcy Act. This case is ruled by our decision in Pobreslo v. Joseph M. Boyd Company, \n287 \nU.S. 518\n, 53 S.Ct. 262.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEYSTONE DRILLER CO. v. GENERAL EXCAVATOR CO.(1933)\nNo. 34\nArgued: October 9, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Boyd and F. O. Richey, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edwin P. Corbett, of Columbus, Ohio, and Lloyd T. Williams, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly applied the maxim, He who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\n Petitioner owns five patents which may be conveniently identified as the Clutter patent and the four Downie \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n patents. \n1\n They all cover devices constituting parts of a ditching machine operated on the principle of a mechannical hoe or mattock. The Clutter patent is basic and the Downie patents are for claimed improvements.\n Prior to the commencement of these suits, the petitioner brought a suit in the Eastern Division of the Northern Ohio District against the Byers Machine Company for infringement of the first three patents. January 31, 1929, the court held them valid and infringed, and granted injunction. 4 F.Supp. 159. Defendant appealed.\n February 9, 1929, petitioner brought these two suits in the Western Division of the same District, one against the General Excavator Company and the other against the Osgood Company. In each, plaintiff alleged infringement by defendant of the same three patents. Plaintiff immediately applied for temporary injunctions to restrain further infringement. The applications were based upon the complaints, supporting affidavits and the pleadings, opinion and decree in the Byers Case. The court filed a memorandum in which it is stated that, while plaintiff had sustained its patents as against the defenses of an alleged impecunious infringer, defendants were in good faith pressing new defenses that seemed to have merit enough to prevent the application of the rule permitting a temporary injunction merely because of the prior adjudication. The court denied the injunctions, but upon condition that defendants give bonds to pay the profits or damages that might be decreed against them. In August, 1929, plaintiff filed supplemental complaints alleging infringement of the other two patents. November 5, 1930, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree in the Byers Case. 44 F.(2d) \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n 283. Then these cases were consolidated for trial. Plaintiff withdrew its claim that the Osgood Company infringed the last patent. The district court held the Clutter patent and the first and fourth Downie patents valid and infringed, the second Downie not infringed, and the third Downie patent invalid.\n At the trial of these cases, defendants introduced evidence that plaintiff did not come into court with clean hands. It was sufficient to sustain findings of fact made by both courts, in substance as follows: June 27, 1921, Downie filed the application on which was issued his first patent. In the preceding winter he had learned of a possible prior use at Joplin, Mo., by Bernard R. Clutter. The latter is a brother of the patentee of the Clutter patent and had then recently been in the service of plaintiff as demonstrator in the use of ditching machinery. Downie made the application and assigned his rights to plaintiff, of which he was secretary and general manager. The patent issued, and plaintiff, contemplating the bringing of an infringement suit thereon against the Byers Machine Company, was advised that the prior use at Joplin was sufficient to cast doubt upon the validity of the patent. Downie then went to Bernard R. Clutter and for valuable considerations-which are described in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 62 F.(2d) 48, and need not be detailed here-obtained from Clutter an affidavit prepared by Downie to the effect that Clutter's use of the device was an abandoned experiment, and also obtained Clutter's agreement to assign plaintiff any rights he might have as inventor, to keep secret the details of the prior use, and, so far as he was able, to suppress the evidence. No proof of such use was produced at the trial of that case. The defendants in these suits took Clutter's deposition early in 1930. He did not then disclose his arrangement with plaintiff for concealment of evidence in the Byers Case. Their suspicions being \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n aroused by his testimony, defendants in the latter part of that year again examined him and secured facts upon which they were able to compel the plaintiff to furnish the details of the corrupt transaction.\n The district court characterized Downie's conduct as highly reprehensible, and found that his purpose was to keep Clutter silent. But it also found that the plaintiff did nothing to suppress evidence in these cases. It expressed the opinion that matters pertaining to the motion for preliminary injunction had no bearing upon the merits, and that plaintiff's use of the Byers decree was not a fraud upon the court. And it ruled the maxim did not apply. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the contrary, reversed the decrees of the District Court, and remanded the cases, with instructions to dismiss the complaints without prejudice. 62 F.( 2d) 48; 64 F.(2d) 39.\n Plaintiff contends that the maxim does not apply unless the wrongful conduct is directly connected with and material to the matter in litigation, and that, where more than one cause is joined in a bill and plaintiff is shown to have come with unclean hands in respect of only one of them, the others will not be dismissed.\n The meaning and proper application of the maxim are to be considered. As authoritatively expounded, the words and the reasons upon which it rests extend to the party seeking relief in equity. 'It is one of the fundamental principles upon which equity jurisprudence is founded, that before a complainant can have a standing in court he must first show that not only has he a good and meritorious cause of action, but he must come into court with clean hands. He must be frank and fair with the court, nothing about the case under consideration should be guarded, but everything that tends to a full and fair determination of the matters in controversy should be placed before the court.' Story's Equity Jurisprudence (14th Ed.)  98. The governing principle is 'that \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n whenever a party who, as actor, seeks to set the judicial machinery in motion and obtain some remedy, has violated conscience, or good faith, or other equitable principle, in his prior conduct, then the doors of the court will be shut against him in limine; the court will refuse to interfere on his behalf, to acknowledge his right, or to award him any remedy.' Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.)  397. This court has declared: 'It is a principle in chancery, that he who asks relief must have acted in good faith. The equitable powers of this court can never be exerted in behalf of oen who has acted fraudulently, or who by deceit or any unfair means has gained an advantage. To aid a party in such a case would make this court the abetter of iniquity.' Bein v. Heath, 6 How. 228, 247. And again: 'A court of equity acts only when and as conscience commands; and, if the conduct of the plaintiff be offensive to the dictates of natural justice, then, whatever may be the rights he possesses, and whatever use he may make of them in a court of law, he will be held remediless in a court of equity.' Deweese v. Reinhard, \n165 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 17 S.Ct. 340, 341.\n But courts of equity do not make the quality of suitors the test. They apply the maxim requiring clean hands only where some unconscionable act of one coming for relief has immediate and necessary relation to the equity that he seeks in respect of the matter in litigation. They do not close their doors because of plaintiff's misconduct, whatever its character, that has no relation to anything involved in the suit, but only for such violations of conscience as in some measure affect the equitable relations between the parties in respect of something brought before the court for adjudication. Story, Id.,  100. Pomeroy, Id.,  399. They apply the maxim, not by way of punishment for extraneous transgressions, but upon considerations that make for the advancement of right and justice. They are not bound by formula or restrained \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 246]\n\u00a0\n by any limitation that tends to trammel the free and just exercise of discretion.\n Neither the plaintiff's corruption of Clutter in respect of the first Downie patent nor its use in these cases of the Byers decree can fairly be deemed to be unconnected with causes of action based on the other patents.\n Its bills show the devices covered by the five patents to be important, if not essential, parts of the same machine. And its claims warrant the inference that each supplements the others. This is made plain by mere reference to the things patented. The Clutter device is for the hoe or mattock arrangement. The first Downie is for an improvement designed, by a drop bottom scoop and other means, to permit more accurate dumping. The second Downie had for its main purpose the elimination of a 'blind spot' in the unloading operation. The third Downie makes possible and convenient the use of scoops of different widths upon the same machine. The fourth Downie device consists of detachable rake teeth for a scoop.\n Had the corruption of Clutter been disclosed at the trial of the Byers Case, the court undoubtedly would have been warranted ranted in holding it sufficient to require dismissal of the cause of action there alleged for the infringement of the Downie patent. Promptly after the decision in that case plaintiff brought these suits and immediately applied for injunctions pendente lite. It used the decree of validity there obtained in support, if not indeed as the basis, of its applications. And plaintiff's misconduct in the Byers suit remaining undisclosed, that decree was given weight on the motions for preliminary injunctions. Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Mach. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 301, 312\n, 29 S.Ct. 495, 1 Walker on Patents (6th Ed.)  704 et seq. As the litigation was to continue for years and the use of the devices in question was essential to the ditching machinery, it is clear that the injunctions would have been a burdensome \n\n[290 U.S. 240, 247]\n\u00a0\n detriment to defendants. The amounts of the bonds required in lieu of injunctions attest the importance of the advantage obtained by use of the decree. While it is not found, as reasonably it may be inferred from the circumstances, that from the beginning it was plaintiff's intention through suppression of Clutter's evidence to obtain decree in the Byers Case for use in subsequent infringement suits against these defendants and others, it does clearly appear that the plaintiff made the Byers Case a part of his preparation in these suits. The use actually made of that decree is sufficient to show that plaintiff did not come with clean hands in respect of any cause of action in these cases.\n The relation between the device covered by the first Downie patent and those covered by the other patents, taken in connection with the use to which plaintiff put the Byers decree, is amply sufficient to bring these cases within the maxim.

LUMBER CO. v. DIMON S.S. CORP.(1933)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 10, 1933Decided: November 13, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lane Summers and W. H. Hayden, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner. \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 118]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude E. Wakefield and Cassius E. Gates, both of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit in admiralty was brought by petitioner in the District Court for Western Washington against respondent, the steamship Pacific Cedar, and its owner, the respondent Dimon Steamship Corporation, to recover an alleged overpayment of freight and to establish a lien on the vessel for the amount of the overpayment. The libel alleges a contract by petitioner with the owner, by which the latter agreed to receive for loading on the Pacific Cedar, on or about January 18, 1930, at named Pacific Coast ports, a quantity of lumber, and to transport it to Philadelphia and New York at the rate of $10 per thousand feet, but with a provision that in the event 'a regular intercoastal carrier moves similar cargo at a lower rate,' such lower rate should be applied. The libel makes no reference to any bill of lading but sets up that the lumber was shipped and transported, and between March 1st and 20th was delivered, all under the provisions of the contract, and that at the conclusion of the voyage and while the vessel was discharging her cargo, respondents, at destination, demanded and received payment of freight at the $10 rate, although in January, 1930, a regular intercoastal carrier had carried a similar cargo from Seattle to Baltimore at $8.50 per thousand feet.\n The lien asserted is for the difference between the freight paid and the freight earned at the agreed lower rate. Upon exceptions the District Court dismissed the libel for want of admiralty jurisdiction. The Pacific Cedar, 53 F.(2d) 492. \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decree dismissing the libel in personam, but affirmed so much of it as dismissed the libel in rem. 61 F.(2d) 187. This Court granted certiorari on petition of the libellant alone, \n289 \nU.S. 716\n, 53 S.Ct. 594, 77 L.Ed. --, to resolve an alleged conflict between the decision below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in The Oregon, 55 F. 666, 676. The only question presented here is whether the petitioner is entitled to a lien on the vessel for the overpaid freight.\n While there has been a lack of unanimity in the decisions as to the precise limits of the lien in favor of the cargo, see Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Pacific Export Lumber Co., \n260 \nU.S. 490\n, 43 S.Ct. 172, the cases are agreed that the right to the lien has its source in the contract of affreightment and that the lien itself is justified as a means by which the vessel, treated as a personality or as impliedly hypothecated to secure the performance of the contract, is made answerable for nonperformance. See The Schooner Freeman v. Buckingham, 18 How. 182, 188; Vandewater v. Mills, 19 How. 82, 90; Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Pacific Export Lumber Co., supra; The Flash, 1 Abb.Adm. 67, Fed. Cas. No. 4,857; The Rebecca, 1 Ware, 188, Fed. Cas. No. 11,619; Scott v. The Ira Chaffee (D.C.) 2 F. 401. This engagement of the vessel, or its hypothecation, as distinguished from the personal obligation of the owner, does not ensue upon the mere execution of the contract for transportation. Only upon the lading of the vessel or at least when she is ready to receive the cargo-when there is 'union of ship and cargo'-does not contract become the contract of the vessel and the right to the lien attach. No lien for breach of the contract to carry results from failure of the vessel to receive and load the cargo or a part of it. See The Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Pacific Export Lumber Co., supra.\n It is not questioned here that the union of ship and cargo, once established, gives rise to the right of the vessel to a lien on the cargo for the freight money and of the \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n cargo on the vessel for failure to carry safely and deliver rightly. The breach now alleged is only that the freight demanded on discharge of the cargo was in excess of that stipulated by the contract, and respondent insists that the liens in favor of cargo growing out of the contract of affreightment are restricted to those claims founded on breach of the obligation to carry and deliver. But the undertaking to charge the agreed freight and no more is an inseparable incident to every contract of affreightment, as essential to it and as properly a subject of admiralty jurisdiction as is the obligation of the cargo to pay freight when earned, or of the vessel to carry safely. See Matson Navigation Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 352, 358\n, 52 S.Ct. 162. It is unlike an agreement to pay a commission to the broker procuring the charter party, Brown v. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. (C.C.A.) 112 F. 1018, or a provision for storing cargo in the vessel at the end of the voyage, Pillsbury Flour Mills Co. v. Interlake Steamship Co. (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 439, which, though embodied in the contract of carriage for hire, are no necessary part of it.\n It is not denied and the cases hold that there is a lien for excessive freight knowingly exacted as a condition of delivery of the cargo, The John Francis (D.C.) 184 F. 746; The Ada (D.C.) 233 F. 325; The Muskegon (D.C.) 10 F.(2d) 817; Tatsuuma Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha v. Robert Dollar Co. (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 401; cf. The Oregon (C.C.A.) 55 F. 666, 677, but it is argued that in that case the generating source of the right is the failure to perform the transportation contract by refusal to deliver the cargo. The fact that the breach of one term of the contract, the agreement to charge only the stipulated freight, coincides with the breach of another to make delivery, does not obscure the fact that both terms are broken and that the substance of the right to recover is for the freight collected in excess of that agreed upon, not damages for failure to make delivery. Nor does the fact that there is breach of both afford any \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n basis for saying that the breach of either term alone could not give rise to the lien. This becomes more apparent upon examination of the numerous cases in which a lien has been imposed for some breach of the freight term. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n In The Oregon, supra, the time charterer sold the tonnage of the vessel for a single voyage at a rate in advance of that stipulated in the charter party. Her captain collected the freight at the agreed higher rate and retained it. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Judge Taft writing the opinion, sustained the jurisdiction in rem to recover the excess on the ground that its collection was incidental to the execution of the maritime contract, and to be treated as an overpayment of freight. This \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 124]\n\u00a0\n conclusion is obviously inconsistent with the view that the affreightment lien in favor of the cargo is dependent on the failure of the vessel to carry and deliver. The right to a lien for the mistaken overpayment of freight was involved in The Oceano (D.C.) 148 F. 131, where the charterer advanced charter freight to provide a fund for the vessel's disbursements, under stipulation that the advance should be deducted from the freight earned under the charter party. Upon settlement at the port of destination the libelant's agent, by mistake, deducted less than the advances made. The court, Judge Hough writing the opinion, held, treating the settlement as an overpayment of the charter freight, that the cause was one of affreightment and that a lien attached to the vessel for the amount of the overpayment.\n It was argued to us, as it has been in other cases, that as the payment for excess freight was made under mistake the demand is upon a cause of action for money had and received, which lies only at common law and not in admiralty. The objection applies with equal force to the liens allowed for excess freight, payment of which was procured by fraud or duress, or for freight paid in advance where the voyage was abandoned after the ship was loaded. \n2\n Admiralty is not concerned with the form of the action, but with its substance. Even under the common law form of action for money had and received there could be no recovery without proof of the breach of the contract involved in demanding the payment, and the basis of recovery there, as in admiralty, is the violation of some term of the contract of affreightment, whether by failure to carry or by exaction of freight which the contract did not authorize. See The Oceano, supra, 132 of 148 F.; but cf. Israel v. Moore & McCormack (D.C.) 295 F. 919. \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 125]\n\u00a0\n It seems equally obvious that lack of knowledge by the parties at the time of the payment that the freight demanded was excessive should have no bearing on the existence of the lien. There is no hint in the books that the security given by way of lien for the performance of the contract of affreightment depends upon such knowledge. The liability of the vessel for damage to cargo affords a not infrequent example of a lien which may attach, although at the time of unloading cargo there was no knowledge of the particular events which effected the breach. See Rich v. Lambert, 12 How. 347\n\n\n We see no distinction, either in principle or with respect to the practical operation or convenience of maritime commerce, between the lien asserted here for overpayment of freight by mistake and those for overpayments similarly made but induced by other means. Here, as there, the overpayment, made as the cargo was unloaded, occurred while the union of ship and cargo continued, and the liability asserted was determined by events contemporaneous with that union. The circumstances which called the lien into being do not differ in point of notoriety from those giving rise to other affreightment liens upon the vessel. While it is true that the maritime lien is secret, hence is stricti juris and not to be extended by implication, this does not mean that the right to the lien is not to be recognized and upheld, when within accepted supporting principles, merely because the circumstances which call for its recognition are unusual or infrequent.\n The suggestion made on the argument that the lien asserted here, after the cargo is discharged, is affected by application of the often stated rule that the liens on ship and cargo are mutual and reciprocal, is without basis. It is only the obligations of ship and cargo under the contract of affreightment which are to be characterized as mutual and reciprocal, not the liens which result from the \n\n[290 U.S. 117, 126]\n\u00a0\n breach of those obligations. The one lien may come into existence without the other and the lien on the ship in favor of cargo, not being possessory, see Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Vance, 19 How. 162; Tatsuuma Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha v.

C.I.R.(1933)\nNo. 595\nArgued: March 22, 1933Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 109, 110]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Washington Bowie, Jr., of Baltimore, Md., and J. R. Sherrod, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1915, petitioner and her husband purchased certain real property at a cost of $13,000; title being vested in them as tenants by the entirety. Of this amount petitioner contributed $1,560 (12 per cent.), and her husband the remaining 88 per cent. The husband died in 1924, the property at that time having a market value of $40,000; and 88 per cent. of that amount was included in the value of the decedent's gross estate for the purposes of the federal estate tax. In 1925 the property was sold for the sum last named. Petitioner, in her income tax return for that year, computed the profit on the basis of the market value of the property at the time of her husband's death, with the exception of 12 per cent., representing the sum which she had contributed to the purchase price of $ 13,000. The Commissioner determined a deficiency, using the entire 1915 cost as the basis for computing the amount of profit realized. The Commissioner's ruling was affirmed by a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (23 B.T.A. 854), and that in turn was affirmed by the court below. ( C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 280.\n The question to be determined, therefore, is whether cost of the property in 1915, or its market value at the time of decedent's death ( with allowable deductions), is the proper basis for determining the gain from the sale in 1925\n\n\n The solution of the problem depends upon the meaning of the provision contained in section 204(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 14, 26 USCA  935(a)(5), which reads: \n\n[289 U.S. 109, 111]\n\u00a0\n 'The basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913, shall be the cost of such property; except that-...\n'5. If the property was acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, the basis shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition.'\n\n An estate by the entirety is held by the husband and wife in single ownership, by a single title. They do not take by moieties, but both and each take the whole estate, that is to say, the entirety. The tenancy results from the common-law principle of marital unity; and is said to be sui generis. Upon the death of one of the tenants 'the survivor does not take as a new acquisition, but under the original limitation, his estate being simply freed from participation by the other. ...' 1 Washburn, Real Property (6th Ed.)  912. In the present case, therefore, when the husband died, the wife, in respect of this estate, did not succeed to anything. She simply continued, in virtue of the nature of the tenancy, to possess and own what she already had. Giving the words of the statute their natural and ordinary meaning, as must be done, it is obvious that nothing passed to her by bequest, devise, or inheritance.\n The foregoing view is confirmed, if that be necessary, by a consideration of the language immediately following the quotation from paragraph (5),  204(a), supra, namely: 'The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the acquisition of such property interests as are specified in subdivision ... (c) or (f) of section 1094(302) of this title.' Subdivision (c),  302 (26 USCA  1094(c), deals with transfers by the decedent made in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death; and subdivision (f),  302 (26 USCA  1094 (f) has reference to property passing under a general power of appointment, exercised by the decedent \n\n[289 U.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n by will or deed in like contemplation or with like intention. Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 70, 71. The significant circumstance is that subdivision (e),  302 (26 USCA  1094(e), which relates to interests held as joint tenants by the decedent and any other person, or as tenants by the entirety by the decedent and spouse, is not included in the enumeration. The result is that the interest held by a joint tenant or tenants by the entirety is expressly included in determining the value of the gross estate for purposes of the estate tax, but not so included as a basis for determining gain or loss under section 204(a). The express inclusion of the subdivision in the former case and its omission in the latter persuasively suggests that Congress did not intent to include estates by the entirety under the phrase 'by bequest, devise, or inheritance.' If Congress did so intend, it is hard to understand why subdivision (e) of section 302 was not expressly adopted as were (c) and (f). Compare William B. Bend v. Jesse Hoyt, 13 Pet. 263, 272, 273.\n It is said that the decision of this court in Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758, requires a different conclusion. But that case does not decide that property held by tenants by the entirety is inherited by the survivor or passes from the dead to the living by right of succession. The decision rests alone upon the fact that Congress had provided in express words (section 202(c), Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777, 778) that the value of such property, to the extent designated in subdivision (c), should be included for the purpose of determining the value or the gross estate. And the tax was upheld not upon the theory that there was a 'transfer' of the property by the death of decedent, or a receipt of it by right of succession, but upon the ground that death had resulted in such an accession of rights in respect of the control of the property as to make appropriate the imposition of a tax upon that result. In other words, the death of the husband had the effect of freeing the estate \n\n[289 U.S. 109, 113]\n\u00a0\n from his equal right of participation in its possession, use and disposition, which, while he lived, stood in the way of the wife's exclusive enjoyment of those rights which ordinarily flow from ownership; and this expansion of her power of control, and consequent enlargement of its value, furnished a sufficient occasion for the imposition of an excise tax, which Congress might denominate a death tax, or a transfer tax, or anything else it saw fit, although in the absence of an expression of the legislative will, it properly could not thus be characterized. Tyler v. United States, supra, at pages 502, 503 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 356.\n If the legislation here under review results in imposing an unfair burden upon the taxpayer, the remedy is with Congress, and not with the courts. Unless there is a violation of the Constitution, Congress may select the subjects of taxation and tax them differently as it sees fit; and if it does so in plain words, as it has done here, the courts are not at liberty to modify the act by construction in order to avoid special hardship.

Shuman, all of San Fra cis co., Cal., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Paul D. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1921 all assets of Leighton & Co., Inc., of California, were sold and the proceeds distributed pro rata among stockholders, including petitioners. Nothing remained to satisfy outstanding corporate obligations.\n September, 1925, within the time permitted by statute, or written waivers, the Commissioner of Internal Reve- \n\n[289 U.S. 506, 507]\n\u00a0\n nue notified the corporation of tax deficiencies for 1918, 1919, and 1920; and no January 16, 1926, he assessed these against it. There was no contest. Efforts to enforce payment by distraint were unsuccessful. The present equity suit seeks to compel petitioners severally to account for corporate property in order that it may be applied toward payment of taxes due by the company. No assessment was made against any petitioner.\n The District Court ruled that the distributed assets constituted a trust fund and adjudged that each petitioner should account for the amount he received, with interest, from January 16, 1926. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment. 61 F.(2d) 530. The matter comes here by certiorari. \n289 \nU.S. 716\n, 53 S.Ct. 594, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Pertinent provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 55, 59, 61, are in the margin. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n Prior to the Revenue Act of 1926, the United States in an equity proceeding might recover from distributees \n\n[289 U.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n of corporate assets, without assessment against them, the value of what they received in order to discharge taxes assessed against the corporation. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 51 S.Ct. 608; United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489\n, 50 S.Ct. 367. And this right remained unless taken away by the specific words or clear intendment of the 1926 enactment. United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250, 261\n, 31 S.Ct. 155; United States v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. (C.C.A.) 249 F. 678, 681.\n Petitioners rely upon section 280 of that act, and maintain that, while the words of this standing alone would not suffice to destroy the right, nevertheless, when read in connection with sections 274(a) and 278, there is enough clearly \n\n[289 U.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n to show the purpose of Congress to require an assessment against them before suit for restitution. And, further, that the sole remedy available in the present circumstances is the one prescribed by section 280.\n The meaning of the statute is not free from uncertainty. The insistence presented in behalf of the petitioners is at least plausible, but this has been before the courts several times, and none has approved it. One the other hand, the right of the United States to proceed against transferees by suit since the act of 1926 has been definitely recognized. United States v. Updike (D.C.) 25 F.(2d) 746, affirmed (C.C.A.) 32 F.(2d) 1; Phillips v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d 177, affirmed \n283 \nU.S. 589, 593\n, 51 S.Ct. 608, 610 (Note); United States v. Greenfield Tap & Die Corp. (D.C.) 27 F.(2d) 933; United States v. Garfunkel (D.C.) 52 F.(2d) 727.\n Considering the established rule of strict construction, the views expressed in the cases cited, also the possible conflict with other statutory provisions pointed out in those opinions, we cannot accept petitioners' interpretation of the statute. The present suit was properly brought, we think, and the courts below reached the correct conclusion. There was no abuse of discretion in respect of interest.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Section 274(a): 'If in the case of any taxpayer, the commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail.

Walsh, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[289 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by petitioners against respondents in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin respondents from combining or conspiring to compel petitioners to employ, in their work of fabricating and erecting structural iron and steel, only members of a labor union, and to refrain from employing nonmembers; from conducting, inducing, or advising a boycott of petitioners; and from other enumerated acts. The bill invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, and also upon the ground that acts complained of unlawfully interfered with interstate commerce and constituted a violation of the federal anti-trust acts. The case was sent to a referee, who, after a hearing, made a report and decision sustaining the charge of boycotting, but holding that the interference occasioned thereby was local in character and did not constitute an interference with interstate commerce. The report and decision were confirmed by the District Court, and the bill dismissed as to certain of the respondents, and an injunction issued against others, the particulars of which, in the view we take of the case, it is not necessary to state.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court holding that the allegations of the bill were insufficient to establish jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, and that the case having failed on the federal question, the court was without power to consider the nonfederal question because it was asserted in an independent cause of action. While resting its decision upon these considerations, that court expressed the further view that the allegations of the bill in respect of the claim of federal jurisdiction under the anti- trust acts were probably so unsubstantial as to disclose, on the face \n\n[289 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n of the bill, a lack of federal jurisdiction. The District Court was directed to dismiss the bill without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction unless amendments could be made to correct the defect in respect of diversity of citizenship. 61 F.(2d) 115. This court granted certiorari limited to the question of federal jurisdiction other than questions relating to diversity of citizenship, \n287 \nU.S. 590\n, 53 S.Ct. 118, 77 L.Ed . --.\n The question of jurisdiction as thus limited is to be determined by the allegations of the bill, and not upon the facts as they may turn out, or by a decision of the merits. Mosher v. Phoenix, \n287 \nU.S. 29, 30\n, 53 S. Ct. 67, and cases cited. Whether an objection that a bill or a complaint fails to state a case under a federal statute raises a question of jurisdiction or of merits is to be determined by the application of a well settled rule. If the bill or the complaint sets forth a substantial claim, a case is presented within the federal jurisdiction, however the court, upon consideration, may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged to support the claim. But jurisdiction, as distinguished from merits, is wanting where the claim set forth in the pleading is plainly unsubstantial. The cases have stated the rule in a variety of ways, but all to that effect. See, for example, Mosher v. Phoenix, supra; Hull v. Burr, \n234 \nU.S. 712, 720\n, 34 S.Ct. 892; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Ann Arbor R. Co., \n178 \nU.S. 239, 244\n, 20 S.Ct. 867; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 U.S. 291\n, 305 et seq., 44 S.Ct. 96; South Covington Ry. Co. v.

And the federal question averred may be plainly unsubstantial either because obviously without merit, or 'because its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of con- \n\n[289 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n troversy.'

C.A.) 145 F. 449, 452, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 762.\n Passing, without inquiry, the first of these tests, a consideration of the decisions of this court rendered prior to the filing of the present bill demonstrates that the question is concluded by an application of the second test.\n The prayer for relief primarily is based upon the averments that petitioners are engaged in fabricating and erecting structural iron and steel; that they are, and have been for a long time, operating in such business on the open shop method in relation to their employment of labor; that they have large contracts for the construction of work in the city of New York; that respondents are organizations of labor and officers and agents thereof; that by means and in ways which are set forth respondents have conspired, and are attempting, to compel petitioners and others to employ, exclusively union labor in their building operations; that in pursuance of the conspiracy respondents have called out on strike petitioners' union employees, and conducted boycotts, and undertaken other injurious interferences particularly set forth in the bill. These allegations conclude with the statement: 'The sole purpose of the activities of the said defendants (respondents) is to compel a putting into effect the closed union shop in the industry of erecting structural iron and steel and inasmuch as this branch of the building industry is the only branch of the building industry where a person not a member of the labor union can secure employment if successful the entire building industry in the entire Metropolitan District will be closed union.'\n Following these allegations the bill contains averments to the effect that all the steel used by petitioners in the city of New York is transported from other states, being \n\n[289 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n either bought or fabricated by petitioners in other states and transported to New York to be erected by petitioners therein; that the purpose and intent of respondents is to prevent the use of said steel therein, and wherever erected by petitioners; that the effect of the success of respondents would be, among other things, to destroy the interstate traffic of petitioners in steel. All this, however, is no more than to say that respondents' interference with the erection of the steel in New York will have the effect of interfering with the bringing of the steel from other states. Accepting the allegations of the bill at their full value, it results that the sole aim of the conspiracy was to halt or suppress local building operations as a means of compelling the employment of union labor, not for the purpose of affecting the sale or transit of materials in interests commerce. Use of the materials was purely a local matter, and the suppression thereof the result of the pursuit of a purely local aim. Restraint of interstate commerce was not an object of the conspiracy. Prevention of the local use was in no sense a means adopted to effect such a restraint. It is this exclusively local aim, and not the fortuitous and incidental effect upon interstate commerce, which gives character to the conspiracy. Compare Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters' Assn, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 46\n, 47 S., 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791; Anderson v. Shipowners' Ass'n, \n272 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 364 S., 47 S.Ct. 125. If thereby the shipment of steel in interstate commerce was curtailed, that result was incidental, indirect, and remote, and, therefore, not within the anti- trust acts, as this court, prior to the filing of the present bill, had already held.

The controlling application of these cases to the present one is apparent from the review of them in the later case of the Industrial Ass'n v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 77\n, 78 S., 80-82, 45 S.Ct. 403, 408. \n\n[289 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n That case involved a combination on the part of building contractors and others to establish the 'open shop' plan of employing labor by requiring builders who desired materials of certain kinds to obtain permits from a builders' exchange, and by refusing such permits to those who did not support the plan. We held that any resulting interference with the free movement of materials from other states, due to the lack of demand therefor upon the part of builders who were excluded from purchasing such materials by reason of their refusal to support the plan, was incidental, indirect, and remote, and, therefore, not an unlawful interference with interstate commerce. After pointing out that the question was thus determined by applying the Coronado and United Leather Workers Cases, we said: 'The alleged conspiracy, and the acts here complained of, spent their intended and direct force upon a local situation-for building is as essentially local as mining, manufacturing or growing crops-and if, by a resulting diminution of the commercial demand, interstate trade was curtailed either generally or in specific instances that was a fortuitous consequence so remote and indirect as plainly to cause it to fall outside the reach of the Sherman Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note).'\n The pertinent facts of that case and those here alleged are substantially the same, and subject to the same rule. It follows that the federal district court was without jurisdiction because the federal question presented was plainly unsubstantial, since it had, prior to the filing of the bill, been foreclosed by the two previous decisions last named, and was no longer the subject of controversy.

The District Court, \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n of three judges, granted an interlocutory injunction and on final hearing dismissed the bill. 58 F.(2d) 256. The company appeals.\n The company, organized in 1909, supplies both gas and electric current. Its rates for the latter are not in controversy. The two departments, both with respect to investment and operation, are distinct, and have been separately treated for rate-making purposes for many years. From 1913, when natural gas in substantial quantities was first made available in Los Angeles, until 1927, the company distributed a mixture of natural and manufactured gas, and since 1927 straight natural gas has been distributed. The company's service extends over the greater part of Los Angeles and neighboring cities and unincorporated territory. It has over 2, 900 miles of mains and 385,000 meters. From 1917 the company's gas rates have been fixed by the California Railroad Commission. Rate orders were made in 1917, 1919, 1921, 1923, 1926, and 1928. During this period the company's business greatly increased. The rate base for its gas department, as fixed by the commission, grew from approximately $12,500,000 in 1916 to about $59,000,000 in 1929. The growth was financed by the sale of the company's bonds and preferred stock. These, according to the finding of the commission, had been marketed at a gradually lessening cost, so that, at the time of the hearing which resulted in the order under review, it was found that the 'annual cost of its bond and preferred stock money' was 6.17 per cent. Approximately 60 per cent. of the amounts thus realized is chargeable to the gas department. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n Under the commission's order of 1928, the gas rates were estimated to yield a return slightly in excess of 7.5 per cent. 32 C.R.C. 379, 386. Concluding that these rates actually yielded a much higher return, the commission reduced the rates by the order now under review. It was intended to effect a reduction of 9 per cent. in gross revenue. 35 C.R.C. pp. 463, 469. The reduction amounted to about $1,300,000 in gross revenue and about $1,080,000 in net revenue.\n\n 1. \nThe Commission's Valuations.-In determining the rate base, the commission made two sorts of valuations of the gas properties for the year 1930-one of $60,704,000 on the basis of 'historical cost,' and the other of $65,500,000 on the basis of 'fair value.' The commission estimated that the return to the company on the former basis would be 7.7 per cent. and, on the latter, 7 per cent. 35 C.R.C. p. 464.\n Historical Cost.-The finding as to historical cost had relation to the method previously adopted by the commission in the regulation of the company's rates. The original rate base was established by the commission in 1917 upon a valuation made by the commission's engineers as of October, 1915. 13 C.R.C. 724. In the later rate proceedings, including the one now under review, the \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n historical cost was built upon the value established in 1917 augmented by net additions and betterments as entered upon the company's books, but with land at current values. \n2\n Of the total amount fixed by the commission on the basis of historical cost, the sum of $1,862,103 was for materials and supplies, working capital, and estimated net additions and betterments for 1930, leaving $58,842,187 as the historical cost of the fixed property at the end of 1929. Aside from overheads, the estimates made by the company and by the commission of the historical cost of this property did not differ widely. \n3\n The main difference lay in the treatment of overheads in the book entries of additions and betterments from 1916 to 1929; the company contends that the amounts recorded in its books in respect to indirect construction costs were inadequate. The reference is to the amounts which should \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n be included for engineering and superintendence, legal expenses, injuries and damages, insurance, taxes, interest during construction, and contingencies. The general instructions of the commission as to classification of fixed capital accounts provided that such overheads should be assigned or apportioned to particular accounts, so that each item of property should bear its proper share, and a considerable range of discretion in making allocations rested with the company. 35 C.R.C. p. 451. The company had availed itself of this opportunity, and the average charge on the company's books for these costs from 1913 to 1929 was about 6 per cent. of the direct labor and material charges. The commission's engineers were of the opinion that 11.25 per cent. might reasonably have been charged to capital, and, on that basis, the total historical cost of fixed property would have been raised from $58,842,187 to $61,019,662. The company's engineers estimated that 14.48 per cent. should be allowed for these overheads, bringing that historical cost up to $63,413,246. The commission stated that its conclusions had been reached upon the assumption that the company's allocations in reporting additions and betterments were properly made, and that the effect of the long-continued practice of the company was that it had been allowed under the rate orders, in the form of operating expenses, the items which it now claims should have been added to capital. The commission thought that the company was not in a position to raise the question. The commission recognized an exception in the item of interest during construction which, when not charged to capital, had been charged to income accounts and did not go into operating expenses, and accordingly there was included in the commission's finding of historical cost an additional allowance, for that interest, of $155,000 which the commission deemed to be fair. 35 C.R.C. 451-453. \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n No deduction was made from the total historical cost for the investment in the generating plant and equipment which the commission found were being rendered unnecessary by the introduction of natural gas. In order to meet the rapidly increasing demand, the gas manufacturing plant had been greatly expanded, until in 1924 the company had a plant of $ 98,500,000 cubic feet daily capacity. The book value of this plant was approximately $10,000,000, and the amount included therefor in the company's estimate of historical cost was approximately $10,500,000. Since April, 1927, on account of the supply of natural gas, the company has not manufactured gas except on one occasion, on March 13, 1928, when, in anticipation of a shortage, a certain amount (569,000 cubic feet) was manufactured, which constituted but nine-tenths of 1 per cent. of the gas sent out on that day. The Commission found that the evidence convincingly established 'the existence of a natural gas supply adequate for years to come.' But, as the investnent in the manufacturing plant had been made prudently and in good faith, it was included by the commission in the estimate of the historical cost of the company's gas properties.\n In that estimate, as thus made, nothing was deducted for depreciation and nothing was added for going concern value.\n Fair value.-The company claimed before the commission a rate base of approximately $95,000,000 on the basis of reproduction cost new as of January 1, 1930, less accrued depreciation. 35 C.R.C. p. 456. On comparing the company's estimate as of that date with the estimate of the commission's engineer of reproduction cost new (of December 31, 1929), in each case without deduction for depreciation, it appears that the difference, exclusive of overheads and the items mentioned below, was only about \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n $3,000,000 in the valuation of the physical property. \n4\n In its estimate the company included overheads at 24.27 per cent., or a total of $14,990,278. On that basis, the value of the physical property was estimated by the company, without depreciation, at $76,754,919.5 This included $12,134,665 as the 'reproduction value of the standby manufacturing facilities,' above mentioned. The company's witness testified before the commission (in 1930) 6 that in his estimate of reproduction cost he had 'attempted to obtain prices that would be reasonably stable and might prevail over the next three years'; that the prices used were 'very close to the average of those which prevailed for a 3-year period prior to January 1, 1930'; and, while in his opinion there was 'a temporary slump in prices,' he did not think it probable that there would be 'any substantial change within the next two or three years.'\n The estimate of the commission's engineer for reproduction cost new of the same physical property including the gas manufacturing plant, as of December 31, 1929, without depreciation, taking unit prices of that day and overheads at 21.65 per cent., was $72,471,207. As of the same date, but using four-year average unit prices for the years 1926 to 1929, his estimate was $73,210,136, with overheads taken at 22,32 per cent. \n7\n His estimates on the \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n last-mentioned basis, but with overheads at 6 per cent. and 11.25 per cent. respectively, were $64,082,282 and $67,007,569.8 With unit prices as of June 15, 1930, his estimates for reproduction cost new as of that day, without depreciation, and with overheads at 6 per cent. 11.25 per cent., and 21.64 per cent., respectively, were $63,399,822, $66,291,307, and $72, 040,522.9\n In arriving at its total estimate of reproduction cost new, the company added to its valuation of its physical property the items of 'Cost of financing, $5,921,470,' 'Promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000,' and 'Going concern value, $9,228,667.' These items the commission did not allow. The items of 'cost of financing' and 'promoters' profits' were rejected as 'too hypothetical and far removed from actuality to properly find lodgment in a rate base.' The company's claim for 'going concern' value was based upon expert testimony which the commission regarded as involving unacceptable theories and assumptions. 35 C.R.C. pp. 459, 460.\n Depreciation.-The company estimated $3,470,326 for accrued depreciation. The commission found that this was too little, and that the accrued depreciation was not less than $7,650,000. The commission stated that this amount was reached after a careful and detailed study involving a physical inspection of the property and analysis of the company's records. Id. p. 461.\n Commission's Conclusion as to Fair Value.-The commission's final conclusion was as follows: 'Subject to deduction for accrued and realized depreciation in a sum of approximately $7,650,000, the fair value of the property \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n here involved as a going property with business attached, giving full effect to the current level of prices and allowing for any intangible elements of value not fully cared for in the usual and current operating expense allowances but excluding various built up claims of value incident to a reproduction of the property under an assumed reconstruction program as too uncertain and hypothetical to enter into a rate base figure did not for the year 1928, using round figures, exceed $65,500,000, and for the year 1929 $64,000,000, and for the year 1930 does not exceed $65,500,000, which figures, for the purposes hereof, are spoken of as rate base.' These amounts included the allowances (supra, p. 263) for additions and betterments (for 1930) and for working capital, materials and supplies. Id. pp. 461, 462.\n Although the accrued depreciation was thus treated by the commission as deductible, in order to arrive at fair value, the commission thought that operating results under the fair value theory could best be shown by using an undepreciated rate base. The result is that the commission allowed for the year 1930, as a basis for its calculation of return, a valuation of $65,500,000 without deduction for depreciation. Id. p. 462.\n\n 2. \nThe Commission's Estimate of Return.-Based upon assumed revenue and operating expenses, and with allowance for a depreciation annuity and taxes, the commission estimated that the company would earn a net return of 7 per cent. upon this undepreciated rate base. The commission stated that the year 1930 was 'in many respects an abnormal year,' that the temperatures had been higher than normal, and that the business depression had had an adverse effect upon the company's growth and revenue. Still it was found that the company's business was growing and that with growth there was a tendency for the rate of return to increase. The commission rested \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n its conclusions 'on the assumption that temperature conditions in the future will be normal and that business conditions will approximate those of the year 1930 and that the gross revenue of 1931 with normal temperatures will not be less than that of 1930.' The commission recognized that the revenue for 1930 might be less than that estimated, and, on the other hand, that the operating expenses for that year were not at a normal figure. It was thought that 'any diminution in revenue is offset by the amount by which operating expense is out of normal.' But the commission clearly perceived that 'the actual earning position of the company in the year 1931' might be 'either worse or better than it would be were these assumptions realized.' It was thought that the disturbing element of varying temperatures might be guarded against by the establishment of a temperature reserve. The commission pointed out that the depreciation reserve of the gas department, on December 31, 1929, was $ 9,350,689, which was 'substantially in excess of the amount of accrued depreciation.' The annual amounts which had been allowed for depreciation expense had proved to be larger than necessary, and it was suggested that a considerable part of the depreciation reserve might be transferred to a temperature reserve. While, for the present purpose, the commission assumed that the creation of such a reserve was a matter of company policy, its desirability was emphasized. The commission's order of November 24, 1930, establishing the rates here in question, provided for the acceptance at the company's option of an alternative plan. This gave, in lieu of the rates prescribed, a provisional schedule of rates to be charged in 1931, and until the further order of the commission, which was deemed to involve a reduction in revenue of approximately 7 per cent., instead of 9 per cent. as otherwise contemplated, the company to agree to establish \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 300]\n\u00a0\n a temperature reserve to which should be credited the amount by which the net earnings of its gas department for the year 1931 should be in excess of a stated sum. This plan was not accepted.\n\n 3. \nDecision of the District Court.-The company brought this suit in December, 1930, attacking the findings of the commission as to both rate base and return. The company alleged that the fair value of its gas properties exceeded $95,000,000; that its gross and net revenues were overestimated by the commission; that under the rates prescribed the company would have earned, for the twelve months ending October 31, 1930, but 4.25 per cent. upon the fair value which it claimed; and that the temporary optional rates, for which the commission's order provided, would also yield less than a fair return and were equally invalid. Upon the motion for interlocutory injunction, the entire record before the commission was received in evidence, together with additional affidavits, and upon the same evidence the parties submitted the cause for final determination.\n While the District Court did not make specific findings of values, revenue, expense, and rate of return, the court reviewed the findings of the commission and the evidence and held that the commission's valuations were reasonable and that the prescribed rates permitted a reasonable return. Two opinions were delivered, one for the majority of the court and a concurring opinion by the Circuit Judge, in which the contentions of the company were examined.\n Considering the growth and stable position of the company, the court pointed out that 'with a history of successful and profitable business, and no real competition to meet in its field of service, the hazard is small and the probabilities of continued demand assured. Electricity has not to any great extent supplanted gas as a fuel. All of the conditions noted, as affecting the business of the \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 301]\n\u00a0\n company, sustain the commission in its statement that the plaintiff's securities are capable of being marketed at moderate interest rates, and that it will continue to grow.' 58 F.(2d) 256, 259. The court found that the commission 'was very liberal in its treatment of certain items of property'; that 'since 1924' the company has served natural gas, 'which is plentiful in the numerous oil fields in Southern California'; that 'there is no evidence which destroys the commission's conclusion that the supply of natural gas will be abundant and constant'; that the commission had found in effect that 'at least two of the artificial gas manufacturing plants' were no longer needed and might well be retired; that nevertheless the commission had included them in its valuation 'as a live necessary part of the operative property'; and that, had these plants been eliminated, 'the fair value base would have been reduced by approximately $ 3,000,000.' Id.\n In the evidence produced on the application for interlocutory injunction was an affidavit of the commission's engineer who brought the valuation of the company's properties down to December 15, 1930, by applying the unit prices prevailing on that date. This witness Mr. Dufour, who had been employed from 1915 to 1921 by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and from that time had served with the California Commission, stated that 'he kept in close touch with the prevailing labor and material costs,' maintaining as part of the valuation division of the commission a cost bureau for that purpose; that 'the present (December, 1930) trend of material and labor cost is downward; due to the present acute unemployment situation the wages paid the class of labor required for this type of construction is now lower and due to the large number of applicants for employment from which capable men may be selected the efficiency of labor is higher, tending to materially decrease the labor costs'; \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 302]\n\u00a0\n that he estimated 'that the current price level cost of plaintiff's gas properties used and useful in the public service applying prices prevailing December 15, 1930, including land market value as of December 31, 1929, and excluding difficulty factor,10 is $60,009,099, undepreciated'; that this amount would represent the cost of the properties as they existed December 31, 1929, if the unit costs and prices prevailing on December 15, 1930, were used, applying overhead charges of six per cent.' The company's expert witness, in replying to this affidavit, gave his opinion that 'the variations in price levels during the year 1930 do not constitute a permanent change in price levels and prices will for a reasonable period in the future be on a higher level than existed on December 15, 1930, and will, on the average over the next few years, approximate the prices used by him in his estimate of labor cost new reflected in the value of $95,767,351 shown in the affidavit filed herein on December 23, 1930.'\n Summing up its conclusions as to the action of the commission, the court said: 'What the commission did then in reaching its base rate figure of fair value was to include all items of property used and useful in the operative plant of the plaintiff, and appraise the value thereof at current market prices. It included original organization costs and franchise values as well. It assumed a live active plant, and affirmed that the ultimate total included all costs of attaching business as the same had accrued and been accounted for. Its fair value figure, assuming the correct estimate and allocation of \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 303]\n\u00a0\n items hereinafter referred to, was one which essentially represented the investment cost, at the present time, of all the operative property and its connected incidentals.' (D.C.) 58 F.(2d) 256, 260. The court regarded the ruling of the commission in taking overheads in accordance with the company's accounting practice as reasonable. The court held that 'the large amounts claimed by the company for cost of financing, $5,921,470; promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000; cost of attaching business (going concern value) $9,228,667; added 'difficulty' costs, $580,195, ... were properly rejected as for their total amounts.' Id., p. 262.\n The court observed that the matter of accrued depreciation, which had not been deducted from the fair value base as used by the commission, was important as affecting the annuity allowance to be considered in arriving at prospective income. The amount allowed by the commission as depreciation annuity was $1,072,000, while the company claimed that it should be not less than $2,344,744. The court noted the inconsistency of this claim, when the company asserted that the total accrued depreciation affecting its property was only $3,470,326. The court concluded that the allowances for depreciation annuities which had been made prior to the rate hearing under review were excessive and were not controlling, that depreciation was a matter not capable of definite ascertainment, and that it had not been shown that the commission had not exercised a reasonable judgment. Id. p. 261.\n With respect to estimated income for the future, the court referred to the company's complaint that the two preceding years had been marked by unusually high temperatures and consequent diminished demand for gas, and that 'it was improper to assume average temperatures.' But the court, familiar with conditions in Los \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 304]\n\u00a0\n Angeles, thought that the practice adopted by the commission was fair, adding: 'We may note that the winter of 1931-32 in the city of Los Angeles, as it has thus far progressed at the end of January, has been one of the coldest in many years. And so, the rule of assumed average temperatures seems to be the only reasonable one to adopt. During unusually mild winters the utility service will earn less than was estimated to be allowed to it, and in colder winters will earn more.' Id., p. 262.\n The action of the commission was also approved with respect to the allowances for materials and supplies and for working capital.\n In the final decree the court set forth its finding 'that the values for plaintiff's property as fixed and determined by the defendant Railroad Commission are the reasonable values thereof; that the rates fixed are such as to render a reasonable return on such values and that said rates are therefore not confiscatory, and the court adopted, 'as representing its further findings,' the opinion filed by the two District Judges. The Circuit Judge concurred in the decree, referring to his concurring opinion for the findings of fact upon which his action was based.\n\n 4. \nWe approach the decision of the particular questions thus presented in the light of the general principles this court has frequently declared. We have emphasized the distinctive function of the court. We do not sit as a board of revision, but to enforce constitutional rights. San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S.Ct. 571. The legislative discretion implied in the rate-making power necessarily extends to the entire legislative process, embracing the method used in reaching the legislative determination as well as that determination itself. We are not concerned with either, so long as constitutional limitations are not transgressed. When the legislative method is disclosed, it may have a definite bearing upon the valid- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 305]\n\u00a0\n ity of the result reached, but the judicial function does not go beyond the decision of the constitutional question. That question is whether the rates as fixed are confiscatory. And upon that question the complainant has the burden of proof, and the court may not interfere with the exercise of the state's authority unless confiscation is clearly established.\n As the property remains in the ownership of the complainant, the question is whether the complainant has been deprived of a fair return for the service rendered to the public in the use of the property. This court has repeatedly held that the basis of calculation is the fair value of the property; that is, that what the complainant is entitled to demand, in order that it may have 'just compensation' is 'a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public.' \n11\n In determining that basis, the criteria at hand for ascertaining market value, or what is called exchange value, are not commonly available. The property is not ordinarily the subject of barter and sale and, when rates themselves are in dispute, earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision. The value of the property, or rate base, must be determined under these inescapable limitations. And mindful of its distinctive function in the enforcement of constitutional rights, the court has refused to be bound by any artificial rule or formula which changed conditions might upset. We have said \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 306]\n\u00a0\n that the judicial ascertainment of value for the purpose of deciding whether rates are confiscatory 'is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment, having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.' Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 754, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 630\n, 43 S.Ct. 680; Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 690\n, 43 S.Ct. 675\n\n\n The actual cost of the property-the investment the owners have made- is a relevant fact. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S.Ct. 418. But, while cost must be considered, the Court has held that it is not an exclusive or final test. The public have not underwritten the investment. The property, on any admissible standard of present value, may be worth more or less than it actually cost. The time and circumstances of the outlay, and the effect of altered conditions, demand consideration. Even when cost is revised so as to reflect what may be deemed to have been invested prudently and in good faith, the investment may embrace property no longer used and useful for the public. This is strikingly illustrated in the present case where the company has a large gas manufacturing plant which, in view of the supply of natural gas, has not been used for several years and is not likely to be used for many years to come, if at all. But no one would question that the reasonable cost of an efficient public utility system 'is good evidence of its value at the time of construction.' We have said that 'such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as there is no change in the level of applicable prices.' McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 411\n, 47 S.Ct. 144, 148. And, when such a change in the price level has occurred, actual experience in the construction and development of the property, especially experience in a recent period, may be an important check upon extravagant estimates. \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 307]\n\u00a0\n This court has further declared that, in order to determine present value, the cost of reproducing the property is a relevant fact which should have appropriate consideration. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 288 S., 43 S.Ct. 544, 546, 31 A.L.R. 807; Bluefield Water Works v. Public Service Commission, supra; Standard Oil Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 45 S. Ct. 465; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Company, supra, \n272 \nU.S. 410\n, 47 S.Ct. 144. In Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, this court said that 'it is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service, without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded, such a forecast becomes impossible.' See St. Louis & O'Fallon Railway Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461, 485\n, 49 S.Ct. 384. But, again, the court has not decided that the cost of reproduction furnishes an exclusive test. See Smyth v. Ames, supra; Minnesota Rate Cases, supra; Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra. We have emphasized the danger in resting conclusions upon estimates of a conjectural character. We said, in Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, \n230 \nU.S. 452\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 761, 48 L.R.A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18: 'The cost-of-reproduction method is of service in ascertaining the present value of the plant, when it is reasonably applied and when the cost of reproducing the property may be ascertained with a proper degree of certainty. But it does not justify the acceptance of results which depend upon mere conjecture. It is fundamental that the judicial power to declare legislative action invalid upon constitutional grounds is to be exercised only in clear cases. The constitutional invalidity must be manifest, and if it rests upon disputed questions of fact, the invalidating facts must be proved. And \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 308]\n\u00a0\n this is true of asserted value as of other facts.' The weight to be given to actual cost, to historical cost, and to cost of reproduction new, is to be determined in the light of the facts of the particular case. McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra.\n\n 5. \nIn determining the weight to be ascribed in the instant case to historical cost as shown by the evidence, the outstanding fact is that the development of the property had, for the most part, taken place in a recent period. We agree with the court below that no ground is shown for assailing the valuation placed upon the company's property by the commission in 1917, in its first decision (13 C.R.C. p. 724) and which appears to have been accepted by the company as a starting point in later rate investigations. See 16 C.R.C. p. 481 (1919); 20 C.R.C. p. 96 (1921). The rate base fixed in 1917 was approximately $13,000,000. From that time the cost of additions and betterments was under constant supervision and was established by the company's records under the accounting regulations of the commission. From 1917 to 1919 there was but little change; the company's estimate of capital and the rate base as fixed by the commission for 1919 being under $14,000,000. 16 C.R.C. pp. 481, 482. Thus the additions and betterments which brought the historical cost of the fixed property (with land at current values) up to $58,842,187, as found by the commission at the end of 1929, took place in the ten preceding years and approximately two-thirds of the latter amount appears to have been the cost of additions and betterments after January 1, 1922, as the rate base taken at that time was approximately $20,000,000. 20 C.R.C. pp. 97, 98. We have had occasion to take judicial notice of the high level of prices of labor and materials preyailing not only from 1917, as incident to the war, but also in 1922 and 1923, and that there was no 'substantial general de- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 309]\n\u00a0\n cline' in such prices from that time to 1926.12 See Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S.Ct. 454; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 402\n, 42 S.Ct. 351; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 412\n, 47 S.Ct. 144. During these years the historical cost of the company's fixed property increased by additions and betterments to over $52,000,000. 29 C.R.C. p. 181. There can be no question that the cost of additions and betterments from 1926-in the period just preceding the commission's order under review- was good evidence of their value at that time. And, so far as prices of labor and materials are concerned, we find no warrant for a conclusion that there had been any change in levels during the years that intervened from the first valuation in 1917 which made it unfair to the company, in fixing rates for the future, to take the historical cost as found by the commission as evidence of the value of the company's structural property at the time of the rate order. On the contrary, it clearly appears that, by reason of the downward trend, the prices for labor and materials, which were reflected in that historical cost were higher than those which obtained during the later period to which the prescribed rates apply.\n We noted at the outset that there is a difference between the parties with respect to the amount which should be taken as historical cost. The company contends that, in entering additions and betterments in its books it charged too little to capital account for overheads, and it directs attention to the opinion of the commission's engineers that 11.25 per cent. of direct labor and material items could reasonably have been charged to capital for indirect construction costs instead of 6 per cent., the amount actually charged. The difference is over $2,000,000. With an allowance of 11.25 per cent. for overheads, the commission's engineers estimated the historical cost of fixed \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 310]\n\u00a0\n property at $61,019,662 instead of $58,842,187, allowed by the commission. It is unnecessary to review the contentions upon this point, as, if the valuation were made at the higher figure, while it would exceed the $60, 704,000 found by the commission as historical cost, it would still be under the amount of $65,500,000 which the commission took, on the basis of fair value, as an undepreciated rate base.\n\n 6. \nComing to cost of reproduction, we agree with the court below that the items included in the company's estimate for 'cost of financing, $ 5,921,470,' and 'promoters' remuneration, $2,500,000,' were too conjectural to be allowed. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488, 500\n, 53 S.Ct. 234. Aside from these items, and that of going value to which we shall presently refer, the company's estimate of cost of reproduction new of the fixed property, without deduction for depreciation, was $77,586,700, which included $831,781 for organization and franchises, leaving for the physical property $76,754,919. While this estimate was described as of January 1, 1930, it was stated to be based, not on spot prices of that date, but upon prices which were 'close to the average' of the prevailing prices for the preceding three years; that is, the estimate rests on prices prevailing from 1927 to 1929, inclusive. In making this calculation, overheads were taken at 24.27 per cent. The estimate made by the commission's engineer of reproduction cost new, without depreciation, which most closely corresponds to the above estimate of the company, was $73,637,542, including $427,406 for organization and franchises, leaving $73,210,136 for the physical property. This estimate was of December 31, 1929, but was based on four-year average unit prices for the years 1926 to 1929, and overheads were figured at 22.32 per cent.\n In both of these estimates the gas manufacturing plant was included without any deduction for disuse. The sum \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 311]\n\u00a0\n of $12,134,665 was included in the company's estimate as the cost of reproducing this plant. Whatever may be said of the propriety of including this entire plant in a valuation based on historical cost, in the light of prudent investment, we perceive no reason for embracing unnecessary facilities in an estimate of cost of reproduction. In a new construction under present conditions it does not appear that such an extensive manufacturing plant would be established, and the finding of the District Court is amply sustained that, if the manufacturing facilities no longer needed had been eliminated, the fair value base would have been reduced by about $3,000,000. With that deduction, the estimate of the commission's engineer would be about $70,000,000, without allowance for depreciation.\n We find it unnecessary, however, to consider the details of these estimates, for there is a fundamental objection to their acceptance as a basis for a finding of confiscation. The determination of present value is not an end in itself. Its purpose is to afford ground for prediction as to the future. It is to make possible an 'intelligent forecast of probable future values' in order that the validity of rates for the future may be determined. 'Estimates for to-morrow,' the court has said, 'cannot ignore prices of today.' Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra; Bluefield Water Works v. Public Service Commission, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 691\n, 43 S.Ct. 675; St. Louis & O'Fallon Railway Co. v. United States, supra. But we know that the estimates of present value, taken as the cost of reproduction as of December 31, 1929, based upon average prices from 1926 or 1927 to 1929, furnished no dependable criterion of values in the succeeding years. The country was facing a most serious decline in prices. It was entering upon a period of such depression as to constitute 'a new experience to the present generation.' \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 312]\n\u00a0\n It was not the usual case of possible fluctuating conditions but of a changed economic level. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 262 S., 52 S.Ct. 146. That an important change was in progress was shown by the evidence submitted on the application for interlocutory injunction in January, 1931, to which we have already referred. The commission's witness then called attention to the downward trend of prices, estimating the cost of the property on the basis of prices prevailing December 15, 1930, and taking overhead at 6 per cent. at $60,009,099 as against $64,082,282 as of December 31, 1929, and $ 63,399,822 as of June 15, 1930. See supra, p. 6. The mistaken outlook of the company's expert witness is disclosed by his affidavit in reply, supporting his former estimate, that, in his opinion, prices for the immediate future, and 'for several years to come,' would be 'on the average higher than the present level and approximately at the 1929 level.' It is apparent that the estimates of cost of reproduction new of 1929, or of 1930, upon which the company relies, afforded no secure foundation for prediction of future values, and the rate base as fixed by the commission is not to be invalidated as involving confiscation by reason of these estimates which the course of events deprived of credit as trust-worthy prophecies.\n\n 7. \nNo ground appears for challenging the finding of the commission, made upon inspection and appraisal, that the accrued depreciation of the property amounted to $7,650,000. While not admitting the accuracy of the finding, the company does not undertake to contest it here, but takes the amount as the maximum which can be allowed upon the evidence. In determining present value, deduction must be made for accrued depreciation. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 29 S.Ct. 148; Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, \n230 \nU.S. 457, 458\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. But the commis- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 313]\n\u00a0\n sion made its calculation of the company's return, under the rates prescribed, upon the rate base it fixed, undepreciated.\n\n 8. \nAs an item additional to the estimates of value thus far considered, the company claims to be entitled to an allowance of $9,228, 667 for 'going value.' This court has declared it to be self-evident 'that there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced,' and that this element of value is 'a property right' which should be considered 'in determining the value of the property, upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return.' Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S.Ct. 811, 815; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 191\n, 192 S., 38 S.Ct. 278, 283; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 414\n, 47 S.Ct. 144. The going value thus recognized is not to be confused with good will, in the sense of that 'element of value which inheres in the fixed and favorable consideration of customers, arising from an established and well- known and well-conducted business,' which, as the court has repeatedly said, is not to be considered in determining whether rates fixed for public service corporations are confiscatory. Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, supra. See Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 52\n, 29 S. Ct. 192, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 669\n, 32 S.Ct. 389, 391; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 396\n, 42 S.Ct. 351. Nor does this recognition of going value countenance a mere attempt to recoup past losses. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 394, 395\n, 42 S.Ct. 351. Deficits in the past do not afford a legal basis for invalidating rates, otherwise compensatory, any more than past profits can be used to sustain confiscatory rates for the future. Board of Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 31\n, 32 S., 46 S.Ct. 363. The concept of going value is not to be used to escape the \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 314]\n\u00a0\n just exercise of the regulatory power in fixing rates, and, on the other hand, that authority is not entitled to treat a living organism as nothing more than bare bones.\n The principle as thus recognized and limited is obviously difficult of application. Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, supra. It does not give license to mere speculation; it calls for consideration of the history and circumstances of the particular enterprise, and attempts at precise definition have been avoided. It is necessary again, in this relation, to distinguish between the legislative and judicial functions. It is the appropriate task of the commission to determine the value of the property affected by the rates it fixes, as that of an integrated, operating enterprise, and it is the function of the court in deciding whether rates are confiscatory not to lay down a formula, much less to prescribe an arbitrary allowance, but to examine the result of the legislative action in order to determine whether its total effect is to deny to the owner of the property a fair return for its use.\n Thus, in Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, supra, this court noted that, in the decision under review, the fact 'that the plant was in successful operation' had expressly been taken into account and that a value had been fixed which 'considerably exceeded its cost,' and hence the court found no warrant for changing the result. In Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, supra, the court, dealing with the master's report and he exclusion of a special item for going value, observed that the master, 'applying the rule of the Cedar Rapids Case,' had 'already valued the property in the estimate of what he called its physical value, upon the basis of a plant in actual and successful operation.' As the master had included overheads at 15 per cent. in that valuation, in addition to organization expenses, the court was unable to hold that 'the element of going value' had not been given the consideration it deserved. In Denver v. Den- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 315]\n\u00a0\n ver Union Water Co., supra, the court, premising that 'each case must be controlled by its own circumstances,' pointed out that the master had 'expressly declared that his detailed valuation of the physical property and water rights included no increment because the property constituted an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money,' and that an examination of his elaborate report convinced the court that this was true. And in that case the court found that the return allowed by the ordinance in question was clearly confiscatory. In Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, supra, \n250 \nU.S. 267, 268\n, 39 S.Ct. 454, the court questioned the propriety of the master's treatment of going value, but, noting compensatory errors in favor of the complainant, could not conclude that the master was wrong in holding that the ordinance was not whown to be confiscatory. In Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, the court took occasion to say that the expressions in the Denver Case and in the Lincoln Case were not to be taken as modifying in any respect the rule declared in he Des Moines Case as to the exclusion of good will. In Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra, the finding below as to going value was not disturbed. In Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, while 10 per cent. had been added for going value, the total result was a valuation which could not be sustained. In McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., supra, where the rates were held to be confiscatory, the court found that the evidence was 'more than sufficient to sustain 9.5 per cent. for going value' and that the commission's engineer had made no appraisal of that element.\n In the light of these decisions, our inquiry must be, first, as to the actual scope and effect of the legislative determination in relation to the value of the property as that of an integrated and established enterprise; and, second, whether the evidence requires the conclusion that, \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 316]\n\u00a0\n by reason of the inadequacy of the valuation, the result is confiscation. As to the first question, it is urged that the commission declined to allow any amount for going value. It is true that the commission, refusing to admit the assumptions underlying the company's claim for the amount of $ 9,228,667 as going value, stated that it did allow 'for the so-called intangible going concern value by treating its cost as a current operating expense.' But we cannot fail to give effect to the fact that the commission, determining its rate base at $65,500,000 for 1930 on the basis of fair value, stated that (apart from deduction for accrued depreciation) this amount was 'the fair value of the property here involved as a going property with business attached, giving full effect to the current level of prices and allowing for any intangible elements of value not fully cared for in the usual and current operating expense.' And the District Court, in its majority opinion, concluded that 'this rate base figure of fair value' included 'original organization costs and franchise values as well,' and 'assumed a live active plant and affirmed that the ultimate total included all costs of attaching business as the same had accrued and been accounted for.' What the commission did was to take the historical cost of the plant, calculated on the same basis as to cost of additions and betterments as that used in the several previous rate proceedings, and this amount, together with the sums allowed for materials and supplies, and for working capital, with the additional allowance for interest, with the amount assigned to organization expenses and franchises, and with land at current values, made up a total 'historical cost' of $60,704,000. To that total, the commission added $4,796,000 in reaching its fair value figure, or rate base, of $65,500,000. Included in that rate base was approximately $10,500,000 as the cost of the gas manufacturing plant, or about $3,000,000 which, as the District Court found, represented facilities no longer \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 317]\n\u00a0\n needed. Eliminating the latter amount, the margin in the rate base, as taken at fair value, over historical cost, was about $7,796,000. If allowance be made for increased overheads, by taking them at 11.25 per vent. in figuring the cost of additions and betterments (instead of the 6 per cent. as allocated to capital by the company in its books), the allowance of which the company urges in the light of the testimony of the commission's engineers, and if the difference of $2,177,765 be deducted, there would still remain $5,618,235 in the rate base over the historical cost as thus revised. As the historical cost of the far greater part of the fixed property appears to have been taken at price levels which were higher than those which have obtained in the period to which the prescribed rates are applicable, and cannot fairly be said to underestimate the value of the plant as of that period, this excess amount of over $5,500,000 can appropriately be assigned to elements of value which may not have been fully covered. the record affords no adequate basis for criticising the allowance made by the commission for materials and supplies and working capital, and thus he entire excess may be regarded as applicable to whatever intangible value the property had as a going concern. The fact that this margin in the rate base was not described as going value is unimportant, if the rate base was in fact large enough to embrace that element.\n The remaining question, then, is whether the company has proved, with requisite persuasiveness, a greater amount for going value than that which may be treated as substantially allowed. An examination of the evidence offered by the company upon this subject shows it to be of a highly speculative and uncertain character. There were two witnesses, and the grounds of their estimates put their results in a strong light. The company's valuation expert, Mr. Luick, gave three methods which he had used as guides in the forming of his judgment as to going \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 318]\n\u00a0\n value. The first method was 'gross revenue,' which the witness used on the basis of his experience 'that a purchaser will ordinarily and reasonably pay for a property with established earnings, and on a stabilized operating basis approximately one year's gross revenue over and above the value of physical property.' This basis the witness said would indicate a going value of $15,801,208.21 'based on revenues for the year ended December 31, 1929.' His second method was to take a percentage of the physical property, the witness stating that in his opinion a purchaser 'would pay approximately 15 per cent. above the cost of reproduction because of the going value of a property so developed.' This percentage produced a total of $10,638,005. The third method he called the 'consumer method,' which was based on a cost of not less than $25 per meter and gave an aggregate of $8,886,700. The witness said that he had also given consideration to the fact that the company had 'an exceptionally good history of growth, an established business, with satisfactory record of earnings and excellent future prospects.' The witness alluded to the growth of Los Angeles and adjoining communities, and, considering all these factors, estimated the going value as of January 1, 1930, at $10,000, 000.\n The other witness, Mr. Miller, took Mr. Luick's construction program, in which the latter had figured the cost of reproduction, and had assumed that there would be turned over to the operating department 'one-twentieth of the service mains during each quarter of the second to sixth years inclusive.' Estimating year by year the cost of securing the business during the construction period, the witness took the difference between 8 per cent. interest on the property used and useful during the year and the net earnings estimated to have been received, and the total of these differences with interest, during the period assumed to be required, was taken to represent the cost of \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 319]\n\u00a0\n securing the present business of the company. This was thus calculated to amount, from the second through the seventh year inclusive, to $8,721,878. To this sum the witness added, as the estimated cost 'of organizing property and personnel,' $506,789, thus reaching the total of $9,228,667 which the company claims as going value. It is unnecessary to analyze the testimony of these witnesses, as it is obviously too conjectural to justify us in treating the failure to include their estimates as a sufficient basis for a finding of confiscation.\n Our conclusion is that the company has failed to sustain its attack upon the rate base of $65,500,000.\n\n 9. \nThe commission calculated that the company would have a return of 7 per cent. on this rate base. We said in Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 692, 693\n, 43 S.Ct. 675, 679, that a 'public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at he same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures.' We added that the return 'should be reasonably sufficient to assure competence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.' And we recognize that 'a rate of return may be reasonable at one time and become too high or too low by changes affecting opportunities for investment, the money market and business conditions generally.' See Smith b. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 160\n, 161 S., 51 S.Ct. 65. Applying these principles, and considering the financial history of \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 320]\n\u00a0\n the company,13 its relations and opportunities, and the general situation as to investments, we find it impossible to hold that a return of 7 per cent. is so low as to be confiscatory. Wabash Electric Co. v. Young, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 502\n, 53 S.Ct. 234.\n The question, then, is as to the estimates of revenue and expenses. The company complains that the commission's estimate of revenue was too high. The problem largely concerns temperatures, and it is plain that the commission was justified, in fixing rates which were to apply for a considerable period, in taking average temperatures. The District Court, with its special knowledge of local conditions, and speaking in April, 1932, held that the action of the commission was fair. The Circuit Judge supplemented this finding of the majority by his holding that there was 'nothing unreasonable in the estimate of returns by the commission so far as temperature is concerned' and that there was 'nothing to indicate that due consideration was not given to the possible effect of the depression upon the consumption of gas.' 58 F.(2d) 256, 262, 286.\n The controversy as to estimate of expenses turns on the sufficiency of the depreciation annuity allowed by the commission. The company claimed $ 2,344,000 (or $2,306,606) as against the commission's allowance of $1,072, 000. But it is not clearly shown that what the commission allowed will not be adequate protection for the purpose in view, and there is no basis for concluding that the commission's practice under which the company has accumulated a large depreciation reserve has resulted in injustice to the company. \n14\n The fact that the property represented by the company's depreciation reserve could not be used to support the imposition of a confiscatory rate did not make it necessary for the commission to make an annual allowance which in \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 321]\n\u00a0\n the light of experience would be excessive. Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., supra, \n282 \nU.S. 158\n, 51 S.Ct. 65. The commission was entitled to form its judgment, and the three judges in the court below were agreed in the view that the discretion of the commission in this regard had not been unreasonably exercised. We see no reason to disturb this conclusion.\n The few minor questions which remain do not require specific mention.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER did not hear the argument and took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n This is an important case. The amount at stake is great, and the principles involved are more important. The reduction made by the commission when prescribing what it found to be reasonable rates, October, 1928, is not definitely shown. But the amount by which the rate of return was reduced indicates a probable reduction by more than a million per year. The net reduction made in November, 1930, by the order under consideration is more than one million per year. That is enough to yield a return of 7 per cent. on over $14,000,000. There is also involved more than $2,500,000 now held by the company subject to claims of customers that it be refunded to them if the order shall be sustained.\n The commission, following theories that admittedly are contrary to our decisions in confiscation cases, refused to ascertain or to consider the value of the property. \n1\n It \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 322]\n\u00a0\n made the last reduction upon mere cost figures. Its 'fair value' figure is higher than its 'historical cost.' The \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 323]\n\u00a0\n commission based that increase on its finding that unit prices properly applicable to the prescribing of reasonable rates for the future are higher than were those actually paid throughout the years for the construction of the property. This increase amounted to $4,796,000, and it was found correct by the District Court and also in the concurring opinion below. But this court excludes it and holds to original cost. The amount involved in that item alone is more than enough to require reversal.\n The commission excluded from overhead expenditures actually made by the company the difference between 6 per cent. and 11.25 per cent. upon the ground that the company charged such difference to operating expenses and not to capital. It refused to give any consideration to the findings of its own engineer that in a proper estimate of the cost of reproduction as of the date of the inquiry such overheads would exceed 22 per cent. The company's estimate was about 24 per cent. Each of these rulings is directly contrary to our decisions. Board of Com'rs v. N.Y. Tel. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 31\n, 46 S.Ct. 363; Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 31 A.L.R. 807; Ohio Utilities Co. v. Commission, \n267 \nU.S. 359, 362\n, 45 S.Ct. 259; McCardle v. Indianapolis Co., \n272 U.S. 400\n, 408-410, 47 S.Ct. 144; St. L. & O'Fallon R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461, 484\n, 485 S., 49 S.Ct. 384. The District Court followed the commission. This court, in accordance with law settled by its own decisions, repudiates that method of treating overheads and adopts 11.25 per cent. It refuses, as did the commission and the lower court, to give any weight to admitted reproduction cost in respect of overhead expenditures.\n The valuation by the commission was based upon an inventory agreed to be correct by the plaintiff and commission. It included two standby plants to which the commission attributed $3,000,000. The District Court adopted that figure. It declared, 58 F.(2d) 256, 259, that \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 324]\n\u00a0\n the commission included these plants as a 'live necessary part of the operative property.' \n2\n But this court excludes the item. Three million so thrown out is sufficient to require reversal. It was for the commission to decide whether these plants are required properly to safeguard the public service. This court should hesitate long before holding they are not. Seven per cent. on $3,000,000 so eliminated is $210,000, about 58 cents on each of the 385,000 meters, a small charge to insure readiness to serve.\n The commission refused to consider or allow anything for going value. Plaintiff's gas properties adequately serve a great and, before the present depression, a rapidly growing demand. If permitted to charge reasonable rates, or those merely high enough to be non-confiscatory, plaintiff will continue to be able to earn an ample rate of return upon the value of the property. Its charges for gas are low in comparison with those generally collected for like service. The record shows that, having regard to the effective thermal units in the natural gas that plaintiff has been furnishing in recent years, its rates are less than one-half those formerly collected by it. And, in absence of contrary showing and finding, its charges must be deemed to have been considered just and reasonable by the regulatory authorities of the state and by the public. \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 325]\n\u00a0\n Unquestionably, and the opinion of this court so implies, millions should be added to the cost figures applicable to the physical items in order to find the value of plaintiff's property, the amount protected by the Constitution. The ground on which the commission excluded going value was that the cost of attaching the business was charged to operating expenses. The District Court followed the commission. That being contrary to law, this court repudiates the rulings of both and uses over $5,500,000 as going value. Its calculations to reach value produce a figure substantially the same as the commission's 'fair value' cost figure. But that was attained by the application of formula, a thing repeatedly condemned here. The Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 679, 690\n, 43 S.Ct. 675; McCardle v. Indianapolis Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 410\n, 47 S.Ct. 144.\n This court's conclusion-depending upon mere coincidences-that value is the same as the 'fair value' cost figures found by the commission is without support. The figure used to cover going value was arrived at upon considerations that have no relation to the amount that in any view reasonably may be assigned to that element. It comes about thus: Add $3, 000,000 (made available by excluding the standby plants found necessary by the commission and included by the District Court) to $4,796,000 (obtained by reversing the findings of commission and accepted by the lower court in respect of unit prices). A part of that total is used to neutralize the errors in law committed by the commission and the lower court in respect of overheads. Enough is taken to increase that item from 6 per cent. to 11. 25 per cent. And the calculated balance, $5,618,235, is assigned to going value. That figure certainly is not the result of an appraisal or valuation of plaintiff's going value. Neither the amount attributed to the standby plants eliminated by this court nor the \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 326]\n\u00a0\n commission's addition to original cost to get its 'fair value' figure has any relation to going value. When in confiscation cases any going value exists, the amount justly attributable thereto must be ascertained and included. See, e.g., National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City (C.C.A.) 62 F. 853, 865, 27 L.R.A. 827; City of Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 30 S.Ct. 615, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1084; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S.Ct. 811; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 192\n, 38 S.Ct. 278; Galveston Elec. Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 396\n, 42 S.Ct. 351; McCardle v. Indianapolis Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 414\n, 47 S.Ct. 144; People ex rel. Kings County L. Co. v. Willcox, 210 N.Y. 479, 486, 104 N.E. 911, 51 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1.\n The rates should be set aside because arrived at by arbitrary methods condemned by our decisions.\n The state, by the exertion of legislative power, established the rule that public utility rates, including those charged for gas, shall be just and reasonable. It is powerless to enforce, and therefore must be presumed to have intended that is commission should not attempt to prescribe, confiscatory rates. The commission's field of action is within reasonable limits above the point or line where confiscation would commence. Banton v. Belt Line Ry., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 45 S.Ct. 534. In ascertaining the return protected by the Constitution, the commission is required to take into account and make proper allowances for the actual original and the estimated present cost of the property, including overheads. It is bound to include a just and reasonable amount to cover going value. The amount omitted in respect of each of these items is large enough to invalidate rates based on the valuation. There is no warrant for inquiry by this court to ascertain whether under the evidence the valuation of the property might otherwise have been pared down to the figure used by the commission and adopted by the District Court. It is definitely settled by our decisions that, where public utility rates, prescribed by a state commission as reasonable, are \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 327]\n\u00a0\n attacked as confiscatory, the courts may inquire into the method by which the commission's conclusion was reached, and that, if such rates are based upon property valuation or other essential fact that was arbitrarily arrived at or that is without support in the evidence, such rates will be set aside. Northern Pacific v. Dept. Public Works of State of Washington, \n268 U.S. 39\n, 42-45, 45 S.Ct. 412; Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., \n274 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 47 S.Ct. 604; St. Louis & O'Fallon R. Co. v. United States, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 485\n, 49 S.Ct. 384. Cf. United States v. Abilene & So. Ry., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S.Ct. 317; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108.\n The lower court's decree and opinion taken together may not reasonably be construed to comply with Equity Rule 70 1\/2. In confiscation cases, with rule should be strictly enforced. The trial court should make a definite and complete statement of the facts on which it rests its judgment. Cf. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174. In a number of cases decided in recent years specially constituted District Courts failed to make definite findings or to give reasons upon which they grounded their decrees. This court repeatedly and emphatically reminded them of the proper practice and required that it be followed. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S.Ct. 222; Lawrence v. St. L.-S. F. Ry., \n274 \nU.S. 588, 596\n, 47 S. Ct. 720; Arkansas Comm. v. Chicago, etc., R.R., \n274 \nU.S. 597, 603\n, 47 S.Ct. 724; Hammond v.

Northern Indiana Co., \n289 \nU.S. 703\n, 53 S.Ct. 527, 77 L.Ed. --; Public Service Comm. v. Wisconsin Tel. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 67\n, 53 S.Ct. 514, 77 L.Ed . --. Finally, June 2, 1930, we promulgated the rule, \n281 U.S. 773\n: 'In deciding suits in equity, including those re- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 328]\n\u00a0\n quired to be heard before three judges, the court of first instance shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon; and its findings and conclusions shall be entered of record and, if an appeal is taken from the decree, shall be included by the clerk in the record which is certified to the appellate court under rules 75 and 76.'\n The command that the trial court 'shall find the facts specially' means at least that the statement shall be definite, concise, and complete as distinguished from discursive, argumentative, obscure, or fragmentary. State Board of Tax Commissioners of Indiana v. Jackson, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 533\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. The direction, 'and state separately its conclusions of law thereon,' shows that discussion of facts and law in the course of explanation, reasoning, or opinion to clarify or support the conclusion or judgment reached is not sufficient. The opinion filed in this case as a concurring one appears on its face to have been prepared for adoption by and as the opinion of the court. It was not accepted by either of the other judges; in any event, that opinion could not be considered a compliance with the rule. The rule was intended to make unnecessary analysis or extended examination for the ascertainment of the facts and propositions of law on which rest decrees of the courts of first instance. The opinion of the majority does not purport to 'find the facts specially' or to 'state separately its conclusions of law thereon.'\n The decree is not a compliance with the rule. 'The court now finds that the values for plaintiff's property as fixed and determined by the defendant Railroad Commission are the reasonable values thereof; that the rates fixed are such as to render a reasonable return on such values and that said rates are therefore not confiscatory. And the court adopts, as representing its further findings, the opinion filed herein on April 8, 1932, as concurred in by the two district judges who participated in the hearing \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 329]\n\u00a0\n and decision hereof.' This is within the condemnation of our decisions. Railroad Commission v. Maxcy, supra; State Board of Tax Commissioners of Indiana v. Jackson, supra; Public Service Comm. v. Northern Indiana Co., supra.\n Public Service Comm. v. Wisconsin Tel. Co., supra, decided after the argument of this case, is of special interest. The commission appealed from an interlocutory decree declaring that enforcement of telephone rates prescribed by the commission would result in confiscation of the company's property. The District Court filed no opinion and made no special findings of fact. The company moved to affirm. The commission's contention was that the decree should be reversed for lack of specification of the facts on which it rested. The company maintained that the decree was abundantly sustained by the facts shown in the record. We held that Rule 70 1\/2 does not apply to decisions on applications for temporary injunctions, and made it clear that the duty of the court in passing on such applications was not altered by the adoption of the rule. We said (page 515 of 53 S.Ct.): 'While an application for an interlocutory injunction does not involve a final determination of the merits, it does involve the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. That discretion can be exercised only upon a determination, in the light of the issues and of the facts presented, whether the complainant has made, or has failed to make, such a showing of the gravity of his complaint as to warrant interlocutory relief. Thus, if the issue is confiscation, the complainant must make a factual showing of the probable confiscatory effect of the statute or order with such clarity and persuasiveness as to demonstrate the propriety in the interest of justice, and in order to prevent irreparable injury, of restraining the state's action until hearing upon the merits can be had. ... The court should make the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are appropriate to the interlocutory proceeding.' And we refused, even when \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 330]\n\u00a0\n aided by adequate brief and argument of counsel, to consider whether the temporary injunction was warranted by the facts shown in the record. We vacated the decree with costs against the utility and remanded the case for findings and conclusions appropriate to a decision upon the application for an interlocutory injunction. And it is the purpose of this court to promulgate a rule definitely requiring District Courts to make special findings of fact in such cases.\n The reasons for the enforcement of such a rule are stronger where final judgment is entered. The work done for the court by the writer of the opinion should not be undertaken here. Our rules do not permit adequate opportunity for presentation of such cases as upon trial de novo. Nor is the time that the Justices can give to preparation for and in our conferences sufficient to enable them to reach reasoned conclusions in respect of the bases or details of calculations, revisions, and determinations reflected by the elaborate opinion in this case.\n We should follow Public Service Comm. v. Wisconsin Tel. Co., vacate the decree, and remand the case for special findings. The District Court should appoint a special master to hear the parties, make specific findings of fact, and state separately his conclusions of law and recommendation for a decree.\n The District Court should have referred the case to a special master for such a report. Experience has made it plain that rate confiscation cases are intricate in respect of facts and involve complicated, grave, and difficult questions that are impossible of adequate examination by a court without the assistance of a master. Dubourg de St. Colombe's Heirs v. United States, 7 Pet. 625. The report of the commission in this case occupies 54 pages of the record, and the opinions of the participating judges extend through more than 71 pages. That the burden of mere analysis, comparison, or concordance is very great \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 331]\n\u00a0\n can be gathered from the opinion of this court. The lack of definite findings in respect of essential facts is obvious, and it is likely that, if the District Court had undertaken separately to state its conclusions of law, it would not have fallen into the errors sought to be corrected by the opinion here. Its decision was not announced until more than nine months after final submission of the case. This statement implies no adverse criticism, for it is often difficult for the judges, consistently with performance of their other duties, to give the time required for travel, full hearings, adequate conferences in advance of decision, and for preparation of draft opinions. The requirement that three judges shall participate undoubtedly increases the need for a special master.\n Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., Ry. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167\n, 20 S.Ct. 336, was a confiscation case involving the validity of state-made railroad rates. The trial judge, without the aid of a master, examined the pleadings and proof, made findings of fact, stated his conclusions of law, delivered an opinion, and rendered a decree dismissing the bill. But he failed to find an essential fact, the cost of doing local business. This court remanded the case with instructions to refer it to a competent master. Speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer, it said (page 179 of 176 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 336, 340): 'The question then arises, What disposition of the case shall this court make? Ought we to examine the testimony, find the facts, and from those facts, deduce the proper conclusion? It would doubtless be within the competency of this court on an appeal in equity to do this, but we are constrained to think that it would not (particularly in a case like the present) be the proper course to pursue. This is an appellate court, and parties have a right to a determination of the facts in the first instance by the trial court. Doubtless if such determination is challenged on appeal it becomes our duty to examine the testimony and see if it sustains the findings, but if the facts found are not challenged by either party \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 332]\n\u00a0\n then this court need not go beyond its ordinary appellate duty of considering whether such facts justified the decree. We think this is one of those cases in which it is especially important that there should be a full and clear finding of the facts by the trial court. The questions are difficult, the interests are vast, and therefore the aid of the trial court should be had. The writer of this opinion appreciates the difficulties which attend a trial court in a case like this. In Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, a similar case, he, as circuit justice presiding in the circuit court of Nebraska, undertook the work of examining the testimony, making computations, and finding the facts. It was very laborious, and took several weeks. It was a work which really ought to have been done by a master. ... We are all of opinion that a better practice is to refer the testimony to some competent master, to make all needed computations, and find fully the facts. It is hardly necessary to observe that in view of the difficulties and importance of such a case it is imperative that the most competent and reliable master, general or special, should be selected, for it is not a light matter to interfere with the legislation of a state in respect to the prescribing of rates, nor a light matter to permit such legislation to wreck large property interests.'\n Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n223 \nU.S. 349\n, 32 S.Ct. 271, involved the validity of a city ordinance regulating charges for gas. The court below failed to make findings of fact in respect of the sums annually required for depreciation and replacements. This court, speaking through Mr. Justice Lurton, said (page 361 of 223 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 271, 273): 'The cause should have gone at the beginning to a skilled master, upon whose report specific errors could have been assigned and a ruling from the court obtained.' The case was remanded to the District Court with instructions to refer it to a competent master with directions to report fully his findings upon all questions raised by either party, and with leave to both parties to take additional evidence. \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 333]\n\u00a0\n While the practice since Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., Ry. v. Tompkins has not been uniform, special masters have been appointed quite generally. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n To summarize:\n\n 1. \nThere is no warrant for reversal here of the commission and District Court in respect of unit prices upon which they built up their 'fair value' figure. If business conditions since the commission made its order are deemed to affect that figure, we should remand with directions to the District Court to find the facts. Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 262 S., 52 S.Ct. 146.\n\n 2. \nThis court should not undertake to ascertain the amount of overheads properly to be included. But, if that matter is to be considered here, the 22 per cent. included in the commission's reproduction estimate and the company's 24 per cent. should not be ignored, but should be considered in connection with the 11.25 per cent. in- \n\n[289 U.S. 287, 334]\n\u00a0\n cluded in the original or historical cost figures. An appraisal of the item should be made on the basis of all the relevant facts.\n\n 3. \nThere is no warrant for this court's elimination from the agreed inventory of standby plants which were included by the commission and District Court.\n\n 4. \nThere has been no appraisal of going value. That element was arbitrarily excluded below. There is no rational foundation for the amount attributed to it here.\n\n 5. \nAs the commission's refusal to apply principles of valuation established by our decisions resulted in arbitrary undervaluations, the prescribed rates should on that ground be set aside.\n\n 6. \nThe decree appealed from should be vacated, and the case remanded for compliance with Rule 70 1\/2.\n\n 7. \nThe District Court should refer the case to a special master to report in accordance with the practice followed in cases such as this.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reviewing the financial history of the Company, the commission found: 'On December 31, 1929, the Company had outstanding in the hands of the public $47,070,000 par value of bonds, $19,469,995 par value preferred stock, and $20,000,000 par value of common stock. Its depreciation reserve on that date was reported at $16,804,105,15. All of its common stock is owned by Pacific Lighting Corporation. Since 1916 but $4,500,000 of this stock has been purchased for cash, $5,500,000, however, having been distributed to Pacific Lighting Corporation in the form of stock dividends, representing earnings left in the property. Dividends have been paid on its common stock of 7.20 per cent per share ($100 par value) in 1916, 1917 and 1918; 7.4 per cent in 1919; 8.4 per cent in 1920, 1921 and 1922; 8.7 per cent in 1923; 33.75 per cent in 1924, included in which is 25 per cent as a stock dividend of $2,500,000; 9 per cent in 1925; 9.815 per cent in 1926; 35.17 per cent in 1927, which includes a stock dividend of 21.42 per cent, or $3,000,000; 15 per cent in 1928, and 17 per cent in 1929. The Company's surplus has grown from $381,212.97 in 1916 to $4,176.663.09 in 1929, while its depreciation reserve increased from $3,804,383.36 to, as said above, $16,804,105.15.' 35 C.R.C. pp. 447, 448. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 16 C.R.C. 478, 482; 20 C.R.C. 93, 96; 29 C.R.C. 164, 181; 32 C. R.C. 379, 381. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Commission found: 'Estimates of the historical cost of the structural property were made in this proceeding, both by the Company and by the Commission's Valuation Department. Excluding overheads, the Company reached a figure approximately $300,000 higher than the one obtained by taking the 1917 rate base as fixed by the Commission in its first decision and building up on that, while the Valuation Department of the Commission reached a figure approximately $300,000 lower than the one thus obtained. The fact that each of these estimates, independently reached by employing somewhat different methods and procedure, corresponded so closely to the historical cost figure as used and accepted by the Commission and by the Company as correct in the series of rate determinations running from 1917 to 1928, confirms its substantial accuracy. The figure used conforms to the accounting practice of the Company as to the bulk of its investment, which has increased from approximately $13,000,000 in 1917 to over $58,000, 000 in 1929, the difference representing net additions and betterments during this period as inscribed in the Company's books and records. Mr. McAuliffe (the commission's appraiser) and the Company's land appraiser were surprisingly close in their results.

And Commissioner Decoto said (page 474): 'For thirty-two years the Supreme Court of the United States has consistently adhered to the controlling principles of valuation laid down by it. In spite of the fact that the pathway is now made reasonably clear by the decisions of the courts, some state commissions seem to be inclined to be a law unto themselves and persist in ignoring the law as laid down by the courts. The California Commission has to all outward appearance been one of these. It has clung ostensibly and theoretically to the historical rate base. In reality it has given effect to the different elements mentioned by the federal courts including fair value including going value by allowing a rate return between 8 per cent and 8 1\/2 per cent on historical cost if there be added to the historical rate base an amount between 10 per cent and 12 1\/2 per cent, the rate base so obtained will approximate fair value including going value. \n So, also if there is deducted from 10 per cent to 12 1\/2 per cent from a rate of return of 8 per cent or 8 1\/2 per cent on an historical cost rate base, it is readily seen that there is an actual return varying from 7 per cent to 7.75 per cent upon fair value including therein a reasonable amount for going value. With this arrangement our public utilities have been content. During the last two years this commission has shown a tendency to cut the rate return upon an historical rate base from between 8 per cent and 8 1\/2 per cent to 7 per cent, which reduced the rate of return upon a fair value base to 6.12 1\/2 per cent and 6.3 per cent. This is confiscation and not regulation.'\n The president of the commission, October 21, 1931, in an address before the National Association of Railroad and Public Utilities Commissioners apparently in opposition to constitutional law as established by numerous decisions here, said: 'It is safe to say that in practically none, if any of the cases in which there have been permanent injunctive orders issued by the federal courts, would actual confiscation have followed the Commission findings. This is stated not only from general knowledge of the facts but from specific knowledge of the experience in California. A study of the court opinions indicates beyond reasonable doubt that in practically every major rate case in the last seventeen years in that state the findings of the commission could not have withstood the test imposed by the federal tribunals.' Report Forty- Third Annual Convention 1931, pp. 180, 190. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The court's statement follows: 'The commission was very liberal in its treatment of certain items of property. The company in its early operations furnished artificial gas. Since 1924 it has served natural gas, which is plentiful in the numerous oil fields in Southern California. There is no evidence which discredits the commission's conclusion that the supply of natural gas will be abundant and constant. The commission found in effect that at least two of the artificial gas manufacturing plants of plaintiff were no longer needed and might well be retired. Nevertheless, it included them in its valuation as a live necessary part of the operative property. It appears that, had these plants been eliminated, the fair vlue base would have been reduced by approximately $3,000,000.' 58 F.( 2d) 256, 259. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Knoxville v.

Carter, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 15624 of the Laws of Florida, 1931 (Ex. Sess.), declares it unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, association, or copartnership, foreign or domestic, to operate any store within the state without first having obtained a license, designates the officer to whom application shall be made, regulates the procedure for issurance of licenses, and provides for annual renewal. The act requires the payment of a filing fee, and by section 5, which is copied in the margin,*\n * 'Section 5. Every person, firm, corporation, association or co- partnership opening, establishing, operating or maintaining one or more stores or mercantile establishments within this State, under the same general management, supervision or ownership, shall pay the license fee hereinafter prescribed for the privilege of opening, establishing, operating or maintaining such stores or mercantile establishments. The license fee herein prescribed shall be paid annually, and shall be in addition to the filing fee prescribed in Sections 2 and 4 of this Act.\n\"The license fees herein prescribed shall be as follows:\n\n\"(1) Upon one store, the annual license fee shall be Five Dollars for each such store.\n\n\"(2) Upon two stores or more, but not exceeding fifteen stores, where the same are located in any one county, the annual license fee shall be Ten Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(3) Upon two stores or more, but not to exceed fifteen stores, where the same are located in different counties, the annual license fee shall be Fifteen Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(4) Upon each store in excess of fifteen, but not to exceed thirty, when all are located in any one county, the annual license fee shall be Fifteen Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(5) Upon each store in excess of fifteen, but not to exceed thirty, where the same are located in different counties, the annual license fee shall be Twenty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(6) Upon each store in excess of thirty, but not to exceed fifty, where all are located in any one county, the anual license fee shall be Twenty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(7) Upon each store in excess of thirty, but not to exceed fifty, where the same are located in different counties, the annual license fee shall be Thirty Dollars for each such additional store. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 529]\n\u00a0\n fixes the amount of the license fee. A tax greater than that exacted for a single store is fixed for each store in excess of one, but not exceeding fifteen, owned or operated by the same person or corporation. The fee for each store is stepped up in amount as the number constituting the chain reaches certain specified limits. This graduated scale applies to stores all of which are within a single county; but, if the same number of stores is located in more than one county, the license fee for each is materially increased.)\n\n The act imposes the tax only on retail stores and excludes from the definition of a store filling stations engaged exclusively in the sale of gasoline and other petroleum products. It provides for a separate county license tax equal to 25 per cent. of the state license fee, and authorizes a municipal tax of the same amount, measuring the graduated tax in the case of counties and municipalities by the number of stores situate \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 530]\n\u00a0\n in the county or municipality, notwithstanding the applicant may own other stores beyond the limits of the governmental subdivision.\n In addition to the described license taxes the act imposes a levy of $ 3 for each $1,000 of value of stock carried in each store, or for sale in such store, and this is defined to include merchandise owned by the taxpayer and held in storage to be sold in or through such store.\n Three chain store owners filed in the circuit court of Leon county, Fla., a class bill, in which twelve others intervened and became coplaintiffs, praying that the tax officials be enjoined from enforcing the act. The complainants are corporations of Florida and other states. They challenge the statute as violative of various provisions of the Constitution of Florida, of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 531]\n\u00a0\n The bill sets forth in great detail facts claimed to assimilate the operation of chain stores to that of stores individually owned and operated in the state of Florida. So-called voluntary chains of retail stores are described at length and their methods of operation compared with those of chain stores; the purpose being to demonstrate that there is no essential difference between the two methods of conducting business. On the basis of the facts recited, the bill charges that to tax a store operated in the one manner and exempt an establishment conducted in the other is arbitrary and unreasonable. The difference in the amount of tax laid upon the operator of a given number of stores in a single county and another conducting the same number in two or more counties is challenged as an unconstitutional discrimination. The imposition of a tax of $3 per $ 1,000 on retail merchants, not only as respects the stock actually contained in their stores, but also on goods in warehouse intended for sale in such stores, is attacked as discriminatory, for the reason that under another statute wholesale merchants are taxed only $1.50 per $1,000 of merchandise carried in their stores or warehouses. The exemption of filling stations is alleged to discriminate against the appellants in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The bill further avers that certain of the plaintiffs receive their goods from warehouses maintained outside the state of Florida, or order shipments to their stores from wholesale houses situate without the state, whereas many operators of single stores who are members of voluntary chains obtain their supplies from wholesalers in Florida, or from a warehouse in the state conducted by a voluntary chain corporation. The unequal effect of the act on these transactions is charged to be an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce.\n The defendants moved to dismiss. The cause was heard upon this motion and a decree entered dismissing the bill at complainants' costs. The Supreme Court of \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 532]\n\u00a0\n Florida affirmed the decree. The present appeal presents only the questions arising under the Federal Constitution.\n\n 1. \nIn support of the allegation of arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination, the bill recites facts from which appellants claim the conclusion is inevitable that there is no difference between the method of conducting chain stores and those employed in department stores, so-called voluntary chains, and singly operated units. This is but a reiteration of the contention made and overruled in State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. It was there held that, whatever may be said of individual similarities and differences between chain store operation and the conduct of a single shop or a department store, the former employ distinguishable methods of conducting business, and the Legislature may make the difference in method and character of the business the basis of classification for taxation. In their bill the complainants aver that the fact situation in Florida at the date of suit differed materially from that set forth in the Jackson Case. Each of the features of chain store operation enumerated in this court's opinion is singled out, and as respects each the averment is that as to some chain store operators, or some operators of individual stores, the present case differs from the Jackson Case.\n In their endeavor thus to distinguish the earlier case, the appellants stress mere details, but ignore the underlying reason for sustaining the classification there attacked. The decision in the Jackson Case was based, not upon any single feature of chain store management, but upon the ultimate fact of common knowledge, illustrated and emphasized by the evidence, that the conduct of a chain of stores constitutes a form and method of merchandising quite apart from that adapted to the practice of the ordinary individually operated small store or department store; and that the difference between an integrated and a voluntary chain is fundamental. While \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 533]\n\u00a0\n incidents of the operation of the one may be quite similar to those found in the other, there is a clear distinction between one owner operating many stores and many owners each operating his own store with a greater or less measure of co-operation voluntarily undertaken. The Legislature may make the distinction the occasion of classification for purposes of taxation. Neither similarity of opportunities and advantages in some aspects, nor the fact that the one kind of store competes with the other, is enough to condemn the discrimination in the taxes imposed. It is needless to repeat what was said in the Jackson Case to the effect that the difference between the subjects taxed need not be great, and that, if any reasonable distinction can be found, the duty of the court is to sustain the classification embodied in the law.\n\n 2. \nThe statute lays a tax of a stated sum per store on any given number of stores in the same ownership located within the same county; but, if one happens to be in a county other than that in which the remainder are situate, imposes an increased tax, not only on the single one lying in the second county, but on all. Thus, if an owner has fourteen stores, he may add a fifteenth in the same county, and the only additional tax will be in the amount of $10 attributable to the privilege of conducting the new store. But, if the new store happens to be in another county, the license fee for it will be increased to $15, and that for each of the other fourteen, which have long since been opened and operated in the original county, will be increased from $10 to $15.\n We are unable to discover any reasonable basis for this classification. As we have held, gradation of the tax according to the number of units operated cannot be said to be so unreasonable as to transcend the constitutional powers of the Legislature. The addition of a store to an existing chain is a privilege, and an increase of the tax on all the stores for the privilege of expanding the chain can- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 534]\n\u00a0\n not be condemned as arbitrary; but an increase in the levy, not only on a new store, but on all the old stores, consequent upon the mere physical fact that the new one lies a few feet over a county line, finds no foundation in reason or in any fact of business experience. There is no more reason for adopting the county line as the measure of the tax than there would be for taking ward lines in cities, or arbitrary lines drawn through the state regardless of county boundaries. It is suggested that the license fee for extending operations into a great and populous city, or for doing business upon crowded business streets, should be greater than for the same privilege in a village or a sparsely settled suburb. But the adoption of a county line can have no reference either to density of population, congregation of the buying public, or any other factor bearing upon the choice of a business site.\n The appellees suggest that an owner reaps greater advantage by the establishment of a new store in a county not previously occupied. This may be conceded. It is evident, however, that the mere spatial relation between the store and a county line cannot, in and of itself, affect the value of the privilege enjoyed. The appellees fail to show how the fact that the new place of business lies in another county increases the advantage over that to accrue from a location within the same county. The classification is solely of different chains, and the difference between them consists neither in number, size, surrounding population, nor in any factor having a conceivable relation to the privilege enjoyed.\n It cannot justifiably be said that the section draws a distinction between national and local chains. The operation of the statute forbids any such assumption; for, if a national chain keeps multiple units within a single county, the tax on each is at the lower rate, while, if a so- called local chain has one store in a given county and another just over the county line, both places of business \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 535]\n\u00a0\n take the higher rate. This difference in treatment has no discernible relation to the sort of chain which establishes a store across a county line. The act is not a rough and ready but honest effort to differentiate what the Federal Census Bureau for its purposes denominates local chains on the one hand and what the Bureau terms sectional or national chains on the other. Neither the phraseology nor the method of operation of the act is consistent with an attempt at any such classification.\n The suggestion is made that the statute is in reality aimed solely at large corporate chains; and that, as none other are parties to this suit, we may ignore any discriminatory features as respects individual owners of multiple units. But this is to construe the act by pure speculation and not by what it says, nor by any declared purpose, nor by anything contained in the record. Conceding for the purpose of the argument that in levying the tax the Legislature might have drawn a distinction between corporate owners and individuals, and again between small owners, whether corporate or individual, and large owners, we are not permitted to guess at any such undisclosed purpose in the minds of those who adopted the statute. Assuming power to suppress by taxation a form of organization deemed inimical to the public interest, we can attribute no such motive to the present statute in the absence of legislative declaration or record proof. The act taxes ownership and operation of stores, not corporate nor large corporate operation. The exaction is based on the doing of a business, not on the personality of the merchant.\n The title declares it 'An Act Requiring Licenses for the Operation, Maintenance, Opening or Establishment of Stores in this State. ...' Section 1 enacts 'That from and after the first day of October A.D. 1931, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, association or co- partnership, whether foreign or domestic, to operate, \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 536]\n\u00a0\n maintain, open or establish any store in this State without first having obtained a license. ...'\n It would violate every principle of statutory construction to hold that this plain language really means that individuals and small local corporations are not within the intendment of the act, but that it in fact applies only to so-called giant corporations. To attribute such a covert, hidden, and indirect purpose to those who passed the statute is, in effect, to charge the lawmakers with saying one thing and meaning another. Nothing said in O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, or any other decision of this court, justifies such a pronouncement. The Legislature of Florida has declared the purpose and object of the statute to be to tax every store owner and operator, and we should not go behind that declaration and attribute to the lawmakers some other ulterior design. Corporations are as much entitled to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment as are natural persons. Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, 30 S.Ct. 287, 17 Ann.Cas. 1247; Kentucky Finance Corp. v. Paramount Auto Exchange, \n262 \nU.S. 544\n, 43 S.Ct. 636; Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490\n, 47 S.Ct. 678; Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, \n278 \nU.S. 105\n, 49 S.Ct. 57; Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239\n, 52 S.Ct. 133. Unequal treatment and arbitrary discrimination as between corporations and natural persons, or between different corporations, inconsistent with the declared object of the legislation, cannot be justified by the assumption, that a different classification for a wholly different purpose might be valid.\n Those provisions of section 5 which increase the tax if the owner's stores are located in more than one county are unreasonable and arbitrary, and violate the guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 3. \nSection 11 of the act provides:\n'A County license tax of twenty-five per cent of the State license tax shall be levied and imposed upon each \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 537]\n\u00a0\n store as herein defined and each incorporated municipality of the State of Florida is authorized to levy a municipal license tax of twenty-five per cent of the State tax imposed by this Act, provided that the tax levied by or for the several counties and municipalities shall be graduated only on the number of stores situate in such county or municipality, respectively, notwithstanding the applicant may own other stores beyond the limits of such county or municipality, as the case may be. ...'\n\n The attack upon this section is the same as that leveled against section 5, which ordains the license tax for state purposes. If, as we have held, it is permissible for the state for its own purposes to impose a tax on a graduated scale depending upon the number of units operated by the chain, it is equally so for a municipality to grade its taxation by the same method, when duly authorized by state authority.\n\n 4. \nSection 5, in addition to the graduated license fee, lays a tax of $ 3 on each $1,000 vlaue of stock carried in each store, or for sale in such store, and section 2 includes within the goods, wares, and merchandise from which sales are to be made those owned by the taxpayer and held in storage to be sold in or through such store. The appellants insist that this requirement deprives them of the equal protection of the law for the reason that wholesale merchants not taxed by the act in question are assessed under section 926 of the Revised General Statutes of Florida ( Comp. Gen. Laws Fla. 1927,  1197) a tax of only $1.50 per $1,000 of value on stock carried in their stores or warehouses. The result is said to be that a chain store operator must pay double the amount paid by the wholesaler who supplies individual stores competing with the chain.\n Chain stores do not sell at wholesale. What they store, if they warehouse any goods in the state of Florida is for the purpose of retail sale at their shops. On the other hand, goods held by a wholesaler are stored for sale to \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 538]\n\u00a0\n retail establishments to be resold by the latter. What has been said with respect to difference in methods and operation of the two kinds of warehouses applies in this instance. The diverse purposes of the storage and difference in the nature of the business conducted are sufficient to justify a different classification of the two sorts of warehouses for taxation.\n\n 5. \nSection 8, which defines a store, contains a proviso to the effect that the term shall not include 'filling stations engaged exclusively in the sale of gasoline and other petroleum products.' The appellants assert the exemption deprives them of equal protection, since it is arbitrary and unreasonable. It appears, however, that all dealers in gasoline, including those conducting filling stations, are required by statute to pay a license tax of $5 per annum, and in addition a tax of 7 cents per gallon for every gallon of gasoline or other like products of petroleum sold ( chapters 15659 and 15788, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1931 (Ex. Sess.)). It has long been settled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a state from imposing differing taxes upon different trades and professions or varying the rates of excise upon various products.

Clear and hostile discriminations against particular persons and classes especially such as are of an unusual character, unknown to the practice of our governments, may be obnoxious to the Constitution, but, in view of the imposition of taxes on the operation of filing stations by other acts, pursuant to the Legislature's power of classification, we cannot declare their exemption from the tax laid by the Chain Store Act offensive to the guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 6. \nIt is asserted that the act bears unevenly upon those who purchase directly from a wholesale house or manufacturer whose plant is outside the state, some of whom \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 539]\n\u00a0\n also store the goods in Florida preparatory to retail sale, and those who purchase from a wholesaler within the state; that the former are engaged in interstate commerce, and the tax is as to them a burden upon that commerce. The claim merits no series discussion. The tax is obviously laid for the privilege of operating stores in Florida, and attempts no discrimination between merchandise imported from another state and that produced in Florida. Compare Emert v. Missouri, \n156 \nU.S. 296\n, 15 S.Ct. 367; Armour & Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 1\n, 38 S.Ct. 267; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643. It levies no tax and lays no burden on the purchase in interstate commerce of articles for sale in Florida. Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 \nU.S. 60, 65\n, 25 S. Ct. 403; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 471\n, 51 S.Ct. 499. The tax on the value of merchandise in a retail store, or warehoused in Florida for sale in that store, even though incident on articles which have moved in interstate commerce, is laid after interstate commerce has ceased. Compare American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 365; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 42 S.Ct. 375; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 52 S.Ct. 631\n\n\n 7. The bill avers that the state officials charged with the administration of the act have failed to demand the tax and do not intend to collect it from the owners of stores in certain lines of business, such as furniture dealers. This alleged official dereliction is claimed to be an unconstitutional discrimination in the enforcement of the act. For this proposition appellants rely upon decisions such as Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision, \n284 \nU.S. 23\n, 52 S.Ct. 48, and Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239\n, 52 S.Ct. 133, holding a failure to assess all property taxed ad valorem at the same proportion of its value to be a denial of equal protection. The principle upon which those cases rest is that where a statute lays a tax upon property ad valorem at an even and equal rate, discrimi- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 540]\n\u00a0\n nation may result from the fact that the assessing officials systematically and intentionally value some property subject to the tax at a proportion of its true value different from that fixed with respect to other like property. They do not support the appellants' contention that, where the taxing officials fail and neglect to exact the tax from some persons alleged to owe it, all others who are subject to the levy are in virtue of such omission exempt. This court has said that in the case of unequal and discriminatory assessment, to hold that the complaining taxpayer's only remedy is to have the assessments on all the other property raised to a level equal with that of his own is in effect to deny any remedy whatever. As a consequence, redress is afforded by requiring the assessing body to revise the complainant's asessment to the level of those upon other like property. Appellants insist that by analogy they are entitled to be exempt, if others are improperly relieved from taxation.\n Under the law of Florida, every unit of the taxpaying public has an interest in having all property subject to taxation legally assessed, and may in behalf of himself and others in like situation require that all property subject to taxation be placed on the tax books and bear its proportionate part of the expense of government. The appellants, if they deem the tax illegally omitted in certain cases, may apply for a writ of mandamus to compel the taxing officials to do their duty. State ex rel. Dofnos Corp. v. Lehman et al., 100 Fla. 1401, 131 So. 333. Failure to collect the tax from some whose occupations fall within the provisions of the act cannot excuse the appellants from paying what they owe. And certainly the remedy afforded by state law assures them equal treatment along with all others similarly situated.\n\n 8. \nWe are told that the Legislature of Florida would not have passed the act if any of its provisions were for \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 541]\n\u00a0\n any reason to be inoperative, and we are asked, therefore, to declare the entire statute void.\n Section 15 provides:\n'If any section, provision or clause of this Act shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional, or if this Act as applied to any circumstances shall be declared invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not be construed to effect the portions of this Act not so held to be invalid or the application of this Act to other circumstances not so held to be invalid.'\n\n The operation of this section consequent on our decision is a matter of state law. While we have jurisdiction of the issue, we deem it appropriate that we should leave the determination of the question to the state court. See King v. West Virginia, \n216 \nU.S. 92\n, 30 S.Ct. 225; Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty & Inv. Co., \n245 \nU.S. 288, 290\n, 38 S.Ct. 125; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 291\n, 44 S.Ct. 323.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting in part).\n In my opinion, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida should be affirmed.\n Florida Laws 1931 (Ex. Sess.), chapter 15624, is legislation of the type popularly called Anti-Chain Store Laws. The statute provides for the licensing of retail stores by the state, the counties, and the municipalities-a system under which large revenues may be raised. But the raising of revenue is obviously not the main purpose of the legislation. Its chief aim is to protect the individual, independently-owned, retail stores from the competition of chain stores. The statute seeks to do this by subjecting the latter to financial handicaps which may conceivably compel their withdrawal from the state. An injunction \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 542]\n\u00a0\n against its enforcement is sought on the ground that the law violates rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\n The Florida law is general in its terms. It prohibits the operation, after September 30, 1931, of any retail store without securing annually a license; and provides, among other things, for annual fees which are in part graduated. If the owner operates only one store, the state fee is $5; if more than one, the fee for the additional stores rises by step increases, dependent upon both the number operated and whether all operated are located in a single county. The highest fee is for a store in excess of 75. If all of the stores are located in a single county, the fee for each store in excess of 75 is $40; if all are not located in the same county, the fee is $50. Under this law, the owner of 100 stores not located in a single county pays for each store operated, on the average, $ 33.65; and, if they were located in a single county, the owner would pay for each store, on the average, $25.20. If the 100 stores were independently owned (although operated co-operatively as a so-called 'voluntary chain'), the annual fee for each would be only $5. The statute provides that the licenses shall issue to expire on September 30th of each calendar year. This suit was begun September 30, 1931. The first license year had expired before the case was heard in this Court.\n In its main features, this statute resembles the Indiana law discussed in State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. For the reasons there stated, the Court sustains like provisions in the Florida statute. But it declares arbitrary, and hence invalid, the novel provision imposing heavier license fees where the multiple stores of a single owner are located in more than one county, because it is 'unable to discover any reasonable basis for this classification.' There is nothing in the record to show affirmatively that the provision may not be a reasonable one in \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 543]\n\u00a0\n view of conditions prevailing in Florida. Since the presumption of constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute, its validity should, in my opinion, be sustained. O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 258 S., 51 S.Ct. 130; Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, \n282 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 51 S.Ct. 201; Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 158\n, 52 S.Ct. 69; Boston & Maine R.R. v. Armburg, \n285 \nU.S. 234, 240\n, 52 S.Ct. 336; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 52 S.Ct. 556.\n There is, however, another ground on which this provision should be, and the whole statute could be, sustained-a ground not considered in the Jackson Case and not pertinent there. Jackson was an individual. The plaintiffs here are all corporations. Though the provisions of the statutes in the two states are similar, certain rules of law applicable to the parties to the litigation are different.\n The plaintiffs are thirteen corporations which engage in Florida exclusively in intrastate commerce. Each (except one) owns and operates a chain of retail stores within the state and some operate stores in more than one county. Several of the plaintiffs are organized under the laws of Florida; the rest under the laws of other states. No claim of discrimination as between the foreign and domestic corporations is made, compare Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, 30 S.Ct. 287, 17 Ann.Cas. 1247; Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713; nor could it be, since the statute affects both classes of corporations alike. The suit is brought as a class suit, for the benefit of all merchants similarly situated who may desire to avail themselves thereof. From certain allegations in the bill it may be inferred that there are at least two natural persons within the state who own and operate more than one store. But, as no such person has intervened in the cause, we have no occasion to inquire whether the discrimination com- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 544]\n\u00a0\n plained of would be fatal as applied to natural persons. The plaintiffs can succeed only if the discrimination is unconstitutional as applied to them; that is, as applied to corporations. One who would strike down a statute must show not only that he is affected by it, but that as applied to him it exceeds the power of the state. This rule, acted upon as early as Austin v. Boston, 7 Wall. 694, and definitely stated in Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 314, has been consistently followed since that time. Compare Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540, 550\n, 32 S.Ct. 784; Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390, 398\n, 33 S.Ct. 120; Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, \n271 \nU.S. 50, 54\n, 55 S., 46 S.Ct. 375, 45 A.L.R. 1495; Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-operative Marketing Ass'n, \n276 \nU.S. 71, 88\n, 48 S.Ct. 291. For the reasons to be stated, the discrimination complained of, and held arbitrary by the court, is, in my opinion, valid as applied to corporations.\n First. The Federal Constitution does not confer upon either domestic or foreign corporations the right to engage in intrastate commerce in Florida. The privilege of engaging in such commerce in corporate form is one which the state may confer or may withhold as it sees fit. Compare Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, \n282 \nU.S. 440\n, 51 S.Ct. 201. See Pembina Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n125 \nU.S. 181, 184\n, 185 S., 186, 8 S.Ct. 737; Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 305, 314\n, 12 S.Ct. 403; Hemphill v. Orloff, \n277 \nU.S. 537, 548\n, 48 S.Ct. 577. Florida might grant the privilege to one set of persons and deny it to others; might grant it for some kinds of business and deny it for others; might grant the privilege to corporations with a small capital while denying it for those whose capital or resources are large. Or it might grant the privilege to private corporations whose shares are owned mainly by those who manage them and to corporations engaged in co-operative undertakings, while denying the privilege to other concerns called private, but whose shares are listed on a stock exchange- corpora- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 545]\n\u00a0\n tions financed by the public, largely through the aid of investment bankers. It may grant the privilege broadly, or restrict its exercise to a single county, city, or town, and to a single place of business within any such subdivision of the state.\n Whether the corporate privilege shall be granted or withheld is always a matter of state policy. If granted, the privilege is conferred in order to achieve an end which the state deems desirable. It may be granted as a means of raising revenue; or. in order to procure for the community a public utility, a bank, or a desired industry not otherwise obtainable; or the reason for granting it may be to promote more generally the public welfare by providing an instrumentality of business which will facilitate the establishment and conduct of new and large enterprises deemed of public benefit. Similarly, if the privilege is denied, it is denied because incidents of like corporate enterprise are deemed inimical to the public welfare and it is desired to protect the community from apprehended harm.\n Here we are dealing only with intrastate commerce. Compare Carley & Hamilton, Inc., v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 71\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 68 A.L.R. 194. Since a state may fix the price for the privilege of doing intrastate commerce in corporate form, and the corporation is free to accept or reject the offer, the state may make the price higher for the privilege of locating stores in two counties than in one. Can it be doubted that a state, being free to permit or to prohibit branch banking, would be at liberty to exact a higher license fee from banks with branches than from those with only a single place of business; that it might exact a higher fee from those banks which have branches in several counties than it does from those whose branches are all within a single county; and that it might do so without obligation to justify, before some court, the reasonableness of the dif- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 546]\n\u00a0\n ference in the license fees?1 The difference made by Florida in exacting a higher license fee for those concerns which do business in more than one county is similar in character to that suggested.\n If the Florida statute had stated in terms that the license fee was exacted as compensation for the privilege of conducting multiple stores in corporate form, it seems clear that no corporation could successfully challenge its validity. Compare Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 305\n, 12 S.Ct. 403; Kansas City, Ft. S. & M.R. Co. v. Botkin, \n240 \nU.S. 227\n, 36 S.Ct. 261; Nebraska ex rel. Beatrice Creamery Co. v. Marsh, \n282 \nU.S. 799\n, 51 S.Ct. 38. And, since the state had the power so to do, the mere failure to state that such was the nature of the exaction does not render it invalid. Compare Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 683\n, 18 S.Ct. 229. Nor does the fact that the plaintiffs had been admitted to the state prior to enactment of the statute. A state which freely granted the corporate privilege for intrastate commerce may change its policy. It may conclude, in the light of experience, that the grant of the privilege for intrastate commerce is harmful to the community, and may decide not to grant the privilege in the future. It may go further in the process of exclusion. It may revoke privileges theretofore granted, compare Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, \n212 \nU.S. 322, 343\n, 29 S.Ct. 370, 15 Ann.Cas. 645; Crescent Cotton Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129\n, 45 S. Ct. 42, since, in the absence of contract, there is no vested interest which requires the con- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 547]\n\u00a0\n tinuance of a legislative policy however expressed-whether embodied in a charter or in a system of taxation. Citizens' Savings Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 636, 644\n, 19 S.Ct. 530, 571; Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Miller, \n221 \nU.S. 408, 414\n, 415 S., 31 S.Ct. 534; Erie R. Co. v. Williams, \n233 \nU.S. 685, 701\n, 34 S.Ct. 761, 51 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1097; Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 157\n, 38 S.Ct. 295. Compare Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 409\n, 37 S.Ct. 158.\n If a state believes that adequate protection against harm apprehended or experienced can be secured, without revoking the corporate privilege, by imposing thereafter upon corporations the handicap of higher, discriminatory license fees as compensation for the privilege, I know of nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent it from making the experiment. The case at bar is not like those where a restriction upon the liberty of the individual may be attacked by showing that no evil exists, or is apprehended, or that the remedy provided cannot be regarded as appropriate to its removal. Nor is the case like those where a state regulation or state taxes burden interstate commerce. Compare Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n; Robbins v. Taxing District of Shelby County, \n120 \nU.S. 489\n, 7 S.Ct. 592; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 \nU.S. 622, 626\n, 23 S.Ct. 229; Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S.Ct. 556; Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S.Ct. 324, 38 A.L.R. 286. Cases like Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190; Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S.Ct. 85; Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S.Ct. 188, 21 A.L.R. 186, have no application to the situation here discussed.\n Whether the citizens of Florida are wise in seeking to discourage the operation of chain stores is, obviously, a matter with which this Court has no concern. Nor need it, in my opinion, consider whether the differences in license fees employed to effect such discouragement are inherently reasonable, since the plaintiffs are at liberty to refuse to pay the compensation demanded for the corporate privilege and withdraw from the state, if they consider the price more than the privilege is worth. But a review of the legislation of the several states by which \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 548]\n\u00a0\n all restraints on corporate size and activity were removed, and a consideration of the economic and social effects of such removal, will help to an understanding of Anti-Chain Store Laws; and will show that the discriminatory license fees prescribed by Florida, even if treated merely as a form of taxation, were laid for a purpose which may be appropriately served by taxation, and that the specific means employed to favor the individual retailer are not constitutionally objectionable.\n Second. The prevalence of the corporation in America has led men of this generation to act, at times, as if the privilege of doing business in corporate form were inherent in the citizen; and has led them to accept the evils attendant upon the free and unrestricted use of the corporate mechanism as if these evils were the inescapable price of civilized life, and, hence, to be borne with resignation. Throughout the greater part of our history a different view prevailed. Although the value of this instrumentality in commerce and industry was fully recognized, incorporation for business was commonly denied long after it had been freely granted for religious, educational, and charitable purposes. \n2\n by corporations. So at first the corporate of encroachment upon the liberties and opportunities of the individual. Fear of the subjection of labor to capital. Fear of monopoly. Fear that the absorption of capital by corporations, and their perpetual life, might bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 517, 549]\n\u00a0\n There was a sense of some insidious menace inherent in large aggregations of capital, particularly when held by corporations. So at first the corporate privilege was granted sparingly; and only when the grant seemed necessary in order to procure for the community some specific benefit otherwise unattainable. The later enactment of general incorporation laws does not signify that the apprehension of corporate domination had been overcome. The desire for business expansion created an irresistible demand for more charters; and it was believed that under general laws embodying safeguards of universal application the scandals and favoritism incident to special incorporation could be avoided. The general laws, which long embodied severe restrictions upon size and upon the scope of corporate activity, were, in part, an expression of the desire for equality of opportunity. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 517, 550]\n\u00a0\n (a) Limitation upon the amount of the authorized capital of business corporations was long universal. \n5\n The maximum limit frequently varied with the kinds of business to be carried on, being dependent apparently upon the supposed requirements of the efficient unit. Although the statutory limits were changed from time to time this principle of limitation was long retained. Thus \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 551]\n\u00a0\n in New York the limit was at first $100,000 for some businesses and as little as $50,000 for others. \n6\n Until 1881 the maximum for business corporations in New York was $2,000,000; and until 1890, $5,000,000.7 In Massachusetts the limit was at first $200,000 for some businesses and as little as $5,000 for others. \n8\n Until 1871 the maximum for mechanical and manufacturing corporations was \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 552]\n\u00a0\n $500,000; and until 1899, $1,000,000.9 The limit of $100,000 was retained for some businesses until 1903.10\n In many other states, including the leading ones in some industries, the removal of the limitations upon size was more recent. Pennsylvania did not remove the limits \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 553]\n\u00a0\n until 1905.11 Its first general act not having contained a maximum limit, that of $500,000 was soon imposed. \n12\n Later, it was raised to $1,000,000; and, for iron and steel companies, to $5,000,000.13 Vermont limited the maximum to $1,000,000 until 1911,14 when to amount over $10,000,000 was authorized if, in the opinion of a judge of the Supreme Court, such a capitalization would tend 'to create a monopoly or result in restraining competition in trade.' \n15\n Maryland limited until 1918 the capital of mining companies to $3,000,000; and prohibited them from holding more than 500 acres of land (except in Allegany county, where 1,000 acres was allowed). 16 New Hampshire did not remove the maximum limit until 1919.17 It had been $1,000,000 until 1907,18 when it was increased to $5,000,000.19 Michigan did not remove the maximum limit until 1921.20 The maximum, at first \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 554]\n\u00a0\n $100,000,21 had been gradually increased until in 1903 it became $10,000, 000 for some corporations and $25,000,000 for others;22 and in 1917 became $ 50,000,000.23 Indiana did not remove until 1921 the maximum limit of $2, 000,000 for petroleum and natural gas corporations. \n24\n Missouri did not remove its maximum limit until 1927.25 Texas still has such a limit for certain corporations. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n (b)\n Limitations upon the scope of a business corporation's powers and activity were also long universal. At first, corporations could be formed under the general laws only for a limited number of purposes-usually those which required a relatively large fixed capital, like transportation, banking, and insurance, and mechanical, min- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 555]\n\u00a0\n ing, and manufacturing enterprises. \n27\n Permission to incorporate for 'any lawful purpose'28 was not common until 1875; and until that time the duration of corporate franchises was generally limited to a period of 20, 30, or 50 years. \n29\n All, or a majority, of the incorporators or directors, or both, were required to be residents of the incorporating state. \n30\n The powers which the corporation might exercise in carrying out its purposes were sparingly conferred and strictly construed. Severe limitations were imposed on the amount of indebtedness, bonded or other- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 556]\n\u00a0\n wise. \n31\n The power to hold stock in other corporations was not conferred or implied. \n32\n The holding company was impossible.\n 31 See, e.g., N.Y. Laws 1825, p. 448,  3, 1 Rev. Stat. (1852), c. 18, tit. 4,  3, p. 1175; N.Y. Laws 1875, c. 611,  22; Ill. Laws 1849, p. 87 ,  22, p. 92; Ill. Laws 1872, p. 296,  16, p. 300; Pa.

Keasbey, New Jersey and the Great Corporations, 13 Harvard Law Review, pp. 198, 207, 208. In no other state had there been a provision permitting the formation of holding companies, although by special act, notably in Pennsylvania, a few such companies had been formed. See James C. Bonbright and Gardiner C. Means, The Holding Company (1932), pp. 58-64. The scandal to which the series of Pennsylvania holding-company charters gave rise led to a constitutional amendment in that state forbidding the grant of special charters. Pa. Laws 1874, p. 8; Pa. Const. art. 3,  7. See Bonbright and Means, supra, at p. 60. New York, like other states, had specifically prohibited intercorporate stockholding, except where the stock held was that of a corporation supplying necessary materials to the purchasing corporation, or where it was taken as security for, or in satisfaction of, an antecedent debt. N.Y. Laws 1848, c. 40,  8; 1876, c. 358; 1890, c. 564,  40; 1890, c. 567,  12. See De La Vergne Ref. Mach. Co. v. German Savings Institution, \n175 U.S. 40\n, 54-58, 20 S.Ct. 20. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 557]\n\u00a0\n (c) The removal by the leading industrial states of the limitations upon the size and powers of business corporations appears to have been due, not to their conviction that maintenance of the restrictions was undesirable in itself, but to the conviction that it was futile to insist upon them; because local restriction would be circumvented by foreign incorporation. Indeed, local restriction seemed worse than futile. Lesser states, eager for the revenue33 derived from the traffic in charters, had removed safeguards from their own incorporation laws. \n34\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 517, 558]\n\u00a0\n Companies were early formed to provide charters for corporations in states where the cost was lowest and the laws least restrictive. \n35\n The states joined in advertising\n 35 Thus, in its pamphlet, 'Business Corporations Under the Laws of Maine' (1903), the Corporation Trust Company enumerated among the advantages of the Maine laws: The comparatively low organization fees and annual taxes; the absence of restrictions upon capital stock or corporate indebtedness; the authority to issue stock for services as well as property, with the judgment of the directors as to their value conclusive; and, significantly enough, 'the method of taxation, which bases the annual tax upon the stock issued, does not necessitate inquiry into or report upon the intimate affairs of the corporation.' See, also, its pamphlet 'Business Corporations Under the Laws of Delaware' (1907). See, also, the Red Book on Arizona Corporation Laws (1908), published by the Incorporating Company of Arizona, especially page 5: 'The remoteness of Arizona from the Eastern and Southern State has in a measure delayed the promulgation of the generousness of its laws. New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia have become widely known as incorporating states. More recently Arizona, Dakota, New Mexico and Nevada have come into more or less prominence by the passage of laws with liberal features.' \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 559]\n\u00a0\n their wares. \n36\n The race was one not of diligence but of laxity. \n37\n Incorporation under such laws was possible; and the great industrial States yielded in order not to \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 560]\n\u00a0\n lose wholly the prospect of the revenue and the control incident to domestic incorporation.\n The history of the changes made by New York is illustrative. The New York revision of 1890, which eliminated the maximum limitation on authorized capital, and \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 561]\n\u00a0\n permitted intercorporate stockholding in a limited class of cases, 38 was passed after a migration of incorporation from New York, attracted by the more liberal incorporation laws of New Jersey. \n39\n But the changes made by New York in 1890 were not sufficient to stem the tide. \n40\n In \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 562]\n\u00a0\n 1892, the Governor of New York approved a special charter for the General Electric Company, modelled upon the New Jersey act, on the ground that otherwise the enterprise would secure a New Jersey charter. \n41\n Later in the same year the New York corporation law was again revised, allowing the holding of stock in other corporations. \n42\n But the New Jersey law still continued to be more attractive to incorporators. \n43\n By specifically providing that corpora-\n 41 N.Y. Laws 1892, c. 323. 'The measure is approved because it is claimed that its objects cannot well be secured under general laws, and because its approval will keep within the State a corporation which professes to be ready to invest a large amount of capital, and which, without the concessions allowed by its proposed charter, would be incorporated under the laws of New Jersey.' Public Papers of Governor Flower, 1892, p. 104. Quoted in James B. Dill, 'Some aspects of New Jersey's Corporate Policy,' Address before the Pennsylvania Bar Association, June 29, 1903, Rep. Pa. Bar Ass'n, 1903, pp. 265, 267.\n 42 N.Y. Laws 1892, c. 688,  40.\n 43 The New York Evening Post, March 23, 1896, said: 'The Evening Post has frequently pointed out that New York capital is driven to shelter in New Jersey by reason of the more liberal laws of that State governing the incorporation of companies as compared with the laws of New York. Nearly all large corporations doing business in this City and State are incorporated under the laws of New Jersey or some other State, where more liberal laws prevail and in which inducements are thereby held out to attract capital thither and make it their legal home.' \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 563]\n\u00a0\n tions might be formed in New Jersey to do all their business elsewhere,44 the state made its policy unmistakably clear. Of the seven largest trusts existing in 1904, with an aggregate capitalization of over two and a half billion dollars, all were organized under New Jersey law; and three of these were formed in 1899.45 During the first seven months of that year, 1336 corporations were organized under the laws of New Jersey, with an aggregate authorized capital of over two billion dollars. \n46\n The Comptroller of New York, in his annual report for 1899, complained that 'our tax list reflects little of the great wave of organization that has swept over the country during the past year and to which this state contributed more capital than any other state in the Union.' 'It is time,' he declared, 'that great corporations having their actual headquarters in this State and a nominal office elsewhere, doing nearly all of their business within our borders, should be brought within the jurisdiction of this State not only as to matters of taxation but in respect to other and equally important affairs.' \n47\n In 1901 the New York corporation law was again revised. \n48\n\u00a0\n\n 44 N.J. Laws 1892, p. 90. In 1894 New Jersey provided by statute that corporations of another state should be subjected to the same taxes, license, and other requirements in New Jersey as are imposed on New Jersey corporations by such other state. Laws 1894, c. 228, p. 347,  3. The statute was in retaliation for the hostile legislation of some of the other States regarding foreign corporations. J. B. Dill, The General Incorporation Act of New Jersey (1898) p. 100. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 564]\n\u00a0\n The history in other states was similar. Thus the Massachusetts revision of 1903 was precipitated by the fact that 'the possibilities of incorporation in other states have become well known, and have been availed of to the detriment of this Commonwealth.' \n49\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Able, discerning scholars50 have pictured for us the economic and social results of thus removing all limitations upon the size and activities of business corporations \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 565]\n\u00a0\n and of vesting in their managers vast powers once exercised by stockholders-results not designed by the states and long unsuspected. They show that size alone gives to giant corporations a social significance not attached ordinarily to smaller units of private enterprise. Through size, corporations, once merely an efficient tool employed by individuals in the conduct of private business have become an institution-an institution which has brought such concentration of economic power that so-called private corporations are sometimes able to dominate the state. The typical business corporation of the last century, owned by a small group of individuals, managed by their owners, and limited in size by their personal wealth, is being supplanted by huge concerns in which the lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of employees and the property of tens or hundreds of thousands of investors are subjected, through the corporate mechanism, to the control of a few men. Ownership has been separated from control; and this separation has removed many of the checks which formerly operated to curb the misuse of wealth and power. And, as ownership of the shares is becoming continually more dispersed, the power which formerly accompanied ownership is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. The changes thereby wrought in the lives of the workers, of the owners and of the general public, are so fundamental and far-reaching as to lead these scholars to compare the evolving 'corporate system' with the feudal system; and to lead other men of insight and experience to assert that this 'master institution of civilised life' is committing it to the rule of a plutocracy. \n51\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 517, 566]\n\u00a0\n tion has already advanced so far that perhaps two-thirds of our industrial wealth has passed from individual possession to the ownership of large corporations whose shares are dealt in on the stock exchange;52 that 200 nonbanking corporations, each with assets in excess of $90,000,000, control directly about one-fourth of all our national wealth, and that their influence extends far beyond the assets under their direct control; 53 that these 200 corporations, while nominally controlled by about 2,000 directors, are actually dominated by a few hundred persons54-the negation of industrial democracy. Other writers have shown that, coincident with the growth of these giant corporations, there has occurred a marked concentration of individual wealth;55 and that the resulting disparity in \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 567]\n\u00a0\n incomes is a major cause of the existing depression. \n56\n Such is the Frankenstein monster which states have created by their corporation laws. \n 57\n\u00a0\n\n 56 Compare J. A. Hobson, Poverty in Plenty (1931) cc. 2, 4; Arthur B. Adams, The Business Depression of 1930, in American Economic Review, vol. 21 (March, 1931, supplement) p. 183; John A.

Maurice Wormser, Frankenstein, Incorporated (1931). \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 568]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. Among these 200 corporations, each with assets in excess of $ 90,000,000, are five of the plaintiffs. These five have, in the aggregate, $ 820,000,000 of assets;58 and they operate, in the several states, an aggregate of 19,718 stores. \n59\n A single one of these giants operates nearly 16,000.60 Against these plaintiffs, and other owners of multiple stores, the individual retailers of Florida are engaged in a struggle to preserve their independence-perhaps a struggle for existence. The citizens of the state, considering themselves vitally interested in this seemingly unequal struggle, have undertaken to aid the individual retailers by subjecting the owners of multiple stores to the handicap of higher license fees. They may have done so merely in order to preserve competition. But their purpose may have been a broader and deeper one. They may have believed that the chain store, by furthering the concentration of wealth and of power and by promoting absentee ownership, is thwarting American ideals; that it is making impossible equality of opportunity; that it is converting independent tradesmen into clerks; and that \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 569]\n\u00a0\n it is sapping the resources, the vigor and the hope of the smaller cities and towns. \n61\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 517, 570]\n\u00a0\n independent stores with the chain stores; at the highest, its aim is to eliminate altogether the corporate chain stores from retail distribution. The legislation reminds of that by which Florida and other states, in order to eliminate the 'premium system' in merchandising, exacted high license fees of merchants who offered trading stamps with their goods. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L. R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Tranner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369\n, 36 S.Ct. 379. Compare Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157\n, 33 S.Ct. 66; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, \n233 \nU.S. 304\n, 34 S.Ct. 493.\n The plaintiffs discuss the broad question whether the power to tax may be used for the purpose of curbing, or of exterminating, the chain stores by whomsoever owned. It is settled that a state 'may carry out a policy' by 'adjusting its revenue laws and taxing system in such a way as to favor certain industries or forms of industry.' Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 32 S.Ct. 192, 193; Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 329\n, 33 S.Ct. 833.62 And, since the Fourteenth Amendment 'was not intended to compel the states to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation,' Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533, 535, it may exempt from taxation kinds of business which it wishes to promote; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114\n, 30 S.Ct. 496, and may burden more heavily kinds of business which it wishes to discourage. Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 271\n, 21 S.Ct. 128; Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 \nU.S. 226\n, 26 S.Ct. 232; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; compare Alaska Fish, etc., Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44\n, 41 S.Ct. 219. To do that has been the practice also of the federal government. It protects, by customs duties, our manufacturers and producers from the competition of foreigners. Compare Hampton, Jr., & Co. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 571]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394\n, 411-413, 48 S.Ct. 348; also, Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S.Ct. 421. It protects, by the oleomargarine laws, our farmers and dairymen from the competition of other Americans. Compare McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561. It eliminated, by a prohibitive tax, the issue of state bank notes in competition with those of national banks. Compare Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533. Such is the constitutional power of Congress and of the state Legislatures. The wisdom of its exercise is not the concern of this Court.\n Whether chain stores owned by individuals may be subjected to the discrimination here challenged need not, however, be decided. This case requires decision only of the narrower question-whether the state may freely apply discrimination in license fees against corporate chain stores. The essential difference between corporations and natural persons has been recognized by the federal government in taxing the income of businesses when conducted by corporations, while exempting a similar business when carried on by an individual or partnership. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 108, 158\n, 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. It has, at other times, imposed upon businesses conducted by corporations heavier taxes than upon those conducted by individuals. \n63\n The equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment presents no obstacle to a state, likewise, taxing businesses engaged in intrastate commerce differently according to the instruments by which they are carried on; provided the purpose of the discrimination is a permissible one, the discrimination employed a means appropriate to achieving the end sought, and the difference in the instruments so employed vital. Compare Fort Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532\n, 40 S.Ct. 304; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373\n, 34 S.Ct. 114; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 572]\n\u00a0\n Brickell, \n233 \nU.S. 304\n, 34 S.Ct. 493. The corporate mechanism is obviously a vital element in the conduct of business. The encouragement or discouragement of competition is an end for which the power of taxation may be exerted. And discrimination in the rate of taxation is an effective means to that end.\n The requirement of the equality clause that classification 'must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,' Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S.Ct. 423, 425, is here satisfied. Mere difference in degree has been widely applied as a difference justifying different taxation or regulation. \n64\n The difference in power between corporations and natural persons is ample basis for placing them in different, classes. Even as between natural persons, where the equality clause applies rigidly, differences in size furnish an adequate basis for discrimination in a tax rate. The size of estates, or of bequests, is the difference on which rest all the progressive inheritance taxes of the states and of the nation. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 18 S.Ct. 594; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 109\n, 20 S.Ct. 747; Keeney v. Comptroller of State of New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525, 536\n, 32 S.Ct. 105, 38 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1139; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525\n, 40 S.Ct. 2; Salomon v. State Tax Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 484\n, 49 S.Ct. 192. Difference in the size of incomes is the basis on which rest all progressive income taxes. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713. Differences in the size of businesses present, likewise, an adequate basis for different rates of taxation. Compare Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 331\n, 33 S.Ct. 833, Pacific American Fisheries v. Territory of Alaska, \n269 \nU.S. 269\n, 46 S.Ct. 110. And so do differences in the extent or field of operation.\n The state might justify progressively higher license fees for corporations of larger size, or a more extended \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 573]\n\u00a0\n field of operation, on the oft-asserted ground that such concerns are more efficient than smaller units, and hence that they can, and should, contribute more to the public revenues. But the state need not rest the difference in tax rates on a ground so debatable as the assertion that efficiency increases with size. \n65\n The Federal Constitution does not require that taxes (as distinguished from assessments for betterments) be proportionate to the differences in benefits received by the taxpayers, compare Illinois Central R. Co. v. Decatur, \n147 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 13 S.Ct. 293; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 203\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 76\n, 32 S.Ct. 13; St. Louis & Southwestern R. Co. v. Nattin, \n277 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 48 S.Ct. 438; or that taxes be proportionate to the taxpayer's ability to bear the burden. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 574]\n\u00a0\n Since business must yield to the paramount interests of the community in times of peace as well as in times of war, a state may prohibit a business found to be noxious and, likewise, may prohibit incidents or excrescences of a business otherwise beneficent. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S.Ct. 273; Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, \n207 \nU.S. 251\n, 28 S.Ct. 89; Williams v. Arkansas, \n217 \nU.S. 79\n, 30 S.Ct. 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 865; Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 \nU.S. 128\n, 31 S.Ct. 190; Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157\n, 33 S.Ct. 66. Businesses may become as harmful to the community by excessive size, as by monopoly or the commonly recognized restraints of trade. If the state should conclude that bigness in retail merchandising as manifested in corporate chain stores menaces the public welfare, it might prohibit the excessive size or extent of that business as it prohibits excessive size or weight in motor trucks or excessive height in the buildings of a city. Compare Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135\n, 47 S.Ct. 548; Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91\n, 29 S.Ct. 567; Village of Euclid v. Ambler Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 388\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, 54 A.L.R. 1016. It was said in United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417, 451\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121, that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note) did not forbid large aggregations; but the power of Congress to prohibit corporations of a size deemed excessive from engaging in interstate commerce was not questioned.\n The elimination of chain stores, deemed harmful or menacing because of their bigness, may be achieved by levelling the prohibition against the corporate mechanism-the instrument by means of which excessive size is commonly made possible. Or, instead of absolutely prohibiting the corporate chain store, the state might conclude that it should first try the more temperate remedy of curbing the chain by imposing the handicap of discriminatory license fees. Compare St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, \n249 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 39 S.Ct. 274; Hammond Packing Co. v. Montana, \n233 \nU.S. 331, 333\n, 334 S., 34 S.Ct. 596; Bradley v. Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477, 480\n, 33 S.Ct. 318. 'Taxation is regulation just as prohibition is.' Compan ia General De Ta- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 575]\n\u00a0\n hacos v. Collector, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 96\n, 48 S.Ct. 100, 103. And the state's power to make social and economic experiments is a broad one.\n Fifth. The mere fact that the taxpayer is a corporation does not, of course, exclude it from the protection afforded by the equality clause. Corporations and individuals, aliens and citizens, are for most purposes in the same class. Ordinarily, they have the same civil rights; are entitled to the same remedies; are subject to the same police regulations; and are also subject to the same tax laws. Where such is the case, the corporation taxpayer is entitled, like the individual, to the protection of the equality clause against discrimination. however effected. Compare Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239\n, 52 S.Ct. 133. But the chief aim of the Florida statute is apparently to handicap corporate chain stores-that is, to place them at a disadvantage, to make their success less probable. No other justification of the discrimination in license fees need be shown; since the very purpose of the legislation is to create inequality and thereby to discourage the establishment, or the maintenance, of corporate chain stores; since that purpose is one for which the power of taxation may be exerted; since higher license fees is an appropriate means of discouragement; and corporations have not the inherent right to engage in intrastate commerce. The clear distinction between the equality clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not be overlooked in this connection. The mandate of the due process clause is absolute. That clause is of universal application. It knows not classes. It applies alike to corporations and to individuals, to citizens and to aliens. Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 411\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701; Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 51 S.Ct. 229. The equality clause, on the other hand, is limited in its operation to members of a class. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 576]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the Florida Anti-Chain Store Law, like others, is not drawn so as to apply only to giant corporate chains. In terms, it applies to the small corporations as well as to the large; and also to natural persons. But the history of such legislation indicates that these laws were aimed at the huge, publicly-financed corporations; and that the statutes were couched in comprehensive terms in the hope of thereby avoiding constitutional doubts raised by judicial statements that the equality clause applies alike to natural persons and corporations. It was said in Quaker City Cab Co. v. Com. of Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389, 402\n, 48 S.Ct. 553, that the equality clause precludes making the character of the owner the sole fact on which a discrimination in taxation shall depend. And in Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515, 522\n, 49 S.Ct. 235, 238, it was said (citing the Quaker City Cab Case; Kentucky Finance Corp. v. Paramount Auto Exchange, \n262 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 43 S.Ct. 636; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 17 S.Ct. 255) 'that a corporation is as much entitled to the equal protection of the laws as an individual.' These statements require, in my opinion, this qualification. Whenever the discrimination is for a permitted purpose-as when a state, having concluded that activity by corporations should be curbed, seeks to favor businesses conducted by individuals-the corporate character of the owner presents a difference in ownership which may be made the sole basis of classification in taxation, as in regulation. \n66\n The discrimination cannot, in such a case \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 577]\n\u00a0\n be held arbitrary, since it is made in order to effect the permitted hostile purpose and is appropriate to that end. Compare Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 U.S. 276\n, 283-285, 52 S.Ct. 556; People of State of New York ex rel. New York & Albany Lighterage Co. v. Lynch, \n288 \nU.S. 590\n, 53 S.Ct. 400, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Sixth. The plaintiffs contend, for a further reason, that there is no taxable difference justifying the discrimination in license fees. They assert that the struggle between them and the independently owned stores is, in fact, not an unequal one; and, in support of this assertion, they call attention to those paragraphs in the bill which describe the co- operative chains of individual stores and their rapid growth. These paragraphs allege that by 'affiliations and cooperative organizations single grocery (and other) store owners have adopted the best features of chain store merchandising and have secured substantially all the benefits derived therefrom, while at the same time they have avoided burdens of capital investment, insurance, etc., incident to the carrying of a large stock in a central warehouse.' The bill sets forth how this has been achieved, describing in detail the recent advances in efficiency of such co-operative merchandising. It alleges, moreover, that the members of a co- operative chain have the superior advantage of the good will and personal interest of the individual owners, as compared with the hired managers of the regular chains; and that all these facts were known to the Legislature when it enacted the statute here challenged. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 578]\n\u00a0\n These allegations are admitted by the motion to dismiss; and they are supported by recent experience of which we may take notice. \n67\n But it does not follow that, because the independently owned stores are overcoming through co-operation the advantages once possessed by chain stores, there is no taxable difference between the corporate chain and the single store. The state's power to apply discriminatory taxation as a means of preventing domination of intrastate commerce by capitalistic corporations is not conditioned upon the existence of economic need. It flows from the broader right of Americans to preserve, and to establish from time to time. such institutions, social and economic, as seem to them desirable; and, likewise, to end those which they deem undesirable. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 579]\n\u00a0\n The state might, if conditions warranted, subject giant corporations to a control similar to that now exerted over public utility companies. \n68\n Or the citizens of Florida might conceivably escape from the domination of giant corporations by having the state engage in business. Compare Jones v. City of Portland, \n245 \nU.S. 217\n, 38 S.Ct. 112, L.R.A. 1918C, 765, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 660; Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, 40 S.Ct. 499; Standard Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, \n275 \nU.S. 504\n, 48 S.Ct. 155. But Americans seeking escape from corporate domination have open to them under the Constitution another form of social and economic control-one more in keeping with our traditions and aspirations. They may prefer the way of co-operation, which leads directly to the freedom and the equality of opportunity which the Fourteenth Amendment aims to secure. 69 That way is clearly open. For the fundamental difference between capitalistic enterprise and the co-operative-between economic absolutism and industrial democracy-is one which has been commonly accepted by Legislatures and the courts as justifying discrimination in both regulation and taxation. 70 Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Marketing Ass'n, \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S.Ct. 291. Compare Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S.Ct. 833. \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 580]\n\u00a0\n There is a widespread belief that the existing unemployment is the result, in large part, of the gross inequality in the distribution of wealth and income which giant corporations have fostered; that by the control which the few have exerted through giant corporations individual initiative and effort are being paralyzed, creative power impaired and human happiness lessened; that the true prosperity of our past came not from big business, but through the courage, the energy, and the resourcefulness of small men; that only by releasing from corporate control the faculties of the unknown many, only by reopening to them the opportunities for leadership, can confidence in our future be restored and the existing misery be overcome; and that only through participation by the many in the responsibilities and determinations of business can Americans secure the moral and intellectual development which is essential to the maintenance of liberty. If the citizens of Florida share that belief, I know of nothing in the Federal Constitution which precludes the state from endeavoring to give it effect and prevent domination in intrastate commerce by subjecting corporate chains to discriminatory license fees. To that extent, the citizens of each state are still masters of their destiny.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting in part.\n The graduation of a tax upon the business of a chain store may be regulated by the test of territorial expansion, and territorial expansion may be determined by the spread of business from one county into another.\n Students of the chains have accepted the classification of the Census Bureau, which divides them into three groups: Local, sectional, and national. Census of 1930, Report on Retail Distribution by Chains; Lebhar, 'The Chain Store,' p. 20. Chains are local 'if substantially all their stores are located in and around some one city.' \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 581]\n\u00a0\n In 1930, the number of these was 5,589. They are sectional if their 'stores are located in some one section of the country, such as the New England states or the Pacific Coast states or in the Gulf Southwest or any other geographic division.' Of these there were 1,136. They are national if their 'interests are broader than those of any one section of the country.' Of these there were 321.\n Statistics thus indicate that there is a definite line of cleavage between chains that serve consumers within a single territorial unit and those framed for larger ends. The business that keeps at home affects the social organism in ways that differ widely from those typical of a business that goes out into the world. It affects the social organism, but also it affects itself. With the lengthening of the chain there are new fields to be exploited. The door is opened to opportunities that have hitherto been closed. Where does the local have an end and the nonlocal a beginning? The Legislature had to draw the line somewhere, and it drew it with the county. Within the range of reasonable discretion its judgment must prevail. There is need to remember the varying significance of county lines for varying communities. From the beginnings of our history, the town has been the distinctive unit of government in the New England states and in many others of the North. In the South from the beginning the distinctive unit has been the county. Bryce, The American Commonwealth (2d Ed. revised) vol. 1, part II, c. 48, pp. 570, 571; K. H. Porter, County and Township Government in the United States, p. 60. Florida is largely an agricultural state. The census of 1930 shows three cities of over 100,000 ( Jacksonville, 129,549, Miami, 110,637, and Tampa, 101,161); four between 20,000 and 40,000 (Orlando, West Palm Beach, Pensacola, and St. Petersburg ); and seven between 10,000 and 20,000. Of these fourteen cities, all are in different counties. In a state with a population thus distributed, \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 582]\n\u00a0\n the boundaries of the county will have an approximate correspondence with the area of local business. When a chain goes beyond the county, beyond the traditional boundaries of local government, it puts the locality behind it, and elects to play for larger stakes.\n Every new community is potentially a new center of economic opportunity. There is then a hazard of new adventures, a tapping of new sources of dominance and profit. At once with this advance, the tax amounts into higher brackets, but does not mount again. There are not progressive increases when a business, after moving into one county, moves on again to others. The second county once attained, the rate is not affected though many more are added. The chain has made its choice, and for this it pays but once. It has put its local character away, and found alignment in another class. It is on the way to becoming an organization of another order, to becoming sectional or national. There is confirmation of this tendency in the facts stated in the bill as to the stores operated by the complainants and by those allowed to intervene. All who have gone beyond a single county do business in many more, or else in many states. One can imagine extreme cases, to be sure, where county lines may be crossed and the business remain local in substance, if not in form. The store in the new county may be next to the boundary line that separates from the old. So too the chain that is national in scope may have its Florida stores in one county and one only, in which event it is local quoad its activities in Florida, whatever it may be beyond. Lawmakers are not required to legislate with an eye to exceptional conditions. Their search is for probabilities and tendencies of general validity, and, these being ascertained, they may frame their rule accordingly. They are not required to legislate with an eye to forms of growth beyond the limits of their own state. In laying a tax upon a Florida chain their concern is with those \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 583]\n\u00a0\n activities that have social and economic consequences for Florida and her people. The question for them, and so for us, is not how a business might be expected to develop if its forms and lines of growth were to be predicted in the abstract without reference to experience. The question is how it does develop in normal or average conditions, and the answer to that question is to be found in life and history. When the problem is thus approached, the movement from one county to another becomes in a very definite sense the crossing of a frontier, a change as marked as the difference between wholesale trade and retail. Cook v. Marshall County, \n196 \nU.S. 261\n, 25 S.Ct. 233. So at least the Legislature might not unreasonably believe, and act on that belief in the formulation of the law. O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 51 S.Ct. 130.\n Corresponding to the change of opportunity-to the change at the periphery-that accompanies the expansion of the area of action are changes at the center. The chain that is merely local is likely to be organized more simply than the one that spreads itself afar. Methods at the point of origin must be adapted to expanding needs. Other things being equal, there will be a new concentration of control, a new unity of administration, a new emphasis of the very features that distinguish chain stores from others and supply an important reason for taxing the two differently, whether within the county or without. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 534\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. Movement from the locality to other fields of activity is thus a symptom of an inner change. This, at least, is its normal meaning, its meaning, or, so the Legislature might fairly say, in the common run of cases. If so, the scale of payment may be graduated in correspondence with the changing facts.\n There is a distinction not to be ignored between the facts that determine subjection to a tax and those that measure its amount. 'Classification good for one pur- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 584]\n\u00a0\n pose may be bad for another.' Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 38\n, 48 S.Ct. 423, 425. The case cited drew a distinction between graduation of the burden and unconditional exemption. The business conducted by these appellants is not subjected to a tax because it is in several counties. It is taxed because it is the business of operating chain stores, and its spread over counties is only one circumstance, along with others, to be considered by the collector in determining how much it has to pay. The factor may be inconclusive if our search is for mathematical exactness. This is far from saying that it is to be rejected as irrelevant. None of the factors measuring this tax will answer to a test of certainty. Even where the business is kept within a single county, there is no certainty that a chain of thirty stores will so differ from one of fifty either in its method of organization or in the proportionate returns that the first should pay a tax at one rate for every store, and the second at another. The like is true where organization is affected by territorial expansion. There is a relation surpassing mere irrelevance between the essential character of the business and its territorial spread beyond the unit of its origin. Even if this is doubtful a priori, it is made apparent or probable by statistics and experience. A court will go no farther.\n What has been written has discovered differences between local chains and others, differences in organization at the center and in opportunity at the outer rim. The differences need not be great. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, at page 538 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. This is true even of the classes that may be described as primary, those accompanied by a division between a tax and no tax. It is true even more plainly of subclasses, the secondary divisions corresponding to graduations of the scale. How slight may be the variance that will mark a permissible classification between a tax and none at all has illustration in the case at hand. The prevailing opinion upholds the power of the state to discriminate between integrated and volun- \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 585]\n\u00a0\n tary chains, though the difference of organization is slender and the inequality of economic benefit uncertain and disputed. Slender though the difference of organization is, it is real enough to rescue classification from the reproach of an arbitrary preference. It will not do to shut one's eyes to the motive that has led so many Legislatures to lay hold of this difference and turn it into a basis for a new system of taxation. The system has had its origin in the belief that the social utility or inutility of one group is less or greater than that of others, and that the choice of subjects to be taxed should be adjusted to social gains and losses. Courts would be lacking in candor if they were not to concede the presence of such a motive behind this chain store legislation. But a purpose to bear more heavily on one class than another will not avail without more to condemn a tax as void. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, 30 S.Ct. 496; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 394\n, 52 S.Ct. 581; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, December 5, 1932. We must know why the discrimination is desired, to what end it is directed, and the relation between end and means. If the motive is vindictiveness, ensuing in mere oppression, the result may be one thing. If the motive and the end attained are the advancement of the public good, the result may be quite another, unless preference and repression go so far as to outrun the bounds of reason. The Legislature has determined with the approval of the court that an integrated chain is a taxable class separable from independent dealers and even from chains that are merely co-operative leagues. If these differences suffice to establish a basis for distinction between a tax and none at all, smaller differences may suffice for the graduation of the scale. The Legislature has found them in those variations of degree that separate a chain within the territorial unit of the locality from chains that are reaching out for wider fields of power. There is no need to approve or disapprove the concept of utility or inutility reflected in such laws. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n\n[288 U.S. 517, 586]\n\u00a0\n supra, at page 537 of \n283 U.S. 51\n S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. The concept may be right or wrong. At least it corresponds to an intelligible belief, and one widely prevalent to-day among honest men and women. Cf. Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606\n, 23 S.Ct. 168. With that our function ends.\n Systems of taxation are not framed, nor is it possible to frame them, with perfect distribution of benefit and burden. Their authors must be satisfied with a rough and ready form of justice. This is true in special measure while the workings of a novel method are untested by a rich experience. There must be advance by trial and error. Taxes upon chain stores are not exempt from these infirmities. To what extent there is a change of form and spirit when a business ceases to be local is not a question of law. O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., supra. In essence it is one of fact. There is a presumption that the Legislature did not ciassify along the lines of counties without study of the relevant data or without an informed and considered judgment. Its findings are not subject to annulment by a court unless facts within the range of judicial notice point to them as wrong. In discarding as arbitrary symbols the lines that it has chosen, there is danger of forgetting that in social and economic life the grooves of thought and action are not always those of logic, and that symbols may mean as much as conduct has put into them.\n Holding these views, I find it unnecessary to consider whether the statute may be upheld for the additional reasons that have been stated by Mr. Justice BRANDEIS with such a wealth of learning. They present considerations that were not laid before us by counsel either in the briefs or in the oral argument, and a determination of their validity and weight may be reserved with propriety until the necessity emerges.\n My vote is for affirmance.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice STONE concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n \"(8) Upon each store in excess of fifty, but not to exceed seventy- five stores, where all are located in any one county, the annual license fee shall be Thirty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\"(9) Upon each store in excess of fifty, but not to exceed seventy- five, where the same are located in different counties, the annual license fee shall be Forty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(10) Upon each store in excess of seventy-five, where all are located in any one county, the annual license fee shall be Forty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"(11) Upon each store in excess of seventy-five, where the same are located in different counties, the annual license fee shall be Fifty Dollars for each such additional store.\n\n\"In addition to the above amounts, Three Dollars for each and every One Thousand Dollars of value of stock carried in each store or for sale in such store.\" \n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In only nine states is state-wide branch banking permitted: Arizona, California, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Of these, all except South Carolina and Maryland require the authorization of the appropriate state officer. See Federal Reserve Bulletin, April, 1930, pp. 258-266; Id., July, 1932, pp. 455-458. Congress prohibited the establish of any branch national bank from 1863 to 1927; see First National Bank v. Missouri, \n263 U.S. 640\n, 656- 659, 44 S.Ct. 213. The law of that year authorized branches only within the same city; and only if the state laws so permitted. Act of February 25, 1927, 44 Stat. 1224, 1228, c. 191,  7 (12 USCA  36). Compare Resolution of February 25, 1933, c. 126 (12 USCA  1 note). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Joseph S. Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of American Corporations, Vol. II, pp. 16-18, 308-309 New York permitted incorporation under a general law for some business purposes in 1811. By 1850 a general law permitting incorporation for a limited business purpose had become common; and after 1875 extension of the privilege to every lawful business became so. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] It was doubtless because of this that the earlier statutes limited the life of corporations to fixed terms of 20, 30, or 50 years. See the statutes cited in subsequent notes.\n The power of Legislatures to grant special charters was sometimes strictly limited, even before the adoption of constitutional amendments withdrawing that power entirely. Thus the New York Constitution, adopted in convention in November, 1821, and by popular vote in January, 1822, required the assent of two-thirds of each house for any act 'creating, continuing, altering, or renewing any body politic or corporate'-article 7 ,  9; L. 1822-24, p.x. Similar provisions were included in the Delaware Constitution of 1831, art. 2,  17; in the Florida Constitution of 1838, art. 13,  2 (with an additional requirement of three months' public notice); and in the Michigan Constitution of 1835, art. 12,  2. The Rhode Island Constitution of 1842, art. 4,  17, required a bill for a corporate charter to be continued to the next Legislature. The Constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1848, provided that no act authorizing the formation of a corporation with banking powers should be effective unless ratified by popular vote-article 10,  5; and a similar provision was included in the Constitution of Wisconsin 1848, art. 11,  4, 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That the desire for equality and the dread of special privilege were largely responsible for the general incorporation laws is indicated by the fact that many states included in their constitutions a prohibition of the grant of special charters. The first constitutional provision requiring incorporation under general laws seems to be that in the New York Constitution of 1846, article 8,  1 (except where objects of incorporation were not thus attainable). Other states followed in later years.

And see the notes following. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Act of March 22, 1811, c. 67, limited the capital stock to $100, 000. The purposes for which corporations might be formed under this law were limited to the following: manufacturing woolen, cotton or linen goods; making glass; making, from ore, bar-iron, anchors, mill-irons, steel, nail rods, hoop iron, ironmongery, sheet lead, shot, white lead and red lead. The Act of April 14, 1817, c. 223, extended the purposes to include the manufacture of morocco and other leather; but for such objects the capital stock was not to exceed $60,000. Further limitations were added from time to time, with the general limitation of $100,000, or a lower limitation; as, for example, $50,000 for corporations manufacturing salt. L. 1821, c. 231,  19. The Act of 1852, c. 228, provided for the incorporation of companies for ocean navigation, and limited the authorized capital to $2, 000,000; this was increased to $4,000,000 by Act of 1853, c. 124; to $8, 000,000 by Act of 1866, c. 322; to $20,000,000 by Act of 1867, c. 419; and this was decreased to $4,000,000 by Act of 1875, c. 445. The Act of 1853, c. 117, provided for the incorporation of building companies, and set a maximum of $500,000; this was increased to $1,000,000 by Act of 1870, c. 773. The Act of 1854, c. 232, provided for the incorporation of companies to navigate lakes and rivers, and set a maximum of $1,000,000; this was increased to $2,000,000 by Act of 1865, c. 691. The Act of 1874, c. 143, provided for the incorporation of hotel companies, and set a maximum of $1, 000,000. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The General Business Corporation Act of 1875, c. 611,  11, set a maximum of $2,000,000. This was increased to $5,000,000 by Act of 1881, c. 295. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The first general act, May 15, 1851, c. 133, permitted incorporation for \"any kind of manufacturing, mechanical, mining or quarrying business.\" It limited the maximum to $200,000.

The act of May 9, 1870, c. 224 (Acts & Res. 1870, p. 154) repealed previous acts ( 69) and made more comprehensive provisions; cutting, storing and selling ice, or carrying on any agricultural, horticultural, mechanical, mining, quarrying or manufacturing business, printing and publishing -- a maximum of $500, 000 ( 2); cooperation in any of the above businesses and cooperative trade -- $50,000 ( 3); opening outlets, canals or ditches, propagation of herrings and alewives -- $5,000 ( 4); making and selling gas for light in cities or towns -- $500,000 ( 5); common carriage of goods -- $1,000,000 ( 6). Later acts provided for the manufacture and distribution of gas for steam, heat, power, and cooking; and for the furnishing of hydrostatic and pneumatic pressure. A maximum of $500,000 was prescribed. Acts of April 9, 1879, c. 202; May 15, 1885, c. 240; April 11, 1891, c. 189; May 27, 1893, c. 397. The same limit was prescribed for corporations to erect and maintain hotels, public halls, and buildings for manufacturing purposes. Acts of April 24, 1872, c. 244; March 9, 1888, c. 116. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The maximum limit was raised to $1,000,000 for manufacturing and mechanical business by Act of March 22, 1871, c. 110,  1; and for mining corporations by Act of May 3, 1875, c. 177,  3; and to $100,000 for cooperative trade by Act of April 11, 1879, c. 210. By Act of April 14, 1873, c. 179, the general act was extended to the common carriage of persons -- except by railroad -- and the limit of $1,000,000 was retained. The Act of April 14, 1874, c. 165, authorized incorporation for \"any lawful business,\" not specifically provided for, and limited the amount of stock to $1,000,000. The maximum limit for manufacturing and mechanical corporations was removed by Act of March 28, 1899, c. 199. For all the other corporate purposes, the limitations above-named remained until the passage of the Business Corporation Law, June 17, 1903, c. 437. By that time commissions with power to supervise the issues of public service corporations had long been established. Act of June 11, 1885, c. 314; Act of June 5, 1894, c. 450; Act of June 5, 1894 c. 452; Act of June 9, 1894, c. 462. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] For all except mechanical and manufacturing corporations, the limitations set out in notes 8 and 9, supra, remained until the passage of the Business Corporation Law, June 17, 1903, c. 437. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Act of April 22, 1905, No. 190, p. 280, amending Act of February 9, 1901, No. 1, p. 3,  1, 5 Purdon's Digest, 1905-1915 Supp. (13th Ed.), p. 5711 (15 PS  241). \n[\nFootnote 12\n] The first act passed in 1849, L. 1849, No. 368, p. 563, contained no limit.

In general, the objects or incorporation under these acts were limited to mining, manufacturing, mechanical, or chemical business; separate acts governed the formation of banking, insurance, and transportation companies. Authority to incorporate for mercantile business, where specifically provided, was given relatively late. E.g., Md. Laws 1894, c. 599; Tenn. Acts 1887, c. 139; Vt. Laws 1884, No. 105; compare Ind. Laws 1889, c. 81,  1.

Other states followed shortly. \n[\nFootnote 29\n] In 1903, almost half the states limited the duration of corporate existence to periods of from 20 to 50 years. See Report of the Committee on Corporation Laws of Massachusetts (1903) pp. 162-164. \n[\nFootnote 30\n] E.g., Calif. Civ. Code (1885)  285; Conn. Gen. Stat. (1888)  1944; Ill. Rev. Stat.

(1908) c. 85,  1750 (chief managing officer or superintendent must reside in state, except in case of interstate railroad). \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] The filing fees and franchise taxes are commonly measured by the authorized or issued stock. See National Industrial Conference Board, State and Local Taxation of Business Corporations (1931) Appendix B, pp. 138-159. And for the earlier laws, utilizing the same basis, see Report of the Massachusetts Committee on Corporation Laws (1903), pp. 265-288; House Committee on the District of Columbia, Report of Hearings of January 16, 1905, on H.R. 11811 and 12303, pp. 24-28 (Gov't Ptg. Office 1905). \n[\nFootnote 34\n] The traffic in charters quickly became widespread. In 1894 Cook on Stock and Stockholders (3d Ed.) Vol. 11, pp. 1604, 1605, thus described the situation: 'New Jersey is a favorite state for incorporations. Her laws seem to be framed with a special view to attracting incorporation fees and business fees from her sister states and especially from New York, across the river. She has largely succeeded in doing so, and now runs the state government very largely on revenues derived from New York enterprises. ... 'Maine formerly was a resort for incorporators, but a recent decision of its highest court holding stockholders liable on stock which has been issued for property, where the court thought the property was not worth the par value of the stock, makes Maine too dangerous a state to incorporate in, especially where millions of dollars of stock are to be issued for mines, patents and other choice assortments of property. ... 'West Virginia for the past ten years has been the Snug Harbor for roaming and piratical corporations. ... The manufacture of corporations for the purpose of enabling them to do all their business elsewhere seems to be the policy of this young but enterprising state. Its statutes seem to be expressly framed for that purpose. ...' In 1906 John S. Parker thus described the practice, in his volume Where and How-A Corporation Handbook (2d Ed.) p. 4: 'Many years ago the corporation laws of New Jersey were so framed as to invite the incorporation of companies by persons residing in other states and countries. The liberality and facility with which corporations could there be formed were extensively advertised, and a great volume of incorporation swept into that state. ... 'The policy of New Jersey proved profitable to the state, and soon legislatures of other states began active competition. ... 'Delaware and Maine also revised their laws, taking the New Jersey act as a model, but with lower organization fees and annual taxes. Arizona and South Dakota also adopted liberal corporation laws, and contenting themselves with the incorporation fees, require no annual state taxes whatever. 'West Virginia for many years has been popular with incorporators, but in 1901, in the face of the growing competition of other states, the legislature increased the rate of annual taxes.' And West Virginia thus lost her popularity. See Conyngton and Bennett, Corporation Procedure (Rev. Ed. 1927), p. 712. On the other hand, too drastic price cutting was also unprofitable. The bargain prices in Arizona and South Dakota attracted wild cat corporations. Investors became wary of corporations organized under the laws of Arizona or South Dakota and both states fell in disrepute among them and consequently among incorporators. See Conyngton on Corporate Organizations (1913) c. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] Thus, in an official pamphlet containing the corporation laws of Delaware (1901), the secretary of state wrote in the preface: 'It is believed that no state has on its statute books more complete and liberal laws than these'; and the outstanding advantages were then enumerated. See, also, a pamphlet 'Organization of Corporations,' issued by the Secretary of State of Maine in 1904. See, also, 'The General Corporation Act of New Jersey' (1898), edited by J. B. Dill, issued by the secretary of state: 'Since 1875 it has been the announced and settled policy of New Jersey to attract incorporated capital to the State. ...' P. xvii. And 'The General Corporation Laws of West Virginia' (1905), published by the secretary of state, containing, at pages 209, 210, a summary of the advantages of incorporating in West Virginia. For other examples, see Henry R. Seager and Charles A. Gulick, Jr., Trust and Corporation Problems ( 1929) c. 4. \n[\nFootnote 37\n] A change in the policy of New Jersey was urged by Woodrow Wilson in his inaugural address as Governor. 'If I may speak very plainly, we are much too free with grants of charters to corporations in New Jersey. A corporation exists, not of natural right, but only by license of law, and the law, if we look at the matter in good conscience, is responsible for what it creates. ... I would urge, therefore, the imperative obligation of public policy and of public honesty we are under to effect such changes in the law of the State as will henceforth effectually prevent the abuse of the privilege of incorporation which has in recent years brought so much discredit upon our State. ... If law is at liberty to adjust the general conditions of society itself, it is at liberty to control these great instrumentalities which nowadays, in so large part, determine the character of society.' Minutes of Assembly of New Jersey, January 17, 1911, pp. 65, 69; reprinted in Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson (Ed. by Baker and Dodd) Vol. II, pp. 273, 274, 275. In 1913 the so-called 'Seven-Sisters' Acts were passed by New Jersey, forbidding, among other things, intercorporate stockholding. Laws 1913, c. 18. These, in turn, were repealed in 1917. Laws 1917, c. 195 (Comp. St. Supp.  47-176 et seq.). The report recommending the repeal stated: 'Those laws now sought to be repealed are harmful to the State because there is much uncertainty as to their meaning, with the result that those who would have otherwise incorporated here or remained here are going to other States. There is no gain to the people of the country, but this State loses a revenue which is perfectly legitimate. We doubt not that much of the adverse criticism outside of the State which was directed against New Jersey and its corporation laws prior to 1913 was due as much to the desire to divert the organization of corporations to other States as it was to prevent evils which might have arisen, and New Jersey fell for the criticism. To whatever cause may be attributed the loss of revenue to the State, it is plain that it is a condition and not a theory which confronts the State, as the following figures will show: ... Such losses mean a serious depletion of the revenues of the State, and, unless a different policy is pursued, it will not be long before the corporation business of the State will have been reduced to a minimum. We believe such conditions justify the appointment of the Commission and will also justify the Legislature in adopting the result of our investigation and embodied in the proposed revision.' Report of the Commission to Revise the Corporation Laws of New Jersey, 1917, pp. 7, 8. \n For more recent movements, see A. A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932) p. 206, n. 18: 'As significant of the trend towards that corporate mechanism with the broades powers to the management, it is interesting to note the steady trend towards the states having a loose incorporation law. Of the 92 holding corporations mentioned above (those whose securities were listed on the New York Stock Exchange and were active in 1928) 44 were organized in Delaware, all of them being formed since 1910. Indeed, of the 44 holding corporations now chartered in that state, 25 were incorporated there between the years 1925 and 1928. In the less liberal New York State 13 of the above holding companies were formed, 6 of them having been chartered between 1910 and 1920, while only 4 were formed since 1920. Ten of the holding companies were chartered in Maryland, one in 1920 and the remaining 9 between 1923 and 1928, presumably in large measure as a result of the looseness of the Maryland corporation law of 1923. New Jersey, a relatively popular state at the turn of the century shows only two of the holding company charters granted there since 1910; while Virginia shows 7 such charters.\n'Combined holding and operating corporations likewise show a steady trend towards Delaware. Of the whole list, 148 of the 573 corporations hold Delaware charters, most of them relatively recent; New York is second with 121, most of them relatively old; New Jersey third with 87, most of which grow out of the great merger period from 1898-1910.'\n\n Corporations formed in one state by citizens of another state, to do business in the state of their residence, were frequently subjected to collateral attack. Generally the courts felt bound to uphold the corporate status. See the cases in J. H. Sears, The New Place of the Stockholder ( 1929) Appendix G. Occasionally, however, states legislated against the practice. Thus California enacted that the statutory liability of stockholders should apply to those in foreign as well as in domestic corporations. In two cases where the foreign corporation was organized specifically to do business in California, this provision was held applicable. Pinney v. Nelson, \n183 \nU.S. 144\n, 22 S.Ct. 52; Thomas v. Matthiessen, \n232 \nU.S. 221\n, 34 S.Ct. 312. And more recently this Court has sustained a constitutional provision of Virginia which prohibits foreign public service companies from doing an intrastate business in the state. Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, \n282 \nU.S. 440\n, 51 S.Ct. 201. The provision was adopted in the light of widespread incorporation of such companies in West Virginia and New Jersey. See Debates of Constitutional Convenion of Virginia, 1901-1902, Vol. II, p. 2811. \n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] One corporation was allowed to hold stock in others so long as the latter were engaged in manufacturing materials, etc., necessary for the former; and in others, which used products of the former. Business Corporation Law, 1890, c. 567,  12. \n[\nFootnote 39\n] Sec note 34, supra. \n[\nFootnote 40\n] See Report of N.Y. Joint Committee on Trusts, March 9, 1897, 120th Sess., Sen. Doc. No. 30, pp. 3, 4: 'When in 1890 the Court of Appeals in this State pronounced its final judgment against the system of trust organization then in vogue (People of New York v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 121 N.Y. 582, 24 N.E. 834, 9 L.R.A. 33, 18 Am.St.Rep. 843), the 'trust' became a thing of the past, existing trust agreements were dissolved and under the permission of existing laws the constituent elements held together under such agreements, became incorporated in the State of New Jersey and in other jurisdictions, where, either by accident or by design, the law of incorporation was so adjusted that by the simplest formality a trust declared unlawful and a conspiracy against public welfare might continue its career. ...\n'The corporation laws of the State of New York at that time differed essentially from the laws of the State of New Jersey in that they did not, as did the latter, permit the acquisition by one corporation of the capital stock of another, and consequently there followed an immediate migration of trusts to the State of New Jersey to secure corporate charters there and thus avoid complications in which the decision of the Court of Appeals threatened to involve them.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] See Moody, The Truth About the Trusts, p. 453. Of the 298 corporations listed as 'lesser industrial trusts,' 150 had New Jersey charters. Id. pp. 454-467. \n[\nFootnote 46\n] Edward K.

The Governor of Michigan, in his Message to the Legislature in 1921, said of the corporation laws of that state: 'Because of their inadequacy to meet modern needs and requirements, and the failure to accord domestic corporations the same rights granted to those organized outside of the state, most of our business corporations are being organized in other states, only to return here as foreign corporations.' Journal of House of Representatives of Michigan, 1921, pp. 31, 37; reprinted in Messages of the Governors of Michigan (Michigan Historical Commission, 1927) vol. 4, pp. 775, 784. In 1921 the corporation laws of Michigan were revised, eliminating, among other things, the maximum limitation on capital stock. See note 20, supra.\n The effect of the policy of West Virginia was described by President Henry M. Russell in an address before the West Virginia Bar Association in 1891. In the six years ending January 1, 1889, he stated, 330 charters were issued by the state to corporations having their principal places of business elsewhere. Of these, 101 were to be in the District of Columbia, and 65 in New York. 'The neighboring State of Pennsylvania has adopted very stringent laws for the government of its corporations. ... So our Pennsylvania friends who have patent rights or gold mines, come to West Virginia. ... Of our 330 corporations, 80 were to have their principal offices in Pennsylvania. Our other neighbor, the State of Ohio, carries upon its statute book a law imposing a double liability on the stockholders for the debts of the corporation ... and 30 out of the 330 have their principal offices in Ohio. Thus 284 of the 330 are found in the cities of Washington and New York and the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio . ... It is unjust to our sister States.' 27 American Law Review, p. 105. \n[\nFootnote 50\n] Adolf A. Berle, Jr., and Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932).

Nichols, Chain Store Manual (1932) c. 5.\n The plaintiffs insist that no taxable difference exists between the owner of multiple stores and the owner of an individual store. A short answer to the contention has already been given, so far as required for the decision of this case. It is that the license fee is not merely taxation. The fee is the compensation exacted for the privilege of carrying on intrastate business in corporate form. As this privilege is one which a state may withhold or grant, it may charge such compensation as it pleases. Nothing in the Federal Constitution requires that the compensation demanded for the privilege should be reasonable. Moreover, since the authority to operate many stores, or to operate in two or more counties, is certainly a broader privilege than to operate only one store, or in only one county, there is in this record no basis for a finding that it is unreasonable to make the charge higher for the greater privilege.\n A more comprehensive answer should, however, be given. The purpose of the Florida statute is not, like ordinary taxation, merely to raise revenue. Its main purpose is social and economic. The chain store is treated as a thing menacing the public welfare. The aim of the statute, at the lowest, is to preserve the competition of the \n\n[\nFootnote 62\n] Indeed, it has been urged that the taxation of the states and the nation should be framed not with a view solely to the raising of revenue, but always for the purpose of promoting that social policy which the people deem wise. \n\n[\nFootnote 63\n] See the statutes cited in Quaker City Cab Co. v.

UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 322\nArgued: Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Guy Patten, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether the petitioner, a Massachusetts life insurance company operating on the mutual level premium plan, is entitled, under section 245 of \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n the Revenue Act of 1926,1 to deduct from its gross income, as interest paid, the amount of interest credited to its policyholders during the taxable year, but not withdrawn by them.\n Petitioner agrees to repay a portion of its receipts to policyholders in the form of dividends. The policies provide that these dividends, when declared, may at the option of the insured by withdrawn in cash, applied as premium payments, or allowed to remain on deposit with the company at interest. If the last alternative be chosen, the dividends and interest accumulate; interest being added to the accumulated sum at the end of each policy year. The dividends and all accrued interest thereon may be withdrawn at any time on demand. Of the total which became due policyholders in 1926 as interest on sums so left with the company, $544, 964.40, the portion not withdrawn, was credited in appropriate amounts to the individual accounts of the policyholders during that year. In its tax return the petitioner deducted as interest paid the amount so credited. Interest actually withdrawn during 1926 totaled $248,405.97, some of which was credited to the policyholders in that year, but the greater portion of which had accrued prior to 1926, and had been credited in the respective years of accrual. No deduction was taken for this sum. The Commissioner disallowed the claimed deduction, and allowed in lieu thereof the amount of interest actually withdrawn in 1926. The resulting additional tax was paid under protest, a claim for refund filed, and, the Commissioner having failed to act upon the claim, suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. That court dismissed the petition,2 and we brought the case here by certiorari \n287 \nU.S. 591\n, 53 S.Ct. 115, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The earlier Revenue Acts made no distinction, in the method of computing the tax, between insurance com- \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n panies and other corporations. The act of 1921 and those subsequently adopted embodied special and separate provisions respecting such companies. 3 In the act of 1926, with which we are here concerned, the applicable sections are 242 to 247, inclusive (26 USCA  1001 note, and  1002 et seq .), the first four dealing with life companies. Section 244 (26 USCA  1003) defines gross income as the amount received during the taxable year from interest, dividends, and rents. Section 245 (26 USCA  1004, 1005) defines net income as the gross income, less certain enumerated deductions. Subdivision (a), paragraph (8), 26 USCA  1004(a)(8), permits deduction of: 'All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities ... the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this chapter.'\n The language of paragraph (8) with respect to interest paid or accrued on indebtedness is precisely the same as the employed with respect to deductions allowed to individuals by section 214(a)(2), 26 USCA  955(a)( 2)4 and to corporations by section 234(a)(2), 26 USCA  986(a)(2).5 Section 200(d), 26 USCA  931(d)6 enacts that 'the terms 'paid or incurred' and 'paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed under section 953 or 984 (212 or 232). ...' The sections mentioned are those applicable to individuals and to corporations generally; neither deals with insurance companies, which, as above said, are treated exclusively in sections 242 to 247, inclusive.\n In the light of these provisions the petitioner insists that insurance companies are forbidden by the terms of the statute to keep their accounts and make their returns by the accrual method, but must report on the cash basis. \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n Hence it is claimed the words 'paid or accrued,' as applied to interest, cannot grant an option in the matter of returns, depending upon whether the insurance company keeps its accounts on a cash basis or on an accrual basis, as in the case of other taxpayers, since the company has no choice in this respect; that the word 'accrued' cannot be read out of the statute or left without meaning or effect; and that the phrase is employed to describe and allow deduction of interest accrued on dividends left with the company.\n The government replies that prior to 1921 there was no statutory direction as to how insurance companies' returns should be made; a regulation required them to be upon the cash basis; when new sections were inserted in the act of 1921 as to insurance companies, the phraseology with respect to interest deductions of individuals and corporations generally was lifted bodily out of the sections applicable to individuals and corporations and inserted in these new sections; as the act does not permit insurance companies to account on the accrual basis, only interest paid is deductible, and the term 'accrued' has no application. It further points to a regulation adopted immediately upon the passage of the act of 1921 and carried forward in the regulations under the Acts of 1924 and 1926. This regulation is:7\n'The deduction allowed by section 245(a)(8) for interest on indebtedness is the same as that allowed other corporations by section 234( a)(2) (see articles 561 and 121), but this deduction includes item 18 of the disbursement page of the annual statement of life companies to the extent that interest on dividends held on deposit and surrendered during the taxable year is included therein.'\n\n Item 18 of the disbursement page of the annual statement of insurance companies includes the amount of in- \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n terest actually paid policyholders, whereas accrued interest credited and not withdrawn is shown in term 22 on page 5 of the standard form of report. Insurance companies have without exception complied with the regulation and taken a deduction only for interest paid. The right to deduct interest credited to policyholders but not withdrawn is now asserted for the first time.\n The Congress in the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932 re-enacted section 245 without alteration. \n8\n This action was taken with knowledge of the construction placed upon the section by the official charged with its administration. If the legislative body had considered the Treasury interpretation erroneous, it would have amended the section. Its failure so to do requires the conclusion that the regulation was not inconsistent with the intent of the statute (National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 40 S.Ct. 237; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 116\n, 51 S.Ct. 58; McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510; Costanzo v. Tillinghast, \n287 \nU.S. 341\n, 53 S.Ct. 152), unless, perhaps, the language of the act is unambiguous and the regulation clearly inconsistent with it. Compare Louisville & N.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740, 757\n, 758 S., 51 S.Ct. 297. The petitioner insists that the statute needs no interpretation and its plain mandate should be enforced. But on examination the proper application of the section is not so clear as is claimed.\n The regulations of the Treasury under all the Revenue Acts since 1916 have required taxpayers to report on the cash or accrual basis, depending on which method was pursued in their accounting. \n9\n Since the adoption of the Revenue Act of 1921, the requirement has been statutory. It is settled beyond cavil that taxpayers other than insurance companies may not accrue receipts and treat \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n expenditures on a cash basis, or vice versa. Nor may they accrue a portion of income and deal with the remainder on a cash basis, nor take deductions partly on one and partly on the other basis. Congress, we think, did not intend to make an exception of insurance companies. If they are not allowed to account on an accrual basis for interest owed them, there is no reason for permitting them to treat interest owed by them on any different basis. The very paragraph (8) on which petitioner relies as defining interest credited but not paid, by the use of the word 'accrued,' recognizes that insurance companies may have indebtedness of other sorts, such as that arising from borrowings to carry securities. Since the company is required to treat interest received on a cash basis, it ought not have the privilege of accruing interest owed. That privilege must be accorded, if petitioner is right. We think the result would be unreasonable and is not intended by the act.\n We are referred to a regulation which provides: 'Income which is credited to the account of or set apart for a taxpayer and which may be drawn upon by him at any time is subject to tax for the year during which so credited or set apart, although not then actually reduced to possession.' 10 It is argued that the regulation requires the policyholder to report interest credited to him as received in the year of credit. The conclusion drawn is that, if the credit is income to the insured, it must constitute a 'constructive payment' by the company. In this view, the transaction is said to come within the term 'paid,' and we may disregard the word 'accrued.' This regulation has, however, not been applied in any case where income has been credited to another by a taxpayer employing the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting; and specifically it has not been invoked to require policyholders to report as income the dividends or interest credited to them in cases such as this. No tax is de- \n\n[288 U.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n manded of them until actual receipt of the money. The constructive payment theory is, we think, untenable.\n We conclude Congress did not intend by the use of the word 'accrued' in section 245(a)(8) to permit the deduction of interest on policy dividends credited but not paid during the taxable year.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 9, 47 (26 USCA  1004, 1005). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] (Ct.

Roger Englar and Henry M. Longley, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. John W. Griffin, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The assignee of cargo owners filed libels against the respondent, the owner of the Isis, to recover moneys deposited as security for general average contributions, the deposit being exacted by the respondent as a condition of delivery.\n The Isis, a vessel of about 7,000 tons, sailed from loading ports on the Pacific Coast with cargo destined for Bremen, Hamburg and Antwerp. She was then seaworthy in hull and gear, and fitted in all respects for the intended voyage. In the Weser river, not far from Bremen, Germany, her first port of discharge, she stranded by reason of negligent \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 340]\n\u00a0\n navigation with damage to her rudder stock and also to the rudder blade. Aided by tugs, she continued up the river to Bremen, disclosing, as she moved, a tendency to sheer to starboard. On arrival at that port, she discharged her Bremen cargo, and there was then an inspection of the damage. The rudder stock had been twisted about 45 degrees. To ascertain the condition of the blade, the vessel was put in a dry dock and kept there a few hours. The examiners reported that the blade was intact. In fact, the lower part of it was bent to starboard to the extent of about five degrees. The inspection was after dark with the bottom of the rudder still under water. The two courts below have concurred in a finding that the use of reasonable care would have caused the bend to be discovered.\n The head office of the owner at Hamburg was notified of the mishap to the vessel before she landed at Bremen, and the marine superintendent was sent to meet her. The superintendent, Reichenbacher, and the master of the vessel, Krueger, consulted, along with others, as to what ought to be done. Bremen had adequate facilities for the making of complete repairs, but it would have taken about two weeks to make them. To save time and expense to the vessel and her cargo, the decision was made to send her to Hamburg about seventy miles away, the cargo still aboard. Before a start was made, the rudder was lashed amidships so as to be incapable of motion. The vessel then set forth in the towage of three tugs, one of them in front, and one on either side. No harm befell for a distance of about six miles. Then, at or near the junction of the Weser and Lesum Rivers, the pilot in control changed her course to starboard in order to pass a vessel coming up. There is a finding that her navigation at this point was unskillful and negligent, in that she was driven at too high a speed and too close to the edge of the channel. At all events, in passing she made a sheer to star- \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 341]\n\u00a0\n board which the tugs and her engines were unable to control. She was stranded hard and fast amidships on a sand spit near the bank.\n With the aid of tugs and lighters the vessel and the cargo were brought back to Bremen, where the new damage was repaired. It was in the course of these repairs that the bend in the rudder was observed. \n1\n In the meantime the entire cargo was transshipped to Antwerp. Before delivery at destination, the respondent made demand of the consignees that they deposit sums of cash as security for the payment of general average contributions to the sacrifices and expenses due to the two strandings. The bills of lading contain what is known as the Jason clause (The Jason, \n225 \nU.S. 32, 49\n, 32 S.Ct. 560) whereby the consignees agree that, if the shipowner has used due diligence to make the ship seaworthy, the cargo is to be liable in general average when the sacrifice or expense results from negligent navigation. The form of the clause applicable to nearly all the shipments is stated in the margin. \n2\n For a small part of the shipments the form is slightly different, but no point is made that there is any difference of meaning. \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 342]\n\u00a0\n Under these clauses the consignees do not dispute the liability of the cargo for general average contributions in respect of the first standing. They do dispute the liability in respect of the second. To recover their deposits to the amount of that excess, they transferred their claims to an assignee by whom five libels, afterwards consolidated, were filed against the owner. The District Court, confirming the report of a commissioner, gave judgment for the defendant. 57 F.(2d) 265. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (63 F.(2d) 248), though in so doing it did not agree with all the findings below. The libelant, May, joined the stipulators for costs (Indemnity Insurance Company of North America and Royal Indemnity Company) in a petition to review the decree of affirmance. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n\n 1. \nThe first question to be determined is whether the cargo must contribute to the sacrifices and expenses resulting from the second stranding if there was a negligent failure by the shipowner to make the ship seaworthy when she left her dock at Bremen.\n Until the enactment of the Harter Act (February 13, 1893, c. 105,  3, 27 Stat. 445, 46 U.S.C.  192 (46 USCA  192)), a shipowner was not at liberty by any contract with the shipper to rid himself of liability to the owners of the cargo for damages resulting from the negligence of the master or the crew. Liverpool & G. W. Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 343]\n\u00a0\n \n129 \nU.S. 397, 438\n, 9 S.Ct. 469; The Delaware, \n161 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 16 S.Ct. 516; The Jason, supra, 225 U.S. page 49, 32 S. Ct. 560; The Willdomino (C.C.A.) 300 F. 5, 9. Section 3 of the Harter Act3 was the grant of a new immunity. Neither the vessel nor her owner was to be liable thereafter for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in management, if the owner had complied with a prescribed condition. The condition was that he must have exercised due diligence to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied. If that condition was not fulfilled, there was liability for negligence in accordance with the ancient rule. Release from liability for negligence when effected by the act did not mean, however, that an obligation was laid upon the cargo to contribute to general average. The Irrawaddy, \n171 \nU.S. 187\n, 18 S.Ct. 831. To create that obligation there was need of an agreement. For a time there was doubt whether such an agreement, if made, would be consistent with public policy. The doubt was dispelled by the decision in The Jason, supra. 'In our opinion, so far as the Harter act has relieved the shipowner from responsibility for the negligence of his master and crew, it is no longer against the policy of the law for \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 344]\n\u00a0\n him to contract with the cargo owners for a participation in general average contribution growing out of such negligence; and since the clause contained in the bills of lading of the Jason's cargo admits the shipowner to share in the general average only under circumstances where by the act he is relieved from responsibility, the provision in question is valid, and entitles him to contribution under the circumstances stated.' Id., 225 U.S. page 55, 32 S.Ct. 560, 564.\n The Isis being seaworthy when she broke ground in the Pacific, the cargo was under a duty to contribute to the expenses of the first stranding, which occurred as the result of faulty navigation before the arrival of the ship at Bremen. Neither here nor it the courts below has there been any contention to the contrary. Whether a like duty existed in respect of the expenses of the second stranding is not so easily determined. The only negligence for which immunity is given by section 3 of the Harter Act is negligence in the navigation or management of the ship. The Carib Prince, \n170 \nU.S. 655, 661\n, 662 S., 18 S.Ct. 753; International Navigation Co. v. Farr & Bailey Mfg. Co., \n181 \nU.S. 218\n, 21 S.Ct. 591. If the master of the Isis had acted on his own responsibility at Bremen in sending the vessel on, the fault would have been negligence in management, or so we may assume. But that is not what happened. The owner intervened by its marine superintendent, who was sent from Hamburg to Bremen to inspect the disabled vessel and determine what to do. He consulted with the master and others. The decision in the end was his. This he tells us very frankly. If reasonable diligence would have shown that the vessel was unseaworthy when he sent her on her way, there was something more than an error in navigation or management on the part of master or of crew. There was a failure by an owner to fulfill the condition on which immunity depended.\n We do not forget that seaworthiness is determined for many purposes according to the state of things existing at \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 345]\n\u00a0\n the beginning of the voyage. This is true of a warranty of seaworthiness in charter parties or in contracts of affreightment. The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199, 210\n, 14 S.Ct. 823; The Caledonia (C.C.) 43 F. 681, 685; Id., \n157 \nU.S. 124, 130\n, 15 S.Ct. 537; Earle & Stoddart v. Ellerman's Wilson Line, \n287 \nU.S. 420, 426\n, 53 S.Ct. 200; McFadden v. Blue Star Line, (1905) 1 K.B. 697, 703. It is true of the like warranty in contracts of marine insurance. Union Ins. Co. v. Smith, \n124 \nU.S. 405, 427\n, 8 S.Ct. 534; Smith v. Northwestern Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 246 N.Y. 349, 359, 363, 364, 159 N.E. 87. But the provisions of the Harter Act relieving an owner from liability to the cargo for errors of management of navigation do not charge him with a warranty. What they say to him is this, that if he wishes the immunity he may have it, but only upon terms. He must do what in him lies by the exertion of due diligence to make the vessel safe and sound. If the management of the ship is in the hands of master and crew, he will be relieved of liability for supervening losses, provided only that his own duty has been fulfilled at the beginning. If the term of management is over and the ship is in his hands again, the duty is renewed.\n The question then is when management begins and ends. Iron shutters are left open through the negligence of the crew while the ship is in a heavy sea. Liability for the damage will not be chargeable to the owner, for this is a fault of management. The Silvia, \n171 \nU.S. 462\n, 19 S.Ct. 7. Upon arrival at a port of call, the master is negligent in his inspection of the ship or its equipment. Liability for the damage will not be chargeable to the owner, for this again is a fault of management. The Steel Navigator (C.C.A.) 23 F.(2d) 590; The Milwaukee Bridge (C.C.A.) 26 F.(2d) 327, 330; United States v. New York & O.S.S. Co. (C.C.A.) 216 F. 61, 71; Jay Wai Nam v. AngloAm. Oil Co. (C.C.A.) 202 F. 822; The Guadeloupe (D.C.) 92 F. 670. Cf. Carver on Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.)  103e, collating the decisions. Arrived at destination, the engineer omits to close a valve, with resulting \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 346]\n\u00a0\n damage to the cargo. Once more, liability for the damage will not be chargeable to the owner, for this again is management. The Wildcroft, \n201 \nU.S. 378\n, 26 S.Ct. 467. One has only to sketch these situations in order to perceive the gap dividing them from that before us here. Here is a case where master and crew have surrendered their management and have made appeal to the owner to resume control himself. Response to that appeal destroys the continuity of the voyage, as if it were broken into stages. Cf. Arnould, Marine Insurance (11th Ed.) vol. 2 ,  699, 700, 701; Greenock S.S. Co. v. Maritime Ins., (1903) 2 K.B. 657. An owner intervening in such circumstances must be diligent in inspection or forfeit his immunity. Negligence at such a time is not the fault of servants employed to take the owner's place for the period of a voyage. It is the fault of the owner personally, exercising his own judgment to determine whether the voyage shall go on. The Waalhaven (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 706, 709.\n\n 2. \nDue diligence being necessary to make the ship seaworthy at Bremen as well as at the Pacific ports, the second question to be determined is whether due diligence was used.\n The District Court and the commissioner found that the Isis, though crippled when she left the dock at Bremen, was seaworthy with the aid of tugs for the voyage then before her. Seaworthiness, it is well known, is a relative term. The Sagamore (C.C.A.) 300 F. 701, 704; Carver, Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.)  18, and cases cited; Arnould, Marine Insurance (11th Ed.)  710. The Court of Appeals held the view, according to our reading of the opinion, that the vessel with her rudder disabled and defective was not so fitted for her voyage as to cast upon the cargo the risk of faults of navigation.\n The respondent, claiming the benefit of a conditional exemption, has the burden of proof that the condition was fulfilled. The Southwark, \n191 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 24 S.Ct. 1; The Wildcroft, \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 347]\n\u00a0\n supra, 201 U.S. at page 386, 26 S.Ct. 467. We are unwilling to say in opposition to the finding of the Court of Appeals that the burden has been borne. The fact is undisputed that the rudder, being disabled, was useless as an instrument to control the movement of the vessel. There is evidence that, in addition to being useless, it was positively harmful by reason of a bend to starboard. These two defects together defeat the carrier's endeavor to shift the risk upon the cargo.\n The respondent insists that a vessel may be seaworthy though she is navigated by tugs. No doubt that is true where the rudder is capable of use. This is far from saying that the risk to the cargo is not appreciably increased if the rudder is out of commission and so incapable of giving aid when an emergency arises. There is no need to go beyond the pages of this record for proof that this is so. Witnesses for the respondent tell us that a vessel with her rudder lashed may be towed without risk if the speed of the tugs is slow, less than seven kilometers an hour. They admit that useless rudder becomes a source of danger if the speed of the tugs is higher, seven kilometers or more. We turn to the findings of the commissioner approved by the District Court. From these it appears that the Isis was proceeding, when she sighted the up-bound steamer, at a speed of more than eight kilometers an hour. Not only that, but the commissioner has found that she was navigated at too high a speed and too close to the edge of the channel, and that because of these errors she tranded a second time. The speed and the place would in all likelihood have been harmless if she had been navigating the river with her steering gear in order. The carrier sent her forward with her steering gear crippled when there was opportunity to make it sound. No doubt there are occasions when owner and master are left without a choice. The vessel may be disabled at a place where the making of repairs is impossible or unreasonably difficult. \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 348]\n\u00a0\n In such circumstances she must go her way with such help as can be gathered. Her no emergency was present to excuse the decision that was made. The carrier would have had no difficulty in making the repairs at Bremen. The risks of navigation that are cast by statute upon the owners of the cargo are those that remain after the carrier has done his duty. They do not include risks that would have been avoided or diminished if the vessel had gone out with her equipment staunch and sound. A carrier who chooses for his own purposes to send out a crippled ship with needless enlargement of the perils of navigation will not receive exemption at the cost of the owners of the cargo if the perils thus enlarged have brought the ship upon the sands. 'When the owner accepts cargo in an unseaworthy ship, though the defect be such as may be neutralized by care, he imposes on the shipper an added risk; not merely that his servants may fail, in so far as she is sound and fit, but that they may neglect those added precautions which her condition demands. That risk the statute does not impose upon the shipper; he bears no loss until the owner has done his best to remove all risks except those inevitable upon the seas.' Learned Hand, J., in The Elkton (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 700, 701.\n The rudder, however, was not merely useless and disabled. By reason of the bend of five degrees, it was positively harmful at least to some extent. Reichenbacher, the marine superintendent, stated in his testimony that he would never have let the vessel leave the dock at Bremen if he had known of the bend. Krueger, the master, testified to the same effect. The commissioner put aside these admissions with the remark that the witnesses 'overdid an effort to establish a character for caution.' He preferred to accept the testimony of Capt. Davis, a tried and efficient wreck master in the harbor of New York, who testified as an expert without personal experience of the navigation of the Weser. Capt. Davis \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 349]\n\u00a0\n stated that a bend of fifteen degrees would surely have been dangerous, that there would probably have been danger in a bend of ten degrees, but that a bend of five degrees would not prevent the ship from being under command, particularly if the ship was going at a low speed. At the same time he admitted that even a five degree bend would affected the ship to some extent, and that it would be very important and valuable to know of its existence. Such testimony is far from convincing in the face of the admissions of the superintendent and the master, who had every motive to present the case in the way most helpful to the owner. The argument is pressed that, if the bend of five degrees had a tendency to sheer the ship to starboard, the movement should have been felt during the six miles traveled before the second stranding. We follow the courts below in their finding that the sheering was not observed, though there is evidence to the contrary. Even so, the movement may have been so counteracted by the engines of the vessel and the tugs that little heed was given it. In any event, the significant fact remains that there is no finding by any court that the bend in the rudder did not affect the steering of the Isis at the moment of the stranding. The commissioner found that the vessel did not have any 'marked tendency to sheer,' and that, if such a tendency existed, the power of her engines and the tugs was adequate to correct it. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the bend would not affect the steering 'except to a slight extent.'\n We think the cumulative effect of the evidence that the rudder was disabled and that there was a bend of five degrees is to exact of us a holding that the respondent has failed to sustain the burden of establishing due diligence in making the ship seaworthy for her voyage down the Weser.\n\n 3. \nIf due diligence was not used in creating a seaworthy condition, the third question to be determined is the need \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 350]\n\u00a0\n of a causal relation between the defect and the ensuing loss.\n The District Court and the Court of Appeals, though at odds with each other as to the seaworthy condition of the vessel when it left the dock at Bremen, are at one in finding that the cause of the stranding was faulty navigation. Cf. Orient Mut. Ins. Co. v. Adams, \n123 \nU.S. 67, 72\n, 8 S.Ct. 68; Queen Ins. Co. v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 487, 492\n, 44 S.Ct. 175; The Manitoba (D.C.) 104 F. 145, 154, 155.\n Whether a shipowner who negligently omits to make his vessel seaworthy may have the benefit, none the less, of section 3 of the Harter Act (46 USCA  192), if there is no causal relation between the defect and the disaster, is a question as to which the Circuit Courts of Appeal in different circuits, and even at times in the same circuit, are divided into opposing camps, though the discord in many instances is the outcome of dicta rather than decisions.\n Favoring the view that the benefit of the act is lost without reference to any causal relation between the defect and the disaster are The Elkton, supra, 49 F.(2d) page 701 (C.C.A., Second Circuit); Louis- Dreyfus & Co. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd. (1933) 67 F.(2d) 331 (C.C.A., Second Circuit); The Willdomino, 300 F. 5, 10, 11 (C.C.A., Third Circuit), affirmed on other grounds in \n272 \nU.S. 718\n, 47 S.Ct. 261; The R. P. Fitzgerald, 212 F. 678 (C.C.A., Sixth Circuit); also the following decisions of District Courts: The River Meander, 209 F. 931, 937; Merklen v. Johnson & Higgins, 3 F.Supp. 897; The Indien, 5 F.Supp. 349, 1933 A.M.C. 1342. Favoring the other view are Hartford & N.Y. Transportation Co. v. Rogers & Hubbard Co. (The Spartan), 47 F.(2d) 189, 192 (C.C.A., Second Circuit); Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Atlantic Transport Co., 25 F.(2d) 739 ( D.C. Cal.); and cf. The Turret Crown, 284 F. 439, 444, 445 (C.C.A., Fourth Circuit); The Thessaloniki, 267 F. 67, 70 (C.C.A., Second Circuit). \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 351]\n\u00a0\n We think the rulings and dicta of the cases in the first group are supported by the better reasons.\n The statute, aided by the contract, gives the shipowner a privilege upon his compliance with a condition. If he would have the benefit of the privilege, he must taken it with the attendant burden. There would be no end to complications and embarrassments if the courts were to embark upon an inquiry as to the tendency of an unseaworthy defect to aggravate the risk of careless navigation. Little can be added on this point to what has been said so well by Learned Hand, J., in a case already cited. The Elkton, supra. The barrier of the statute would be sufficient, if it stood alone, to overcome the claim of privilege. It is reinforced, however, by the barrier of contract. The Harter Act, as we have seen, would not impose upon the cargo a duty to share in general average contribution if the Jason clause or an equivalent were not embodied in the bill of lading or contract of affreightment. The owners of this cargo have stated the conditions on which they are willing to come in and pay their share of the expenses. A court should be very sure that the literal meaning is not the true one before subtracting from conditions that are clear upon their face.\n We are told that the provisions of the Harter Act (46 USCA  190-195) will lead to absurdity and hardship if an unseaworthy condition is to take away from the carrier an exemption from liability for the negligence of its servants in the management of the vessel without a causal relation between the defect and the disaster. Extreme illustrations are set before us, as where there is a loose rivet in the deck, or a crack in a hatch cover, or one less messboy than required. Seaworthiness of the vessel becomes, it is said, a whimsical condition if exemption is lost through defects so unsubstantial. We assume for present purposes that the nature of the defects brought forward as illustrations is \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 352]\n\u00a0\n sufficient to condemn a vessel as unfitted for her voyage. Even if that be so, the argument for the respondent loses sight of the value of a uniform rule that will put an end to controversy where the causal relation is uncertain or disputed. Particularly is there need of such a test where the carrier asks to be relieved from liability for conduct which without the benefit of the statute would be an actionable wrong. The maritime law abounds in illustrations of the forfeiture of a right or the loss of a contract by reason of the unseaworthiness of a vessel, though the unseaworthy feature is unrelated to the loss. The law reads into a voyage policy of insurance a warranty that the vessel shall be seaworthy for the purpose of the voyage. There are many cases to the effect that, irrespective of any relation of cause and effect, the breach of the warranty will vitiate the policy. What is implied is a condition, and not merely a covenant, just as here there is not a covenant, but a condition of exemption. See Smith v. Northwestern Fire & Marine Insurance Co., supra, 246 N.Y. at page 363, 159 N.E. 87, summarizing the following decisions. Thus, in DeHahn v. Hartley, (1786) 1 T.R. 343, affirmed (1787) 2 T.R. 186, n, a vessel was insured on a slaving voyage, 'at and from Africa to her port or ports of discharge in the British West Indies,' and a memorandum was inserted in the margin of the policy that the vessel had 'sailed from Liverpool with fourteen six-pounders, swivels, small arms and fifty hands or upwards coppersheathed.' It appeared that the ship had actually sailed from Liverpool with only forty-six men instead of fifty, but that within twelve hours of leaving Liverpool she had taken on board at Beaumaris six additional hands; and evidence was also given that the ship between Liverpool and Beaumaris was quite as safe with forty-six men as she would have been with fifty. The court unanimously held that the policy was void in toto. Arnould, Marine Ins.  633. Again in Forshaw v. Chabert, (1821) 3 Brod. & B. 158, \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 353]\n\u00a0\n a policy was effected on a voyage 'at and from Cuba to Liverpool.' The captain having lost some of his outward crew by sickness and desertion at Cuba, and finding it impossible there to engage ten men, his proper complement for Liverpool, sailed from Cuba with only eight men engaged for Liverpool, and two for Montego Bay (Jamaica), where he touched and landed the two men, and whence, having procured others to supply their place, he proceeded on his voyage to Liverpool. The court held (inter alia) that the ship was not seaworthy when she sailed from Cuba for a voyage to Liverpool, as she ought then to have had on board a full complement of men engaged for the whole voyage. Arnould, Marine Ins.  723. Again in Queen Marine Ins. Co. v. Commercial Bank of Canada, (1870) L.R. 3 P.C. 234, a vessel, covered by a voyage policy, left port with a defective boiler. She stopped at an intermediate port, where the boiler was repaired. A loss occurred thereafter. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held, after a full review of the authorities, that the underwriters were discharged by force of the breach of warranty at the inception of the voyage. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The distinction is apparent between suits such as this where the unseaworthiness of a vessel is merely a condition of exemption and suits where the unseaworthiness of a vessel is the basis of a suit for damages. In cases of the latter order there can be no recovery of damages in the absence of a causal relation between the loss and the de- \n\n[290 U.S. 333, 354]\n\u00a0\n fect. The Malcolm Baxter, Jr., \n277 \nU.S. 323, 333\n, 48 S.Ct. 516; The Francis Wright, \n105 U.S. 381\n, 387. 'If the unseaworthiness was not the proximate cause of the loss, it is not contended the vessel can be charged with the damages.' The Francis Wright, supra. Unseaworthiness viewed as a condition of exemption stands upon a different footing from unseaworthiness viewed as the subject of a covenant.\n We are thus brought to the conclusion that the shipowner was not relieved by the Harter Act from the negligence of the pilot in the navigation of the vessel, and that for like reasons the cargo owners are not chargeable with general average contributions.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER think that the court below was right and that its decree should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We have assumed for present purposes that the bend was the result of the first stranding, and not the second. This is in accordance, it seems, with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The commissioner who heard the witnesses found that the evidence was too evenly balanced to enable him to make a finding either way. Since the burden of proof was on the respondent to make out its claim for exemption, the effect is the same as if the finding were against it. The commissioner did find that the bend, if it existed, could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] General Average shall be payable in accordance with York-Antwerp Rules 1890 and at carrier's option as to matters not therein provided for in accordance with the laws and customs of the port of New York.

If the carrier shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and to have her properly manned, equipped and supplied, it is hereby agreed that in case of danger, damage or disaster resulting from fault or error, in navigation or in the management of the vessel, or from any latent or other defect in the vessel, or machinery, or appurtenances, or from unseaworthiness, although existing at the time of shipment or at the beginning of the voyage (provided the defect or unseaworthiness was not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence), the shippers, consignees, or owners of the cargo shall nevertheless pay salvage and any special charges incurred in respect to the cargo, and shall contribute with the carrier in General Average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses, or expenses of a General Average nature that may be made or incurred for the common benefit or to relieve the adventure from any common peril. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Limitation of Liability for Errors of Navigation, Dangers of the Sea and Acts of God. If the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise or property to or from any port in the United States of America shall exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied, neither the vessel, her owner or owners, agent, or charterers, shall become or be held responsible for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel nor shall the vessel, her owner or owners, charterers, agent, or master be held liable for losses arising from dangers of the sea or other navigable waters, acts of God, or public enemies, or the inherent defect, quality, or vice of the thing carried, or from insufficiency of package, or seizure under legal process, or for loss resulting from any act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative, or from saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or from any deviation in rendering such service.'

Reference will be made in the opinion only to the McDonnell case.\n The action was brought by McDonnell in the Court of Claims on November 4, 1929 to recover $4,549.03, with interest from the date of payment, October 23, 1926. McDonnell filed his individual income tax return for 1917 on April 1, 1918, and paid the amount shown thereon to be due. The sum now sought to be recovered was paid to the collector of internal revenue for the Second district of New York pursuant to an assessment of an additional income tax for the year 1917, which was made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on October 9, 1926. There had been a waiver on February 23, 1926, of the statutory limitation upon the time for making the assessment. Claims for refund were made on December 27, 1928, and May 31, 1929, alleging that the waiver was invalid and that the amount claimed was collected after the running of the statute. The claims for refund were rejected on March 6, 1929, and July 25, 1929. The Court of Claims entered judgment for the defendant. 59 F.(2d) 290. Because of conflict of the decision with that in Uncasville Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 893, certiorari was granted, limited to the question of the validity of the waiver under section 278(e) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1062 note) \n287 \nU.S. 589\n, 53 S.Ct. 95, 77 L. Ed. --.\n The waiver was given under the following circumstances: McDonnell was in 1917 a member of the firm of McDonnell & Truda, which in that year filed its income tax return and paid the taxes therein shown to be due. On March 18, 1923, that is, within five years after the filing of the return and before the expiration of the period allowed by section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 264) for \n\n[288 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n assessment and collection of an additional tax, the Commissioner made a jeopardy assessment against the firm of $100,005.14. On November 30, 1925, that is, after the expiration of the statutory period for making an additional assessment against the plaintiff, the Commissioner notified the plaintiff that the amount payable by the firm for additional tax should, because of errors, be reduced to $24,863.28; but that a reduction of the liability of the partnership necessitated additional taxes to the individual members of the firm; and that he would not make the reduction to the firm unless plaintiff and his partner would waive the statute of limitations so as to permit additional individual taxes, and would pay the amounts assessed against them. Each gave the waiver requested, and paid the amount now sought to be recovered.\n It is conceded by McDonnell that the tax was payable, unless it was barred by the period of limitations prescribed in section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 or section 277(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1057 note). It is conceded by the government that it was so barred, unless the limitation was removed by the waiver signed by McDonnell on February 23, 1926, which, by its terms, purported to extend to December 31, 1926, the time within which the Commissioner could assess additional taxes for the year 1917\n\n\n McDonnell claims that the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, renders the waiver ineffective, because the assessment of the tax had been barred on April 1, 1923. The contention is that, since the period of limitation had expired before the passage of the 1924 act, the waiver was inoperative under the express terms of paragraph (e) of section 278 of that act, which declares: 'This section shall not (1) authorize the assessment of a tax or the collection thereof by distraint or by a proceeding in court if at the time of the enactment of this Act such assessment, distraint, or proceeding was barred by the \n\n[288 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n period of limitation then in existence, or (2) affect any assessment made, or distraint or proceeding in court begun, before the enactment of this Act.' \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The contention of the petitioner, expressed in different terms, is that waivers executed subsequent to June 2, 1924, are invalid where the date of filing the return was such that the five-year period for assessment elapsed before June 2, 1924. Obviously, the waiver would have been good if executed before June 2, 1924, the period of limitation expiring when it did; for in that event the assessment would not have been 'barred by the period of limitation' at the time of the enactment of the 1924 act. The fact that the waiver was executed after the running of the statute of limitations does not render it invalid. Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., 282 U.S. \n\n[288 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n 295, 298, 299, 51 S.Ct. 137; Stange v. United States, \n282 U.S. 270\n, 273-275, 51 S.Ct. 145. And confessedly, the waiver would have been good, executed when it was, if the period of limitation had expired after June 2, 1924.\n Nothing in the legislative history of section 278 indicates an intention to exclude cases like that at bar from the generality of those in which waivers may be given. The purpose of Congress in enacting paragraph (c) of section 278 indicates the contrary (26 USCA  1060 note). Prior to the 1921 act there was no statutory provision expressly authorizing waivers; but their execution had grown out of administrative practice. Doubt as to their validity in the absence of statute, however, had been raised; and the doubt in that situation was not removed until the decision in Aiken v. Burnet, \n282 \nU.S. 277\n, 51 S.Ct. 148. The purpose of Congress in enacting paragraph (d) of section 250 of the Revenue Act of 1921 and paragraph (c) of section 278 of the Revenue Act of 1924 was not to grant authority for waivers or to limit their effect, but to remove that doubt by expressly recognizing them. The latter paragraph substantially re-enacted paragraph (d) of section 250 of the Revenue Act of 1921.2\n Both the language and the purpose of paragraph (e) are consistent with this view. It was pointed out in Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., \n282 U.S. 295\n, 300, note 5, 51 S.Ct. 137, that paragraph ( e) cannot have been intended to qualify every other subdivision in section 278. The petitioner assumes, in fact, that it does not qualify subdivisions (a) and (b), which provide, respectively, for assessment at any time in the case of false or fraudulent returns or failure to file returns, and in the case of deficiencies attributable to a change in deductions taken in amortization of war investments. That paragraph (e) does qualify paragraph (d), which extends the period in \n\n[288 U.S. 420, 425]\n\u00a0\n which collection may be made to six years after assessment, was decided in Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181\n, 49 S.Ct. 121. The petitioner argues that since paragraph (d) relates only to collection, and since the qualifications of paragraph (e) apply in terms to assessments as well, the latter paragraph must limit paragraph (c), the only remaining subdivision. But this conclusion does not necessarily follow. Congress may have inserted the reference to 'assessments' in paragraph (e) in order to make it clear that the extension of time for collections should in no event be regarded as authorizing an assessment already barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Moreover, paragraph (d) alone marked a change in the policy of Congress. \n3\n Paragraph (e) was inserted to prevent the section from being given a 'retroactive effect.' \n4\n To apply it to paragraph (c) would not serve that function. On the countrary, it would serve to cause a break in the policy of giving effect to waivers; a policy expressly adopted in the act of 1921 and avowedly continued by the act of 1924. The disclaimer of an intention to 'authorize an assessment' where 'such assessment' was already barred cannot be taken to refer to assessments \n\n[288 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n which were authorized by section 278 only in the sense that they were made pursuant to an agreement by the taxpayer of the kind which the act continued to recognize and sanction.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234,  278(e), 43 Stat. 253, 299, 300 (26 USCA  1062 note).

Acheson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Paul D. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n December 10, 1930, in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, petitioner was convicted on his plea of guilty of the crime of stealing from the United States mails. By order of the court, sentence was suspended, and he was discharged from the custody of the marshal.\n At a subsequent term of court, on June 17, 1931, petitioner was sentenced by another judge to four years' imprisonment. A motion to vacate the sentence was denied; and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, praying the discharge of petitioner on the ground that the court imposing the sentence was without jurisdiction to do so. After a hearing the writ was dismissed and petitioner remanded to custody. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 56 F.(2d) 152.\n Petitioner seeks a reversal here on the ground that the order of December 10 constitutes a permanent suspension of sentence, void under the decision of this court in Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27\n, 37 S.Ct. 72, L.R.A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355; and that with the expiration of the term the trial court was without power to sentence petitioner. The Solicitor General vigorously opposes the contention that the effect of the order was \n\n[288 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n to suspend sentence permanently; but, without determining that question, we are of opinion that if such was the effect, nevertheless, the court was not deprived of power to impose sentence at a subsequent term.\n The decisions on the point are in conflict. The greater number support the view of petitioner; but we are of opinion that the weight of reason is the other way. Several of the cases holding with petitioner are set forth in Mintie v. Biddle (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 931, 933. While these cases and others are emphatically to the effect that a permanent suspension of sentence is void, and that the court thereby, with the passing of the term, loses jurisdiction, we find no convincing reason in any of them for the latter conclusion. The decision in the Mintie Case rests primarily upon considerations affecting the accused. Support for its conclusion is found by the court in the supposition that during the suspension the accused can 'make no plans, enter into no contracts, engage in no permanent occupation, and bind himself to no obligations, or create any permanent ties, business or domestic.' But it is hard to see the relevancy of these difficulties to the question of jurisdiction. They equally would be present if sentence were definitely postponed from term to term; and power to that extent is not doubted. Moreover, since the suspension order is void, the accused is not bound to rest under the supposed hardship. He may at any time put an end to it by requesting the court to pronounce judgment, which the court no doubt would do unless good cause to the contrary were made to appear. In the absence of such request he must be held to have consented to the indefinite delay, and cannot complain. Hoggett v. State, 101 Miss. 269, 271, 57 So. 811. Compare United States ex rel. Grossberg v. Mulligan (C.C.A.) 48 F.(2d) 93; United States v. Lecato (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 694, 695.\n In a criminal case final judgment means sentence; and a void order purporting permanently to suspend sentence \n\n[288 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n is neither a final nor a valid judgment. United States v. Lecato, supra (C. C.A.) at page 695, of 29 F.(2d); State v. Bongiorno, 96 N.J. Law, 318, 115 A. 665; People v. Bork, 78 N.Y. 346, 350; State v. Vaughan, 71 Conn. 457, 458, 42 A. 640; Symington III v. State, 133 Md. 452, 454, 105 A. 541. If the suspension be for a fixed time, the case undoubtedly remains on the docket of the court until disposed of by final judgment. There is no good reason, in our opinion, why a different rule should obtain where the order of suspension, though expressly made permanent, is void. Such an order is a mere nullity without force or effect, as though no order at all had been made; and the case necessarily remains pending until lawfully disposed of by sentence. Compare In re Bonner, \n151 U.S. 242\n, 259-262, 14 S.Ct. 323; G. Amsinck & Co. v. Springfield Grocer Co. (C.C.A.) 7 F.(2d) 855, 858; Hammers v. United States (C.C.A.) 279 F. 265, 266; Biddle v. Thiele (C.C.A.) 11 F.(2d) 235, 236-237; Bryant v. United States (C.C.A.) 214 F. 51.\n The order here under review being ineffectual to confer immunity from punishment, the conclusion that such immunity existed must rest upon the bare fact that, without any saving provision, the term at which the accused was convicted but not sentenced had passed. But that foundation for the conclusion at once vanishes in the face of the rule that where judgment has not been pronounced upon a verdict during the term at which it was rendered, the cause continues on the docket and necessarily passes over to a succeeding term for final judgment or other appropriate action. Walker v. Moser (C.C.A.) 117 F. 230, 232. We conclude, in accordance with what we regard as the better view, that in a criminal case, where verdict has been duly returned, the jurisdiction of the trial court, under circumstances such as are here disclosed, is not exhausted until sentence is pronounced, either at the same or a succeeding term.

CO.(1933)\nNo. 51\nArgued: November 10, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Martin J. O'Donnell and William Buchholz, both of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles V. Garnett, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent. \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1927, decedents, Marcus Andlauer and his wife, Ellanore Andlauer, while attempting to cross respondent's railroad track at a highway intersection within a few feet of the easterly boundary line of the city of St. Marys, Kan., were killed as the result of a collision between a train of respondent and the automobile in which they were riding. The wife sat in the front seat with her husband, who was driving. The automobile had been driven westerly along a highway parallel to the railroad track to a point about 71 feet south of the railroad track, where it was turned into a road running northerly across the track, and driven thence without change of speed at the rate of 12 or 15 miles per hour until the accident. The day was clear. The crossing was a familiar one to decedents; and, from the point where the automobile was turned to a point beyond the crossing, trains from the east were in plain view for a distance of 2,000 feet. The train which caused the accident came from the east at a speed of from 50 to 60 miles an hour. There was evidence that the whistle was not sounded; that the train was about an hour late; that it usually slowed down in approaching the crossing to about 25 or 30 miles per hour; and that a city ordinance limited the speed of trains within the city to 20 miles per hour. The rear wheels of the automobile were on or very near the south rail of the track when the collision occurred. \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n The trial court took the case from the jury and dismissed the petition on the merits with prejudice, holding that both decedents were guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law. This judgment the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 63 F.(2d) 574.\n So far as the case for the death of the husband is concerned, we agree with the courts below. Contributory negligence on his part was clearly established under the general rule frequently stated by this court. We need do no more than refer to the case of Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Freeman, \n174 \nU.S. 379\n, 19 S.Ct. 763, where a person killed by a moving train at a railroad crossing well known to him, with the coming train in full view which he could have seen while 40 feet distant from the track if he had looked, was held guilty of contributory negligence because, putting aside the oral testimony, these facts demonstrated that either he did not look or took the chance of crossing before the train reached him. 'When it appears,' the court said (pages 383, 384 of 174 U.S., 19 S.Ct. 763, 765), 'that, if proper precautions were taken, they could not have failed to prove effectual, the court has no right to assume, especially in face of all the oral testimony, that such precautions were taken. ... Judging from the common experience of men, there can be but one plausible solution of the problem how the collision occurred. He did not look; or, if he looked, he did not heed the warning, and took the chance of crossing the track before the train could reach him. In either case he was clearly guilty of contributory negligence.' Authority for this view was found especially in Chicago, R.I. & P. Railroad Co. v. Houston, \n95 U.S. 697\n, 702.\n The case for the death of the wife is controlled by different considerations. Although it was at one time ruled in England-Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 C.B. 115 (1849)-that the negligence of the driver of a vehicle is imputed to a passenger, that doctrine, much criticized and finally \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n abandoned in England (The Bernina, 12 Pro.Div. 58), was never generally accepted in this country. Followed by a few state decisions, it was rejected by the great weight of American authority and, after full consideration, distinctly repudiated by this court. Little v. Hackett, \n116 \nU.S. 366\n, 6 S.Ct. 391. And see Union Pac. Ry. v. Lapsley (C. C.A.) 51 F. 174, 16 L.R.A. 800. Whether a passenger or guest in a public or private conveyance, having no control over its movement, may be denied a right of recovery for personal injury or death on the ground of contributory negligence, depends upon his own failure to exercise a proper degree of care, and not upon that of the driver. This is true where the passenger is the wife of the driver as in other cases. Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Fanning (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 799, 803. And, while the state decisions are not uniform on the subject, the federal rule is definitely settled that the burden of proving such contributory negligence rests, in all cases, upon the defendant, Washington & G. Railroad Co. v. Gladmon, 15 Wall. 401, 406, 407; Texas & Pacific Railway v. Volk, \n151 \nU.S. 73, 77\n, 78 S., 14 S.Ct. 239; Central Vermont R. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 35 S.Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252, although, if such negligence be established by plaintiff's evidence, it hardly seems necessary to add, defendant may have the benefit of it, Washington & Georgetown R. Co. v. Harmon, \n147 \nU.S. 571, 580\n, 581 S., 13 S.Ct. 557; Indianapolis, etc., R.R. Co. v. Horst, \n93 \nU.S. 291, 298\n, 299 S..\n In the present case, as already appears, the burden was sustained as to the husband. It was not sustained as to the wife. As to her, there is an entire absence of evidence on the point. Whatever duty rested upon her under the circumstances, for aught that appears to the contrary, may have been fully discharged. It properly cannot be said from anything shown by the record before us that she did not maintain a careful lookout for the train, or that, if aware of its approach, she did not warn her husband or urge him to stop before entering upon the cross- \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n ing. Want of due care for her own safety must be proved; it cannot be presumed. The presumption is the other way. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Gentry, \n163 \nU.S. 353, 366\n, 16 S.Ct. 1104; Baltimore & Potomac R.R. v. Landrigan, \n191 \nU.S. 461, 473\n, 474 S., 24 S.Ct. 137; Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Toops, \n281 \nU.S. 351, 356\n, 50 S.Ct. 281. If, as here, there be no evidence which speaks one way or the other with respect to contributory negligence of the person killed, it is presumed that there was no such negligence. Looney v. Metropolitan Railroad Co., \n200 \nU.S. 480, 488\n, 26 S.Ct. 303.\n Here the wife was not in control of the movement of the automobile. She could only note the danger, warn her husband, and urge him to stop. She may have done so, and he, misjudging the situation or taking the chance, have gone forward nevertheless. Or she may have seen the approaching train, observed that her husband was also aware of the fact and, relying upon her knowledge of his habits and character, trusted him, with good reason, until it became too late to interfere, to do whatever was necessary to avoid the danger. The applicable rule is found in Southern Pac. Co. v. Wright (C.C.A.) 248 F. 261, 264. That was a case where one Wright was riding in a motortruck with an experienced chauffeur as driver. A collision occurred between the truck and a train, which resulted in Wright's death. It did not appear whether Wright saw the train before it was seen by the chauffeur, The court said that he might have seen it, and yet reasonably remained silent on the assumption that, the view being unobstructed, the chauffeur also saw it and was governing himself accordingly. 'So that up to the very time that the truck approached the main track he (Wright) may have reasonably supposed that Tucker (the chauffeur) would stop the car in time to avoid a collision. And when he realized that he was going to attempt to cross ahead of the train, what could, or should, he have done? Who can now say as a matter of law? Cry out? He might thus have con- \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n fused and disconcerted the driver, and an instant of indecision in such a case may be fatal. Here, with the truck a half a second sooner or the train a half a second later, the tragedy would not have happened. It must be borne in mind that there was no time to reflect or reason. If the train was running only 30 miles an hour-the speed was probably greater-it was only about 30 seconds from the time it came into view a quarter of a mile away until it crashed into the truck.' Accordingly, it was held that the question of Wright's contributory negligence was not one of law but one of fact for the jury.\n To the same effect see, Chicago & E.I. Ry. Co. v. Divine (C.C.A.) 39 F.(2d) 537, 539; Trenholm v. Southern Pac. Co. (C.C.A.) 8 F.(2d) 452; Baker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 248 N.Y. 131, 135, 136, 161 N.E. 445, 447; Nelson v. Nygren, 259 N.Y. 71, 75, 181 N.E. 52; Crough v. New York Central R.R. Co., 260 N.Y. 227, 232, 183 N.E. 372. In the Baker Case, supra, the New York court, holding that the question of the contributory negligence of an automobile passenger killed in a train collision was for the jury and not the court, said:\n'Believing the car was about to stop, he may have thought that warning would be needless, and discovering too late that the car was going on, he may have thought that interference would be dangerous. These and like possibilities were to be estimate by the triers of the facts. They make it impossible to deal with the issue as a question for the court.'\n\n Bradley v. Missouri Pac. R. Co. (C.C.A.) 288 F. 484, is cited by respondent to the contrary; but, to the extent that it conflicts with the view we have expressed, that case is disapproved.\n But the argument is advanced that, even though the railroad company be guilty of negligence and the wife be absolved from the charge of contributory negligence, \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless the railroad company is not liable, because, under the circumstances here disclosed, the proximate cause of the wife's death was not its negligence, but the negligence of the husband in driving upon the track in the face of the approaching train. The validity of this contention depends altogether upon whether the negligence of the husband constituted an intervening cause which had the effect of turning aside the course of events set in motion by the company, and in and of itself producing the actionable result. The evidence here does not present that situation. Instead of a remote cause and a separate intervening, self- sufficient, proximate cause, we have here concurrent acts, co-operating to produce the result. As this court pointed out in Washington & Georgetown R. Co. v. Hickey, \n166 \nU.S. 521, 525\n, 17 S.Ct. 661, the vice of the argument consists in the attempt to separate into two distinct causes ( remote and proximate) what in reality is but one continuous cause; that is to say, an attempt to separate two inseparable negligent acts which, uniting to produce the result, constituted mutually contributing acts of negligence on the part of the railroad company and the driver of the automobile.\n The negligence sought to be established against the railroad company was not only failure to sound the whistle, but operation of the train at a rate of speed dangerous and unusual, and which necessarily would bring the train into the city at a speed far beyond the limit prescribed by the city ordinance. Assuming, upon these facts, that a finding by the jury that the train was negligently operated would be justified, such negligence continued without interruption down to the moment of the accident. The same is equally true in respect of the contributory negligence of the driver of the automobile. The result, therefore, is that the contributory negligence of the driver did not interrupt the sequence of events set in motion by the negligence of \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 236]\n\u00a0\n the railroad company or insulate them from the accident, but concurred therewith so as to constitute in point of time and in effect what was essentially one transaction.\n The rule is settled by innumerable authorities that if, injury be caused by the concurring negligence of the defendant and a third person, the defendant is liable to the same extent as though it had been caused by his negligence alone.

There the owner of a house, being unable to shut off the gas, telephoned the gas company asking that some one be sent to look after the matter. There being some delay, the owner, in attempting to find the leak, lighted a match which caused an explosion of accumulated gas. Creighton was injured thereby and brought suit against the gas company. That company insisted that the proximate cause of the injury was the act of the owner in bringing the lighted match in contact with the gas. The court in rejecting the claim said:\n'This might be so if it had been a supervening cause which rendered the first cause inoperative. The truth of the matter is that the causes of the injury were concurrent. The accumulation of the gas was one; the lighted \n\n[290 U.S. 227, 237]\n\u00a0\n match was the other. The effect of the former had not ceased, but co- operated with that of the other in effecting the injury. In such case an inquiry about the proximate cause is not pertinent, for both are liable.'\n\n The court below erred in holding as matter of law that the wife was guilty of contributory negligence, and therefore its judgment cannot stand.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINTZ v. BALDWIN(1933)\nNo. 760\nArgued: April 10, 1933Decided: May 8, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of New York. \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. E. Messerschmidt, of Madison, Wis., for appellants.\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs have a large and valuable business in the raising, and in the sale and transportation from Wisconsin to New York, of cattle for dairy and breeding purposes. Defendant, acting under state statutes, made and is enforcing an order1 to guard against Bang's disease, \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n bovine infections abortion. The order requires that the cattle imported into New York for such purposes and also the herds from which they come shall be certified to be free from that disease by the chief sanitary official of the state of origin and that each shipment be accompanied by such a certificate.\n Plaintiffs shipped 20 head from Wisconsin for delivery to one Bartlett in New York. The animals were accompanied by a certificate which was sufficient as to them, but there was nothing to show the freedom from Bang's disease of the herd of herds from which they came. For that reason defendant refused to permit them to be delivered, and so plaintiffs were compelled to take them out of New York.\n Plaintiffs brought this suit for a temporary and perpetual injunction to restrain enforcement of the order. Their claim, so far as here material, is that the order is repugnant to the commerce clause (Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3) because in conflict with federal statutes relating to interstate transportation of livestock. Cattle Contagious Diseases Acts: February 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 791, 21 U.S.C.  111, 120-122 (21 USCA  111, 120-122); March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1264, 18 U.S.C.  118 (18 USCA  118), and 21 U.S. C.  123-127 (21 USCA  123-127).2 Their application for a temporary injunction was brought on for hearing before a specially constituted court. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380). Defendant answered, and, upon stipulation of the parties, plaintiffs' motion for interlocutory de- \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n cree and defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint were submitted upon the pleadings, the affidavit of one of the plaintiffs, the affidavit of defendant, and affidavits of others in his behalf. Temporary injunction was denied, and the bill was dismissed.\n The court made special findings of fact which include the following: Bang's disease prevails throughout the United States, and is one of the greatest limiting factors, both as to reproduction and milk yield. Undulant fever may be caused by the disease germs when introduced into the human body by drinking raw milk of an infected cow. The disease may generally be diagnosed about 60 days after infection, though the time may be considerably longer. Two blood tests are customarily made to detect the disease, but they may not disclose it in the incubative stage. A substantial percentage of cattle imported into New York under certificate that they have passed tests for the disease are shown to have been infected. There is a body of expert opinion that such cattle should only be admitted when certified to have come from a clean herd, and that by such a safeguard danger of infection would be greatly lessened. The disease is exceedingly infectious, and the defendant concluded that, in order to protect herd owners and milk consumers, he should require a certificate not only that imported cattle showed no infection, but that they came from herds free from disease. This resulted in the order. By reason of danger of infection from the disease, many states of the Union have imposed restrictions upon the admission of cattle. The federal Department of Agriculture, November 15, 1932, by letter to defendant, declared that the Department had issued no quarantine or regulations pertaining to Bang's disease, and that its policy for the present is to leave the control with the various states.\n The order is an inspection measure. Undoubtedly it was promulgated in good faith and is appropriate for the \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n prevention of further spread of the disease among dairy cattle and to safeguard public health. It cannot be maintained therefore that the order so unnecessarily burdens interstate transportation as to contravene the commerce clause. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 203, 204; The Minnesota Rate Case, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 402\n, 406 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 151\n, 152 S., 23 S.Ct. 92; Hannibal & St. J. Railroad Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n; Henderson v. Mayor of N.Y., 92 u.S. 259, 268. Unless limited by the exercise of federal authority under the commerce clause, the state has power to make and enforce the order. The purpose of Congress to supersede or exclude state action against the ravages of the disease is not lightly to be inferred. The intention so to do must definitely and clearly appear. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. Railroad Comm., \n283 \nU.S. 380, 391\n, 51 S.Ct. 553; Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118, 122\n, 39 S.Ct. 403; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway v. Haber, \n169 \nU.S. 613, 623\n, 18 S.Ct. 488.\n Plaintiffs' contention that the order is in conflict with the Act of March 3, 1905, is groundless. That act applies only to shipments from quarantined districts that it authorizes the Secretary to establish. Plaintiffs' shipments are not made from such a district.\n Examination of the act of 1903 is necessary. It is a measure intended to enable the Secretary to prevent the spread of disease among cattle and other live stock. He is authorized and directed from time to time to establish such rules and regulations concerning interstate transportation from any place 'where he may have reason to believe such diseases may exist ... and all such rules and regulations shall have the force of law.' 'Whenever any inspector or assistant inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry shall issue a certificate showing that such officer had inspected any cattle ... which were about to be shipped ... from such locality ... and \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n had found them free from ... communicable disease, such animals, so inspected and certified, may be shipped, driven, or transported from such place' in interstate commerce 'without further inspection or the exaction of fees of any kind, except such as may at any time be ordered or exacted by the Secretary of Agriculture. ...' Section 1, 21 U.S.C.  120, 121 ( 21 USCA  120, 121).\n Plaintiffs' cattle were not inspected by, and no certificate was issued under, federal authority. Unless the act itself operates to prevent the enforcement of the order, the suit was rightly dismissed. The express exclusion of state inspection extends only to cases where federal inspection has been made and certificate issued. The clause cannot be read to extend to other cases. The expression of purpose so to limit the exertion of state power strongly suggests that Congress intended not otherwise to trammel the enforcement of state quarantine measures. United States v. De la Maza Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 725. Much weight is to be given to the practical interpretation of the act by the federal department through its acquiescence in the enforcement of state measures to suppress Bang's disease. This case is governed by the principle on which rests the decision in Asbell v. Kansas, \n209 \nU.S. 251\n, 28 S.Ct. 485, 14 Ann.Cas. 1101. Defendant's order does not conflict with the act of 1903\n\n\n Plaintiffs lean upon our decision in Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87\n, 46 S.Ct. 279. But, as concerns the question of conflict with state measures, the act of 1903 is to be distinguished from the Plant Quarantine Act there interpreted. Act of August 20, 1912, 37 Stat. 315, as amended, 7 U.S.C.  151-154, 156-165 (7 USCA  151-154, 156-165). In that case upon full consideration of the latter, we said (page 99 of 270 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 279, 283): 'All the sections look to a complete provision for quarantine against importation into the country and quarantine as between the states under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture. ... (Page 101 of 270 U. S., 46 S.Ct. 279, 283.) It (the \n\n[289 U.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n Act) covers the whole field so far as the spread of the plant disease by interstate transportation can be affected and restrained. ... The state laws of quarantine that affect interstate commerce and thus federal law, cannot stand together. The relief sought to protect the different states, in so far as it depends on the regulation of interstate commerce, must be obtained through application to the Secretary of Agriculture.'\n Unlike the act of 1903, the Plant Quarantine Act does not, by specification of the cases in which action under it shall be exclusive, disclose the intention of Congress that, subject to the limitations defined, state measures may be enforced. This difference is essential and controlling.\n Plaintiffs' other contentions are not substantial, and need not be specifically discussed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It appearing that Bang's disease, an infectious and communicable disease affecting domestic animals, exists outside of the state of New York in areas from which cattle are or may be imported into this state,\n'Now, therefore, to prevent the bringing into this state of such disease, and in pursuance of the authority conferred upon me by sections 72 and 74 of the Agriculture and Markets Law (Consol.

I do hereby order that all bovine animals coming into the State of New York shall comply with the following requirements:\n\n'All cattle over six months of age imported for dairy or breeding purposes shall come directly from herds certified to be free from Bang's disease by the chief livestock sanitary official by whatever name known of the country, province or state of origin. Such animals at the time of import must be accompanied by a certificate authenticated by such livestock sanitary official showing the name and address of the laboratory or person making the last blood test on such herd with a complete statement of the results of such test on the animals so imported. Such certificate shall describe each animal in such manner as to enable its identification by ear tag number, name and registration number in the case of pure breds and ear tag number in the case of grades. Such certificate shall include or be accompanied by the certificate above mentioned as to freedom of the herd from bang's disease. A duplicate of such authenticated certificate or certificates must be filed with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, Albany, N.Y., by the consignee at the time the shipment is received, unless such duplicate has previously been filed by the consignor.\n\n'This order shall not apply to the following classes of bovine animals:\n\n'(a) Cattle for immediate slaughter, consigned to the public stockyards.\n\n'(b) Steers and beef type cattle for feeding and grazing purposes.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Both acts were amended by Act of February 7, 1928, 45 Stat. 59. \n\n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI STATE LIFE INS.

Code  24(1), confers original jurisdiction upon District Courts of the United States of suits of a civil nature between citizens of different states 'where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $ 3,000.' And section 71, 28 USCA (Jud. Code  28), provides for removing suits of which District Courts are given original jurisdiction.\n Section 6155, Crawford & Moses' Digest, Statutes of Arkansas: 'In all cases where loss occurs, and the fire, life, health, or accident insurance company liable therefor shall fail to pay the same within the time specified in the policy, after demand made therefor, such company shall be liable to pay the holder of such policy, in addition to the amount of such loss, twelve per cent. damages upon the amount of such loss, together with all reasonable attorneys' fees for the prosecution and collection of said loss; said attorneys' fee to be taxed by the court where the same is heard on original action, by appeal or otherwise and to be taxed up \n\n[290 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n as a part of the costs therein and collected as other costs are or may be by law collected. Act March 29, 1905, p. 307.'\n Seeking to recover upon two insurance policies, respondent Johnson, a citizen of Arkansas, sued the petitioner, a Missouri corporation, in the Hot Springs circuit court. He asked judgment for $3,000, total of the policies, 'together with a reasonable attorney's fee for his attorneys herein and for all of his costs herein expended.'\n By proper proceeding the defendant company asked removal of the cause to the United States District Court. It alleged a reasonable attorney's fee would amount to $250 and that the matter in controversy exceeded $3, 000, exclusive of interest and costs. Removal was denied. Judgment went in favor of Johnson for $3,000; also the court further found and adjudged 'that the plaintiff is entitled to an attorney's fee of $550, and the same is hereby assessed and taxed as a part of the costs in this case.' Upon appeal the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. Among other things, it said: 'Appellant contends for a reversal of the judgment upon the ground that the trial court erred in denying its petition for removal of the cause to the federal court. It is argued that to include an attorney's fee in the amount sued for exceeds $3,000, interest, and costs, and in amount makes the cause a removable one under the federal removal statute ( Judicial Code  24(1), 28, 28 USCA  41(1), 71). This court has ruled otherwise in the case of Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh, 185 Ark. 332, 333, 47 S.W.(2d) 585, 586. In the case referred to, it was ruled that an attorney's fee in cases of this nature must be taxed as costs in compliance with the express terms of section 6155 of Crawford & Moses' Digest.' 54 S.W. (2d) 407, 409.\n In Marsh's Case, judgment was sought upon an insurance policy for $3, 000, together with 12 per cent. penalty and attorneys' fees. The trial court denied a petition for removal. The Supreme Court disapproved and said: \n\n[290 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n 'He sues for $3,000 and 12 per cent. damages and attorney's fees. Section 6155, supra, provides that the attorney's fees shall be taxed as costs, but it does not provide that the 12 per cent. penalty shall be taxed as costs. Therefore the amount in controversy was $3,360.' Evidently, the court concluded because the state statute directed that attorneys' fees should be treated as costs, they were costs within the removal statute. Also, that the prescribed damages were not costs since not so declared.\n But this view was rejected here in Sioux County, Neb., v. National Surety Co., \n276 \nU.S. 238, 241\n, 48 S.Ct. 239. We there held that a statute which allowed attorneys' fees to be taxed as part of the costs created a liability enforceable by proper judgment in a federal court; that the mere declaration of the state statute could not alter the true nature of the obligation.\n In the state court the present respondent sought to enforce the liability imposed by statute for his benefit-to collect something to which the law gave him a right. The amount so demanded became part of the matter put in controversy by the complaint, and not mere 'costs' excluded from the reckoning by the jurisdictional and removal statutes.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed. Reversed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOFFAT TUNNEL LEAGUE v.

Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants brought this suit against the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company to set aside an order of the Commission made pursuant to 49 U.S.C.  5(2), 49 USCA  5(2),1 authorizing that company by stock purchase to acquire control of the Denver & Salt Lake Railway Company, called the Moffat road. The latter, the Moffat Tunnel Improvement District, and the state of Colorado by its Public Utilities Commission, intervened as parties defendant. The grounds of suit alleged in the complaint are that the order is not supported by evidence, and that, because the examiner excluded what plaintiffs assert to be material evidence concerning the effect of such acquisition upon the public interest, the Commission failed to hold a hearing as required by the act. They have now abandoned the first of these contentions. Copies of the report, Denver & S. L. Ry. Co. Control, 170 I.C.C. 4, and the supplemental report and order, 175 I.C.C. 542, together with a narrative \n\n[289 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n of evidence before the Commission, were attached to the complaint.\n All the defendants prayed that the suit be dismissed. In substance they maintained that neither plaintiff is a legal entity or has capacity to maintain this suit on its own behalf or as representative of others, and that neither was a party in interest before the Commission or has any pecuniary, property, or legal right or interest injuriously affected or threatened by the order.\n Plaintiffs applied to the court, consisting of three judges, for a temporary injunction. The motions to dismiss were submitted at the same time. The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that they had a right to maintain the suit. But, conceiving that on review dismissal on that ground might be deemed not sufficient finally to dispose of the litigation, it also passed upon the merits. Decree was entered accordingly. (D.C.) 59 F.(2d) 760.\n The Rio Grande was built between 1871 and 1890. Its main line between Denver and Ogden, 782 miles, follows a circuitous and difficult route through mountainous country. It extends from Denver, a mile above sea level, southerly 120 miles to Pueblo, where the elevation is 4,668 feet, thence westerly, northerly, southwesterly, and northwesterly to Ogden. It rises to 10,240 feet over the continental divide at Tennessee Pass east of Dotsero, and descends to a level of 4,583 at Grand Junction, and 4,293 at Ogden. This line constitutes an important stretch for through transportation, via St. Louis and Chicago, between Pacific Coast points and the East. But as to traffic to or from the west originating at, destined to, or passing through, Denver, the Rio Grande is at a great disadvantage because of its circuitous route between Pueblo and Dotsero.\n The Moffat road was constructed between 1903 and 1913 and extends westerly from Denver 232 miles through \n\n[289 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n Grand and Routt counties to Craig in Moffat county, Colo. Its promoters at first intended to construct the line more than 250 miles farther into and through Duchesne and Uintah counties, Utah, to reach Provo, Salt Lake, or Ogden. But that became impossible, and it appears from the evidence that the company now has no such plans. Originally the line crossed the Continental Divide, rising from an elevation of 5,170 feet at Denver to 11, 660 at Corona, and descending to 6,700 at Orestod, which is 41 miles northeasterly of Dotsero on the Rio Grande. The use of the line over the divide was so expensive and difficult that its abandonment was contemplated. Its continued operation was deemed of great importance to Denver and the northwestern part of Colorado. Accordingly the General Assembly of 1922 created the Moffat Tunnel Improvement District including all of Denver and parts or all of the counties traversed by the road, and provided for the construction of a tunnel to be used as a transportation facility for railroads, power, water, telephone, and telegraph. The cost was to be covered by an issue of bonds and, if necessary, by special assessments on real estate in the district according to benefits determined by the Moffat Tunnel Commission which was also created by the act. The tunnel was constructed at a cost of $15,470,000. In January, 1926, the district made a lease to the Moffat covering all railroad uses, and the tunnel has since been used as a part of its line. The Commission assessed the benefits against all real estate in the district at $45,000, 000, of which 89 per cents. is upon property in Denver. The other parts of the district are mountainous and sparsely settled.\n Constructed on about 41 miles of line between Orestod on the Moffat and Dotsero on the Rio Grande and use by the latter of the Moffat road through the tunnel would reduce the distance between Denver and points on the Rio Grande west of Dotsero by 173 miles and avoid the heavy \n\n[289 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n grades over the Divide. The Interstate Commerce Commission's order declaring that public convenience and necessity require the cut-off and its order authorizing the Rio Grande to secure stock control of the Moffat open the way for this development. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The complaint alleges that the Moffat Tunnel League is an unincorporated voluntary association organized for the purpose of assisting in the development of commercial interests and adequate transportation facilities in Grand, Routt, and Moffat counties. The evidence shows that it consists of nine unnamed persons who were selected, three by each of the county boards of commissioners, from persons designated by commercial and other clubs, none of which is identified. The complaint alleges that the Uintah Basin Railroad League is an unincorporated voluntary association organized to promote the interests of Uintah and Duchesne counties. The evidence tends to show that it was created shortly before the hearing to secure railroad facilities for these counties, and that it is made up of clubs, towns, and irrigation companies. But none of these is named or in any manner identified. It is said that the league also includes the boards of these two counties. But no authorization by local law or official action on the part of either is disclosed.\n These leagues are not corporations, quasi corporations, or organized pursuant to, or recognized by, any law. Neither is a person in law, and, unless authorized by statute, they have no capacity to sue. Brown v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 134, 141\n, 48 S.Ct. 288; United Mine Workers v.

There is no federal statute that purports to give any unincorporated voluntary association standing to bring suit to set aside an order of the Commission. Every such suit must be brought against the United States. Urgent Deficiencies Act, 38 Stat. 219, 28 U.S.C.  41(28), 46, 48, 28 USCA  41(28), 46, 48. And, save as authorized by the Congress, it may not be sued. The act does not specify the classes of persons, natural or artificial, who may sue or what shall constitute a cause of action for the setting aside of an order. But it does require that the petition shall set forth 'the facts constituting the petitioner's cause of action' any by other provisions shows that for failure so to do the suit shall be dismissed. Id.,  45. Consequently the complaint must show that plaintiff has, or represents others having, a legal right or interest that will be injuriously affected by the order.

It is no more than a sentiment, such as may be entertained by members of the public in the territory west of Craig, that the improvement of transportation facilities authorized by the Commission will lessen the possibility of construction by a rival of the Rio Grande of an extension of the Moffat to Utah common points. Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co ., \n288 \nU.S. 14\n, 53 S.Ct. 266.\n Plaintiffs contend that they are empowered to sue by the first proviso of section 45a3. And they seek support from \n\n[289 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n the second proviso of that section. But these clauses do not purport to authorize those within their terms to bring suit. The first provides that a party in interest to proceedings before the Commission in which an order is made may appear and be heard in a suit involving the 'validity of such order ... and the interest of such party.' The second declares that 'communities' and others there mentioned who are interested in the 'controversy or question' in any suit brought by any one under specified sections may intervene at any time after institution of the suit. The right so to appear and be heard or so to intervene in a suit brought by another is to be distinguished from an authorization to bring suit.

RAPHAEL(1933)\nNo. 407\nArgued: February 7, 1933Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 485, 486]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Carl F. Schipper, Jr., and William P. Everts, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Mark M. Horblit, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In an equity suit in the United States District Court against the Monroe Stores, Inc., the petitioner, Munroe, was appointed receiver. One Dempsey made a written offer to purchase the entire property, stipulating that he would pay the expenses of the receivership and thirty per cent. of all claims which might be filed by a certain date and allowed by the court, and, upon acceptance give a bond in the penal sum of $100,000, with sureties, con- \n\n[288 U.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n ditioned that he should perform the contract. The District Court authorized a sale to Dempsey on the terms set forth in his offer; the receiver conveyed all of the property in his possession and took a bond which bound Dempsey as principal and two sureties to the United States of America. It recited:\n'The conditions of this obligation are such, that whereas, in Equity Case No. 3293, now pending in this District Court of the United States, District of Massachusetts, entitled J. B. Hirschfeld & Co. Inc. et als. vs. The Monroe Stores, Inc. Harold A. Dempsey made an offer in writing to purchase all of the assets of every name, nature, character, and kind and wheresoever situated, of George B. Munroe, Receiver of said The Monroe Stores Inc. as more fully set forth in said offer, and\n\n'Whereas, in connection with said offer a bond guaranteeing the performance of the conditions and terms of said offer is required.\n\n'Now, therefore, if the said Harold A. Dempsey shall comply with all the conditions and items of said offer then this obligation to be void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and effect.'\n\n Raphael, within the time limited by order of the District Court, proved his claim and the court allowed it for $35,000. After he had been paid $1,200, Dempsey defaulted and Raphael applied for and obtained leave of the District Court to sue Dempsey and his sureties on the bond in the state court. An attachment suit was brought in the name of the United States of America on the relation of respondent and property of the defendants seized which is still bound by the attachment. Shortly after this action was brought the petitioner, as receiver, instituted a suit on the bond by a supplementary bill in the District Court in the name of the United States and a final decree was entered therein against Dempsey and his sureties for $33,026, which was the amount due all credi- \n\n[288 U.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n tors, including the respondent. An execution was returned unsatisfied. The petitioner then instituted proceedings in contempt against Dempsey and his sureties, and procured an order requiring them to pay $1,000 a month until the amount awarded should be paid in full. Thereafter the petitioner moved the District Court to rescind its prior order granting respondent leave to sue in the state court and to enjoin further proceedings therein, except the entry of judgment. At the time of this motion the suit in the state court was ripe for judgment. The District Court allowed the motion and granted the injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order, 60 F.(2d) 16. The case is here on certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 591\n, 53 S.Ct. 117, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The primary purpose of the receivership was to turn the Stores Company's assets to account for the equal benefit of all creditors. If the sale had been for cash, the consideration, after payment of necessary expenses, would have been ratably distributed. In parting with the property the receiver, as the court's representative, took a bond, running not to the creditors, but to the United States. Certainly no creditor could bring a suit in his own name on the bond, for his share of the purchase money. Nor could he institute such an action without leave of the District Court. The course the respondent pursued evidences his recognition of these limitations. Nevertheless the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the interest of the United States was merely nominal; that the cause of action on the bond belonged to the creditors as individuals; that by granting the respondent leave to sue in the state court the District Court lost jurisdiction; that its order permitting such suit was final and could not be revoked after the expiration of the term; and that the order of rescission and injunction violated section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  379 (28 USCA  379)) which forbids federal courts to enjoin prosecution of suits in state courts.\n The petitioner supports the action of the District Court on the ground that the bond was to stand in place of \n\n[288 U.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n the property conveyed, and was taken to enable the court through its receiver to insure the receipt and distribution of the purchase money amongst the creditors without preference or priority. He urges that when leave to sue was given the respondent the court evidently considered that such a suit would not interfere with ratable payment of all entitled to share in the assets, but that the grant was discretionary and subject to revocation if the interests of the creditors should so require. He says that the court never lost its jurisdiction over the estate, and the bond represented the estate for distribution.\n We think this is the correct view of the matter. The District Court's order granting leave to respondent, a party in interest in the receivership, to sue upon the bond in the name of the United States, was not a relinquishment of its jurisdiction over him or the subject matter. The bond was given to an officer of the court for faithful performance of a contract with that officer. If at any time it was made to appear that the permitted suit by a single creditor might work an injustice to the others it was within the court's power to revoke the permission.\n The parties refer us to decisions as to the right of action on statutory bonds given to the United States by contractors, providing, inter alia, for the payment of subcontractors and materialmen (United States Fidelity & Guar. Co. v. Kenyon, \n204 \nU.S. 349\n, 27 S.Ct. 381; Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, \n240 \nU.S. 214, 223\n, 36 S.Ct. 321), or official bonds required by law (Howard v. United States, \n184 \nU.S. 676\n, 22 S.Ct. 543). But these are not helpful in the present case. Here the outstanding fact is that the bond was taken by the court to protect all creditors. Any suit upon it must be in furtherance and not in contravention of that purpose.\n Holding, as we do, that the manner of the enforcement of Dempsey's obligation remained within the control of the District Court, we conclude that the order which is the subject of the controversy was neither beyond its jurisdiction (compare Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U.S. \n\n[288 U.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n 494, 497; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S.Ct. 399; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 229\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077) nor an unlawful interference with the prosecution of a suit in a state court (compare Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 49 S.Ct. 310).\n The judgment must be reversed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNASHVILLE, C. & ST. L. RY. v.

Wallace \n288 U.S. 249\n (1933) ]\n\n\n[288 U.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., for appellant.\n\n\n[288 U.S. 249, 255]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. F. Barry, Jr., and E. F. Hunt, both of Nashville, Tenn., for appellees.\n\n\n[288 U.S. 249, 258]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin M. Borchard, of New York City, and Charles E. Clark, of New Haven, Conn., amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant brought suit in the Chancery Court of Davidson county, Tenn ., under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of that state,1 chapter 29, Tennessee Public Acts 1923, to secure a judicial declaration that a state excise tax levied on the storage of gasoline, chapter 58, Tennessee Public Acts 1923, as amended by chapter 67, Tennessee Public Acts 1925, is, as applied to appellant, invalid under the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. A decree for appellees was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, and the case comes here on appeal under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344(a). \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 259]\n\u00a0\n After the jurisdictional statement required by Rule 12 (28 USCA  354) was submitted, this Court, in ordering the cause set down for argument, invited the attention of counsel to the question 'whether a case or controversy is presented, in view of the nature of the proceedings in the state courts.' This preliminary question, which has been elaborately briefed and argued, must first be considered, for the judicial power with which this Court is invested by article 3,  1, of the Constitution, extends by article 3,  2, only to 'cases' and 'controversies'; if no 'case' or 'controversy' is presented for decision, we are without power to review the decree of the court below. Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 250.\n In determining whether this litigation presents a case within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, we are concerned, not with form, but with substance. See Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, \n274 \nU.S. 123\n, 47 S.Ct. 511. Compare Gasoline Products Co., Inc., v. Champlin Refining Co., \n283 \nU.S. 494, 498\n, 51 S.Ct. 513. Hence, we look not to the label which the Legislature has attached to the procedure followed in the state courts, or to the description of the judgment which is brought here for review, in popular parlance, as 'declaratory,' but to the nature of the proceeding which the statute authorizes, and the effect of the judgment rendered upon the rights which the appellant asserts.\n Section 1 of the Tennessee Declaratory Judgments Act confers jurisdiction on courts of record 'to declare rights ... whether or not further relief is or could be claimed' and provides that 'no action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect; and such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.' By section 2 it is provided that 'any person ... whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute ... may have determined any question of \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 260]\n\u00a0\n construction or validity arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights ... thereunder.'\n Under section 6, the court may refuse to render a declaratory judgment where, if rendered, it 'would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.' Declaratory judgments may, in accordance with section 7, be reviewed as are other orders, judgments, or decrees, and under section 8 'further relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper.' Section 11 requires that, 'when declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.'\n This statute has often been considered by the highest court of Tennessee, which has consistently held that its provisions may only be invoked when the complainant asserts rights which are challenged by the defendant, and presents for decision an actual controversy to which he is a party, capable of final adjudication by the judgment or decree to be rendered.

It has also held that no judgment or decree will be rendered when all the parties who will be adversely affected by it are not before the court. Harrell v. American Home Mortgage Co., 161 Tenn. 646, 32 S.W.(2d) 1023; Sadler v. Mitchell, 162 Tenn. 363, 367, 36 S.W.(2d) 891.\n Proceeding in accordance with this statute, appellant filed its bill of complaint in the state chancery court, \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 261]\n\u00a0\n joining as defendants the appellees, the Attorney General and the state officials charged with the duty of collecting the gasoline privilege tax imposed by the Tennessee statute. The complaint alleged that appellant is engaged in purchasing gasoline outside the state, which it stores within the state pending its use within and without the state in the conduct of appellant's business as an interstate rail carrier; that appellees assert that the statute taxes the privilege of storing gasoline within the state and is applicable to appellant; that they have demanded payment of the tax in a specified amount and have determined to enforce their demand; and that, under the circumstances alleged, the statute as applied to appellant is invalid under the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. The relief prayed was that the Taxing Act be declared unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The chancery court sustained the appellees' demurrer to the sufficiency in law of the allegations relied on to establish the unconstitutionality of the tax. Its final decree dismissing the bill on the merits has been affirmed by the highest court of the state.\n That the issues thus raised and judicially determined would constitute a case or controversy if raised and decided in a suit brought by the taxpayer to enjoin collection of the tax cannot be questioned. See Risty v. Chicago, R.I. & Pac. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S.Ct. 236. Compare Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; Pierce v.

United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 250, was between adverse parties, seeking a determination of their legal rights upon the facts alleged in the bill and admitted by the demurrer. Unlike Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S.Ct. 274; Texas v.

Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S.Ct. 122, valuable legal rights asserted by the complainant and threatened with imminent invasion by appellees, will be directly affected to a specific and substantial degree by the decision of the question of law; and, unlike Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 495; Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n, 32 S.Ct. 224; Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n, 43 S.Ct. 445; Federal Radio Commission v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464\n, 50 S.Ct. 389, the question lends itself to judicial determination and is of the kind which this court traditionally decides. The relief sought is a definitive adjudication of the disputed constitutional right of the appellant, in the circumstances alleged, to be free from the tax (see Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 724\n, 49 S.Ct. 499); and that adjudication is not, as in Gordon v. United States, 2 Wall. 561, and Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 284, subject to revision by some other and more authoritative agency. Obviously the appellant, whose duty to pay the tax will be determined by the decision of this case, is not attempting to secure an abstract determination by the Court of the validity of a statute (compare Muskrat v. United States, supra, \n219 \nU.S. 361\n, 31 S.Ct. 250; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 162\n, 42 S.Ct. 261), or a decision advising what the law would be on an uncertain or hypothetical state of facts, as was thought to be the case in Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S.Ct. 282, and Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n277 \nU.S. 274\n, 48 S.Ct. 507. See, also, Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Marketing Ass'n, \n276 \nU.S. 71, 88\n, 48 S.Ct. 291. Compare Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 463\n, 51 S.Ct. 522. Thus the narrow question presented for determination is whether the controversy before us, which would be justiciable in this Court if presented in a suit for injunction, is any the less so because through a modified procedure appellant has been permitted to present it in the state courts, without praying for an injunc- \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 263]\n\u00a0\n tion or alleging that irreparable injury will result from the collection of the tax.\n While the ordinary course of judicial procedure results in a judgment requiring an award of process or execution to carry it into effect, such relief is not an indispensable adjunct to the exercise of the judicial function. Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 132\n, 47 S.Ct. 511. This court has often exerted its judicial power to adjudicate boundaries between states, although it gave no injunction or other relief beyond the determination of the legal rights which were the subject of controversy between the parties, Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1\n, 26 S.Ct. 408; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158\n, 38 S.Ct. 301, L.R.A. 1918D, 258; Georgia v. South Carolina, \n257 \nU.S. 516\n, 42 S.Ct. 173; Oklahoma v.

Wisconsin, \n272 \nU.S. 398\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, and to review judgments of the Court of Claims, although no process issues against the government, United States v. Jones, \n119 \nU.S. 477\n, 7 S.Ct. 283. Compare District of Columbia v. Eslin, \n183 \nU.S. 62\n, 22 S.Ct. 17; Ex parte Pocono Pines Assembly Hotels Co., \n285 \nU.S. 526\n, 52 S.Ct. 392, reported below in 73 Ct.Cl. 447. As we said in Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 132\n, 47 S.Ct. 511, 514, 'Naturalization proceedings (Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568\n, 46 S.Ct. 425); suits to determine a matrimonial or other status; suits for instructions to a trustee or for the construction of a will ( Traphagen v. Levy, 45 N.J.Eq. 448, 18 A. 222); bills of interpleader, so far as the stakeholder is concerned (Wakeman v. Kingsland, 46 N.J.Eq. 113, 18 A. 680); bills to quiet title where the plaintiff rests his claim on adverse possession (Sharon v. Tucker, \n144 \nU.S. 533\n, 12 S.Ct. 720)-are familiar examples of judicial proceedings which result in an adjudication of the rights of litigants, although execution is not necessary to carry the judgment into effect, in the sense that no damages are required to be paid or acts to be performed by the parties.' See, also, Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 725\n, 49 S.Ct. 499; La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423\n, 20 S.Ct. 168. \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 264]\n\u00a0\n The issues raised here are the same as those which under old forms of procedure could be raised only in a suit for an injunction or one to recover the tax after its payment. But the Constitution does not require that the case or controversy should be presented by traditional forms of procedure, invoking only traditional remedies. The judiciary clause of the Constitution defined and limited judicial power, not the particular method by which that power might be invoked. It did not crystallize into changeless form the procedure of 1789 as the only possible means for presenting a case or controversy otherwise cognizable by the federal courts. Whenever the judicial power is invoked to review a judgment of a state court, the ultimate constitutional purpose is the protection, by the exercise of the judicial function, of rights arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The states are left free to regulate their own judicial procedure. Hence changes merely in the form or method of procedure by which federal rights are brought to final adjudication in the state courts are not enough to preclude review of the adjudication by this Court, so long as the case retains the essentials of an adversary proceeding, involving a real, not a hypothetical, controversy, which is finally determined by the judgment below. See Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 724\n, 49 S.Ct. 499. As the prayer for relief by injunction is not a necessary prerequisite to the exercise of judicial power, allegations of threatened irreparable injury which are material only if an injunction is asked, may likewise be dispensed with if, in other respects, the controversy presented is, as in this case, real and substantial. Such was the purport and effect of our decision in Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, supra, where it was held that a final judgment rendered by a state court in an adversary proceeding brought under a state statute to determine the validity of liens about to be imposed for benefits assessed under a city improvement ordinance presented a case \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 265]\n\u00a0\n within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, we must consider the constitutional questions raised by the appeal.\n Chapter 58, Tennessee Public Acts 1923, as amended by chapter 67, Tennessee Public Acts 1925, is said, by its caption, to impose a privilege tax on 'persons ... and corporations engaged in or carrying on the business ... of selling or storing or distributing gasoline ...' within the state at the rate of 2 cents per gallon on the gasoline sold or stored, the tax 'to be used solely in the construction and maintenance of a highway system in the State.' But section 3 (as amended by Pub. Acts Tenn. 1925, c. 67,  2) provides: 'The tax imposed by this Act shall apply to persons, firms, or corporations, dealers or distributors, storing any of the products mentioned in this Act, and distributing the same, or allowing the same to be withdrawn from storage, whether such withdrawal be for sale or other use. ...' Storage of the gasoline and withdrawal of it from storage within the state for use or sale are, as the state Supreme Court has held, the events which, by the very terms of the statute, call it into operation. Foster & Creighton Co. v. Graham, 154 Tenn. 412, 420, 285 S.W. 570, 47 A.L.R. 971; Quick Service Tire Co. v. Smith, 156 Tenn. 96, 102, 299 S.W. 807.\n Appellant, an interstate rail carrier, purchases large quantities of gasoline outside the state of Tennessee and brings it into the state in tank cars, from which it is unloaded and placed in its own storage tanks. None of it is sold by appellant, but all is withdrawn and used by it as a source of motive power in interstate railway operation in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, and Georgia. Storage of the gasoline is a preliminary step to such use in interstate commerce. The tax is assailed both on the ground that it is imposed on the gasoline while still a subject of interstate commerce in the course of transportation from points of origin to points outside the state of Tennessee, and on the ground that it is in effect a tax upon \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 266]\n\u00a0\n the use of the gasoline in appellant's business as an interstate carrier, and is thus an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n The gasoline, upon being unloaded and stored, ceased to be a subject of transportation in interstate commerce, and lost its immunity as such from state taxation. General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S.Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299; Susquehanna Coal Co. v. South Amboy, \n228 \nU.S. 665, 669\n, 33 S.Ct. 712; Hart Refineries v. Harmon, \n278 \nU.S. 499\n, 49 S.Ct. 188; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472\n, 52 S.Ct. 631. The fact that the oil was, in the ordinary course of appellant's business, later withdrawn from storage for use, some within and some without the state, part of it thus becoming again the subject of interstate transportation, did not affect the power of the state to tax it all before that transportation commenced. Neither the appellant, the shippers, nor the carrier, at the time of the shipment of the gasoline from points of origin, arranged a destination for any part of the oil other than the appellant's storage tanks in Tennessee. Although in the usual course of business a variable and undefined part of it, when segregated for that purpose, would again be transported across state boundaries, appellant was free to distribute the oil either within or without the state for use in its business or for any other purpose. As nothing in the transaction before the withdrawal from storage in Tennessee can be said to have given any ascertainable part of the gasoline a destination to points beyond the state, the case is distinguishable from Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, \n279 \nU.S. 95\n, 49 S.Ct. 292, and Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111\n, 33 S.Ct. 229. The oil in storage was not a subject of interstate commerce, and so was a part of the common mass of goods within the state, subject to local taxation. General Oil Co. v. Crain, supra; Susquehanna Coal Co. v. South Amboy, supra; Bacon v. Illinois, supra. Compare Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Standard Oil Co., \n275 \nU.S. 257\n, 48 S.Ct. 107. \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 267]\n\u00a0\n We cannot say that the tax is a forbidden burden on interstate commerce because appellant uses the gasoline, subsequent to the incidence of the tax, as an instrument of interstate commerce. Taxes said to burden interstate commerce directly when levied upon or measured by the operation of interstate commerce or gross receipts derived from it, are beyond the state taxing power, East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission of Ohio, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S.Ct. 499; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 171 S., 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 126, and a tax levied upon the use of gasoline in generating motive power for a ferryboat used exclusively in interstate commerce has been held to be so direct and immediate a burden on the commerce itself as to be invalid, Helson v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S.Ct. 279.\n But interstate rail carriers are not wholly immune from other forms of nondiscriminatory state taxation, even though the burden of the tax is thus indirectly or incidentally imposed upon the interstate commerce in which they are engaged. It cannot be doubted that, when the gasoline came to rest in storage, the state was as free to tax it, notwithstanding its prospective use as an instrument of interstate commerce, as it was to tax appellant's right of way, rolling stock, or other instruments of interstate commerce, which are subject to local property taxes.

Middelkamp, \n256 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 41 S.Ct. 489; St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350\n, 35 S.Ct. 99; Kansas City, Ft. S. & M.R. Co. v.

The power to \n\n[288 U.S. 249, 268]\n\u00a0\n tax property, the sum of all the rights and powers incident to ownership, necessarily includes the power to tax its constituent elements. See Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 U.S. 124\n, 136-138, 50 S.Ct. 46. Hence there can be no valid objection to the taxation of the exercise of any right or power incident to appellant's ownership of the gasoline, which falls short of a tax directly imposed on its use in interstate commerce, deemed forbidden in Helson v. Kentucky, supra. Here the tax is imposed on the successive exercise of two of those powers, the storage and withdrawal from storage of the gasoline. Both powers are completely exercised before use of the gasoline in interstate commerce begins. The tax imposed upon their exercise is therefore not one imposed on the use of the gasoline as an instrument of commerce, and the burden of it is too indirect and remote from the function of interstate commerce itself to transgress constitutional limitations. See Eastern Air Transport v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 147\n, 52 S.Ct. 340.\n Appellant objects that the tax violates the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it is levied as a charge for the use of the highways which appellant does not use. But the levy is a tax, not a toll or charge for use of the highways (see Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 68 A.L.R. 194), and the constitutional power to levy taxes does not depend upon the enjoyment by the taxpayer of any special benefit from the use of the funds raised by taxation. Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, supra; St. Louis & Southwestern R. Co. v. Nattin, \n277 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 48 S.Ct. 438. The allegations of the bill showing that a heavier burden of taxation is imposed upon railroads than upon common carriers by motorbus, examined in the light of the applicable statutes of the state, fall short of alleging a discrimination forbidden by either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The procedure authorized by this statute has been extensively adopted both in this country and abroad.

U. S.(1933)\nNo. 39\nArgued: October 9, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederic M. P. Pearse, of Newark, N.J. (Mr. Max Mehler, of Newark, N.J., on the brief), for petitioner. \n\n[290 U.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the trial court where he was defendant under a criminal information, petitioner Nathanson duly, but unsuccessfully, challenged the admission as evidence of certain liquors seized under color of a search warrant issued, he claimed, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment against him.\n Upon complaint of the customs agent in charge, a state judge sent out the questioned warrant. Its pertinent recitals and command follow:\n'Whereas said Francis B. Laughlin has stated under his oath that he has cause to suspect and does believe that certain merchandise, to wit: Certain liquors of foreign origin a more particular description of which cannot be given, upon which the duties have not been paid, or which has otherwise been brought into the United States contrary to law, and that said merchandise is now deposited and contained within the premises of J. J. Nathanson said premises being described as a 2 story frame dwelling located at 117 No. Bartram Ave. ...; and\n\n'Whereas said Francis B. Laughlin has requested that a warrant issue to him, authorizing him to enter said premises and search for and seize said merchandise: \n\n[290 U.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n 'Now, therefore, you are commanded, in the name and by the authority of the President of the United States, to enter and search the premises hereinbefore described, in the daytime (if a dwelling house) at any time of the day or night (if other than a dwelling house) and to seize and take into your possession the merchandise hereinbefore described, or so much thereof as may be found, to the end that the same may be dealt with according to law.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals said: 'The appellant contends that the affidavit upon which the search warrant was issued showed no facts upon which to base a finding of probable cause; that the search warrant was therefore illegal; and that the use of the property so seized as evidence in a criminal prosecution amounted to a violation of the protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. ...\n'Had this warrant issued under authority of the Prohibition Act, it would be invalid, since the affidavit was merely based upon cause to suspect and suspicion. It issued, however, under the authority of (section 595) the Tariff Act of 1930 ...' 46 Stat. 752, c. 497 (19 USCA  1595). ( This is identical with section 595, Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 983, c. 356 (19 USCA  499) copied in the margin1.)\n\n And it held: 'In the instant case the seizure was under the tariff laws. The government had a pecu- \n\n[290 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n niary interest in the smuggled goods. Following the reasoning in the cases cited, we conclude that that interest was sufficient to justify the issuance of the search warrant and that the search and seizure, based on the sworn complaint (phrased almost in the very words of the Tariff Act) and the warrant thereon, did not violate the constitutional rights of the defendant. This court, in Bookbinder v. United States (C.C.A.) 287 F. 790, certiorari denied \n262 \nU.S. 748\n, 43 S.Ct. 523, held that evidence obtained on a search warrant for violation of the customs laws is admissible in a prosecution for violation of the prohibition laws.'\n We think the court below acted upon an erroneous view. Its judgment must be reversed.\n This court has often spoken concerning searches and seizures and the limitations of the Fourth Amendment. Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch, 339; Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S.Ct. 372; Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S.Ct. 341, L.R.A. 1915B, 834, Ann.

See, also, Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) p. 427.\n Here we are dealing with a warrant to search a private dwelling said to have been authorized by the Tariff Act. It went upon a mere affirmation of suspicion and belief without any statement of adequate supporting facts.\n All unreasonable searches and seizures are absolutely forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. In some circumstances a public officer may make a lawful seizure without a warrant; in others he may act only under permission of one. In the present case the place of search and seizure was a private dwelling. The challenged warrant is said to constitute adequate authority therefor. The legality of the seizure depends upon its sufficiency. Did it issue upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation within the intendment of the amendment? \n\n[290 U.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n The amendment applies to warrants under any statute; revenue, tariff, and all others. No warrant inhibited by it can be made effective by an act of Congress or otherwise.\n It is argued that searches for goods smuggled into the United States in fraud of the revenue, based upon affidavits of suspicion or belief, have been sustained from the earliest times; that this practice was authorized by the Revenue Act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat. 43, also subsequent like enactments. But we think nothing in these statutes indicates that a warrant to search a private dwelling may rest upon mere affirmance of suspicion or belief without disclosure of supporting facts or circumstances.\n Although relied upon, we find nothing in Locke v. United States and Boyd v. United States which upholds the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The first of these causes was a proceeding to forfeit a cargo of imported goods seized for violation of the revenue laws. It presented no question concerning the validity of a warrant. The second denied the right to compel production of private papers in a suit by the United States to establish a forfeiture of goods fraudulently imported.\n Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may not properly issue a warrant to search a private dwelling unless he can find probable cause therefor from facts or circumstances presented to him under oath or affirmation. Mere affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act 1922 and Act of 1930,  595. Searches and Seizures. (a) Warrant.

CORIELL(1933)\nNo. 65\nArgued: December 15, 1933Decided: May 22, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Tuttle and Saul S. Myers, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. John S. Sheppard and Charles B. McInnis, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity of the reorganization of Morris White, Inc., pursuant to a decree of the federal court for Southern New York. The old company, a New York corporation, is said to have been the largest manufacturer in the world of ladies' handbags and fancy leather goods. For many years prior to 1930 the business had been very profitable. Then, the company became financially embarrassed, partly through cancellation of orders due to the general depression, partly through withdrawals of large sums by Morris White for investments in stocks and real estate. The bank creditors intervened; \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n and for nearly six months prior to April 6, 1931, the business was conducted by White under their financial supervision and control. On that day, they caused to be brought in the name of Coriell, a citizen of New Jersey, this suit through which the reorganization was effected.\n The bill alleged that the company's assets exceed $4,000,000 and that its liabilities are approximately $1,000,000; that no quick assets are available to meet liabilities immediately payable; nd that unless a receiver is appointed the assets will be wasted and the business destroyed through proceedings of creditors seeking payment. The prayers were that a receiver be appointed with power to carry on the business; and that, at the proper time, the properties be sold for the benefit of creditors, or be returned to the company. On the same day on which the bill was filed, the defendant answered admitting its allegations and assenting to the appointment of a temporary receiver. The Irving Trust Company was appointed. The receiver employed as counsel the solicitor for the complainant.\n The receiver called promptly a meeting of the creditors; and a committee there elected examined into the company's affairs. The committee prepared a plan of reorganization which was submitted to the court in the form of an offer by Lily White (wife of Morris) to purchase all the assets. The plan (with later amendments) provided that all the purchased assets should be transferred, subject to existing liens, to a new corporation called the Morris White Handbags Corporation; that all creditors of the old company having claims not exceeding $100 be paid in cash; that the claims of creditors having priority by law, the fees and expenses of the receiver, the counsel fees and other expenses of the Creditors' Committee be paid or assumed by the new company; and that all other creditors should receive in payment of their claims 20 per cent. in \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n unsecured notes of the new company and 80 per cent. in its preferred stock. No new money was to be embarked in the enterprise by either the Whites or others. Morris White (who had created and managed the business and owned all of the stock of the old company except a minority interest held by his brother, an employee) was to agree to serve the new company for three years at a salary not exceeding $60,000 a year. He and his wife were to have all of the common stock and, through control of the board of directors, substantial control of the new corporation. Accompanying the offer was an accountants' certificate unitemized stating that the liabilities shown on the books of the company as of April 6, the date of the appointment of the temporary receiver, were $1,072,000.30.\n On May 12, 1931, the District Court entered an order requiring creditors to show cause on May 26th why that offer should not be accepted; and to consider and act upon any other offer which might then be made. On May 26th and 27th hearings were held. The receiver made no recommendation. The committee made no written report. Its counsel, who represented also several of the bank creditors, recommended, on its behalf, acceptance of the plan. He stated that the committee believed, in view of Morris White's record of achievement, that he would within a few years earn profits sufficient to pay all the creditors amounts equal to their existing claims, if he were permitted to resume the control and management of the business, with the prospect of complete ownership. The bank creditors and the larger merchandise creditors urged acceptance of the plan. The federal and state governments offered to agree that the taxes due them might be paid by the new company in installments.\n The receiver had made no inventory and had not determined the amount of the liabilities. No one had made \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n even an estimate of the value of the assets as of the date of the order to show cause, or, except as stated below, as of the date of the hearing. No figures were presented to indicate the course and results of the business while under the informal supervision and control of the banks, during the five months prior to the appointment of the temporary receiver; or during the seven weeks following his appointment. But that the bill had grossly overstated the assets was obvious. Instead of assets exceeding $4,000,000 as there alleged, it appeared that those available were worth, at most, a fourth of that amount. Items aggregating.$2,277,714.89 consisted of obligations and securities of associated and subsidiary companies, which were probably worthless. The substantial assets consisted, according to the books, of the following items: Merchandise and supplies which had cost.$ 1,241,208.09; bills receivable aggregating $301,852.12, of which $251,409. 42 were pledged to the banks; machinery entered as having cost, less depreciation, $74,265.01; and $5,614.60 cash. Based on an appraisal made by a subcommittee shortly after the appointment of the temporary receiver, the Creditors' Committee estimated the value of the merchandise as of that date to be $717,000, on the basis of a continuing business. Counsel for the receiver, estimating the value of the merchandise as of the date of the hearing, on the basis of a continuing business, stated that it was worth about $462,500; and that there was cash on hand in the amount of $54, 000 and unpledged accounts receivable of $67,000. He stated that the committee estimated the value of the merchandise, if disposed of at forced sale, to be $357,000. Another statement was made to the effect that the committee estimated the total value of the assets at forced sale to be $ 182,000. Whether this figure included the assets pledged to the banks was left in doubt. The court was told that Morris White had an informal \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n assurance that banks would give to the new company the necessary temporary accommodations required for working capital.\n A substantial minority of the creditors objected strenuously to the acceptance of the plan. The dissenting creditors urged, in support of their objections, that no inventory and valuation of the assets had been made by the receiver or under any order of the court; and that not even the amount and character of the liabilities had been determined by the receiver, or otherwise by the court. They questioned whether bank creditors had not received (while they were in substantial control of the business) unlawful preferences. They asked that time be given for the appropriate determination of these matters and for further investigation as to the merits of the plan. They pointed out that under it the banks were to receive notes and preferred stock to the full amount of their claims, although they held assigned accounts as collateral. And they protested against disposing of the assets otherwise than for cash after public sale and without competitive bids being sought. The committee of creditors insisted that any delay would be disastrous, the business being seasonal.\n The District Judge announced, at the close of the hearing on May 27th, that he would direct the receiver to accept the Lily White offer. An order making permanent the receivership was entered later. On June 15, 1931, pursuant to the decree, the assets were transferred to the Morris White Handbags Corporation. And it entered upon the conduct of the business, although application for allowance of an appeal had been promptly made by the National Surety Company and other dissenting creditors. Five months later the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court and remanded the cause \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. 54 F.(2d) 255, 260.\n The Court of Appeals held, among other things, that creditors who refuse to assent to a plan of reorganization have 'the right to share immediately in the proceeds of a forced sale of the corporation's assets'; and that a court of equity lacks 'power to compel a creditor of any kind to accept stocks or promises to pay in the future in full extinguishment of his claim, without being afforded the alternative of receiving his proportionate share of the proceeds of the conventional sale of the property in cash.' It declared that ordinarily dissenting creditors would be 'entitled to a public sale with competitive bidding, the assets to be sold to the highest bidder'; that this right must be fully protected; but that, in the case at bar, this right could be fully protected without setting aside the sale made to the new corporation; that the right of the dissenting creditors would be protected 'b having an appraisal of the value of their respective claims made before a master, to be appointed, who will take an account of the assets and liabilities of Morris White, Inc., ascertaining the value of the assets as if sold at a public sale'; by the payment to them of 'their proportionate share of the price which would have been realized at such sale after deduction of administration expenses'; and by providing that if 'payment is not thus made in cash, the several amounts which appellants are found entitled to may be collected by a sale of the property transferred to the new corporation.'\n Pursuant to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court entered on February 2, 1932, a decree which ordered that (subject to the orders to be made), 'the reorganization plan approved by it June 15, 1931, be allowed to continue in operation and the Morris White Handbags Corporation be and is hereby permitted to continue in the conduct of the business heretofore \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n transferred to it. ...'1 On February 23, 1932, the dissenting creditors petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals entered November 23, 1931; and the writ was granted on May 12, 1932. \n286 \nU.S. 537\n, 52 S.Ct. 578\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n The petitioenrs contend that the District Court had no power to deprive the dissenting creditors of a cash share in the assets; that the amount of this share should have been determined by a public sale; that the right of dissenting creditors was not protected by the decree directing an appraisal (in 1932) of the assets as if disposed of at public sale on June 15, 1931; and that they were entitled to recover their claims in full. The respondents insist that the District Court had power to compel participation in the reorganization without the alternative of a share of the assets in cash; and that even if the District Court lacked that power, the modification of the decree by the Circuit Court of Appeals gave full protection to the rights of the dissenting creditors. We have no oc- \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n casion to pass upon any of these contentions,2 for we are of opinion that the decree approving the plan should have been reversed in its entirety because the procedure pursued by the District Court was improper.\n First. The nonassenting creditors were entitled to have the plan and their objections considered in an orderly way, and to a decree based on adequate data. The District Court had before it, in support of the plan, only informal, inadequate, and conflicting ex parte assertions unsupported by testimony. It undertook to pass upon the wisdom and fairness of the plan of reorganization, and the rights of nonassenting creditors. For the proper disposition of these questions, definite, detailed, and authentic information was essential. Such information was wholly lacking. The receiver submitted no facts and made no recommendations. There was no evidence on which the court could have found even that a majority of the unsecured creditors favored the plan. \n3\n There was \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 436]\n\u00a0\n no valuation of the assets by a disinterested appraiser; no account of the results of the operations of the business during the five months in which it was under the control of the banks; no account of the result of the operations under the receivership; and no dependable schedule of liabilities of the corporation showing the number of creditors, the amount owed to each, and the collateral held. A trustworthy appraisal; an account showing the result of recent operations of the business; an accurate determination of the number of creditors, the amounts of their respective claims, and the extent to which collateral given or payments made to them might be deemed preferences; these were facts which might have influenced the court in deciding whether the plan should be approved or should be approved only upon a public sale. The failure to require relevant data before deciding whether the plan should be approved was not cured by the declaration of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the dissenting creditors were entitled to an aliquot share of what, a year later, it might be estimated the property would have brought at a public sale, and authorizing them to recover that amount, if assets available to satisfy their claims were then available.\n Second. Every important determination by the court in receivership proceedings calls for an informed, independent judgment. In the case at bar special reasons existed why the court should have secured adequate, trustworthy information. The proceeding was not an adversary one; and jurisdiction rested wholly upon the consent of the defendant corporation. \n4\n The court did not have \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 437]\n\u00a0\n the advice of its receiver. The creditors who approved of the plan of reorganization appeared to be actuated in their recommendations and desires by considerations not applicable to the dissenting creditors. For the bank creditors, unlike the others, were to a large extent secured by the pledge of assets and may, moreover, have received preferences which would be held invalid if bankruptcy proceedings were instituted. The assenting merchandise creditors were interested not merely as creditors but as sellers of goods; and it appeared that at least some were far more interested in expected profits from future sales than in possible dividends on their existing claims. On the other hand, the dissenting creditors, largely credit indemnity companies, were anxious to have determined the amounts of their risks and to obtain as promptly as possible dividends in cash.\n The respondents directed attention to the proposed amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, which have been enacted in part since the argument;5 and, as justifying the procedure challenged, urge that those amendments confer power on the District Courts in Bankruptcy similar to that exercised in the case at bar. But this is not true. Those amendments relating to compositions and exten- \n\n[289 U.S. 426, 438]\n\u00a0\n sions for insolvent debtors make detailed provision for an inventory by the receiver; for a schedule of liabilities; for an examination of the debtor; and for fixing, with reference to the convenience of the parties, a date and place for hearings upon applications for confirmation of composition or extension proposals. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; that of the District Court entered February 2, 1932 vacated; and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. We do not pass upon the scope, the measure or the incidence of the relief to which the petitioners are entitled; among other reasons, because of the following facts brought to our attention at the argument. On April 29, 1932, the Morris White Handbags Corporation was adjudged bankrupt. On June 6, 1932, a sale for $53,850 of all its tangible assets was confirmed by the District Court. The Morris White Handbags Corporation, its trustee in bankruptcy, and the purchaser at the bankruptcy sale are not parties to the case at bar.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decree entered February 2, 1932, modified that of June 15, 1931, as follows:\n (A) It reversed the same so far as it affects the rights of the National Surety Company and the other dissenting creditors.\n (B) It provided that a special master be appointed who shall:\n (1) 'Ascertain the several amounts of (their) respective claims,' among other things.\n (2) 'Make an appraisal of the realizable value of said claims as of June 15, 1931' and that to this end the Special Master 'shall ascertain and report the then realizable value of said assets as if sold at public sale; and shall also take account of the liabilities of Morris White, Inc., as of April 6, 1931, and shall ascertain and report which, if any, of said liabilities are entitled to priority of payment; and shall also take an account of the obligations of the Receiver herein and of the expenses of administration of the estate herein incurred up to the fifteenth day of June, 1931; and shall determine through examination of officers and\/or agents of the defendant and\/or The Morris White Handbags Corporation, the nature, quality and amount of inventory on hand as of such dates as may be pertinent to this enquiry.\n (3) 'Ascertain and report the aliquot share of the assets to be awarded and paid in cash, subject to further order of this court, to National Surety Company (and to the other dissenting creditors) out of the sum ascertained to be the amount that would have been realized for the assets of Morris White, Icn., on June 15, 1931, had a public sale of said assets been held, after the deduction from said sum of such portion of the obligations of the Receiver and the expenses of administration herein as would have been properly chargeable against the estate had the assets of Morris White, Inc., been liquidated by sale, and the proceeds distributed to creditors in ordinary course, and after the deduction of the liabilities of Morris White, Inc., entitled to priority of payment; or at the option of each of them the preferred stock and notes heretofore offered to them, pursuant to said offer of Lily White, may and shall in like manner be valued by said Special Master, as of the date the reorganization plan became effective, to be awarded and to be paid in cash to them or any of them subject to the further order of the court; ... \n (4) 'That pending the entry of an order of this court upon the report of the said Special Master and for the purpose of securing to National Surety Company (and the other dissenting creditors) payment by the said The Morris White Handbags Corp., pursuant to the order herein dated June 15, 1931, of the amounts which may be determined to be paid to them in cash upon their respective claims, a lien is hereby imposed upon all the assets of Mo ris White, Inc., transferred to and remaining in the possession of said The Morris White Handbags Corp. pursuant to said order dated June 15, 1931; except that as to such of said assets as the said The Morris White Handbags Corp. shall hereafter in good faith transfer in the regular course of its business for fair and proper consideration, said lien shall attach to the proceeds of such transfer or successive transfers of such proceeds, and the said The Morris White Handbags Corp. is hereby enjoined and restrained subject to the further order of this court, from transferring any of said assets of Morris White, Inc., remaining in its possession except in good faith in the regular course of its business and for fair and proper consideration, unless the said The Morris White Handbags Corp. shall file a bond or other security in such amount as may be fixed and approved by this court after hearing the parties in interest ; ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The petitioners made the further contention that the court should have ordered the case to proceed in bankruptcy, or at least should not have permitted it to continue in equity. This question was not before us on the writ of certiorari. The order of June 3, 1931, making the receivership permanent, recited that there was no opposition to the order. It was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and certiorari was denied by this Court. \n286 \nU.S. 553\n, 52 S.Ct. 578. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Even the number of creditors appears to have been undetermined. The number was stated by Mr. White to be 150, in addition to 5 bank creditors. The president of one of the creditor banks gave the number as 150 including the banks. Counsel for Morris White, Inc., stated that there were 245 creditors, 'not 145.' Counsel for the receiver stated that there were 193 creditors whose claims were each less than $100. Counsel for Morris White, Inc., gave the number of such creditors as 50 or 100. The amount represented by the creditors' committee appears likewise to have been in doubt. Counsel for the committee stated that it represented merchandise claims in the amount of $178,000. Counsel for Morris White, Inc., stated that the committee represented merchandise claims of over $ 300,000; later he gave the figure as $180,000 out of $442,000 of merchandise claims. At the argument in this Court it was stated that, at the hearing before the District Court pursuant to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, a new claim against Morris White, Inc., in the sum of $1,025,000 was presented and that a rule to show cause issued. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Harkin v.

Reeder, both of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On May 6, 1924 (43 Stat. 1949) the President of the United States determined and proclaimed that an increase in the rate of duty on sodium nitrite was necessary to equalize the differences in the costs of production in the United States and the principal competing country, Norway, and that to that end the duty should be increased from 3 cents per pound to 4 1\/2 cents per pound. The proclamation was made after an investigation and report by the United States Tariff Commission under the flexible tariff provisions of the Tariff Act of 1922. Tariff Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356,  315, 42 Stat. 858, 941-943 (19 USCA  154- 159). After the new rate of duty had thus gone into effect, there were new importations of sodium nitrite at the port of New York. The duty was assessed by the customs officers in accordance with the proclamation; and protests were filed by the petitioner, which is the exclusive agent within the United States of the leading exporter to this country of the commodity affected. The protests were made upon the ground that the Tariff Commission in investigating the costs of production in the United States and Norway had not given the petitioner the hearing prescribed by the statute, and that all that followed was of no validity. A judgment of the Customs Court overruling the protests (T.D. 44,824, 59 Treas.Dec. 921) was affirmed by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. T.D. 45,674. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n In October, 1922, the American Nitrogen Products Company submitted to the Tariff Commission a request for a report and recommendation to the President that the duty on sodium nitrite be increased 50 per cent. It \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n stated in this request that with every reasonable effort to economize it had been unable to compete with the foreign manufacturers and had been forced to close its plant. In response to this request, the Commission on March 27, 1923, ordered that an investigation be made, declared that a public hearing would be held on a date thereafter to be fixed, and gave public notice of its order. The Commission then proceeded to the business of investigation. From the chief producers of sodium nitrite in the United States (the American Nitrogen Products Company and another), the agents of the Commission received the fullest measure of disclosure as to the costs of production and other details of the business. The information as to costs was subject to a pledge of secrecy; the manufacturers taking the position, to which the Commission acceded, that costs were trade secrets, to be withheld from competitors. The chief foreign producers were two; the Norsk-Hydro, a Norwegian company, represented by the petitioner, and the Badische-Anilin of Germany. Both foreign producers refused to supply the investigators for the Commission with any statement of costs, or to permit access to their records. The Norwegian company wrote afterwards in a cablegram to the petitioner: 'On principle we always refuse publish cost price, consequently did not furnish investigators any information enabling them calculate cost price.' The Commission was hindered, but not baffled. Its investigators went to Norway, and, consulting other sources of information, made an estimate of cost as best they could. By July 20, 1923, the preliminary investigation was over, and the Commission was ready for a public hearing. It gave public notice on that date that on September 10, 1923, all parties interested would be given an opportunity to appear before the Commission, to produce evidence, and to be heard with regard to differences in the cost of sodium nitrite and any other facts and conditions affecting the inquiry. \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n At the time thus appointed, the petitioner appeared, represented by its counsel. It made a motion at the beginning that it receive a complete copy of the request or application for an increase of rates. The copy already furnished to it was not complete, in that the details of the costs of production at the applicant's factory had been left out. The president of the applicant protested that the information as to costs had been given under a promise to hold it confidential, and the chairman of the Commission thereupon assured him that the promise would be kept. The request of the importer was accordingly refused. The hearing then proceeded; the president of the American Nitrogen Products Company appearing as a witness. He gave general information as to the state of the industry, showing by his testimony that the foreign producers were selling their product in this country at a lower price than they were selling it in their home markets, and showing also that by reason of a difference in the manufacturing process in this country and abroad the foreign producers were able to manufacture sodium nitrite as a by-product, and thus to dispose of it far more cheaply than was possible here. A change of the domestic plant in adaptation to the foreign process would involve prohibitory expense. Counsel for the importer was allowed to cross-examine as to everything brought out at the public hearing. He was not allowed, however, to extract from the witness a statement of the costs of production; the witness again protesting that disclosure of these costs, though it had been made to the Commission in the preliminary investigation, ought not to be made in public for the use of a competitor. At the end of the examination, there was an adjournment of the hearing until September 26.\n In the interval, there were other happenings that bear on the merits of the controversy. On September 15, 1923, the Commission made public a report or summary of its \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 300]\n\u00a0\n information, still omitting, however, any statement as to the costs of production at the applicant's domestic plant. On September 11, it received a letter from the importer's counsel renewing his demand for a complete copy of the application and demanding at the same time that 'every particle of evidence gathered by the Commission or its representatives' be submitted to his inspection, and that he be accorded the privilege of examining any and all witnesses, including the field agents of the Commission, with reference thereto. On September 24, the Commission wrote to counsel refusing his request for a disclosure of 'every particle of evidence,' but stating that the American Nitrogen Products Company had agreed to disclose its cost of production data if the opposition, the Norwegian Nitrogen Products Company, would furnish cost data for the Norwegian product. The importer did not accept this offer. It did not present any excuse for failing to accept it. It did not even state that it had made any effort to induce its principal abroad to supply it with the necessary data. It paid no attention to the suggestion that disclosure should be mutual, and stood upon its rights, whatever they might be.\n On September 26, the hearing went on again. Counsel for the importers submitted copies of cablegrams exchanged between his client and its Norwegian principal. The cablegram from the client informed the principal of the estimate of costs of production in Norway contained in the summary prepared by the Commission. The answering cablegram stated that the estimate was far too low, but confirmed the report of the investigators that information had been refused on the ground that the costs were confidential. That part of the cablegram has been quoted already. The chairman, responding to a request for an adjournment of thirty days, made inquiry of counsel whether definite figures would be obtained from Nor- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 301]\n\u00a0\n way in return for the extension. To this counsel retorted that he was not offering any consideration, nor joining in any barter, but 'relying strictly upon the statute.' The outcome of the colloquy was an order for an adjournment until October 6. Before this adjournment was taken, counsel submitted five separate requests. Request number one was that his client 'have reasonable opportunity to inspect and to be heard upon all evidence which has been offered in this case, not deemed by the Commission trade secrets, or not, in fact, trade secrets.' Request number two was to inspect and to be fully heard upon 'all the evidence in the possession of the Commission as to the cost of power in the United States in the production of nitrite.' Number three was a like request with reference to the number of laborers employed by the American Nitrogen Products Company, and the wages paid. Number four was a like request with reference to the capital invested in its plant. Number five was a request that the experts of the Commission be produced for cross-examination with reference to the information collected by them in the course of the inquiry, and that the importer be permitted to offer testimony and to be heard in opposition thereto.\n At the adjourned hearing on October 6, the Commission announced its ruling with reference to these requests; notice of the ruling having been previously conveyed to counsel for the importer. The decision was, in substance, that data gathered by the Commission with the understanding that they were to be treated as confidential would be withheld; that the investigators working for the Commission would not be required to produce such data or to be cross-examined about them; but that as to all these subjects of inquiry the importer would be permitted to offer any evidence that it was able to present, and to be heard in oral and written argument with reference thereto. \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 302]\n\u00a0\n Upon the announcement of this ruling counsel for the importer stated that he would offer no testimony on behalf of his client, but would thereafter file a brief.\n On December 12, 1923, before the Commission had reported to the President, the petitioner applied to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus directing the Commission to disclose the information sought. The petition was dismissed; the court ruling that the action of the Commission had been in conformity with law. An appeal to the Court of Appeals followed, but while it was pending the Commission made a report to the President, and upon the basis of that report the President issued his proclamation for an increase of the duty. The Court of Appeals expressed an opinion, not called for by its judgment, that the information should have been given. It decided, however, that the petition had become moot by force of the action of the President (U.S. ex rel. Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. U.S. Tariff Commission, 55 App.D.C. 366, 6 F.(2d) 491), and so did this Court. United States ex rel. Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co., Inc., v. United States Tariff Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 106\n, 47 S. Ct. 499. The stages through which the controversy has come to us again have already been described.\n The Tariff Act of 1922 (chapter 356,  315, 42 Stat. 858, 941) gives authority to the President to increase or decrease the rates of duty specified in the act, if he finds upon investigation that increase or decrease is necessary in order to equalize the differences in the cost of production in the United States and elsewhere. It provides (section 315(c )), 19 USCA  156, that in ascertaining these differences, 'the President, in so far as he finds it practicable, shall take into consideration (1) the differences in conditions in production, including wages, costs of material, and other items in costs of production of such or similar articles in the United States and in competing foreign countries; (2) the differences in the wholesale selling prices of domestic and foreign articles in the principal markets of the United States; (3) \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 303]\n\u00a0\n advantages granted to a foreign producer by a foreign government, or by a person, partnership, corporation, or association in a foreign country; and ( 4) any other advantages or disadvantages in competition.' This provision is followed by others designed to give protection against hasty or ill- considered changes. There shall be no proclamation under the authority of the statute until an investigation to assist the President has been made by the United States Tariff Commission, which is 'authorized to adopt such reasonable procedure, rules, and regulations as it may deem necessary.' Coupled with these general directions is a mandate more particular, which is the petitioner's chief reliance. 'The commission shall give reasonable public notice of its hearings, and shall give reasonable opportunity to parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard.' Section 315(c).\n The decision of this case hinges upon our answer to the question whether the petitioner has been 'heard' in accordance with the statute. Does the requirement of a hearing mean that every producer or importer affected by a tariff may explore at will the data collected by the Commission as to the capital, the wages, the cost of material and manufacture, in the business of any other person similarly affected, and may cross-examine investigators and competitors upon the data thus laid bare? If something less than this is exacted, is there still a minimum of disclosure without which the purpose of the hearing will be thwarted altogether, and was this minimum attained by what was done by the Commission here?\n\n 1. \nHistory, analogy, and administrative practice point with sureness to the conclusion that letters of marque have not been issued to every producer or importer affected by a tariff to capture knowledge of the business of every rival so affected in all the intimate details uncovered to the investigating officers.\n The appeal to history is a threefold one: To the history of the process of tariff making by Congress and congres- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 304]\n\u00a0\n sional committees; to the history of this statute in its progress through the Houses; and to the history of this investigating commission and of others that came before.\n The process of tariff making by Congress and congressional committees is not different in essentials from that for legislation generally. If the bill has gone to a committee, the practice has been general to give the privilege of a hearing to business men and others affected by its provisions. The hearing is not one that may be demanded as of right. A change of the tariff laws like a change of any other statute is not subject to impeachment on the score of invalidity, though notice to those affected has been omitted altogether. Luce, Legislative Procedure, p. 143, cf. Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470\n, 24 S.Ct. 349. Even so, the privilege is now so fortified by practice that it may fairly be taken for granted. But the hearing when given is not similar to a trial as conducted in a court. The proponents of a bill and the contestants make their statements for and against, bringing forward such confirmatory documents, trade journals, letters, governmental reports, and what not, as they believe to be important. The kind of information thus supplied can be gathered from the proceedings of the committees that reported the Tariff Act in question, the act of 1922, as well as from those leading up to the tariff acts of other years. In none of these congressional hearings has the practice ever prevailed of permitting the advocates of a measure to cross-examine the opponents, or the opponents the advocates, or of compelling the committee itself to submit to an inquisition as to data collected by its members through independent investigation. The committee determines for itself whether its sessions shall be public or private. 'Investigations (in Congress) often proceed behind closed doors, for the manifest reason that otherwise some witnesses would not be frank, perhaps would not attend, putting themselves if \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 305]\n\u00a0\n possible beyond the reach of the committee.' Luce, Legislative Procedure, p. 144. It is all a matter of discretion. What is done by the Tariff Commission and the President in changing the tariff rates to conform to new conditions is in substance a delegation, though a permissible one, of the legislative process. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348; Buttfield v. Stranahan, supra; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 495. The inference is, therefore, a strong one that the kind of hearing assured by the statute to those affected by the change is a hearing of the same order as had been given by congressional committees when the legislative process was in the hands of Congress and no one else. To be sure there has been a change of sanction. What was once a mere practice has been converted into a legal privilege. But the limits of the privilege were not meant to be greatly different from those of the ancient practice that had shaped the course of legislation.\n We have said that the inference is a strong one, yet, of course, it is far from conclusive and might even be inadequate if it were considered by itself. The history of the statute as it passed through the two Houses of the Congress supplies confirmatory evidence. The bill in its early stages empowered the President to change tariff rates, but said nothing whatever as to the manner in which the preliminary investigation should be made. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 7, p. 7108, pt. 11, pp. 11,155, 11,156, 11,193. A letter from President Harding to the chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate recommended that Congress name the Tariff Commission as the source of information and recommendation upon which the President might proclaim a change. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, p. 11,211. Several amendments embodying this recommendation were proposed in each chamber of the Congress. Nowhere in the long debates that followed is there a suggestion by any one that witnesses or others appearing in the \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 306]\n\u00a0\n inquiry should be heard in any other way than according to the customary procedure for investigating bodies. The first amendment named the Tariff Commission as the investigator, but gave no directions as to the mode of action. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, pp. 11,229, 11,232. A second provided that the Commission 'shall give such opportunity as it deems proper for the presentation of material facts in each case and arguments thereon.' 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, p. 11,229. These provisions aroused the fear that at times there might be no hearing, or hearings at which only one side would be permitted to appear. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, p. 11,231. A third amendment, proposed in the Senate, recast the statute by providing that 'the Commission shall give reasonable public notice and shall give reasonable opportunity to parties interested to be present and to produce evidence and to be heard,' which is in the statute as enacted, and by providing also 'said hearings shall be public' and the President shall publish with his findings 'the hearings and testimony.' 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, pp. 11,231, 11,232. These last provisions were omitted in conference, and the section was thus amended to read as it stands today. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 12, p. 12,627. The omission may have been unwise, but it certainly was not inadvertent. The managers on the part of the House reported (62 Cong. Rec., pt. 12, p. 12,660): 'The action of the conferees eliminates the provision of the Senate amendment that the Tariff Commission hearings shall be public and that the President shall make the findings, hearings and testimony in all proceedings public as soon as practicable after the issuance of a proclamation.' The change was criticized in the Senate (62 Cong. Rec., pt. 12, p. 12,888), but in the face of the criticism it was written into the law.\n If Congress was unwilling to prescribe a requirement that the 'hearings shall be public,' or that the President shall publish the testimony when announcing his decision, \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 307]\n\u00a0\n it is hard to believe that it intended every member of the public affected by an increase or decrease of the duty to inspect and copy all the records and data collected by the Commission, and to cross-examine the investigators as well as the producers or importers appearing at the hearing. If a privilege so far reaching was to be accorded as a matter of right, there would be a publicity far greater than any that would result from throwing the doors of the hearings open to all who wished to enter. By the Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463,  706, 39 Stat. 756, 797 (19 USCA  100 and note)), the Commission and its agents are given access to any document pertinent to the subject-matter under investigation in the possession of any one engaged in the production, importation, or distribution of the commodity affected, with power to inspect and copy, to summon witnesses, and to administer oaths. If the hearings are to have the scope for which the petitioner contends, all this information is subject to the call of every business rival, unless it comes within the description of 'trade secrets or processes.' Revenue Act of 1916,  708 ( 19 USCA  105). It happens in this case that the number of competitors is small. Cases may arise in which it will mount into the hundreds. Any one of these competitors will be free, in the view of the petitioner, to pry without hindrance into the business of the others, for everything collected by the Commission will have the quality of a public record. Not only will there be a privilege to inspect whatever is of record, but the process, it is said, may be carried even farther, by examination and cross- examination as to whatever is thus discovered. The statute does not say that the parties affected by the duty may be present during the preliminary investigation by the agents of the Commission. They are to be present at a hearing, which may be public or private as the Commission shall determine. The statute does not say that they are to have an opportunity to produce evidence and to be heard to whatever extent they may desire. It says \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 308]\n\u00a0\n that they are to have a reasonable opportunity, and this subject to the power of the Commission to adopt such reasonable procedure, rules and regulations as it may deem necessary. Nothing in the statute suggests a belief of the lawmakers that every producer or importer was to be viewed, like a party to a lawsuit, as the adversary of every other, with privilege of examination and cross-examination extended through the series. 'There must be a limit to individual argument in such matters if government is to go on.' Holmes, J., in Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Board of Equalization of Colorado, \n239 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 36 S.Ct. 141, 142.\n Our discussion of the significance of history as an aid to the construction of the statute will be inadequate if it is confined to the history of hearings by congressional committees and to the amendments of the bill in its progress through the Houses. There is need to consider also the history of this Commission before the act of 1922, and that of earlier commissions organized for kindred purposes.\n The powers of the President under the flexible tariff provisions of the act of 1922 differ in degree rather than in kind from powers that have long been his. By an act of March 3, 1815 (3 Stat. 224), the President was empowered to give effect to a repeal of duties upon imports whenever he was 'satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties' of the foreign nation affected, 'so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States,' had been abolished. See Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 685\n, 12 S.Ct. 495. Powers very similar were conferred in later years. See, e.g., Act of March 3, 1817, c. 39, 3 Stat. 361; Act of January 7, 1824, c. 4, 4 Stat. 2, 3; Act of May 31, 1830, c. 219, 4 Stat. 425; Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, 23 Stat. 57; Field v. Clark, supra, pages 686, 689 of 143 U.S., 12 S.Ct. 495. 1 The Tar- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 309]\n\u00a0\n iff Act of 1890 went farther than those before it. Whenever the President became satisfied that the government of any country producing and exporting certain enumerated articles had imposed duties upon the agricultural or other products of the United States which he found to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable, he was to have power to suspend the provisions of the tariff law whereby importation of the enumerated articles had previously been free. 26 Stat. 567, 612, c. 1244. Broader still was the delegation of power under the Tariff Act of 1909, which set up a system of maximum and minimum rates with permission to the President to adopt the one set or the other. 36 Stat. 11, 82, c. 6. Under none of these statutes was executive action conditioned upon an inquiry and report by any officer or department. In the fulfilment of his duties, the President consulted whatever sources of information appeared to be appropriate, and, when satisfied as to the facts, made proclamation of the action.\n The first statute for the appointment of a commission to deal with the problem of the tariff was enacted in 1882. 22 Stat. 64, c. 145. See F. W. Taussig, Tariff History of the United States (8th Ed.) p. 231. The Commission, which was to be an investigating body merely, was established as an aid to Congress rather than the President. It was to report at the next session of Congress what changes it thought desirable. After the expiration of its life, neither President nor Congress received official aid that was more than desultory or occasional till a body styled the Tariff Board was organized by President Taft in 1909. Taussig, supra, pp. 405, 481. This board was established under a provision of the Tariff Act of that year, which by section 2 gave the President a choice between two sets of duties; a maximum and a minimum. 'To secure information to assist the President in the discharge of the duties imposed upon him by this section, and the \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 310]\n\u00a0\n officers of the Government in the administration of the customs laws, the President is hereby authorized to employ such persons as may be required.' 36 Stat. 83, c. 6. The function of the new board was to investigate and advise. See Taussig, supra, p. 424.\n The Tariff Board went down at the end of 1912 through the failure of the Congress to provide the ways and means. Taussig, supra, 424, n. 1. No similar body was created till the organization of the present Tariff Commission in 1916. Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463,  700, 702, 703, 706, 707, 39 Stat. 756, 795, 796, 797; 19 U.S. Code,  91, 96, 97, 100, 101 (19 USCA  91, 96, 97, 100, 101). Cf. Taussig, supra, p. 481. The function of the Commission as first organized was to investigate the administration and fiscal and industrial effects of the customs laws of this country and other kindred problems, to put at the disposal of the President, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, whenever requested, all information at its command, and to make such investigations and reports as might be requested by the President or by either of the committees, or by either branch of Congress. In aid of these purposes and duties, it was empowered to subpoena witnesses and conduct hearings. The result of an investigation might be a recommendation to Congress that would lead to the increase or decrease of existing duties. There is nothing to show that in conducting these investigations it permitted any interested person to inspect its collected data, or to cross-examine others. On the other hand, it does affirmatively appear, set forth at large in its reports to Congress, that it withheld even from that body disclosure of the costs of production of individual producers, confining its reports to averages and symbols that gave no token of identity. Census of Dyes and Coal Tar Chem- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 311]\n\u00a0\n icals for 1917, p. 11; Ninth Annual Report, U.S. Tariff Commission, p. 17; Sixteenth Annual Report, p. 19.2 From the beginning there has been an administrative policy to treat the costs or investments of identified producers as akin to a trade secret, with the result that disclosure, even if not strictly within the prohibition of the statute (Revenue Act of 1916 ,  708 (19 USCA  105)), was forbidden in the view of the Commission by persuasive considerations of fair dealing and expediency. Congress did not then protest and indeed never has protested, though Congress was the very body for whose benefit the investigation had been made and the reports transmitted. In providing, as it did, in 1922, that a reasonable opportunity for a hearing should be given to any one affected by a change, it had no thought, we may well believe, to prohibit reservations and confidences that would be allowed against itself.\n The administrative practice before the act of 1922 might be too desultory and brief to fix the meaning of the statute if it did not find support, and that unmistakable and ample, in administrative practice afterwards. Consistently through all its hearings the Commission has acted upon the principle that the cost of production will not be made known to competitors if the producers are so few that there can be no disclosure of the cost without disclosing the identity of those producing at that cost. A report by the Commission, submitted by the government in connection with the briefs, explains the practice that has been followed and the reasons supporting it. At times the reports by the Commission have shown costs identified by number or by letter. This has been done \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 312]\n\u00a0\n in those instances, and those only where producers were so many that identity was cloaked. Even then, it was often necessary to combine the costs in one country, for example, in Eastern Venezuela, with those in other countries, or to combine items of one class, for example, advertising expenses, with items of another class, such as administrative expenses. At times the Commission has resorted to the expedient of showing costs in the form of averages. It has applied the same methods impartially to residents and to foreigners. In one of its reports the foreign costs of Danish and Dutch producers were published in combined form in order to avoid disclosure of the costs in Denmark, the principal competing country. Finally a third group of reports exists where the cost data are not given at all, either directly or indirectly. This has been the form where there were fewer than three companies, or where the number was very small, and one predominated in the industry. The reports taken collectively show variations in degree as to the kind and fullness of the information imparted to the public, the variations depending in every instance upon the estimate by the Commission of the effect of the disclosure. \n3\n What is more significant than any variations in the reports is a strain of uniformity that runs through all alike. Not in one of them is there a disclosure of the individual data brought together by the Commission through the work of its investigators. Not in one is there the suggestion that the reasonable opportunity for a hearing conceded by the statute carries with it the opportunity to inspect 'every particle of evidence' collected by the Commission, and to examine and cross-examine the men who have collected it. \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 313]\n\u00a0\n Acquiescence by Congress in an administrative practice may be an inference from silence during a period of years. In this instance the inference is strengthened when it is recalled that during some of those years the Commission was under fire. In 1926, there was a resolution by the Senate for the appointment of a committee to investigate the workings of the flexible tariff. S. Res. 162, 69th Congress. The inquiry was to have 'particular reference to the regulations and procedure of the Tariff Commission, the powers exercised and the functions performed by said Commission, and to the institution, investigation, hearing, and decision of cases' arising under section 315 of the act of 1922. United States Senate Hearings, Investigation of Tariff Commission, 1926, 1927. In the investigation that followed, the procedure and methods of the Commission were thoroughly explored. One of its members, Mr. Glassie, in his statement to the Committee, explained that it was impossible for the hearing to be 'so conducted as to permit of the open disclosure of the individual evidence of costs.' United States Senate Hearings, supra, p. 529. Indeed, without such explanation, the reservation of these and kindred confidences was made abundantly apparent by records and reports. At the close of the inquiry, the Committee reported to the Senate. Senate Report, No. 1325, 70th Congress, First Session, May 28, 1928. A majority of the Committee advised that the flexible provisions of the tariff act be repealed for the reason chiefly that the President was already overburdened with executive duties, and that the Commission be reorganized as a congressional agency. There was no criticism of the practice whereby the costs of individual producers were treated as confidential. A minority report advised that the Commission be continued, and with it the provision for a flexible tariff. Such it seems was also the judgment of Congress as a whole, for despite the majority report of the \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 314]\n\u00a0\n Committee, the Commission exists today. Tariff Act of 1930, c. 497, 46 Stat. 590, 696,  330-336 (19 USCA  1330-1336).4\n The administrative practice developed before the act of 1922 has thus been continued and confirmed with the \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 315]\n\u00a0\n tacit approval of the President and the acquiescence of the Congress. As late as January 28, 1933, after this cause had been submitted to the court, the signs of acquiescence and approval were strikingly renewed. On that day there was a resolution by the Senate directing a report by the Commission in respect of problems of the tariff. 76 Cong. Rec., pp. 2877, 2878. One of the subjects to be reported was 'the range and variety of costs of production related to the quantities produced in each cost range in the United States and in competing foreign countries for each industry investigated by the Tariff Commission since 1920 (so far as can be given without disclosing the costs of individual concerns).' The history of the methods of this investigating body is thus carried down to date. True indeed it is that administrative practice does not avail to overcome a statute so plain in its commands as to leave nothing for construction. True it also is that administrative practice, consistent and generally unchallenged, will not be overturned except for very cogent reasons if the scope of the command is indefinite and doubtful. United States v. Moore, \n95 U.S. 760\n, 763; Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S.Ct. 685; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375\n, 51 S.Ct. 144; Interstate Commerce Commission v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 178\n, 53 S.Ct. 106, November 21, 1932. The practice has peculiar weight when it involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion; of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, supra.\n To the external aids that are drawn from history and analogy and administrative practice there is to be added another that may be said to be internal; the aid to be derived from the wording of related sections. In the same tariff act that makes provision in these general words for a hearing by the Commission as a step in the develop- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 316]\n\u00a0\n ment of the process of legislation, there is another section prescribing the remedy available to an importer after the legislative process has been completed, and the question is whether the merchandise has been properly appraised. Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356,  501, 42 Stat. 966, 19 U.S. Code,  381 (19 USCA  381). The remedy in such circumstances is an appeal from the decision of the appraiser to the Board of General Appraisers. The Board shall assign the appeal to one of its members, who shall give reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing, 'at which the parties and their attorneys shall have an opportunity to introduce evidence and to hear and cross-examine the witnesses of the other party and to inspect all samples and all papers admitted or offered as evidence.' This is the way that Congress spoke when it wished to attach to an administrative proceeding the incidence of a trial in court. There are times when the obscurity of one section as contrasted with the clearness of another may be ascribed to inattention. The need is not perceived of filling up the outlines because what is within them is assumed or carelessly overlooked. Not so in this case where Congress had its attention sharply directed to the fact that plain speech was needed if a hearing was to mean so much. Until it spoke thus plainly, the importer was denied the right to cross-examine and inspect, and this though the privilege of a hearing had been his for many years. It took an explicit statute to overcome the long-established policy of the government whereby witnesses testifying to values were to be protected from publicity. 5 If the dis- \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 317]\n\u00a0\n satisfied importer 'is afforded such notice and hearing as enables him to give his views and make his contention in respect of the value of his goods, he cannot complain.' Origet v. Hedden, \n155 \nU.S. 228, 238\n, 15 S.Ct. 92, 96; Auffmordt v. Hedden, \n137 \nU.S. 310\n, 11 S.Ct. 103.6 For years this opportunity for a statement was his only legal privilege, though the effect of the appraisal had a direct relation to his own interests and burdens as contrasted with the interests and burdens that concern the public generally, though the controversy, in brief, was closer to the field of judicature than to that of legislation. A fortiori the privilege is no greater in such a controversy as this where legislation rather than judicature supplies the paramount analogy.\n We are not unmindful of cases in which the word 'hearing' as applied to administrative proceedings has been thought to have a broader meaning. All depends upon the context. There is no denial of the power of Congress to lay bare to the business rivals of a producer and indeed to the public generally every document in the office of this Commission and all the information collected by its agents. The question for us here is whether there was the will to go so far. The answer will not be found in definitions of a hearing lifted from their setting and then applied to new conditions. The answer will be found in a consideration of the ends to be achieved in the particular conditions that were expected or foreseen. To know what they are, there must be recourse to all the aids available in the process of construction, to history and analogy, and practice as well as to the dictionary. Much is made by the petitioner of the procedure of the Interstate Commerce Commission when regulating the conduct or the charges of interstate carriers, and that of the Public Service Commissions of the states when regulating the \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 318]\n\u00a0\n conduct or the charges of public service corporations. The Tariff Commission advises; these others ordain. There is indeed this common bond that all alike are instruments in a governmental process which according to the accepted classification is legislative, not judicial. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 29 S.Ct. 67; Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 440\n, 43 S.Ct. 445. Cf. People ex rel. Central Park, M. & E.R.R. Co. v. Willcox, 194 N.Y. 383, 386, 87 N.E. 517. Whatever the appropriate label, the kind of order that emerges from a hearing before a body with power to ordain is one that impinges upon legal rights in a very different way from the report of a commission which merely investigates and advises. The traditionary forms of hearing appropriate to the one body are unknown to the other. What issues from the Tariff Commission as a report and recommendation to the President, may be accepted, modified, or rejected. If it happens to be accepted, it does not bear fruit in anything that trenches upon legal rights. No one has a legal right to the maintenance of an existing rate or duty. Neither the action of Congress in fixing a new tariff nor that of the President in exercising his delegated power is subject to impeachment if the prescribed forms of legislation have been regularly observed. It is very different, however, when orders are directed against public service corporations limiting their powers in the transaction of their business. They may be challenged in the courts if the effect is to reduce the charges to the point of confiscation. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418. They may be challenged for other reasons when they are without evidence supporting them, and are merely arbitrary edicts. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pac. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108; Manufacturers' R. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S.Ct. 383; Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Dept. Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 45 S.Ct. 412; Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., \n274 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 47 S.Ct. 604. Cf. Sharfman, The \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 319]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Commission, vol. II, p. 424. The 'hearing' that such commissions are to give must be adapted to the consequences that are to follow, to the attack and the review to which their orders will be subject. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n264 \nU.S. 64\n, 44 S.Ct. 294; Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146. The Commerce Act, as it stands today, and kindred statutes in the states, are instinct with the recognition of a duty to give a hearing of such a kind that the courts will understand why a commission has acted as it has if their supervisory powers are afterwards invoked for enforcement or revision. No such inference is to be drawn from the act before us now.\n The tokens of intention set down in this opinion have a force in combination that is denied to any one of them alone. They impel us to the holding that within the meaning of this act the 'hearing' assured to one affected by a change of duty does not include a privilege to ransack the records of the Commission, and to subject its confidential agents to an examination as to all that they have learned. There was no thought to revolutionize the practice of investigating bodies generally, and of this one in particular. Hearings had once been optional. By the new statute they became mandatory. The form remained the same.\n\n 2. \nOur second question must now be answered: If something less is due than inspection without limit, is there a minimum of disclosure without which the purpose of a hearing will be thwarted altogether, and was this minimum attained by what was done by the Commission here?\n The argument for the petitioner portrays the American producer in the position of a plaintiff tendering an issue to others which they are called upon to meet like defendants in a lawsuit. The picture is misleading, for in truth \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 320]\n\u00a0\n there is no lawsuit, nor anything akin to it. See the testimony of Mr. Glassie in the investigation by the Senate (U.S. Senate Hearings, p. 516). The Commission, in conducting an investigation, is free to act on its own motion. Indeed it often does so. If it is moved by some one else, the investigation is still its own; the request amounting to a mere suggestion which it is free, in its discretion, to accept or to reject. There is nothing in its rules whereby applicants are placed under a duty to state the figures of their costs, still less to divide the total into items. On the contrary, the rules provide that 'an application is not required to be in any special form.' It 'must state the name, legal residence, business address, occupation and business connection of the applicant, and contain a short and simple statement of the relief sought and the grounds therefor.' If it is deemed to be insufficient, 'the Commission may permit the applicant to amend the same or to submit evidence orally or in writing.' A statement by an applicant that it has been compelled to close its plant because it has been unable to hold its own against foreign competition by reason of disparity of costs in this country and abroad will present a hardship to be investigated if the Commission believes that investigation will be helpful. Certainly there is nothing in any provision of the statute whereby the opponents of an increase may insist that something more than this be shown before they may be called upon to come forward and oppose.\n The difficulty is not fully met, however, when we hold that a statement of the costs is not required at the beginning to set the process of investigation going. The question remains whether a statement in some form, even though fragmentary and stripped of detail, may be necessary later on. The persons affected by the change of duty are entitled to a hearing, and this involves, so it is said, such a modicum of information, such a disclosure of the costs in the form of percentages of the market price or \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 321]\n\u00a0\n otherwise, as to give notice of the ultimate facts to be contested and overcome. What is required in that view is not a bill of particulars, nor a disclosure of the evidence, but a definition of the issue which is to be the theme of the debate.\n The argument thus stated ignores the historic function of the Commission as the adviser of the President or Congress in the business of legislation, and views it as an arbiter between adverse parties litigant. This is to subject its action to the test of an unreal analogy. If the Commission is under a duty to make disclosure of the costs at all, the origin of the duty and its measure are to be found, we think, in this, that since a hearing is required, there is a command by implication to do whatever may be necessary to make the hearing fair. A duty so indeterminate must vary in form and shape with all the changing circumstances whereby fairness is conditioned. The appeal is to the sense of justice of administrative officers, clothed by the statute with discretionary powers. Their resolve is not subject to impeachment for unwisdom without more. It must be shown to be arbitrary.\n Arbitrary in this instance it certainly was not, and that for several reasons.\n\n\n (a)\n The Commission did not withhold disclosure from the petitioner with any sinister purpose to make the hearing ineffective. It was moved by the belief that a way could not be found of stating the costs without identifying them with the business of a particular producer. In so acting it conformed to its own precedents and practice, and to those of such commissions generally. If it was under a duty to give a hearing similar to one in court, it was bound to expose everything, details as well as summaries. There was then no middle ground. If it was under a duty to give the kind of hearing that was fair in all the circumstances, it was free to shape its course within reasonable limits by its own conception of the promptings \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 322]\n\u00a0\n of policy and fairness. It would have kept within the statute even though it had made the hearings private and had refrained from the publication of anything, either the records of its agents or the testimony of witnesses. 62 Cong. Rec., pt. 11, p. 11, 232. Instead, it made the hearings public, and exposed everything to view except only when publication was likely in its judgment to result in hardship or injustice. Ninth Annual Report, United States Tariff Commission, p. 13. See the Rules of the Commission quoted infra in this opinion. There is indeed a possibility that the work of such a body would be seriously hampered if producers were not made to feel that information which in the thought of many is ranked as confidential would be withheld from prying eyes. \n7\n Particularly might that be so when inquiry would have to be made of manufacturers abroad, not subject to compulsion. \n8\n Business men may exaggerate the importance of secrecy in matters of this kind. Their sensitiveness is to be reckoned with, whether it be reasonable or not.\n\n\n (b)\n The attack upon the ruling of the Commission as a denial of a fair hearing in a primary and basic sense is weakened even more when consideration is directed to what the petitioner then asked for.\n There was no appropriate motion or objection that brought to the notice of the Commission a claim that apart from any details there was a certain minimum of information due to the petitioner which the Commission was withholding. There is no reason to believe that this minimum was then an object of desire, or that it would have been helpful if conceded. The only statement by the petitioner approaching such a notice was a request that it be furnished with a complete, and not a deleted, copy of \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 323]\n\u00a0\n the application for relief. The record makes it plain, however, that included in the application were supporting facts and figures giving the costs in fullest detail. The petitioner did not suggest at any time that it would be satisfied with less. On the contrary, its request for a copy of the application was accompanied or quickly followed by a motion setting forth in five subdivisions the particulars exacted, and culminating in a demand that 'every particle of evidence' collected by the Commission be held subject to inspection. That was its attitude, made manifest in many ways to the members of the board. That was again its attitude on the petition to the court for a writ of mandamus to hold the Commission to its duty. There would be no justice at this late day in invalidating the proceedings for the failure to supply the petitioner with some average of aggregate which it did not state that it cared for, which even now is not explained, and which, in all likelihood, if given, would have added little to its knowledge. \n9\n Business men as a rule are not wholly in the dark as to the ways of their competitors.\n\n\n (c)\n For still another reason the ruling made by the Commission was not an arbitrary refusal to give the kind of hearing that in the circumstances of this particular inquiry was reasonable and fair.\n The unwillingness of the petitioner to submit the costs of its Norwegian principal, or to make any effort to submit them, has closed its mouth to the complaint that the refusal to disclose the costs of its American competitor has nullified the report and the proclamation based upon it.\n The Norwegian principal, as we have seen, declined to give any information to the agents of the Commission and left them to make up their estimate of the foreign \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 324]\n\u00a0\n costs from indirect and imperfect sources. The petitioner, to be sure, was an agent, not a principal, yet it was the exclusive agent in the United States, and plainly in a relation that gave it influence, if not authority. Not once during the hearing did it offer to make an effort to obtain the foreign costs and submit them to the Commission under a pledge of confidence or otherwise. Its attitude was one of indifference so complete as to vary hardly at all, or so at least the Commission might reasonably infer, from one of purposeful obstruction.\n This attitude of obstruction is not to be ignored in determining whether the information to be imparted to the petitioner was curtailed by the Commission in any arbitrary way. One who seeks equity must do it.\n The question in that aspect becomes this: Does justice require that the costs of a domestic producer shall be made known to an importer who is unwilling to use reasonable effort to make disclosure of the costs of his principal abroad? A mind neither perverse nor arbitrary in its judgments might think the answer should be 'no.'\n There is left a final question. The petitioner makes the point that the Commission by its own rules has spread its records open to the inspection of interested parties, and that there was a violation of those rules by denying an inspection here. The argument may not prevail. A rule of the Commission does indeed provide as follows: 'Parties who have entered appearances shall, prior to the filing of briefs, have opportunity to examine the report of the Commissioner or investigator in charge of the investigation and also the record except such portions as relate to trade secrets and processes.' The evidence leaves no room for doubt that the exception stated in this rule has been construed by the Commission as keeping costs secret for the protection of producers, both foreign and domestic, unless disclosure is so cloaked that the identity of the producers will be effectively disguised. \n\n[288 U.S. 294, 325]\n\u00a0\n Disguise has been found to be impossible when the producers are but two or three. The phrase 'trade secrets and processes' is not a new one in the law. It occurs in statutes and judicial decisions as well as in the rule. The Commission was without competence by any decision it might make to fix the meaning of the phrase as used by Congress or the courts. It had power, however, to interpret its own rules and any phrase contained in them. Evans v. Backer, 101 N.Y. 289, 292, 4 N.E. 516; Duncan's Heirs v. United States, 7 Pet. 435, 451, 452. This it has done by an administrative practice too clear to be misread.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For other instances, see Comer, Legislative Functions of National Administrative Authorities, pp. 64, et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the investigations by the Tariff Board of 1909, the practice apparently was the same.

At first, there was no requirement of public hearings. Tariff Board Act of 1921. The Board states in its report for the year 1923: 'It will readily be understood when representatives of industries or manufacturers are called upon to give definite details of their costs and manufacture such information must be given confidentially.' Third Annual Report of Australian Tariff Board, June, 1923, p. 23. A requirement of public hearings was imposed by an amendment of the statute. Tariff Board Act of 1924, sec. 3. It then became necessary that applicants for increases or decreases 'present their cases publicly and on oath.' Seventh Annual Report of Australian Tariff Board, June, 1928, p. 14. This does not mean, however, that there is no restraint upon publicity. The same statute provides that upon the objection of a witness, evidence which the Board is satisfied is of a confidential nature may be presented in private if the Board considers it desirable in the public interest to do so.

They involve the same questions, were argued together at the bar, and may well be disposed of by the same opinion.\n Daniel W. O'Donoghue is an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, having been duly appointed to that position by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. He duly qualified as such justice on February 29, 1932, and has ever since been engaged in the performance of the duties of the office. At the time of his appointment and entry upon his duties, his salary was fixed by act of Congress (chapter 6, 44 Stat. 919 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 18,  42)) at the rate of $10,000 per year, which was paid to him until June 30, 1932\n\n\n William Hitz is an associate justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, having been appointed on December 5, 1930, by the President, and later confirmed by the Senate. On February 13, 1931, he duly qualified as such associate justice and has ever since been engaged in performing the duties of his office. By the act of Congress already referred to, his salary was fixed at the rate of $12,500 per year. This amount he received until June 30, 1932.\n By the Legislative Appropriation Act of June 30, 1932 (chapter 314, 47 Stat. 382, 401 (5 USCA  673 note)), Congress provided as follows:\n'Sec. 105. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933- ...\n\n'(d) In the case of the following persons the rate of compensation is reduced as follows: If more than $1,000 per annum but less than $10, 000 per annum, 8 1\/3 per centum; if $10,000 per annum or more, but less than $12,000 per annum, 10 per centum; if $12,000 per annum or more, but less than $15,000 per annum, 12 per centum; if \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 526]\n\u00a0\n $15,000 per annum or more, but less than $20,000 per annum, 15 per centum; if $20,000 per annum or more, 20 per centum. ...\n\n'Sec. 106.

This section shall not operate so as to reduce any rate of retired pay to less than $1,000 per annum.\n\n'Special Salary Reductions\n\n'Sec. 107. (a) During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933- ...\n\n'(5) the salaries and retired pay of all judges (except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office), if such salaries or retired pay are at a rate exceeding $10,000 per annum, shall be at the rate of $10,000 per annum.'\n\n In July, 1932, the Comptroller General of the United States held that the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia are 'legislative' courts and not 'constitutional' courts whose judges are entitled to the protection of article 3,  1, of the Constitution, which provides: \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 527]\n\u00a0\n 'The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.'\n Thereupon the disbursing officer of the Department of Justice, pursuant to the ruling of the Comptroller General, reduced the annual compensation by 10 per cent. in the case of Justice O'Donoghue, and by 20 per cent. in the case of Justice Hitz, and over their protest paid to them for the months of July to December, 1932, inclusive, their compensation at this reduced rate.\n On January 19, 1933, suits were brought in the court of Claims to recover the amount of the deductions which had been made and enforced up to that time.\n These suits are based upon the contention that the ruling of the Comptroller General and the deductions made in pursuance thereof are in violation of the provisions of the appropriation act just quoted, because section 107 specifically excepts from their operation 'judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office,' and these plaintiffs are such judges. It is averred in the petitions that the ruling of the Comptroller General and the resulting deductions contravene article 3,  1, of the Constitution, since plaintiffs were appointed to serve during good behavior and to receive a compensation which constitutionally cannot be diminished during their continuance in office. It is further averred that the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the District are vested by acts of Congress with all the jurisdiction and all the power conferred on the United States by the Constitution under article 3; that such jurisdiction and power have been exercised by the Court of Appeals from its organization \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 528]\n\u00a0\n in 1893, and by the Supreme Court of the District and its predecessor courts from the establishment of the government; that therefore, in the organization of these courts, Congress acted in virtue of article 3, and thereby constituted said courts inferior courts of the United States; that only to the extent that Congress has enlarged and extended the powers of said courts did that body act under any other than article 3; and that they are none the less such inferior courts because, by reason of their location at the seat of government, Congress, under article 1,  8, cl. 17,* has conferred upon them powers and jurisdiction which it may not confer upon other federal courts. Each plaintiff avers a reluctance to institute a suit which may result in personal benefit to himself, but that he feels it a duty to the court, to the bar, to the citizens of the District of Columbi , and to the people of the United States to have the status of these important courts defined and settled as soon as possible.\n The government demurred to the petitions, upon the ground, among others, that the justices of the District Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are not 'judges of inferior courts' within the meaning of section 1 of article 3 of the Constitution, and are therefore not 'judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office,' within the meaning of section 107 of the appropriation act hereinbefore quoted.\n Upon this state of the record the Court of Claims certified the following questions upon which it desires instruc- \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 529]\n\u00a0\n tions, under section 3(a) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 939 (28 USCA  288(a):\n'I. Does Section 1, Article III, of the Constitution of the United States apply to the Supreme Court (and to the Court of Appeals) of the District of Columbia and forbid a reduction of the compensation of the Justices thereof during their continuance in office?'\n\n'II. Can the compensation of a Justice of the Supreme Court (or of the Court of Appeals) of the District of Columbia be lawfully diminished during his continuance in office?'\n\n Before entering upon a consideration of the subject, it is well to observe that Congress has not undertaken by the legislation under review to assume or indicate any view of the meaning of the constitutional provision involved, but has left open the question whether these judges or others are judges 'whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office.' This relieves us from the duty, always a delicate one, of passing upon the constitutionality of the congressional act, and only requires us to ascertain and determine the meaning and application of the constitutional provision, to which determination, by the plain intent of Congress, the act will immediately accommodate itself. That is to say, neither the terms nor intent of the statute, but only the application made of it by the Comptroller General, will be affected by the construction which we shall put upon the constitutional limitation.\n The questions propounded by the court below find no answer in any conclusive adjudication of this court; and it will materially assist us in arriving at a correct determination if we shall first consider the great underlying purpose which the framers of the Constitution had in mind and which led them to incorporate in that instrument the provision in respect of the permanent tenure of office \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 530]\n\u00a0\n and the undiminishable character of the compensation of the judges.\n The Constitution, in distributing the powers of government, creates three distinct and separate departments-the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. This separation is not merely a matter of convenience or of governmental mechanism. Its object is basic and vital, Springer v. Government of Philippine Islands, \n277 \nU.S. 189, 201\n, 48 S.Ct. 480; namely, to preclude a commingling of these essentially different powers of government in the same hands. And this object is none the less apparent and controlling because there is to be found in the Constitution an occasional specific provision conferring upon a given department certain functions, which, by their nature, would otherwise fall within the general scope of the powers of another. Such exceptions serve rather to emphasize the generally invi late character of the plan.\n If it be important thus to separate the several departments of government and restrict them to the exercise of their appointed powers, it follows, as a logical corollary, equally important, that each department should be kept completely independent of the others-independent not in the sense that they shall not co-operate to the common end of carrying into effect the purposes of the Constitution, but in the sense that the acts of each shall never be controlled by, or subjected, directly or indirectly, to, the coercive influence of either of the other departments. James Wilson, one of the framers of the Constitution and a justice of this court, in one of his law lectures said that the independence of each department required that its proceedings 'should be free from the remotest influence, direct or indirect, of either of the other two powers.' Andrews, the Works of James Wilson (1896), vol. 1, p. 367. And the importance of such independence was similarly recognized by Mr. Justice Story when he said that in reference to each other neither of the departments \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 531]\n\u00a0\n 'ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence in the administration of their respective powers.' 1 Story on the Constitution ( 4th Ed.)  530. To the same effect, the Federalist (Madison) No. 48. And see Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S.Ct. 597.\n The anxiety of the framers of the Constitution to preserve the independence especially of the judicial department is manifested by the provision now under review, forbidding the diminution of the compensation of the judges of courts exercising the judicial power of the United States. This requirement was foreshadowed, and its vital character attested, by the Declaration of Independence, which, among the injuries and usurpations recited against the King of Great Britain, declared that he had 'made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.'\n In framing the Constitution, therefore, the power to diminish the compensation of the federal judges was explicitly denied, in order, inter alia, that their judgment or action might never be swayed in the slightest degree by the temptation to cultivate the favor or avoid the displeasure of that department which, as master of the purse, would otherwise hold the power to reduce their means of support. The high importance of the provision, as the contemporary history shows, was definitely pointed out by the leading statesmen of the time. Thus, in the Federalist, No. 78, Hamilton said: 'The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.' And in No. 79: 'Next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. ... In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will.' (The italics are in the original.) \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 532]\n\u00a0\n Chief Justice Marshall, in the course of the debates of the Virginia State Convention of 1829-1830 (pp. 616, 619), used the following strong and frequently quoted language:\n'The Judicial Department comes home in its effects to every man's fireside; it passes on his property, his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not, to the last degree important, that he should be rendered perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience? ... I have always thought, from my earliest youth till now, that the greatest scourge an angry Heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a sinning people, was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary.'\n\n In a very early period of our history, it was said, in words as true to-day as they were then, that 'if they (the people) value and wish to preserve their Constitution, they ought never to surrender the independence of their judges.' Rawle on the Constitution (2d Ed.) 281.\n We need not pursue this phase of the subject urther. It is fully discussed in Evans v. Gore, \n253 U.S. 245\n, pages 248, 249, 40 S.Ct. 550, 551, 11 A.L.R. 519, where this court said:\n'With what purpose does the Constitution provide that the compensation of the judges 'shall not be diminished during their continuance in office'? Is it primarily to benefit the judges, or rather to promote the public weal by giving them that independence which makes for an impartial and courageous discharge of the judicial function? Does the provision merely forbid direct diminution, such as expressly reducing the compensation from a greater to a less sum per year, and thereby leave the way open for indirect, yet effective, diminution, such as withholding or calling back a park as a tax on the whole? Or, does it mean that the judge shall have a sure and continuing right to the compensation, whereon he confidently may rely for his support during his continuance in office, \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 533]\n\u00a0\n so that he need have no apprehension lest his situation in this regard may be changed to his disadvantage?'\n\n And, after referring to statements from which we have quoted and others, the court added (page 253 of 253 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 550, 553):\n'These considerations make it very plain, as we think, that the primary purpose of the prohibition against diminution was not to benefit the judges, but, like the clause in respect of tenure, to attract good and competent men to the bench and to promote that independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of the guaranties, limitations, and pervading principles of the Constitution and to the administration of justice without respect to persons and with equal concern for the poor and the rich. Such being its purpose, it is to be construed, not as a private grant, but as a limitation imposed in the public interest; in other words, not restrictively, but in accord with its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds.\n\n'Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and others indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition. Nothing short of this will give full effect to its spirit and principle.'\n\n In the light of the foregoing views-time honored and never discredited-it is not extravagant to say that there rests upon every federal judge affected nothing less than a duty to withstand any attempt, directly or indirectly in contravention of the Constitution, to diminish this compensation, not for his private advantage-which, if that were all, he might willingly forego-but in the interest of preserving unimpaired an essential safeguard adopted as a continuing guaranty of an independent judicial administration for the benefit of the whole people. It was this \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 534]\n\u00a0\n motive that impelled Chief Justice Taney to protest against the attempt of the Treasury Department to exact a tax upon the compensation of the judges under an Act of Congress passed in 1862, c. 119,  86, 12 Stat. 472. 157 U. S.Append. 701; Evans v. Gore, supra, pages 257-259 of 253 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 550. The judges of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, as far back as 1788, in discharge of the same duty, directed to the members of the state assembly a 'respectful remonstrance' against an act which had the effect of reducing their compensation. 4 Call (Va.) 135, 141. In the course of the remonstrance these judges said (pp. 143, 145):\n'The propriety and necessity of the independence of the judges is evident in reason and the nature of their office; since they are to decide between government and the people, as well as between contending citizens; and, if they be dependent on either, corrupt influence may be apprehended, sacrificing the innocent to popular prejudice; and subjecting the poor to oppression and persecution by the rich. And this applies more forcibly, to exclude a dependence on the egislature; a branch, of whom, in cases of impeachment, is itself a party. ... For vain would be the precautions of the founders of our government to secure liberty, if the legislature, though restrained from changing the tenure of judicial offices, are at liberty to compel a resignation by reducing salaries to a copper. ...'\n\n Actuated by like considerations of public duty, as it is averred, these plaintiffs brought the present suits.\n The judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia are of equal rank and power with those of other inferior courts of the federal system, and plainly within the spirit and reason of the compensation provision; and also within its intent, unless there be something in the Constitution, or in the character or organization of the District, or its relations to the \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 535]\n\u00a0\n general government, or in the character of the courts themselves, which precludes that conclusion. Indeed, the reasons which have been set forth, and which impelled the adoption of the constitutional limitation, apply with even greater force to the courts of the District than to the inferior courts of the United States located elsewhere, because the judges of the former courts are in closer contact with, and more immediately open to the influences of, the legislative department, and exercise a more extensive jurisdiction in cases affecting the operations of the general government and its various departments.\n This court has repeatedly held that the territorial courts are 'legislative' courts, created in virtue of the national sovereignty or under article 4,  3, cl. 2, of the Constitution, vesting in Congress the power 'to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States'; and that they are not invested with any part of the judicial power defined in the third article of the Constitution. And this rule, as it affects the territories, is no longer open to question. Do the courts of the District of Columbia occupy a like situation in virtue of the plenary power of Congress, under article 1,  8, cl. 17, 'To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States? ...' This inquiry requires a consideration, first, of the reasons upon which rest the decisions in respect of the territorial courts.\n The authority upon which all the later cases rest is The American Insurance Company et al. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 546, where the opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall. The pertinent question there was whether the judicial power of the United States described in article 3 of the Constitution vested in the superior courts of the territory of \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 536]\n\u00a0\n Florida; and it was answered in the negative. 'The Judges of the Superior Courts of Florida,' the Court said, 'hold their offices for four years. These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States.'\n This view was accepted and followed in Benner et al. v. Porter, 9 How. 235, 242-244; Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 447; Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648, 655; Good v. Martin, \n95 U.S. 90\n, 98; Reynolds v. United States, \n98 U.S. 145\n, 154; The City of Panama, \n101 U.S. 453\n, 460; McAllister v. United States, \n141 U.S. 174\n, 180, et seq., 11 S.Ct. 949; United States v. McMillan, \n165 \nU.S. 504, 510\n, 17 S.Ct. 395, and Romen v. Todd, \n206 \nU.S. 358, 368\n, 27 S.Ct. 724.\n A sufficient foundation for these decisions in respect of the territorial courts is to be found in the transitory character of the territorial governments. In the McAllister Case, supra, this court, after stating that the Constitution had secured the independence of the judges of courts in which might be vested the judicial power of the United States by an express provision that they should hold office during good behavior and their compensation should not be diminished during their continuance therein, concluded (pages 187, 188 of 141 U.S., 11 S.Ct. 949, 954): 'The absence from the constitution of such guaranties for territorial judges was no doubt due to the fact that the organization of govern- \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 537]\n\u00a0\n ments for the territories was but temporary, and would be superseded when the territories became states of the Union.' And in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice White in Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 293\n, 21 S.Ct. 770, 789, these decisions are said to grow out of the 'presumably ephemeral nature of a territorial government.'\n In this connection, the peculiar language of the territorial clause, article 4,  3, cl. 2, of the Constitution, should be noted. By that clause Congress is given power 'to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.' Literally, the word 'territory,' as there used, signifies property, since the language is not 'territory or property,' but 'territory or other property.' There thus arises an evident difference between the words 'the territory' and 'a territory' of the United States. The former merely designates a particular part or parts of the earth's surface-the imperially extensive real estate holdings of the nation; the latter is a governmental subdivision which happened to be called a 'territory,' but which quite as well could have been called a 'colony' or a 'province.' 'The Territories,' it was said in First National Bank v. County of Yankton, \n101 U.S. 129\n, 133, 'are but political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of the United States.' Since the Constitution provides for the admission by Congress of new states (article 4,  3, cl. 1), it properly may be said that the outlying continental public domain, of which the United States was the proprietor, was, from the beginning, destined for admission as a state or states into the Union; and that as a preliminary step toward that foreordained end-to tide over the period of ineligibility-Congress, from time to time, created territorial governments, the existence of which was necessarily limited to the period of pupilage. In that view it is not unreasonable to conclude that the makers of the Constitution could never have intended to give \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 538]\n\u00a0\n permanent tenure of office or irreducible compensation to a judge who was to serve during this limited and sometimes very brief period under a purely provisional government which, in all cases probably and in some cases certainly, would cease to exist during his incumbency of the office.\n The impermanent character of these governments has often been noted. Thus, it has been said, 'The territorial state is one of pupilage at best,' Nelson v. United States (C.C.) 30 F. 112, 115; 'A territory, under the constitution and laws of the United States, is an inchoate state,' Ex parte Morgan, (D.C.) 20 F. 298, 305; 'During the term of their pupilage as Territories, they are mere dependencies of the United States.' Snow v. United States, 18 Wall. 317, 320. And in Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan et al., 3 How. 212, 224, the court characterizes them as 'the temporary terri orial governments.'\n How different are the status and characteristics of the District of Columbia! The pertinent clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 17) confers the power on Congress to 'exercise exclusive Legislation ... over such District ... as may ... become the Seat of the Government of the United States.' These are words of permanent governmental power. The District, as the seat of the national government, is as lasting as the states from which it was carved or the union whose permanent capital it became. It could not have been intended otherwise; and it was thus recognized by the act of acceptance in 1790 (section 1, c. 28, 1 Stat. 130 ): '... The same (district) is hereby accepted for the permanent seat of the government of the United States.'\n In the District clause, unlike the territorial clause, there is no mere linking of the legislative processes to the disposal and regulation of the public domain-the landed estates of the sovereign-within which transitory governments to tide over the periods of pupilage may be con- \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 539]\n\u00a0\n stituted, but an unqualified grant of permanent legislative power over a selected area set apart for the enduring purposes of the general government, to which the administration of purely local affairs is obviously subordinate and incidental. The District is not an 'ephemeral' subdivision of the 'outlying dominion of the United States,' but the capital-the very heart-of the Union itself, to be maintained as the 'permanent' abiding place of all its supreme departments, and within which the immense powers of the general government were destined to be exercised for the great and expanding population of forty-eight states, and for a future immeasurable beyond the prophetic vision of those who designed and created it.\n Over this District Congress possesses 'the combined powers of a general and of a state government in all cases where legislation is possible.' Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, \n129 \nU.S. 141, 147\n, 9 S.Ct. 256, 257. The power conferred by article 1,  8, cl. 17, is plenary; but it does not exclude, in respect of the District, the exercise by Congress of other appropriate powers conferred upon that body by the Constitution, or authorize a denial to the inhabitants of any constitutional guaranty not plainly inapplicable. Circuit Judge Taft, afterwards Chief Justice of this Court, speaking for himself, Judge Lurton, afterwards an associate justice of this Court, and Judge Hammond, in Grether v. Wright (C.C.A.) 75 F. 742, 756, 757, after reciting the foregoing clause and the organization of the District under it, said:\n'It was meet that so powerful a sovereignty should have a local habitation the character of which it might absolutely control, and the government of which it should not share with the states in whose territory it exercised but a limited sovereignty, supreme, it is true, in cases where it could be exercised at all, but much restricted in the field of its operation. The object of the grant of exclusive legislation over the district was, therefore, national in the highest sense, and the city organized under the \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 540]\n\u00a0\n grant became the city, not of a state, not of a district, but of a nation. In the same article which granted the powers of exclusive legislation over its seat of government are conferred all the other great powers which make the nation, including the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. He would be a strict constructionist, indeed, who should deny to congress the exercise of this latter power in furtherance of that of organizing and maintaining a proper local government at the seat of government. Each is for a national purpose, and the one may be used in aid of the other.'\n\n Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 550\n, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 1304:\n'There is nothing in the history of the constitution, or of the original amendments to justify the assertion that the people of this District may be lawfully deprived of the benefit of any of the constitutional guaranties of life, liberty, and property; especially of the privilege of trial by jury in criminal cases.'\n\n It is important to bear constantly in mind that the District was made up of portions of two of the original states of the Union, and was not taken out of the Union by the cession. Prior thereto its inhabitants were entitled to all the rights, guaranties, and immunities of the Constitution, among which was the right to have their cases arising under the Constitution heard and determined by federal courts created under, and vested with the judicial power conferred by, article 3. We think it is not reasonable to assume that the cession stripped them of these rights, and that it was intended that at the very seat of the national government the people should be less fortified by the guaranty of an independent judiciary than in other parts of the Union.\n In Downes v. Bidwell, supra, in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Brown, at pages 260, 261 of 182 U.S., 21 S.Ct. 770, 777, it is said: \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 541]\n\u00a0\n 'This District had been a part of the states of Maryland and Virginia. It had been subject to the Constitution, and was a part of the United States. The Constitution had attached to it irrevocably. There are steps which can never be taken backward. The tie that bound the states of Maryland and Virginia to the Constitution could not be dissolved, without at least the consent of the Federal and state governments to a formal separation. The mere cession of the District of Columbia to the Federal government relinquished the authority of the states, but it did not take it out of the United States or from under the aegis of the Constitution. Neither party had ever consented to that construction of the cession. If, before the District was set off, Congress had passed an unconstitutional act affecting its inhabitants, it would have been void. If done after the District was created, it would have been equally void; in other words, Congress could not do indirectly, by carving out the District, what it could not do directly. The District still remained a part of the United States, protected by the Constitution. Indeed, it would have been a fanciful construction to hold that territory which had been once a part of the United States ceased to be such by being ceded directly to the Federal government.'\n That the Constitution is in effect in the territories as well as in the District has been so often determined in the affirmative that it is no longer an open question. Whether that instrument became operative in virtue of its own force, or because of its formal extension by acts of Congress, is a consideration which does not affect the present inquiry. It is enough that the Constitution is in force, and the question here, as well as in the case of the territories, is simply whether the provisions of article 3 relied upon are applicable. Because, for the peculiar reasons already stated, they are inapplicable to the terri- \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 542]\n\u00a0\n tories, it does not follow that they are likewise inapplicable to the District where these peculiar reasons do not obtain. In the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice White in the Downes Case, certain principles applicable to the situation with which we are dealing are enumerated. Among them (pages 289, 292 of 182 U.S., 21 S.Ct. 770, 787) are these: 'Every function of the government being thus derived from the Constitution, it follows that that instrument is everywhere and at all times potential in so far as its provisions are applicable. ... In the case of the territories, as in every other instance, when a provision of the Constitution is invoked, the question which arises is, not whether the Constitution is operative, for that is self-evident, but whether the provision relied on is applicable.' And them follows, almost immediately at page 293 of 182 U.S., 21 S.Ct. 770, 789, the observation already quoted that the decisions in respect of the inapplicability of the third Article of the Constitution to the territorial courts grow out of the 'presumably ephemeral nature of a territorial government.'\n In the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Brown, following the quotation which we have already made, it is said (page 266 of 182 U.S., 21 S.Ct. 770, 779):\n'As the only judicial power vested in Congress is to create courts whose judges shall hold their offices during good behavior, it necessarily follows that, if Congress authorizes the creation of courts and the appointment of judges for a limited time, it must act independently of the Constitution and upon territory which is not part of the United States within the meaning of the Constitution. ... It is sufficient to say that this case (The American Insurance Company et al. v. Canter, supra) has ever since been accepted as authority for the proposition that the judicial clause of the Constitution has no application to courts created in the territories, and that with respect to them Congress has a power wholly unrestricted by it.' \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 543]\n\u00a0\n After an exhaustive review of the prior decisions of this court relating to the matter, the following propositions, among others, were stated as being established:\n\n'1. That the District of Columbia and the territories are not states within the judicial clause of the Constitution giving jurisdiction in cases between citizens of different states;\n\n'2. That territories are not states within the meaning of Rev. St.  709, permitting writs of error from this court in cases where the validity of a state statute is drawn in question;\n\n'3. That the District of Columbia and the territories are states as that word is used in treaties with foreign powers, with respect to the ownership, disposition, and inheritance of property;\n\n'4. That the territories are not within the clause of the Constitution providing for the creation of a supreme court and such inferior courts as Congress may see fit to establish.'\n\n The significant point to be observed in this enumeration is that the opinion is careful to distinguish between those propositions which relate both to the territories and the District of Columbia, and those which relate to the territories alone; so that, when the court in paragraph 4 excepts from the operation of article 3 of the Constitution only the territories, it is equivalent to a determination either that the District was not subject to the same rule or that the question in respect of the District had not then been decided.\n No less significant in this respect is the decision in Cross v. United States, \n145 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 12 S.Ct. 842, 844. In that case it was held that a writ of error would not lie to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the District, sitting in appellate review of the conviction of a person of a capital crime. The government contended that the writ would \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 544]\n\u00a0\n not lie because the Supreme Court of the District was not a court of the United States within the intent and meaning of the Act of Congress of February 6, 1889, c. 113,  6, 25 Stat. 655 (18 USCA  681), which provided that in capital cases tried before 'any court of the United States' the final judgment could be reviewed by this court upon a writ of error. McAllister v. United States, supra, was cited in support of that contention, but this court said: '... It is to be remembered that that case referred to territorial courts only.' And the contention of the government in this respect was rejected; the writ being dismissed on a different ground.\n In The American Insurance Company et al. v. Canter, supra, the Chief Justice gave as a conclusive reason why the territorial courts were not constitutional courts vested with the judicial power designated in article 3 of the Constitution that: 'They are incapable of receiving it.' It is not hard to justify this observation in respect of courts created for a purely provisional government to serve merely between events; but the District Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are permanent establishments- federal courts of the United States and part of the federal judicial system. Fed. Trade Comm. v. Kl sner, \n274 \nU.S. 145, 154\n, 156 S., 47 S.Ct. 557, 560:\n'The parallelism between the Supreme Court of the District and the Court of Appeals of the District, on the one hand, and the District Courts of the United States and the Circuit Courts of Appeals, on the other, in the consideration and disposition of cases involving what among the states would be regarded as within federal jurisdiction, is complete.'\n\n To the same effect, see Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. U.S., \n285 \nU.S. 382, 390\n, 391 S., 52 S.Ct. 440.\n In the light of all that has now been said, we are unable to perceive upon what basis of reason it can be said that these courts of the District are incapable of receiving the \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 545]\n\u00a0\n judicial power under article 3. In respect of them we take the true rule to be that they are courts of the United States, vested generally with the same jurisdiction as that possessed by the inferior federal courts located elsewhere in respect of the cases enumerated in section 2 of article 3. The provision of this section of the article is that the 'judicial Power shall extend' to the cases enumerated, and it logically follows that, where jurisdiction over these cases is conferred upon the courts of the District, the judicial power, since they are capable of receiving it, is, ipso facto, vested in such courts as inferior courts of the United States.\n The fact that Congress, under another and plenary grant of power, has conferred upon these courts jurisdiction over nonfederal causes of action, or over quasi judicial or administrative matters, does not affect the question. In dealing with the District, Congress possesses the powers which belong to it in respect of territory within a state, and also the powers of a state. Keller v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 442\n, 443 S., 43 S.Ct. 445, 448. 'In other words,' this court there said,' 'it possesses a dual authority over the District, and may clothe the courts of the District, not only with the jurisdiction and powers of federal courts in the several states, but with such authority as a state may confer on her courts. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 619. Instances in which congressional enactments have been sustained which conferred powers and placed duties on the courts of the District of an exceptional and advisory character are found in Butterworth v. (United States ex rel.) Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 5 S.Ct. 25, United States v. Duell, \n172 \nU.S. 576\n, 19 S.Ct. 286, and Baldwin Co. v. Howard Co., \n256 \nU.S. 35\n, 41 S.Ct. 405. Subject to the guaranties of personal liberty in the amendments and in the original Constitution, Congress has as much power to vest courts of the District with a variety of jurisdiction and powers as a state Legislature has in conferring jurisdiction on its courts. In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., supra, we \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 546]\n\u00a0\n held that when 'a state Constitution sees fit to unite legislative and judicial powers in a single hand, there is nothing to hinder so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned.' \n211 \nU.S. 225\n, 29 S.Ct. 67, 69 (53 L.Ed. 150); Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 84 S., 23 S.Ct. 28.'\n If, in creating and defining the jurisdiction of the courts of the District, Congress were limited to article 3, as it is in dealing with the other federal courts, the administrative and other jurisdiction spoken of could not be conferred upon the former. But the clause giving plenary power of legislation over the District enables Congress to confer such jurisdiction in addition to the federal jurisdiction which the District courts exercise under article 3, notwithstanding that they are recipients of the judicial power of the United States under, and are constituted in virtue of, that article.\n Since Congress, then, has the same power under article 3 of the Constitution to ordain and establish inferior federal courts in the District of Columbia as in the states, whether it has done so in any particular instance depends upon the same inquiry, Does the judicial power conferred extend to the cases enumerated in that article? If it does, the judicial power thus conferred is not and cannot be affected by the additional congressional legislation, enacted under article 1,  8, cl. 17, imposing upon such courts other duties, which, because that special power is limited to the District, Congress cannot impose upon inferior federal courts elsewhere. The two powers are not incompatible; and we perceive no reason for holding that the plenary power given by the District clause of the Constitution may be used to destroy the operative effect of the judicial clause within the District, where, unlike the territories occupying a different status, that clause is entirely appropriate and applicable.\n The matter has been well stated by Mr. Justice Groner, speaking for the District Court of Appeals, in Pitts v. \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 547]\n\u00a0\n Peak, 60 App.D.C. 195, 197, 50 F.(2d) 485, 487, a case which we had occasion very recently to cite (Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, supra, at page 391 of 285 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 440):\n'But it by no means follows that because Congress has seen fit, by virtue of its authority over the District of Columbia, to confer upon the courts of the District administrative functions, which outside the District it may not confer upon courts created solely under article 3, these courts are any the less created under that article of the Constitution, nor do we know of anything in the history of these courts or in the legislation with relation to them which would indicate the contrary. We think a reasonable and correct view of the subject would indicate that, in the creation and organization of the superior courts of the District of Columbia, Congress has availed of its dual constitutional right in the first place to establish courts of law and invest them, as it has, with power and jurisdiction over all cases and controversies which, under the authority of article 3, it has invested the district courts of the United States, and, in the second place, in the exercise of the power of a sovereign state, under the provisions of section 8 of article 1, has further imposed upon them jurisdiction and power which it cannot impose upon other like courts functioning outside the District. There is no inhibition in the Constitution against the exercise by Congress of this dual power, arising as it does out of an express grant in the one case ( article 3) and an implied grant in the other (article 1,  8), nor does its exercise in the one case exhaust its power and prevent its exercise in the other, and therefore we assume, when Congress created the two courts- the District Courts of the United States and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia-and gave to each, within its own sphere, identical jurisdiction, that it drew its power from the same source, even though it was necessary it should have recourse to another provision of the Constitution in order \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 548]\n\u00a0\n to clothe the courts at the seat of government with other and additional authority not permissible under article 3.'\n\n And, see, also, James v. United States, 38 Ct.Cl. 615, 627-631, which this court on appeal disposed of on another ground, saying it was unnecessary to decide the constitutional question. \n202 \nU.S. 401\n, 26 S.Ct. 685.\n The conclusion to which we have come is in accord with the continuous and unbroken practice of Congress from the beginning of the government. In 1801 (chapter 15,  3, 2 Stat. 103, 105) Congress established the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, the judges thereof to hold office during good behavior, giving the court and the judges the same powers as were vested in the Circuit Courts of the United States and the judges thereof. In 1863, that court was superseded by, and its jurisdiction conferred upon, the present District Supreme Court (chapter 91, 12 Stat. 762), the judges to hold their offices during good behavior. Many acts of Congress refer to these courts as 'courts of he United States.' In the District Code, passed March 3, 1901 (chapter 854, 31 Stat. 1189), it is provided, section 61 (now D.C. Code 1929, T. 18,  43), that the Supreme Court of the District 'shall be deemed a court of the United, States.' And section 84 (now D.C. Code 1929, T. 18,  91), provides that it 'shall have and exercise the same powers and jurisdiction as the other district courts of the United States.' In Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 324\n, 48 S.Ct. 311, it was contended that the District Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction of a case arising under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, and  15 note), because it was not a District Court of the United States within the meaning of that act; but this court held that the contention had been adversely disposed of by Fed. Trade Comm. v. Klesner, supra; and in a footnote at page 325 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 311, 314, attention was called to the fact that suits to enjoin patent infringements under R.S.  4921 (35 USCA  70) are entertained by the Supreme Court of the District solely by virtue of its general powers as 'a District Court of the United States.' \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 549]\n\u00a0\n The District Court of Appeals was established in 1893 (chapter 74, 27 Stat. 434), the judges to hold office during good behavior. Congress invariably has fixed the same salaries for the judges of the Supreme Court of the District as for the judges of the District Courts of the United States sitting elsewhere, and the salaries of the judges of the District Court of Appeals the same as for the judges of the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals. When one has been increased, the other has been increased in like amount. Indeed, the congressional practice from the beginning recognizes a complete parallelism between the courts of the District and the District and Circuit Courts of Appeals of the United States. See Fed. Trade Comm. v. Klesner, supra, generally, and especially the language already quoted.\n The protest of Chief Justice Taney apparently did not bear fruit until 1869, at which time Attorney General Hoar delivered an opinion in response to a request of the Secretary of the Treasury, holding that if the act of 1862 imposed a tax upon the salaries of the President and the justices of the Supreme and inferior courts of the United States, it was unconstitutional. 13 Op.Attys.Gen. 161. Upon this authority the taxes which had been paid were refunded, and in 1872 a like refund of taxes was made to the judges of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, as shown by the records and files of the Treasury Department.\n It is true, of course, that Congress, in conferring the life tenure upon the judges of the courts of the District, and in doing the other things mentioned above, might have done so merely as a matter of legislative discretion, without deeming it to be a matter of constitutional compulsion. Nevertheless, a practice so uniform and continuous indicates, with some degree of persuasive force, that Congress entertained the view that the courts of the District and the inferior courts of the United States sitting \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 550]\n\u00a0\n elsewhere stood upon the same constitutional footing. In any event, it is not without significance that, in the acts of Congress from the beginning of the government to the present day, nothing has been brought to our attention that is inconsistent with that view.\n The government relies almost entirely upon the decision of this court in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438\n, 49 S.Ct. 411. In that case we held that the Court of Customs Appeals was a legislative court, not a constitutional court under article 3 of the Constitution. In the course of the opinion attention was called to the decisions in respect of the territorial courts, and it was said that a like view had been taken in respect of the status and jurisdiction of the courts provided by Congress for the District of Columbia. This observation, made incidentally, by way of illustration merely and without discussion or laboration, was not necessary to the decision, and is not in harmony with the views expressed in the present opinion. 'It is a maxim, not to be disregarded,' said Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 'that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.'\n Two cases are cited in support of the dictum in the Bakelite opinion- Keller v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., supra, and Postum Cereal Co. v. Calif. Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693, 700\n, 47 S.Ct. 284. The Keller Case we have already discussed. It simply holds that, in virtue of its dual power over the \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 551]\n\u00a0\n District, Congress may vest non-judicial functions in the courts of the District. We find nothing in that decision which cannot be reconciled with what we have here said. In the case of Postum Cereal Co., the court follows the Keller Case in holding that administrative or legislative functions may be vested in the courts of the District, but adds that this may not be done with any federal court established under article 3 of the Constitution. Taken literally, this seems to negative the view that the superior courts of the District are established under article 3. But the observation, read in the light of what was said in the Keller Case in respect of the dual power of Congress in dealing with the courts of the District, should be confined to federal courts in the states as to which no such dual power exists; and, thus confined, it is not in conflict with the view that Congress derives from the District clause distinct powers in respect of the constitutional courts of the District which Congress does not possess in respect of such courts outside the District.\n We hold that the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia are constitutional courts of the United States, ordained and established under article 3 of the Constitution; that the judges of these courts hold their offices during good behavior, and that their compensation cannot, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office.\n In accordance with that view the questions propounded are answered:\n Question No. 1, Yes.\n Question No. 2, No.\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n We are of the opinion that the courts of the District of Columbia, as this court has repeatedly declared, are \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 552]\n\u00a0\n not courts established under section 1 of article 3 of the Constitution, but are established under the broad authority conferred upon the Congress for the government of the District of Columbia by paragraph 17 of section 8 of article 1. Hence, the limitations imposed by section 1 of article 3, with respect to tenure and compensation, are not applicable to judges of these courts. The special authority conferred for the government of the District of Columbia necessarily includes the power to establish courts deemed to be appropriate for the District (Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 619), including the power to fix and alter tenure and compensation. It is a power complete in itself and derives nothing from section 1 of article 3. It is a power not less complete, but essentially the same as that which is conferred upon the Congress for the government of territories. American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 546; McAllister v. United States, \n141 \nU.S. 174\n, 11 S.Ct. 949. It is not a dual power in the sense that it is derived from two ources, that is, both from article 3 and also from the constitutional provision for the government of the District, but is dual only in the sense that the latter provision confers an authority so broad that it enables the Congress to invest the courts of the District not only with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those of federal courts within the States but also with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those which States may vest in their own courts. As the courts of the District do not rest for their creation on section 1 of article 3, that creation is not subject to any of the limitations of that provision. Nor would those limitations, if considered to be applicable, be susceptible of division so that some might be deemed obligatory and others might be ignored. If the limitations relating to courts established under section 1 of article 3 applied to the courts of the District of Columbia, they would necessarily prevent the attaching to the latter courts of jurisdiction and powers of an adminis- \n\n[289 U.S. 516, 553]\n\u00a0\n trative sort. It is only because the Congress, in establishing the courts of the District of Columbia, is free from the limitations imposed by section 1 of article 3 that administrative powers can be, and are, conferred upon them. Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Company, \n261 \nU.S. 428, 442\n, 443 S., 43 S.Ct. 445; Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693, 700\n, 47 S.Ct. 284; Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 450\n, 49 S.Ct. 411.\n With the question of policy, this court is not concerned, save as policy is determined by the Constitution. The question is one of constitutional interpretation which has hitherto been deemed to be settled. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Article 1,  8, cl. 17: 'The Congress shall have Power ...

Reilly, all of Portland, Or., for petitioner.\n Mr. William Healy, of Boise, Idaho, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action under the Idaho 'claim and delivery' statute brought by petitioner in the Federal District Court for the District of Idaho. The complaint alleges that petitioner is a resident and inhabitant of the state of Oregon, and is the duly qualified receiver of the property which is the subject matter of the action, having been so appointed by an Oregon state circuit court; that follow- \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 60]\n\u00a0\n ing his appointment and qualification, and prior to March, 1931, as such receiver he took into his possession certain designated cattle, and has ever since been entitled to the immediate and exclusive possession thereof; that about the 1st day of July, 1931, the respondent took possession of the cattle in the state of Idaho by virtue of a writ of attachment; that respondent has refused to return said cattle to petitioner, although demand therefor was made prior to the commencement of the action. Judgment was prayed to the effect that petitioner is the owner and entitled to the immediate possession of the cattle, and in lieu thereof that he recover from respondent the sum of $5,000.\n The answer, among other things, denies that petitioner took possession of the cattle as alleged, or any of them, and avers affirmatively that respondent in his official capacity seized the cattle upon a writ of execution duly issued by an Idaho state district court.\n The case was tried before the Federal District Court and a jury. Petitioner offered evidence tending to show that he had taken actual possession of the cattle in the state of Oregon, and that the cattle thereafter were found in Idaho and there seized by respondent. At the conclusion of petitioner's case, respondent moved for nonsuit and dismissal, upon the grounds: (1) That the proof shows that plaintiff had no capacity to sue in the courts of Idaho, since he had neither title to the property under the Oregon law or the order of the court appointing him, nor actual possession thereof, either in the state of Oregon or in the state of Idaho; (2) that an action of replevin will not lie in a United States court against a sheriff to take property from the possession of a state court. A third ground was urged, which we do not consider. It is without merit and is not pressed here. The court granted the motion, saying 'that the proof is insufficient to initiate the liability on this hearing.' \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n 1. Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, that court, without considering other assignments of error, affirmed the judgment upon the ground that a receiver appointed in a state court is not entitled to sue in a foreign jurisdiction to repossess cattle, which, after being put in charge of his agent, cross over the boundary line into a foreign jurisdiction. Although respondent contends otherwise, the court below reached that conclusion in the face of an assumption that actual possession of the cattle had been taken by petitioner in Oregon. The language of the court follows: 'Granting the soundness of the contention that the receiver was entitled to the undisturbed possession of the property and assuming that he actually had such possession (italics supplied), and granting or assuming that he had the power to sue locally in replevin for an unlawful interference with his right of possession, nevertheless such right of possession did not vest him with the title necessary to sue in the court below without an ancillary appointment therein; and he was not entitled to bring the suit as a matter of comity.' 62 F.(2d) 728, 730.\n Upon the same assumption, namely, that the receiver had reduced the property to his actual possession in the state of Oregon, we reach a different conclusion.\n The general rule undoubtedly is that an ordinary chancery receiver, having no other authority that that arising from his appointment as such, cannot as of right maintain an action in a state other than that in which he was appointed. The decision in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, to that effect has been uniformly followed by this court. See, for example, Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561\n, 25 S.Ct. 770; Sterrett v. Second National Bank, \n248 \nU.S. 73\n, 39 S.Ct. 27. The very terms in which the rule is expressed, however, clearly recognize that where the receiver has 'other authority than that arising from his \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n appointment as such,' he may under some circumstances maintain an action outside the state of his appointment. And so it definitely has been held.\n The foreign receiver may maintain such a suit, so far at least as the federal courts are concerned, where title to the property in question has been vested in him by conveyance or statute. In Bernheimer v. converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n, 27 S.Ct. 755, it was held that a receiver might sue in a foreign jurisdiction to collect upon the statutory liability of stockholders of a corporation, where the statute of the state conferred the right upon the receiver as quasi assignee. Following that decision, this court, in Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 256 et seq., 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292, while reiterating the rule laid down in Booth v. Clark, supra, pointed out that the receiver suing in the Hamilton Case was not merely an ordinary chancery receiver, but much more; that under the laws of the state of his appointment he became a quasi assignee, vested with the rights of the creditors against the stockholders, and charged with the enforcement of those rights in the courts of the state and elsewhere; that his right to maintain an action in another state properly could not be denied as presenting a question only of comity unaffected by the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution. The case involved the right of a receiver of an insolvent Minnesota corporation to maintain a suit in Wisconsin against two stockholders to enforce an asserted double liability imposed by the Minnesota statute. The Wisconsin court refused to entertain the suit, holding it to be a matter of comity; but this court, denying that view, reversed on the ground that thereby the laws of Minnesota and the judicial proceedings of that state had not been accorded the faith and credit to which they were entitled under the Federal Constitution.\n In the case just dealt with, and in other cases where the receivership property has been assigned to the receiver by \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n its owner, the suit is brought not strictly in his capacity as receiver, by virtue of his appointment in another state, but in his capacity as assignee. High, Receivers (4th Ed.)  244. His designation as receiver, etc., in the title of the cause may be regarded as descriptio personae merely.\n Coming immediately to the present case, the authorities, federal and state, are in practical accord to the effect that where the receiver appointed in one state has taken possession of property which thereafter is found and seized upon process in another state, the receiver may maintain an action in the latter state to recover possession or for other appropriate relief.

Trust Co., 11 N.D. 157, 163, 164, 90 N.W. 795, 95 Am.St.Rep. 712; Cagill v. Wooldridge, 67 Tenn. (8 580, 582, 583, 35 Am. Rep. 716. Other cases might be cited to the same effect. The only decision which we have found definitely to the contrary is Humphreys v. Hopkins, 81 Cal. 551, 22 P. 892, 6 L.R.A. 792, 15 Am.St.Rep. 76, but in which there is a convincing dissenting opinion in harmony with the general current of authority.\n In some of the cases cited the courts seem to have put their determination in favor of the receiver upon the ground of comity. With this view, however, we do not agree. It is a matter of right, as this court has said. Converse v. Hamilton, supra.\n The true rule is stated in Robertson v. Staed, supra, by the Supreme Court of Missouri, where it was held that where the receiver has taken possession of property in pursuance of his appointment, a special property is thereby vested in him which enables him to maintain a suit for the recovery of the property in a foreign jurisdiction; and that the principle upon which that may be done is 'one of law and not of comity.' \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n 2. The other ground upon which respondent asked a dismissal of the action by the trial court is that an action of replevin 'will not lie in a United States court against a sheriff to take property from the possession of a state court.' Respondent, in support of that contention, relies on Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450, and later cases decided by this court following that decision. It was held in the Freeman Case that replevin would not lie in a state court against a United States marshal who held property seized by him under process issued by a federal court- this for the reason, as stated in Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 179\n, 4 S. Ct. 355, that such property is in the custody of the law and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, from which the process has issued, for the purposes of the writ; that to disturb this possession by process from a state court would be to invade the jurisdiction of the federal court by whose command it is held.\n We do not stop to consider whether this rule is applicable to the present case, where the property is in the hands of a sheriff under process issued by a state court, and the action to recover possession, normally within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts, is brought in a federal court on the sole ground of diversity of citizenship. \n1\n We find it unnecessary to do so for the reasons now to be stated.\n The effect of the Idaho so-called claim and delivery statute (Code Idaho 1932,  6-301 et seq.) is to abolish the common-law action of replevin and substitute therefor the statutory action. Under the statute the action will lie whether immediate possession be demanded or not. If immediate delivery be claimed, an affidavit must be filed setting forth certain facts, and a written undertaking in a prescribed form be given. Here petitioner filed no affidavit or undertaking, nor did he seek \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 65]\n\u00a0\n the immediate possession of the property. If, upon the trial, he proves his case, the form of judgment prescribed by the statute is for the possession of the property or the value thereof in case a delivery cannot be had. Bates v. Capital State Bank, 21 Idaho, 141, 149, 121 P. 561.\n Respondent's position is based upon the view that since a state court cannot interfere with property held by a United States marshal under process issued by a federal court, by parity of reasoning a federal court cannot interfere with property held by a sheriff under process issued by a state court. Petitioner-making no attempt to distinguish the one case from the other-in terms neither concedes nor denies this view. He replies simply that under the Idaho statute no conflict between the courts is involved, for, since the sheriff's possession has not been and need not be disturbed, there is no question of conflict of possession before the court. He rests his case, in this respect, upon the provision of the statute ( Code 1932,  7-1104) allowing judgment for the value of the property where delivery cannot be had. In this aspect, we put aside the question of interference with the jurisdiction of the state court as not being really involved. If, upon a new trial, petitioner and respondent unite in the view that a delivery cannot be had, we perceive no reason why the trial court may not proceed with the case upon that theory and dispose of it as one to recover the value of the property and damages; and we hold accordingly. Should a different situation be presented, it can be appropriately dealt with when it arises. That under the Idaho statute the court may thus dispose of the case when for any reason a delivery cannot be had, is a proposition which finds abundant support in the decisions. Boley v. Griswold, 20 Wall. 486; Erreca v. Meyer, 142 Cal. 308, 310, 75 P. 826; Claudius v. Aguirre, 89 Cal. 501, 504 et seq., 26 P. 1077; De Thomas v. Withereby, 61 Cal. 92, 97, 44 Am.Rep. 542; Donovan v. \n\n[290 U.S. 59, 66]\n\u00a0\n Aetna Indemnity Co., 10 Cal.App. 723, 727-729, 103 P. 365.\n In Porter v. Davidson (C.C.) 62 F. 626, 629, a similar conclusion was reached under a North Carolina statute. That court, after stating the rule laid down in Freeman v. Howe, supra, Covell v. Heyman, supra, and other cases, held that these decisions went only to the possession of the res, and that the remedy might be pursued against the sheriff for damages in any court. 'The proceedings of the plaintiff in this case by which he took from the possession of the sheriff the chattels levied on was ancillary, not in any way affecting the merits of the original case. That can go on without conflicting with any of the cases quoted above.'\n The Court of Appeals did not consider the question whether petitioner had made out a case of actual possession in Oregon. Nor can we say from the very general words of the judge in granting respondent's motion and in discharging the jury that this precise question of fact was passed upon by the trial court. We, therefore, do not consider it, but leave it to be disposed of in the further proceedings which must be had in the District Court.\n Judgments reversed, and cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Wise v.

CHATTANOOGA BOILER & TANK CO.(1933)\nNo. 18\nArgued: April 10, 1933Decided: May 22, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. John W. Bricker and Oscar A. Brown, both of Columbus, Ohio, and Gilbert Bettman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for the State of Ohio.\n Mr. Francis J. Wright, of Columbus, Ohio, for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Ohio invokes, by an action at law, the original jurisdiction of this Court to recover the sum of $4,910.64 from the Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Company, a corporation organized in Tennessee and having its principal place of business there. Reimbursement is sought by the state of the amount paid from its insurance fund to Mrs. Cora Tidwell, as compensation for the death \n\n[289 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n of her husband, an employee of the company, who was killed at Ironton, Ohio, while engaged in erecting a tank. The claim rests upon the Workmen's Compensation Act of Ohio, sections 1465-37 to 1465-110 of the General Code,- a law of the compulsory type held constitutional in Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642.\n The proceeding at bar is one to enforce a statutory cause of action for liquidated damages, based on an award made to Mrs. Tidwell by the Industrial Commission. \n1\n The employer relies, as its only defense, upon the full faith and credit clause, invoking the rule declared in Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696. That defense was not set up in the proceedings before the Ohio commission. The Ohio law does not provide for review of an award by an appeal; but the employer is entitled to challenge, in an action for reimbursement, the correctness of the award in \n\n[289 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n all respects save the amount of compensation. \n2\n Whether the full faith and credit clause is applicable to proceedings in this Court in the same manner and to the same extent as to proceedings in the courts of a state and in the lower federal courts, we have no occasion to consider; for we are of opinion that on the facts here presented the rule declared in the Clapper Case is not applicable.\n The following facts were agreed: The employer never had a regular place of business in Ohio; had not qualified to do business there as a foreign corporation; and had not complied with the provisions of the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Law, either by becoming a subscriber to the state insurance fund or by electing to pay compensation direct to injured employees or to their dependents in case of death. Both the company and Tidwell were residents of Tennessee; Tidwell had entered its employ there; it was a term of the employment that he should serve also in other states; and he had been brought to Ohio to erect there the tank which had been fabricated in Tennessee. Both the company and Tidwell had accepted the pro- \n\n[289 U.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n visions of the Tennessee Workmen's Compensation Act, a law of the elective type; and under that law his widow would have been entitled to recover as compensation about $2,200. After Tidwell's death, his widow, who had become a citizen and resident of Georgia, filed her application for compensation with the Industrial Commission of Ohio. The company, appearing specially, challenged the jurisdiction of the commission. The objection was overruled; the company made no defense before that tribunal; and the commission found that the company was an employer within the meaning of the Ohio law; that the injury was sustained accidentally in the course of the employment; and that the widow had not before filing the claim begun a court action against the employer on account of the death. Upon failure of the company to pay the award, it was paid from the state insurance fund.\n In the Clapper Case it was held that the Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act was a defense to an action brought in New Hampshire under the New Hampshire act to recover for the death in that state of a Vermont resident who had been employed by a Vermont company, pursuant to a contract made in Vermont; because : 'It clearly was the purpose of the Vermont act3 to preclude \n\n[289 U.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n any recovery by proceedings brought in another state for injuries received in the course of a Vermont employment.' 286 U.S. at page 153, 52 S.Ct. 571, 573.4 The Tennessee act is different. It is true that it provides that, 'when an accident happens while the employee is elsewhere than in this state, which would entitle him or his dependents to compensation had it happened in this state, the employee or his dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this chapter if the contract of employment was made in this state, unless otherwise expressly provided by said contract,' Tenn. Code 1932,  6870; and that 'the rights and remedies herein granted to an employee subject to this chapter on account of personal injury or death by accident shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, his personal representative, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury or death.' Id.  6859. But, as construed and applied by the highest court of Tennessee, the statute does not preclude recovery under the law of another state. And the full faith and credit clause does not require that greater effect be given the Tennessee statute elsewhere than is given in the courts of that state. Compare Allen v. Alleghany Co., \n196 \nU.S. 458, 465\n, 25 S.Ct. 311; Robertson v. Pickrell, \n109 \nU.S. 608, 610\n, 611 S., 3 S.Ct. 407; Board of Public Works v. Columbia College, 17 Wall. 521, 529.\n The decision in Tidwell v. Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Co., 163 Tenn. 420, 43 S.W.(2d) 221, 222, Id., 163 Tenn. 648, 45 S.W.(2d) 528, shows that the provision of the Tennessee law making its remedy an exclusive one is not applicable on the facts here presented. In that case, Mrs. Tidwell brought (while the application in Ohio was pending and before \n\n[289 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n the award) an action in Tennessee to recover compensation under the Tennessee act. The court held that by bringing the Ohio proceedings the widow had renounced her right under the Tennessee act; and final judgment was entered for the company shortly before the action at bar was gebun. The opinion states that the suit is one upon contract; that 'the sole defense interposed is the proceedings in Ohio'; that the institution of the proceedings in Ohio 'was a clear renunciation or disaffirmance of the contract; ... that the election thus made was irrevocable because petitioner (Mrs. Tidwell) has taken the benefit of the Ohio suti and defendant (the company) will doubtless take the detriment of that suit'; and the court added: 'Not prejudging another case, but merely by way of answer to argument made in this case, we may observe that defendant's way of escape from the Ohio proceedings and award is not apparent, after the pleading by the defendant of such proceedings and award to defeat its liability herein.' In view of this decision, we have no occasion to consider differences in phraseology between the Tennessee statute and that of Vermont.\n Judgment for the plaintiff. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Any employee whose employer has failed to comply with the provisions of section 1465-69, who has been injured or has suffered an occupational disease in the course of his employment, and which was not purposely self-inflicted, or his dependents in case death has ensued, may, in lieu of proceedings against his employer by civil action in the courts, as provided in section 1465-73, file his application with the commission for compensation and the commission shall hear and determine such application for compensation in like manner as in other claims and shall make such award to such claimant as he would be entitled to receive if such employer had complied with the provisions of section 1465-69, and such employer shall pay such award in the manner and amount fixed thereby or shall furnish to the industrial commission a bond, in such an amount and with such sureties as the commission may require, to pay such employee such award in the manner and amount fixed thereby.

Ormsby was a resident and citizen of Pennsylvania until his death June 14, 1926. He owned a building in New York City in which he maintained and operated a passenger elevator. Respondent was one of his tenants, and October 17, 1925, the elevator, in which she was being carried, fell, seriously injuring her. She did not sue him, but after his death, brought this suit in the federal court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against his executors to recover damages on account of such injuries, alleging them to have been caused by the negligence of deceased. The affidavit of defense alleged that plaintiff's cause of action abated with the testator's death. The district court so held. 3 F.Supp. 680. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 65 F.(2d) 521.\n Plaintiff's statement of claim did not allege that her right of action survived the death of the deceased. It was not made to survive by any statute of New York, and under the common law there is force did abate with his death. Gorlitzer v. Wolffberg, 208 N.Y. 475, 102 N.E. 528, Ann.

Koster and Ralph W. Smith, both of Los Angeles, Cal ., for petitioner.\n Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n McDonnell v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 420\n, 53 S.Ct. 410, decided this day, involved the question of the effect of section 278(e) ( 26 USCA  1062 note) on \n\n[288 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n assessment waivers where the period for assessment had expired before the effective date of the act of 1924. This case involves the effect of that section on collection waivers where the period for collection had expired before the effective date of the act of 1924, but where the assessment had been timely and before the act.\n On May 13, 1929, Pacific Coast Steel Company brought this action in the federal court for Northern California, to recover the amount paid as additional income and excess profits taxes for the year 1917. The return for that year was made, and the tax thereby shown to be due was paid, on March 30, 1918. On December 9, 1922, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined a deficiency of $257,443.30; and on February 9, 1923, he assessed that amount against the plaintiff. Thus the assessment was made within five years from the date of the filing of the return and before expiration of the period allowed therefor by section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 265). Thereafter, by proceedings in the Bureau, the amount of the claimed deficiency was reduced to $129,920.06 through credits of overpayments of other years. For that amount the Commissioner made demand on July 16, 1927; that is, more than five years after the date of the taxpayer's return, in 1918. The government relied, as extending the period for collection, upon a waiver given on December 7, 1925; that is, more than five years after the return.\n The District Court, without opinion, entered judgment for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the waiver, though in terms extending the time for assessment, was effective to extend that for collection; and that the waiver was valid under  278 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (See 26 USCA  1058-1060, 1061 note, 1062 note). The judgment of the District Court was accordingly affirmed. 61 F.(2d) 73. This Court granted certiorari, 'limited to the question of the effect of section 278( e) of the Revenue Act of 1924.' \n287 \nU.S. 595\n, 53 S.Ct. 313, 77 L.Ed. --. \n\n[288 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner contends that clause (2) of paragraph (e) of section 278 (26 USCA  1062 note), which states that the section shall not 'affect any assessment made, or distraint or proceeding in court begun, before ( the enactment of this Act),' renders paragraph (c) inoperative in the case at bar; that the waiver therefore had no statutory authority and was of no effect. The government insists, in answer to this contention, that, even if clause (2) thus qualifies paragraph (c),1 the waiver is nevertheless valid either without express statutory authority or under the authority of the Revenue Act of 1921,  250(d),2 which, it is argued, remained in force by virtue of  110(b) of the Act of 1924.3 We do not pass upon this contention of the government; for we are of opinion that paragraph (c) is not rendered inoperative by clause (2) of paragraph (e).\n The meaning of clause (2) was considered in Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181\n, 49 S.Ct. 121. It was there pointed out \n\n[288 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n that the distinction in the act of 1924 between existing and subsequent assessments derived significance from the contemporaneous creation of the Board of Tax Appeals. Assessments made after June 2, 1924, 'generally, at least, if objected to, could not be made without assent of the Board. To secure proper action by the Board might require considerable time, and this was provided for by extending the limitation to six years after assessment.' 278 U.S. at page 186, 49 S.Ct. 121, 122. Where an assessment was made before the act, the reason for the extension did not exist. In the case of waivers, no such considerations exist to indicate that Congress intended to distinguish between assessments made before and those made after the act. It was held in the Russell Case that to apply paragraph (d), extending the period for collection to six years after assessment, to an assessment made before the act, would 'affect' that assessment, and hence was forbidden by clause (2) of paragraph (e). Such an application, it was said, 'would be retroactive; and certainly it would produce radical change in the existing status of the claim against the petitioners-would extend for some five years, a liability which had almost expired.' 278 U.S. at page 187, 49 S.Ct. 121, 123. In the case at bar no such effect follows upon a recognition of the waiver. The claim against the petitioners was barred, it is true, at the time of the enactment of the 1924 act; but even before the act the claim was subject to revival by waiver of the statute of limitations. We are of opinion, therefore, that paragraph (c) does not 'affect' the assessment in the case at bar so as to be rendered inoperative by clause (2) of paragraph (e).\n There remains the question of the effect of clause (1) of paragraph ( e), which provides that section 278 shall not authorize an assessment or collection already barred at the effective date of the 1924 act. This is the same question considered in the McDonnell Case, \n288 \nU.S. 420\n, 53 S.Ct. 410, with respect to assessment waivers, and for the reasons there \n\n[288 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n stated we hold that the clause does not impair the validity of the waiver here involved.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(c) Where both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the time prescribed in section 1057(277) of this title for its assessment the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.'

BENDER(1933)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Tucker, Jr., of Shreveport, La., Henry P. Dart and Henry P. Dart, Jr., both of New Orleans, La., and Fred R. Angevine, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought suit in the District Court for Western Louisiana to recover taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted for 1921 and 1922 upon income derived from oil properties by petitioner as a member of two partnerships, known, respectively, as the Smitherman and Baird partnerships. Both partnerships, after 1913, acquired oil and gas leases of unproved Louisiana lands and engaged in drilling operations on them which resulted in discovery of oil on March 30, 1921, in the case of the Smitherman leases and on August 23, 1919, in the case of the Baird leases.\n In April, 1921, the Smitherman partnership executed a writing by which it conferred on the Ohio Oil Company the right to take over a part of the leased property on which the producing well was located, subject to the obligations of the covenants of the leases, in consideration of a present payment of a cash bonus, a future payment to be made 'out of one- half of the first oil produced and saved' to the extent of $1,000,000, and an additional 'ex- \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n cess royalty' of one-eighth of all the oil produced and saved. The instrument in terms stated that the partnership 'does sell, assign, set over, transfer and deliver ... unto the Ohio Oil Company' the described leased premises. The Baird partnership in November, 1921, gave a similar document to the Gulf Refining Company containing some additional features which, in the view we take are immaterial. It too stipulated for future payment of royalties in kind from the oil produced and saved.\n Petitioner's tax returns for the years 1921 and 1922 reported his distributive share of the income from the Smitherman partnership, derived from the bonus payment and oil received under its contract with the Ohio Oil Company, and also his share in the income from the Baird partnership from oil received under its contract with the Gulf Refining Company. In the returns for both years, petitioner, relying upon the provisions of section 214(a)(10) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 239), regulating depletion allowances in the case of oil and gas wells, made a deduction for depletion based on the value of the oil in place in the two properties on the respective dates of discovery.\n The Commissioner refused to allow these deductions, on the theory that both transactions were sales of the leases by the partnerships, and that the only allowable deductions, in calculating taxable gain, are those based upon the cost of the respective properties to petitioner, in each case materially less than their value at the date of the discovery of oil. This resulted in the assessment and payment of an increased tax which is the subject of the present suit. Judgment of the District Court, 49 F.(2d) 316, denying petitioner the right to make the deductions claimed, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 57 F.(2d) 32. This court granted certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 586\n, 53 S.Ct. 79, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Both courts below, following earlier decisions of the Court of Appeals with respect to the two instruments \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n involved here, held that they were assignments or sales of the leases for the stipulated consideration of bonus paid and royalties to be received. See Waller v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 892; Herold v. Commissioner ( C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 942. The government rests its case on this conclusion. It concedes that, if any reversionary interest, according to the common law, however small, has been retained in the leased land by the two partnerships, the petitioner is entitled to the depletion allowances claimed, but insists that no such interest was reserved by the instruments in question. Petitioner contends that by the Louisiana law any transfer of an interest in land, yielding to the transferor, as consideration, the fruits of the land as they may be produced, such as the royalty oil in the present case, must be regarded as a lease. See Roberson v. Pioneer Gas Company, 173 La. 313, 137 So. 46. From this he concludes that the two instruments were subleases, and invokes the rule recently affirmed in Murphy Oil Company v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, decided December 5, 1932, that the lessor of an oil and gas well is entitled to a depletion allowance upon bonus and royalties received from the lessee, under section 234(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1077). Section 214(a)(10) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which is applicable here, contains the same provisions.\n It has been elaborately argued at the bar and in the briefs whether under Louisiana law the two instruments are assignments or subleases. We do not think the distinction material. Nothing in section 214(a)(10) indicates that its application is to be controlled or varied by any particular characterization by local law of the interests to which it is to be applied. See Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, decided November 7, 1932. We look to the statute itself and to the decisions construing it to ascertain to what interests it is to be applied, and then to the particular interests secured to the two partnerships by the instruments in question to ascertain whether they come within the statutory provision. The formal attributes of those instruments or the descrip- \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n tive terminology which may be applied to them in the local law are both irrelevant.\n Section 214(a)(10) of the Revenue Act of 1921, so far as now material, is printed in the margin. \n1\n It will be observed that the statute directs that reasonable allowance for depletion be made as a deduction in computing net taxable income, 'in the case of ... oil and gas wells , ... according to the peculiar conditions in each case.' The allowance to the taxpayer is not restricted by the words of the statute to cases of any particular class or to any special form of legal interest in the oil well. It is true that under article 215 of Treasury Regulations 62 the lessor of an oil or gas well is entitled to a depletion allowance upon the bonus and royalties received from the lessee. See Murphy Oil Company v. Burnet, supra. But there is nothing in the statute or regulations which confines depletion allowances to those who are technically lessors. The concluding sentence of the section that 'In the case of leases the deductions allowed by this paragraph shall be equitably appor- \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n tioned between the lessor and the lessee' presupposes that the deductions may be allowed in other cases. The language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.\n That the allowance for depletion is not made dependent upon the particular legal form of the taxpayer's interest in the property to be depleted was recognized by this Court in Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364\n, 45 S.Ct. 274. There a depletion allowance under section 12(a) of the 1916 act, 39 Stat. 767, was claimed by a lessee of a mining lease, in the computation of tax on income from the proceeds of ore mined. The statute made no specific reference to lessees, and the government argued that, as the lessee acquired no ownership of the ore until the severance from the soil (see United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 116, 123\n, 38 S.Ct. 462), the lease gave him no depletable interest in the ore in place. But this Court held that, regardless of the technical ownership of the ore before severance, the taxpayer, by his lease, had acquired legal control of a valuable economic interest in the ore capable of realization as gross income by the exercise of his mining rights under the lease. Depletion was therefore allowed.\n Similarly, the lessor's right to a depletion allowance does not depend upon his retention of ownership or any other particular form of legal interest in the mineral content of the land. It is enough if by virtue of the leasing transaction he has retained a right to share in the oil produced. If so, he has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production. Thus we have recently held that the lessor is entitled to a depletion allowance on bonus and royalties, although by the local \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n law ownership of the minerals in place passed from the lessor upon the execution of the lease. See Burnet v. Harmel, supra; Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Company v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308\n, 53 S.Ct. 150, decided December 5, 1932\n\n\n In the present case the two partnerships acquired by the leases to them, complete legal control of the oil in place. Even though legal ownership of it, in a technical sense, remained in their lessor, they, as lessees, nevertheless acquired an economic interest in it which represented their capital investment and was subject to depletion under the statute. Lynch v. Halworth-Stephens Co., supra. When the two lessees transferred their operating rights to the two oil companies, whether they became technical sublessors or not, they retained, by their stipulations for royalties, an economic interest in the oil, in place, identical with that of a lessor. Burnet v. Harmel; Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Company v. Burnet, supra. Thus throughout their changing relationships with respect to the properties, the oil in the ground was a reservoir of capital investment of the several parties, all of whom, the original lessors, the two partnerships, and their transferees, were entitled to share in the oil produced. Production and sale of the oil would result in its depletion and also in a return of capital investment to the parties according to their respective interests. The loss or destruction of the oil at any time from the date of the leases until complete extraction would have resulted in loss to the partnerships. Such an interest is, we think, included within the meaning and purpose of the statute permitting deduction in the case of oil and gas wells of a reasonable allowance for depletion according to the peculiar conditions in each case.\n The statute makes effective the legislative policy, favoring the discoverer of oil, by valuing his capital investment for purposes of depletion at the date of the discovery rather than at its original cost. The benefit of it accrues \n\n[287 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n to the discoverer if he operates the well as owner or lessee, or if he leases it to another. It would be an anomaly if that policy were to be defeated and all benefit of the depletion allowance withheld because he chose to secure the return of his capital investment by stipulating for a share of the oil produced from the discovered well through operation by another.\n The bonus received by the Smitherman partnership was a return pro tanto of the petitioner's capital investment in the oil, in anticipation of its extraction, resulting in a corresponding diminution in the unit depletion allowance upon the royalty oil as produced.

CO. v. CHAMBERLAIN(1933)\nNo. 379\nArgued: January 19, 1933Decided: February 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Morton L. Fearey and Roscoe H. Hupper, both of New York City, and Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Sol Gelb, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by respondent against petitioner to recover for the death of a brakeman, alleged to have been caused by petitioner's negligence. The complaint alleges that the deceased, at the time of the accident resulting in his death, was assisting in the yard work of breaking up and making up trains and in the classifying and assorting of cars operating in interstate commerce; that in pursuance of such work, while riding a cut of cars, other cars ridden by fellow employees were negligently caused to be brought into violent contact with those upon which deceased was riding, with the result that he was thrown therefrom to the railroad track and run over by a car or cars, inflicting injuries from which he died.\n At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of petitioner. Judgment upon a verdict so found was reversed by the Court of Appeals, Judge Swan dissenting. 59 F.(2d) 986.\n That part of the yard in which the accident occurred contained a lead track and a large number of switching tracks branching therefrom. The lead track crossed a 'hump,' and the work of car distribution consisted of pushing a train of cars by means of a locomotive to the top of the 'hump,' and then allowing the cars, in separate strings, to descend by gravity, under the control of \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n hand brakes, to their respective destinations in the various branch tracks. Deceased had charge of a string of two gondola cars, which he was piloting to track 14. Immediately ahead of him was a string of seven cars, and behind him a string of nine cars, both also destined for track 14. Soon after the cars ridden by deceased had passed to track 14, his body was found on that track some distance beyond the switch. He had evidently fallen onto the track and been run over by a car or cars.\n The case for respondent rests wholly upon the claim that the fall of deceased was caused by a violent collision of the string of nine cars with the string ridden by deceased. Three employees, riding the nine-car string, testified positively that no such collision occurred. They were corroborated by every other employee in a position to see, all testifying that there was no contact between the nine-car string and that of the deceased. The testimony of these witnesses, if believed, establishes beyond doubt that there was no collision between these two strings of cars, and that the nine-car string contributed in no way to the accident. The only witness who testified for the respondent was one Bainbridge; and it is upon his testimony alone that respondent's right to recover is sought to be upheld. His testimony is concisely stated, in its most favorable light for respondent, in the prevailing opinion below by Judge Learned Hand, as follows:\n'The plaintiff's only witness to the event, one Bainbridge, then employed by the road, stood close to the yardmaster's office, near the 'hump.' He professed to have paid little attention to what went on, but he did see the deceased riding at the rear of his cars, whose speed when they passed him he took to be about eight or ten miles. Shortly thereafter a second string passed which was shunted into another track and this was followed by the nine, which, according to the plaintiff's theory, col- \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n lided with the deceased's. After the nine cars had passed at a somewhat greater speed than the deceased's, Bainbridge paid no more attention to either string for a while, but looked again when the deceased, who was still standing in his place, had passed the switch and onto the assorting track where he was bound. At that time his speed had been checked to about three miles, but the speed of the following nine cars had increased. They were just passing the switch, about four or five cars behind the deceased. Bainbridge looked away again and soon heard what he described as a 'loud crash,' not however an unusual event in a switching yard. Apparently this did not cause him at once to turn, but he did so shortly thereafter, and saw the two strings together, still moving, and the deceased no longer in sight. Later still his attention was attracted by shouts and he went to the spot and saw the deceased between the rails. Until he left to go to the accident, he had stood fifty feet to the north of the track where the accident happened, and about nine hundred feet from where the body was found.'\n\n The court, although regarding Bainbridge's testimony as not only 'somewhat suspicious in itself, but its contradiction ... so manifold as to leave little doubt,' held, nevertheless, that the question was one of fact depending upon the credibility of the witnesses, and that it was for the jury to determine, as between the one witness and the many, where the truth lay. The dissenting opinion of Judge Swan proceeds upon the theory that Bainbridge did not testify that in fact a collision had taken place, but inferred it because he heard a crash, and because thereafter the two strings of cars appeared to him to be moving together. It is correctly pointed out in that opinion, however, that the crash might have come from elsewhere in the busy yard and that Bainbridge was in no position to see whether the two strings of cars were actually together; that Bainbridge repeatedly said he was \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 338]\n\u00a0\n paying no particular attention; and that his position was such, being 900 feet from the place where the body was found and less than 50 feet from the side of the track in question, that he necessarily saw the strings of cars at such an acute angle that it would be physically impossible even for an attentive observer to tell whether the forward end of the nine-car cut was actually in contact with the rear end of the two-car cut. The dissenting opinion further points out that all the witnesses who were in a position to see testified that there was no collision; that respondent's evidence was wholly circumstantial, and the inferences which might otherwise be drawn from it were shown to be utterly erroneous unless all of petitioner's witnesses were willful perjurers. 'This is not a case,' the opinion proceeds, 'where direct testimony to an essential fact is contradicted by direct testimony of other witnesses, though even there it is conceded a directed verdict might be proper in some circumstances. Here, when all the testimony was in, the circumstantial evidence in support of negligence was thought by the trial judge to be so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify submission to the jury.'\n We thus summarize and quote from the prevailing and dissenting opinions, because they present the divergent views to be considered in reaching a correct determination of the question involved. It, of course, is true, generally, that where there is a direct conflict of testimony upon a matter of fact, the question must be left to the jury to determine, without regard to the number of witnesses upon either side. But here there really is no conflict in the testimony as to the facts. The witnesses for petitioner flatly testified that there was no collision between the nine- car and the two-car strings. Bainbridge did not say there was such a collision. What he said was that he heard a 'loud crash,' which did not cause him at once to turn, \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n but that shortly thereafter he did turn and saw the two strings of cars moving together with the deceased no longer in sight; that there was nothing unusual about the crash of cars-it happened every day; that there was nothing about this crash to attract his attention except that it was extra loud; that he paid no attention to it; that it was not sufficient to attract his attention. The record shows that there was a continuous movement of cars over and down the 'hump,' which were distributed among a large number of branch tracks within the yard, and that any two strings of these cars moving upon the same track might have come together and caused the crash which Bainbridge heard. There is no direct evidence that in fact the crash was occasioned by a collision of the two strings in question; and it is perfectly clear that no such fact was brought to Bainbridge's attention as a perception of the physical sense of sight or of hearing. At most there was an inference to that effect drawn from observed facts which gave equal support to the opposite inference that the crash was occasioned by the coming together of other strings of cars entirely away from the scene of the accident, or of the two-car string ridden by deceased and the seven-car string immediately ahead of it.\n We, therefore, have a case belonging to that class of cases where proven facts give equal support to each of two inconsistent inferences; in which event, neither of them being established, judgment, as a matter of law, must go against the party upon whom rests the necessity of sustaining one of these inferences as against the other, before he is entitled to recover.

Walters, \n284 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 52 S.Ct. 58, 59.\n The rule is succinctly stated in Smith v. First National Bank in Westfield, 99 Mass. 605, 611-612, 97 Am.Dec. 59, quoted in the Des Moines National Bank Case, supra:\n'There being several inferences deducible from the facts which appear, and equally consistent with all those facts, the plaintiff has not maintained the proposition upon which alone he would be entitled to recover. There is strictly no evidence to warrant a jury in finding that the loss was occasioned by negligence and not by theft. When the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof. A verdict in favor of the party bound to maintain one of those propositions against the other is necessarily wrong.'\n\n That Bainbridge concluded from what he himself observed that the crash was due to a collision between the two strings of cars in question is sufficiently indicated by his statements. But this, of course, proves nothing, since it is not allowable for a witness to resolve the doubt as to which of two equally justifiable inferences shall be adopted by drawing a conclusion, which, if accepted, will result in a purely gratuitous award in favor of the party who has failed to sustain the burden of proof cast upon him by the law.\n And the desired inference is precluded for the further reason that respondent's right of recovery depends upon the existence of a particular fact which must be inferred \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 341]\n\u00a0\n from proven facts, and this is not permissible in the face of the positive and otherwise uncontradicted testimony of unimpeached witnesses consistent with the facts actually proved, from which testimony it affirmatively appears that the fact sought to be inferred did not exist. This conclusion results from a consideration of many decisions, of which the following are examples: Wabash R. Co. v. De Tar (C.C.A.) 141 F. 932, 935, 4 L.R.A.(N.S.) 352; Ragsdale v. Southern Ry. Co.

Co., 174 Mich. 339, 344, 140 N.W. 524; Rashall v. Railroad, 249 Mo. 509, 522, 155 S. W. 426; George v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., 213 Mo.App. 668, 674, 251 S.W. 729, 732; Stines v. Dillman (.mo.App.) 4 S.W.(2d) 477, 478; Akerson v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 158 Minn. 369, 374, 197 N.W. 842; Butterfield v. Trittipo et al., 67 Ind. 338, 343, 344; Blid v. Chicago & N.W.R. Co., supra, at pages 691-693 of 89 Neb., 131 N.W. 1027. A rebuttable inference of fact, as said by the court in the Wabash Railroad Case, 'must necessarily yield to credible evidence of the actual occurrence.' And, as stated by the court in George v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., supra, 'It is well settled that, where plaintiff's case is based upon an inference or inferences, the case must fail upon proof of undisputed facts inconsistent with such inferences.' Compare Fresh v. Gilson et al., 16 Pet. 327, 330, 331. In Southern Ry. Co. v. Walters, supra, the negligence charged was failure to stop a train and flag a crossing before proceeding over it. The court concluded that the only support for the charge was an inference sought to be drawn from certain facts proved. In rejecting the inference, this court said:\n'It is argued that it may be inferred from the speed of the train when some of the witnesses observed it crossing other streets as well as Bond avenue, and from a guess of the engineer as to the time required to get up such speed \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 342]\n\u00a0\n after a full stop, that none could have been made at Bond avenue. But the argument amounts to mere speculation in view of the limited scope of the witnesses' observation, the down grade of the railway tracks at the point, and the time element involved. Compare Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472\n, 46 S.Ct. 564. Five witnesses for defendant (employees) testified that a full stop was made and the crossing flagged, and that no one was hit by the rear of the tender, which was the front of the train.\n\n'An examination of the record requires the conclusion that the evidence on the issue whether the train was stopped before crossing Bond avenue was so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify a submission of that issue to the jury.'\n\n Not only is Bainbridge's testimony considered as a whole suspicious, insubstantial, and insufficient, but his statement that when he turned shortly after hearing the crash the two strings were moving together is simply incredible, if he meant thereby to be understood as saying that he saw the two in contact; and if he meant by the words 'moving together' simply that they were moving at the same time in the same direction but not in contact, the statement becomes immaterial. As we have already seen he was paying slight and only occasional attention to what was going on. The cars were eight or nine hundred feet from where he stood and moving almost directly away from him, his angle of vision being only 3 33 from a straight line. At that sharp angle and from that distance, near dusk of a misty evening (as the proof shows), the practical impossibility of the witness being able to see whether the front of the nine-car string was in contact with the back of the two-car string is apparent. And, certainly, in the light of these conditions, no verdict based upon a statement so unbelievable reasonably could be sustained as against the positive testimony to the contrary of unimpeached witnesses, all in a position to see, \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 343]\n\u00a0\n as this witness was not, the precise relation of the cars to one another. The fact that these witnesses were employees of the petitioner, under the circumstances here disclosed, does not impair this conclusion. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Martin, \n283 U.S. 209\n, 216-220, 51 S.Ct. 453.\n We think, therefore, that the trial court was right in withdrawing the case from the jury. It repeatedly has been held by this court that before evidence may be left to the jury, 'there is a preliminary question for the judge, not whether there is literally no evidence, but whether there is any upon which a jury can properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it, upon whom the onus of proof is imposed.' Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 120, 121. And where the evidence is 'so overwhelmingly on one side as to leave no room to doubt what the fact is, the court should give a peremptory instruction to the jury.' Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 94\n, 50 S.Ct. 231, 233; Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658, 660\n, 21 S.Ct. 275. The rule is settled for the federal courts, and for many of the state courts, that whenever in the trial of a civil case the evidence is clearly such that if a verdict were rendered for one of the parties the other would be entitled to a new trial, it is the duty of the judge to direct the jury to find according to the views of the court. Such a practice, this court has said, not only saves time and expense, but 'gives scientific certainty to the law in its application to the facts and promotes the ends of justice.' Bowditch v. Boston, \n101 U.S. 16\n, 18; Barrett v. Virginian Ry. Co., \n250 \nU.S. 473, 476\n, 39 S.Ct. 540, and cases cited; Herbert v. Butler, \n97 U.S. 319\n, 320. The scintilla rule has been definitely and repeatedly rejected so far as the federal courts are concerned. Schuylkill & D. Improvement & R. Company v. Munson, 14 Wall. 442, 448; Commissioners of Marion County v. Clark, \n94 U.S. 278\n, 284; Small Co. v. Lamborn & Co., \n267 \nU.S. 248, 254\n, 45 S. Ct. 300; Gunning v. Cooley, supra; Ewing v. Goode, supra (C. C.) at pages 443-444 of 78 F. \n\n[288 U.S. 333, 344]\n\u00a0\n Leaving out of consideration, then, the inference relied upon, the case for respondent is left without any substantial support in the evidence, and a verdict in her favor would have rested upon mere speculation and conjecture. This, of course, is inadmissible. C.M. & St. P. Ry. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 46 S.Ct. 564; Gulf, etc., R.R. v. Wells, \n275 \nU.S. 455, 459\n, 48 S.Ct. 151; New York C.R. Co. v.

RUSSELL & CO.(1933)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Cattron Rigby and Fred W. Llewellyn, both of Washington, D.C., for People of Puerto Rico.\n Mr. Francis E. Neagle, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The people of Puerto Rico, the petitioner, brought this suit in the insular district court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, against the respondent Russell & Co., a sociedad en comandita organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, to recover certain assessments levied on lands of Russell & Co., under an act of the Legislature of Puerto Rico. The individual respondents, members of the sociedad, none of whom are citizens of Puerto Rico or domiciled there, were not named as defendants. They appeared specially in the insular court and removed the cause to the United States District Court for Puerto Rico. That court denied a motion to remand and gave its decree for respondents on the ground, first raised by the answer, that the assess- \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n ments sued for were levied in violation of section 2 of the Organic Act of Porto Rico, March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951 (48 USCA  737), forbidding the enactment of any law impairing the obligation of contract. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, 60 F.(2d) 10; this Court granted certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 593\n, 53 S.Ct. 222, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Section 41 of the Organic Act (48 USCA  863) confers on the United States District Court for Puerto Rico 'jurisdiction of all cases cognizable in the district courts of the United States,' and also 'jurisdiction of all controversies where all of the parties on either side of the controversy are citizens ... of a foreign State or States, or citizens of a State, Territory, or District of the United States not domiciled in Porto Rico, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or cost, the sum or value of $3,000.' By section 42 (48 USCA  864) 'the laws of the United States relating to ... removal of causes, and other matters or proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the several States shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the district court of the United States and the courts of Porto Rico. ...' Thus suits arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States are within the jurisdiction of the District Court for Puerto Rico (section 24, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41 (28 USCA  41)), and civil suits begun in the insular court over which the federal court has original jurisdiction may be removed in accordance with the provisions of section 28 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  71 (28 USCA  71)).\n Admittedly, if the individual members of the sociedad are 'parties' within the meaning of the Organic Act,  41, supra, the suit is one within the jurisdiction of the District Court because of their nonresidence, diversity of citizenship being unnecessary. See Porto Rico Ry., Light & Power Co. v. Mor, \n253 \nU.S. 345\n, 40 S.Ct. 516. And, if the nonresidence of the individual members would confer jurisdiction upon the federal court in a suit against the sociedad \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n originally instituted there, we will assume, for present purposes, that it would also suffice to justify removal by the individuals, even though the insular court refuses to recognize them as parties. Compare McLaughlin v. Hallowell, \n228 \nU.S. 278, 290\n, 33 S.Ct. 465. The petitioner argues, nevertheless, that the suit was not removable because of citizenship, for the reason that the sociedad is a juridical entity under Puerto Rican law and, as in the case of a corporation, its domicile rather than that of its members determines citizenship for purposes of federal jurisdiction. If the petitioner's contention is sound, the District Court was without jurisdiction, unless the suit was, as the respondents argue, one arising under the laws of the United States. The questions raised by these contentions must therefore first be answered.\n For almost a century, in ascertaining whether there is the requisite diversity of citizenship to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts, we have looked to the domicile of a corporation, not that of its individual stockholders, as controlling. Louisville R.R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497; Rundle v. Delaware & Raritan Canal Co., 14 How. 80; Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., 16 How. 314; Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404; Covington Draw Bridge Co. v. Shepherd, 20 How. 227; St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. James, \n161 \nU.S. 545\n, 16 S.Ct. 621; Patch v. Wabash Ry., \n207 \nU.S. 277\n, 28 S.Ct. 80, 12 Ann.Cas. 518. In its final form this rule of jurisdiction was stated in terms of a 'conclusive presumption' that the stockholders are citizens of the state of the corporate domicile, see Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., supra, 16 How. 328; Covington Draw Bridge Co. v. Shepherd, supra, 20 How. 233; St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. James, supra, \n161 \nU.S. 554\n, 16 S.Ct. 621; but even those who formulated the rule found its theoretical justification only in the complete legal personality with which corporations are endowed. Fictitious that personality may be, in the sense that the fact that the corporation is composed of a plu- \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n rality of individuals, themselves legal persons, is disregarded, but 'it is a fiction created by law with intent that it should be acted on as if true.' Klein v. Board of Supervisors, \n282 \nU.S. 19, 24\n, 51 S.Ct. 15, 16, 73 A.L.R. 679. This treatment of the aggregate for other purposes as a person distinct from its members, with capacity to perform all legal acts, made it possible and convenient to treat it so for purposes of federal jurisdiction as well. But status as a unit for purposes of suit alone, as in the case of a joint-stock company, see Chapman v. Barney, \n129 \nU.S. 677, 682\n, 9 S.Ct. 426; Levering & Garrigues v. Morrin (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 115, 117, or a limited partnership, not shown to have the other attributes of a corporation, Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n177 \nU.S. 449\n, 20 S.Ct. 690; compare Thomas v. Board of Trustees, \n195 \nU.S. 207\n, 25 S.Ct. 24, has been deemed a legal personality too incomplete; what was but an association of individuals for so many ends and a juridical entity for only a few was not easily to be treated as if it were a single citizen.\n The tradition of the common law is to treat as legal persons only incorporated groups and to assimilate all others to partnerships. Chapman v. Barney, supra; Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. v. Jones, supra. The tradition of the civil law, as expressed in the Code of Puerto Rico, is otherwise. \n1\n Therefore to call the sociedad en \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n comandita a limited partnership in the common-law sense, as the respondents and others have done, is to invoke a false analogy. In the law of its creation, the sociedad is consistently regarded as a juridical person. It may contract, own property, and transact business, sue and be sued in its own name and right. Civil Code (1930),  27 to 30; Code of Commerce (1930),  95, 97, 123, 124. Its members are not thought to have a sufficient personal interest in a suit brought against the entity to entitle them to intervene as parties defendant. See People v. Rivera Zayas, 29 Porto Rico, 423, 430. It is created by articles of association filed as public records. Code of Commerce,  95, 98; compare Civil Code,  1558, 1560. Where the articles so provide, the sociedad endures for a period prescribed by them, regardless of the death or withdrawal of individual members. Civil Code,  1591, 1596, 1598; Code of Commerce,  141. Powers of management may be vested in managers designated by the articles from among the members whose participation is unlimited, and they alone may perform acts legally binding on the sociedad. Civil Code,  1583, 1589; Code of Commerce,  102, 106, 125. Its members are not primarily liable for its acts and debts (Code of Commerce,  156), and its creditors are preferred with respect to its assets and property over the creditors of individual members, although the latter may reach the interests of the individual members in the common capital. Civil Code,  1590; see Quintana Bros. & Co. v. S. Ramirez & Co., 22 Porto Rico 707, 716. Although the members whose participation is unlimited are made contingently liable for the debts of the sociedad in the event that its assets are insufficient to satisfy them (Code of Commerce,  125, 156; see Sucrs. of M. Lamadrid & Co. v. Torrens, Mortorell & Co., 28 Porto Rico 824), this liability is of no more consequence for present purposes than that imposed on corporate stockholders by the statutes of some states. Compare Louis- \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n ville R.R. Co. v. Letson, supra, 2 How. 557, 558; Liverpool Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566, 575. These characteristics under the Codes of Puerto Rico give content to their declaration that the sociedad is a juridical person. That personality is so complete in contemplation of the law of Puerto Rico that we see no adequate reason for holding that the sociedad has a different status for purposes of federal jurisdiction than a corporation organized under that law. In neither case may nonresidents of Puerto Rico, who have taken advantage of its laws to organize a juridical entity for the purpose of carrying on business there, remove from the insular courts controversies arising under local law.\n Respondents' contention that the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States, and therefore removable, irrespective of the citizenship of the defendant, rests upon two grounds: First, that the suit was brought pursuant to an Act of Congress of April 23, 1928, 45 Stat. 447; and, second, that the plaintiff in the District Court, the People of Puerto Rico, derives its power as a sovereign political entity from the Organic Act, under which the insular government was organized.\n The act of Congress first mentioned was adopted as a result of earlier litigation with respect to the present tax. Respondent and others originally brought suits in the federal District Court of Puerto Rico to enjoin collection of the tax, pending which Congress, by Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1421 (48 USCA  872), forbade the maintenance of any suit in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico to restrain the collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico. Following that prohibition, this Court, in Smallwood v. Gallardo, \n275 \nU.S. 56\n, 48 S.Ct. 23, held that all such injunction cases then pending in the federal courts were abated by the statute, and the suit brought by respondents was accordingly dismissed. Gallardo v. Havemeyer (C.C.A.) 21 F.( 2d) 1012. Subsequently, Congress passed the law of \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n April 23, 1928, by which it was provided that in cases where the taxpayer had by such suits obtained an injunction restraining collection of the tax, the treasurer of Puerto Rico should 'enforce the collection of the tax so enjoined ... by a suit at law instead of by attachment, embargo, distraint or any other form of summary administrative proceeding. ...' Respondents argue that, as the authority to recover the tax by suit rather than by attachment or other summary method was conferred by act of Congress, the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States.\n We do not stop to examine the answering contention of petitioner that the act of Congress was not an enabling act, but operated only to preclude resort by the insular government to the summary remedies otherwise available for the collection of the tax. For we think that, even though petitioner derived its authority to maintain the suit from the act of Congress, it did not arise under the laws of the United States within the meaning of the jurisdictional statutes.\n The suit was brought to recover assessments levied under the act of the Puerto Rican Legislature, but not to enforce a right created by a law of the United States. No question of interpretation or enforcement of the federal statute appears upon the face of the complaint. Federal jurisdiction may be invoked to vindicate a right or privilege claimed under a federal statute. It may not be invoked where the right asserted is nonfederal, merely because the plaintiff's right to sue is derived from federal law, or because the property involved was obtained under federal statute. The federal nature of the right to be established is decisive-not the source of the authority to establish it. Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, \n177 \nU.S. 505\n, 20 S.Ct. 726; Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., \n175 \nU.S. 571\n, 20 S.Ct. 222; Little York Gold Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, \n96 U.S. 199\n, 203; see McGoon v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. (D.C.) 204 F. \n\n[288 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n 998, 1001; compare Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487\n, 22 S.Ct. 783. The case is analogous to those involving rights to land granted under laws or treaties of the United States. Where the complaint shows only that such was the source of the plaintiff's title, the case is not one within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Barnett v. Kunkel, \n264 \nU.S. 16, 20\n, 44 S.Ct. 254; Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561\n, 32 S.Ct. 704; Devine v. Los Angeles, \n202 \nU.S. 313, 337\n, 26 S.Ct. 652; compare Hopkins v. Walker, \n244 \nU.S. 486, 489\n, 37 S.Ct. 711; Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co., \n241 \nU.S. 551\n, 36 S.Ct. 711; Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo, \n236 \nU.S. 635, 643\n, 35 S.Ct. 446; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Soderberg, \n188 \nU.S. 526\n, 23 S.Ct. 365.\n For similar reasons the case stands in no different aspect because the people of Puerto Rico is a political entity, recognized as such by the act of Congress under which its government is organized. A state brought into the federal Union by act of Congress is likewise a political entity, and, although not a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the statutes conferring jurisdiction on federal courts, Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 \nU.S. 430\n, 6 S.Ct. 799; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Alabama, \n155 \nU.S. 482\n, 15 S.Ct. 192; see Arkansas v. Kansas & Texas Coal Co., \n183 \nU.S. 185\n, 22 S.Ct. 47, a suit brought by it presenting a federal question is within the jurisdiction of the district courts, New Orleans, M. & T. Railroad Co. v.

But, a suit does not arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States merely because a state is the plaintiff, though the state derives its authority to maintain the suit from the Federal Constitution and laws.

Whether or not these cases are distinguishable from others on the ground, usually urged in their support, that a corporation has no powers and can incur no obligations except as authorized by federal law, Osborn v. Bank of United States, supra, 9 Wheat. 823; see Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, supra, 13, their doctrine has not been extended to other classes of cases and has been restricted by successive statutes (Act of July 12, 1882, c. 290,  4, 22 Stat. 162, 163, 28 USCA  41(16); Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22,  5, 38 Stat. 803, 804; Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  12, 43 Stat. 936, 941, 28 USCA  42), the last of which limits it to cases of government owned corporations alone.

IRVING TRUST CO.(1933)\nNo. 304\nArgued: January 13, 1933Decided: February 13, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert P. Beyer, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. S. John Block, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Experimenter Publishing Company was adjudged bankrupt March 6, 1929. The Irving Trust Company be- \n\n[288 U.S. 329, 330]\n\u00a0\n came trustee. Upon its petition the referee, July 1, 1929, directed that 'proof of any and all claims which the State of New York may have against the estate of the above named bankrupt,' shall be filed within sixty days after service of this order; otherwise, they shall be forever barred. Proper service was had July 18, 1929\n\n\n October 20, 1929, the State filed notice of a possible demand for additional franchise taxes for 1917 to 1928 and stated that definite claim therefor would be presented when necessary reports, etc., could be obtained. No further proof has followed.\n March 30, 1931, the trustee asked and obtained a referee order striking from his files the notice of October 20th. He held that the claim for taxes 'cannot be filed after the expiration of the bar order date' and declared, 'The State has only itself to blame for the situation it finds itself in as the record indicates that facts were within its knowledge upon which it could have filed this claim prior to September 16, 1929.' The District Court approved this action and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its judgment, 'but without prejudice to an application by the people of the state of New York presenting an actual claim which can be audited and showing lawful reasons why it should be paid, at which time the trustee may contest the right to payment.' In re Experimenter Pub. Co., Inc., 58 F.(2d) 980, 981.\n The only question properly presented by the application for certiorari is whether the District Court had power to grant the motion to expunge. Petitioners claim that such power is incompatible with State sovereignty as defined in Marshall v. New York, \n254 \nU.S. 380\n, 41 S.Ct. 143.\n Nothing adjudged below conflicts with any thing said in Marshall v. New York. There we recognized the prior right of the State to be paid license taxes, unsecured by specific lien, from the assets of an insolvent estate. Here, no such question is presented. \n\n[288 U.S. 329, 331]\n\u00a0\n The bar order against the State, as finally modified, may be revoked upon proper showing until termination of the cause-it remains within control of the court. See United States v. Elliott (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 843. And if the District Court has power to make any such order against a State, this one seems appropriate to the circumstances.\n An ill-digested brief for the State beclouds its present position. But we consider only the point relied upon in the petition for certiorari, and that is without merit.\n The Federal Constitution clothes the Congress with power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies.\n The extant Bankruptcy Act-section 2 (11 USCA  11)-declares the United States District Courts shall be courts of bankruptcy and undertakes to give them jurisdiction to adjudge persons bankrupt; to allow or disallow claims; to take charge of the property of bankrupts; to cause their estates to be collected, reduced to money, and distributed; to determine controversies in relation thereto; to close estates when fully administered; and make such general orders as may be necessary for enforcement of the Act. Section 64 (11 USCA  104) requires payment of taxes due to the United States, state, county, district, or municipality in advance of dividends to creditors. Section 57n provides that claims shall not be proved after six months subsequent to adjudication. Act May 27, 1926, c. 406,  13, 44 Stat. 666 (11 USCA  93(n).\n It is admitted here, that as the United States and the States are not mentioned in the limitation of section 57, they are not bound thereby. The consequent necessity for bar orders is apparent. Otherwise, estates could not be promptly closed. Lewis v. United States, \n92 U.S. 618\n; United States v.

Bray, \n225 \nU.S. 205, 217\n, 32 S.Ct. 620, 625: 'We think it is a necessary conclusion from these and other provisions of the act that the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts in all 'proceedings in bankruptcy' is intended to be exclusive of all other courts, and that such proceedings include, among others, all matters of administration, such as the allowance, rejection, and reconsideration of claims, the reduction of the estates to money, and its distribution, the determination of the preferences and priorities to be accorded to claims presented for allowance and payment in regular course, and the supervision and control of the trustees and others who are employed to assist them. ... A distinct purpose of the bankruptcy act is to subject the administration of the estates of bankrupts to the control of tribunals clothed with authority and charged with the duty of proceeding to final settlement and distribution in a summary way, as are the courts of bankruptcy.'\n William Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597, 601\n, 602 S., 38 S.Ct. 211, 213, receivership in a court of equity which had possession of the corporate assets: 'When a statutory system is administered the only question for the Courts is what the statutes prescribe.

(then) in order to make a distribu- \n\n[288 U.S. 329, 333]\n\u00a0\n tion possible they must of necessity limit the time for the proof of claims.'\n Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, \n284 \nU.S. 225, 227\n, 52 S.Ct. 115, 116: 'No good reason is suggested why liens for state taxes should be deemed to have been excluded from the scope of this general power to sell free from incumbrances. Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  104) grants to the court express authority to determine 'the amount or legality' of any tax. ... Realization upon the lien created by the state law must yield to the requirements of bankruptcy administration.'\n The Federal government possesses supreme power in respect of bankruptcies. International Shoe Company v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 49 S.Ct. 108. If a state desires to participate in the assets of a bankrupt, she must submit to appropriate requirements by the controlling power; otherwise, orderly and expeditious proceedings would be impossible and a fundamental purpose of the Bankruptcy Act would be frustrated.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK v. MACLAY(1933)\nNo. 374\nArgued: Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles A. Schneider and Robert P. Beyer, both of New York City, for the People of the State of New York. \n\n[288 U.S. 290, 291]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D.Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy is one between the United States and a state as to priority of payment out of the assets of an insolvent corporation.\n Receivers of the corporation were appointed by a consent decree in January, 1927, and creditors were directed to file their claims. The decree had the effect of a general assignment. Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492, 502\n, 46 S.Ct. 180. The United States filed with the receivers a claim for additional taxes in the sum of $33,663.97 due from the insolvent for the years 1917 and 1918, and also a claim for $516. 46 expenses incurred in the replacement of a buoy run into by the insolvent's tug. The state of New York filed a claim for franchise taxes due for the years 1921 to 1925, but not assessed or liquidated till after the receivership. It filed another claim afterwards for taxes due for later years. The District Court held that under section 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S. Code,  191 (31 USCA  191)), the debt owing to the United States had a preference over the debt owing to the state in the distribution of the fund. Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the second circuit, the decree was affirmed. 59 F.(2d) 979. The case is here on certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 590\n, 53 S.Ct. 96, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The decision of this court in County of Spokane, Washington, v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 80\n, 49 S.Ct. 321, upheld the power of Congress to give priority to debts due to the people of the United States, though the debts thereby subordinated were due to the people of a state, or its political subdivisions. To \n\n[288 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n that decision we adhere. The hardship to the state, if there is any, 'is the necessary consequence of the supremacy of the laws of the United States on all subjects to which the legislative power of congress extends.' Marshall, C.J., in United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 397. Cf. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S.Ct. 265.\n The tax held to have been subordinated in the Spokane county suit was not a perfected lien upon the property of the insolvent at the date of the receivership. \n279 \nU.S. 80, 93\n, 94 S., 49 S.Ct. 321. The question was reserved whether a different conclusion would have been necessary if such a lien had been proved. \n279 \nU.S. 95\n, 49 S.Ct. 321. Certiorari was granted in this case because of the claim of the petitioner that by the statutes of New York franchise taxes become liens in advance for the years in which they are due, though the amount is not fixed, and must be liquidated thereafter.\n Liens in a sense they unquestionably are, but, we think, not so perfected or specific as to change the rule of distribution. The receivers were appointed, as we have seen, in January, 1927; and the petitioner, if not preferred at the time of the appointment, did not win itself a preference by anything done thereafter. United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 260\n, 43 S.Ct. 295. By the statutes of New York, 'each such tax or fee (including the annual franchise tax to be paid by corporations) shall be a lien and binding upon the real and personal property of the corporation ... liable to pay the same until the same is paid in full.' N.Y. Tax Law (Consol. Laws, c. 60),  197. The lien thus created is effective for many purposes, though its amount is undetermined. It is notice to mortgagees or purchasers, who are held to loan or purchase at their own risk if they take their mortgages or deeds before the tax has been assessed or paid. Carey v. Minor C. Keith, Inc., 250 N.Y. 216, 164 N. E. 912; Engelhardt v. Alvino Realty Co., Inc., 248 N.Y. 374, 162 N.E. 287. In that respect it is similar to the lien of a transfer tax or \n\n[288 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n duty upon the estate of a decedent. Midurban Realty Co. v. F. Dee & L. Realty Corporation, 247 N.Y. 307, 160 N.E. 380; Stock v. Mann, 255 N.Y. 100, 104, 174 N.E. 76. It will even be superior, at all events after assessment (N.Y. Terminal Co. v. Gaus, 204 N.Y. 512, 514, 98 N.E. 11), to mortgages already made, and will thus prevail against a purchaser who buys at a foreclosure sale (N.Y. Terminal Co. v. Gaus, supra). Cf. Marshall v. N.Y., \n254 \nU.S. 380, 384\n, 41 S.Ct. 143. All this is settled in New York by reiterated judgments.\n The problem here is different. To hold that a lien has progressed to such a point as to be a warning to mortgagees and purchasers of a contingent liability, like a notice of lis pendens, is far from holding that, while the liability is unliquidated and unknown, the lien thus created is perfect and specific. By the terms of the hypothesis it is nothing of the kind. If the state were to stand upon the warning and omit to ascertain the debt, it would never be able to sell anything, for it would not know how much to sell. Against mortgagees and purchasers a lien perfected afterwards may take effect by relation as of the date of the inchoate lien through which mortgagees and purchasers became chargeable with notice. The doctrine of relation will not divest the United States of the preference that accrued when receivers were appointed.\n In what has been written there has been an assumption in favor of the petitioner that the tax would have priority if its amount had been liquidated before rights and interests became static through insolvency proceedings. The assumption is hardly to be reconciled with a judgment of this court pronounced a century and more ago. Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396, 426. The ruling there was that the general lien of a judgment upon the lands of an insolvent debtor is subordinate to the preference established by the statute, unless seizure by a marshal or some other equivalent act has made the lien specific and brought \n\n[288 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n about a change of title or possession. Later cases have drawn a distinction between the liens of judgments and of mortgages. These last have been thought to have the effect of a conveyance, divesting the debtor of his title and leaving nothing but an equity to which a preference can attach. Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 386; Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 Pet. 596, 611, 612; Savings & Loan Society v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421, 428\n, 18 S.Ct. 392. We do not now determine whether the holding in the mortgage cases is to be applied in jurisdictions where a mortgage upon real estate is a lien and nothing more (Trimm v. Marsh, 54 N.Y. 599, 13 Am.Rep. 623), nor whether, if so applied, it imports a modification of the holding in the Thelusson Case as to the lien of a judgment. Cf. United States v. Canal Bank, 3 Story 79, 81, Fed. Cas. No. 14,715; United States v. Duncan, 4 McLean 607, 630, 12 Ill. 523, Fed. Cas. No. 15003. A mortgage, even though a lien is one much more specific than a judgment or a tax, much closer to ownership. Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., supra, page 443 of 1 Pet.; In re Boyd, 4 Sawy. 262, 264, Fed. Cas. No. 1,746. Into these refinements and their consequences, there is no need to enter now. Enough for present purposes that the statutory preference must prevail against the lien of a tax not presently enforceable, but serving merely as a caveat of a more perfect lien to come.\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETROLEUM EXPLORATION v.

The Commissioner refused to allow the deductions and assessed a corresponding deficiency against the taxpayer. On appeal the Board of Tax Appeals held that the deductions should have been allowed. 23 B.T.A. 890. On petition for review the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the order of the Board. 61 F.(2d) 273. The court held that the deductions claimed were included in the depletion allowance fixed by section 234(a)(8) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 USCA  986(a)(8), at 27 1\/2 per cent. of petitioner's gross income for the years in question, and could not be allowed as depreciation of improvements.

COM'R OF INT. REV.(1933)\nNo. 182\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 462, 463]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert L. Hopkins and Jay C. Halls, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Atty. Gen., and Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Florida corporation, made and sold ice at St. Petersburg. Substantially the same stockholders owned the Citizens' Ice & Cold Storage Company, engaged in like business at the same place. In February, 1926, Lewis, general manager of both companies, began negotiations for the sale of their properties to the National Public Service Corporation. Their directors and stockholders were anxious to sell, distribute the assets, and dissolve the corporations. The prospective vendee desired to acquire the properties of both companies, but not of one without the other.\n In October, 1926, agreement was reached and the vendor's directors again approved the plan for distribution and dissolution. In November, 1926, petitioner and the National Corporation entered into a formal written contract conditioned upon a like one by the Citizens' Company. This referred to petitioner as 'vendor' and the National Corporation as 'purchaser.' The former agreed to sell, \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 464]\n\u00a0\n the latter to purchase the physical property, plants, etc., 'together with the goodwill of the business, free and clear of all defects, liens, encumbrances, taxes and assessments for the sum of $1,400,000, payable as hereinafter provided.' The specified date and place for consummation were 11 a.m., December 15, 1926, and 165 Broadway, New York City, when 'the vendor shall deliver to the purchaser instruments of conveyance and transfer by general warranty in form satisfactory to the purchaser of the property set forth. ... The purchaser shall pay to the vendor the sum of $ 400,000.00 in cash.' The balance of the purchase price ($1,000,000) shall be paid $500,000 on or before January 31, 1927; $250,000 on or before March 1, 1927; $250,000 on or before April 1, 1927. Also, the deferred installments of the purchase price shall be evidenced by the purchaser's 6 per cent. notes, secured either by notes or bonds of the Florida West Coast Ice Company, thereafter to be organized to take title, or other satisfactory collateral; or by 6 per cent. notes of such Florida company secured by first lien on the property conveyed, or other satisfactory collateral.\n The vendor agreed to procure undertakings by E. T. Lewis and Leon D. Lewis not to engage in manufacturing or selling ice in Pinellas county, Fla., for ten years.\n The $400,000 cash payment was necessary for discharge of debts, liens, incumbrances, etc. The Florida Company, incorporated December 6, 1926, took title to the property and executed the purchase notes secured as agreed. These were paid at or before maturity except the one for $100,000, held until November, 1927, because of flaw in a title. As the notes were paid petitioner immediately distributed the proceeds to its stockholders according to the plan.\n The property conveyed to the Florida Company included all of petitioner's assets except a few vacant lots worth not more than $10,000, some accounts-$3,000 face value-also, a small amount of cash. Assets, not exceed- \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 465]\n\u00a0\n ing 1 per cent. of the whole, were transferred to the Citizens' Holding Corporation as trustee for petitioner's stockholders-99 per cent. of all vendor's property went to the Florida Company. The plan of the whole arrangement as carried out was accepted by petitioner's officers and stockholders prior to November 4, 1926\n\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the petitioner derived taxable gain exceeding $500,000 and assessed it accordingly under the Revenue Act of 1926. The Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals approved this action.\n The facts are not in controversy. The gain is admitted; but it is said this was definitely exempted from taxation by section 203, Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  934).\n The Act approved February 26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 11, 12 ( sections 202, 203 (26 USCA  933, 934)):\n'Sec. 202.

(and) (d) ...\n\n'(e) If an exchange would be within the provisions of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then-\n\n'(1) If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but\n\n'(2) If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed. ...\n\n'(h) As used in this section and sections 201 and 204-\n\n'(1) The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation ( including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation), or (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to an- \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 467]\n\u00a0\n other corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred, or (C) a recapitalization, or (D) a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.\n\n'(2) The term 'a party to a reorganization' includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the case of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation.'\n\n All of section 203(a) and (b) of the act (26 USCA  934(a, b), is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Counsel for the petitioner maintain-\n The record discloses a 'reorganization' to which petitioner was party and a preliminary plan strictly pursued. \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 468]\n\u00a0\n The Florida West Coast Ice Company acquired substantially all of petitioner's property in exchange for cash and securities which were promptly distributed to the latter's stockholders. Consequently, under section 203, the admitted gain was not taxable.\n The Board of Tax Appeals held that the transaction in question amounted to a sale of petitioner's property for money and not an exchange for securities within the true meaning of the statute. It, accordingly and as we think properly, upheld the Commissioner's action.\n The 'vendor' agreed 'to sell,' and 'the purchaser' agreed 'to purchase,' certain described property for a definite sum of money. Part of this sum was paid in cash; for the balance the purchaser executed three promissory notes, secured by the deposit of mortgage bonds, payable, with interest, in about forty-five, seventy-five, and one hundred and five days, respectively. These notes-mere evidence of obligation to pay the purchase price-were not securities within the intendment of the \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 469]\n\u00a0\n act and were properly regarded as the equivalent of cash. It would require clear language to lead us to conclude that Congress intended to grant exemption to one who sells property and for the purchase price accepts well secured, short-term notes (all payable within four months), when another who makes a like sale and receives cash certainly would be taxed. We can discover no good basis in reason for the contrary view and its acceptance would make evasion of taxation very easy. In substance the petitioner sold for the equivalent of cash; the gain must be recognized.\n The court below held that the facts disclosed failed to show a 'reorganization' within the statutory definition. And, in the circumstances, we approve that conclusion. But the construction which the court seems to have placed upon clause A, paragraph (h)(1), section 203 ( 26 USCA  934(h)(1), cls. (A, B), we think is too narrow. It conflicts with established practice of the tax officers and, if passed without comment, may produce perplexity.\n The court said: 'It must be assumed that in adopting paragraph (h) Congress intended to use the words 'merger' and 'consolidation' in their ordinary and accepted meanings. Giving the matter in parenthesis the most liberal construction, it is only when there is an acquisition of substantially all the property of another corporation in connection with a merger or consolidation that a reorganization takes place. Clause (B) of the paragraph removes any doubt as to the intention of Congress on this point.'\n The paragraph in question directs: 'The term 'reorganization' means ( A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation).' The words within the parenthesis may \n\n[287 U.S. 462, 470]\n\u00a0\n not be disregarded. They expand the meaning of 'merger' or 'consolidation' so as to include some things which partake of the nature of a merger or consolidation but are beyond the ordinary and commonly accepted meaning of those words-so as to embrace circumstances difficult to delimit but which in strictness cannot be designated as either merger or consolidation. But the mere purchase for money of the assets of one company by another is beyond the evident purpose of the provision, and has no real semblance to a merger or consolidation. Certainly, we think that to be within the exemption the seller must acquire an interest in the affairs of the purchasing company more definite than that incident to ownership of its short-term purchase-money notes. This general view is adopted and well sustained in Cortland Specialty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 937, 939, 940. It harmonizes with the underlying purpose of the provisions in respect of exemptions and gives some effect to all the words employed.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 203.

JOSEPH M. BOYD CO.(1933)\nNo. 171\nArgued: December 13, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin. \n\n[287 U.S. 518, 519]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. G. Mathys and R. M. Rieser, both of Madison, Wis., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank Ross, of Madison, Wis., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 128 of the Wisconsin Statutes, 1929 (section 128.01 et seq.), regulates and controls voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors and also contains provisions relating to the discharge of insolvent debtors. By this appeal we are called on to decide whether, as construed below, the provisions of that chapter which relate to voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors, and especially a clause contained in section 128.06, conflict with the National Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA). The clause declares: 'No creditor shall, in any case where a debtor has made or attempted to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or in case of the insolvency of any debtor, by attachment, garnishment or otherwise, obtain priority over other creditors upon such assignment being \n\n[287 U.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n for any reason adjudged void, or in consequence of any sale, lien or security being adjudged void.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 518, 523]\n\u00a0\n The Boyd Company, a Wisconsin corporation, March 23, 1931, made a voluntary assignment of all its property to assignees for the benefit of its creditors. They immediately took possession, and the circuit court of Dane county on the same day assumed jurisdiction declaring in its order that it did so pursuant to chapter 128. Appellant, a nonassenting creditor, brought suit against the assignor and prayed judgment for more than $2,500. September 1, 1931, she instituted garnishment proceedings against the assignees, asserting that the assignment was void because of failure to comply with chapter 128 in several particulars, and because that chapter was repugnant to the Bankruptcy Act. Thereafter the assignor amended the assignment to authorize the judge of the circuit court, in case of resignation of the assignees, to appoint a trustee. The assignees resigned, and the court appointed appellee Samp as sole trustee. He answered the garnishment and admitted that he had the property conveyed by the assignment, but denied that he had possession or control of any property in which the assignor had an interest. Appellant, having recovered judgment against the assignor for $2,645, moved for judgment against the garnishees. The court found that the assignees had received property belonging to the assignor in excess of appellant's judgment, and had transferred the same to the trustee, and ordered that it be applied to satisfy the judgment. The Supreme Court reversed and directed that the garnishee action be dismissed. 242 N.W. 725.\n In view of the construction theretofore put upon chapter 128 by the state Supreme Court, it is evident that the assignment did not have the effect of instituting proceedings contemplating discharge of assignor from its debts.\n In Voluntary Assignment of Tarnowski (1926) 191 Wis. 279, 210 N.W. 836, 49 A.L.R. 686, the Supreme Court declared that, as to all matters comprehended within the Bank- \n\n[287 U.S. 518, 524]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy Act, the state insolvency laws had been by it completely superseded, and said (page 283 of 191 Wis., 210 N.W. 836, 837): 'The statutes of this state relating to the subject of bankruptcy are suspended during the existence of the federal Bankruptcy Act, and ... such statutes afford the courts of this state no power or authority to discharge debtors from their debts.' In Hazelwood v. Olinger Building Department Stores (1931) 205 Wis. 85, 236 N.W. 591, 592, the court pointed out that the Wisconsin statute under consideration is essentially different from the Arkansas statute before us in International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261\n, 49 S. Ct. 108, and, speaking through Chief Justice Rosenberry, said: 'In the matter of Voluntary Assignment of Tarnowski ... it was held that the right to make a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors is a personal right inherent in the ownership of property, and existed at common law independent of the statute; that, while the discharge of a bankrupt from his debts constitutes the very essence of the Bankruptcy Law, the discharge of a debtor is no part of an assignment law, that part of the chapter relating to discharge is entirely superseded by the federal act, and has, under present conditions, no efficacy; and, further, that a creditor filing his claim and accepting his pro rata share of the proceeds under a voluntary assignment does not waive his right to object to the debtor's discharge. As a condition of filing a claim under the Arkansas statute, the creditor was required to agree that payment of a pro rata share of the assets of the insolvent's estate should discharge his claim. It is hardly necessary to point out the wide difference between the statute of Arkansas and that of Wisconsin as construed by this court.' In the case at bar the court again declared that the provisions in chapter 128 that apply to such voluntary assignments are severable from those that relate to the discharge of insolvent debtors. It reiterated that the federal \n\n[287 U.S. 518, 525]\n\u00a0\n act superseded the latter. And it held that, as there was an attempt to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the quoted clause of section 128.06 prevented garnishment, even though the assignees had failed to follow some of the procedural details prescribed by chapter 128.\n There is slight need to refer more specifically to the differences between this case and International Shoe Company v. Pinkus, supra. There the proceedings in the chancery court were under the state insolvency law ( Crawford & Moses' Dig.,  5885-5893) and not under the law governing voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors. Id.,  486-493. Upon the entry of the shoe company's judgment against him, Pinkus sought discharge from his debts under the insolvency law, and to that end procured the entry of a decree under which his creditors were prohibited from having any payment out of his property except upon stipulation for his full release. As shown by our decision in that case, the Arkansas insolvency law not only related to the subject of bankruptcies, but actually dealt with essential features of that subject which are covered by the act now in force. It not only governed discharge of the bankrupt debtor, but imposed conditions which trammeled and made against equal distribution of his property.\n In the case now before us the Wisconsin statutory provisions relating to discharge of insolvent debtors were not invoked. There is nothing in the assignment, the application to the circuit court to take jurisdiction, or its order thereon, to suggest that the discharge of the assignor was contemplated. The provisions regulating the administration of trusts created by voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors apply whether the assignor is solvent or insolvent. They do not prevent creditors from bringing action against the debtor or require those seeking to participate in the distribution of the estate to stipu- \n\n[287 U.S. 518, 526]\n\u00a0\n late for his discharge. And, quite in harmony with the purposes of the federal act, the provisions of chapter 128 that are regulatory of such voluntary assignments serve to protect creditors against each other, and go to assure equality of distribution unaffected by any requirement or condition in respect of discharge.\n A proceeding under the Arkansas law derives its force solely from legislation that involves a judicial winding up of an insolvent estate and the discharge of the debtor. Such a law is within the field of the federal act. Indeed, the declaration, 'Proceedings commenced under State insolvency laws before the passage of this Act shall not be affected by it' (30 Stat. 566 (11 USCA  110 note)) suggests that Congress intended to supersede these local enactments. See In re Sievers (D.C.) 91 F. 366. Star v. Johnson (Tex. Civ. App.) 44 S.W. (2d) 429. On the other hand the Wisconsin law merely governs the administration of trusts created by deeds like that in question which do not differ substantially from those arising under common-law assignments for the benefit of creditors. The substantive rights under such assignments depend upon contract; the legislation merely governs the execution of the trusts on which the property is conveyed. And as proceedings under any such assignment may be terminated upon petition of creditors filed within the time and in the manner prescribed by the federal act (George M. West Company v. Lea, \n174 \nU.S. 590\n, 19 S.Ct. 836), it is apparent that Congress intended that such voluntary assignments, unless so put aside, should be regarded as not inconsistent with the purposes of the federal act. Mayer v. Hellman, \n91 U.S. 496\n, 501; Boese v. King, \n108 U.S. 379\n, 385-387, 2 S.Ct. 765; Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 615\n, 38 S.Ct. 215; Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318, 327\n, 51 S.Ct. 465. It follows that the above-quoted provision of section 128.06 is valid and effective to prevent garnishment of funds in the hands of the trustee.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 128.06 follows.\n'All voluntary assignments or transfers whatever ... for the benefit of or in trust for creditors shall be void as against the creditors of the person making the same unless the assignee shall be a resident of this state and shall, before taking possession of the property assigned and before taking upon himself any trust conferred upon him by the instrument of assignment, deliver to the county judge or court commissioner of the county in which such assignor or some one of the assignors at the time of the execution of such assignment shall reside ... a bond ... in a sum not less than the present value of the assets of such assignor, ... with two or more sufficient sureties; ... and the bond shall be conditioned that such assignee shall faithfully discharge the several trusts reposed in him by such assignment and diligently and faithfully collect and reduce to money the property assigned to him and account for and pay over to the several parties, then being creditors of the assignor, all moneys that shall come into his hands from the effects of such assignor after deducting the necessary expenses of performing the several trusts mentioned in the assignment, as settled and allowed by the circuit court, and abide the order of said court. But no assignment shall be void because of any defect, informality or mistake therein or in the bond, inventory or list of creditors accompanying the same; and the court or judge may direct the amendment of the assignment or of any other such paper to effect the intention of the assignor or assignee, and any such amendment shall relate back to the time of the execution of the paper to which it is made. No mistake in filing a copy instead of an original or any like mistake or inadvertent failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall avoid the assignment. No creditor shall, in any case where a debtor has made or attempted to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or in case of the insolvency of any debtor, by attachment, garnishment or otherwise, obtain priority over other creditors upon such assignment being for any reason adjudged void, or in consequence of any sale, lien or security being adjudged void; but in all such cases the property of such insolvent debtor shall be administered for the ratable benefit of all his creditors under the direction of the court by the assignee or by any receiver of said property and estate appointed as hereinafter provided.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTER v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1933)\nNo. 466\nArgued: February 9, 1933Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 436, 437]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter E. Hope, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General andMr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 436, 439]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether, for the purpose of determining the tax liability of the estate of the deceased, section 302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1926,1 requires that there shall be included in the value of the gross estate certain bonds that he had transferred in trust.\n October 18, 1918, and again on February 1, 1919, decedent transferred to the Bankers' Trust Company certain bonds for the benefit of his daughter and her son. Contemporaneously he made similar transfers of bonds to the same trustee for the benefit of his son and his son's daughter. November 27, 1926, in order to make provision for two children of his daughter born after the creation of these trusts, he sent the trust company letters purporting to revoke the trusts of which she was a beneficiary, to terminate the interest of all persons therein, and to direct it to deliver the principal and income to itself as trustee according to a new deed then delivered. Each of the five trust agreements included provisions governing the management, investment, and disposition of principal and income, and contained a paragraph reserving to the donor power at any time to alter or modify the indenture and any or all of the trusts in any manner, but expressly excepting any change in favor of himself or his estate. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 436, 440]\n\u00a0\n Deceased died November 30, 1926. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included in the gross estate the value of the property described in the last deed and petitioners sought redetermination. The Board of Tax Appeals, because of the reserved power to alter and amend, held section 302(d) applied, and included the corpus of all the trusts in the gross estate. 23 B.T.A. 1016. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. 60 F.(2d) 673. Its decision being in conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Brady v. Ham, 45 F.(2d) 454, and that of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Cover v. Burnet, 60 App.D.C. 303, 53 F.(2d) 915, we granted a writ of certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 591\n, 53 S.Ct. 121, 77 L.Ed. --.\n By the trust agreements, decedent divested himself of all interest in the bonds and, subject only to the reserved power, transferred full title to the trustee and beneficiaries. The reservation is broad; evidently he intended to be free at any time and from time to time to alter or modify the disposition of the property as he might see fit, subject to the restriction above mentioned. The power \n\n[288 U.S. 436, 441]\n\u00a0\n did not amount to an estate or interest in the property. It was much like, and for the purposes of this case may be deemed the substantial equivalent of, a general power of appointment by will. Cf. United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257, 263\n, 41 S.Ct. 256, 18 A.L.R. 1461; Patterson v. Lawrence, 83 Ga. 703, 707, 10 S.E. 355, 7 L.R.A. 143; Clapp v. Ingraham, 126 Mass. 200.\n The act, section 301(a), 26 USCA  1092, imposes a tax 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent.' The net estate as there used does not mean an amount to be ascertained as such under any general rule of law or under statutes governing the administration of estates, but is the gross estate as specifically defined in section 302 (26 USCA  1094) less deductions permitted by section 303 (26 USCA  1095). The former section declares that 'the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.'\n\n\n (b)\n To the extent of any interest therein of the surviving spouse as or in lieu of dower or curtesy. (c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer by trust or otherwise in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in, possession or enjoyment at or after his death.\n\n\n (d)\n 'To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or revoke. ...'\n\n\n (e)\n To the extent of the interest therein held by decedent as a joint tenant or as a tenant by the entirety. (f) To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will or by deed in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. (g) \n\n[288 U.S. 436, 442]\n\u00a0\n To the extent of the amount of life insurance receivable as specified. Subdivision (h) requires the interests defined in (b) to (g), inclusive, to be included whether transfer was made before or after the passage of the act.\n Petitioners contend that the only thing taxed is the transfer of the net estate at death, and that property in which the decedent then held no interest or power of enjoyment must be excluded. They rely on Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397. But that case is not in point. It involved seven trusts created by the decedent. Two were held taxable because subject to a power of revocation in him alone. In each of the others he reserved power to alter, change, or modify, to be exercised in four by joint action of himself and a single beneficiary and in the remaining one by himself and a majority of the beneficiaries acting jointly. As the title was put beyond his control, we held these transfers not taxable. And petitioners assume, as held in White v. Erskine (C.C.A.) 47 F. (2d) 1014, 1016, that (a) is a limitation upon (d), and argue that the gross estate includes property only to the extent of the 'interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death' and that, as before his death he had divested himself of all title, the property so transferred is not to be included in the gross estate. But the construction thus taken for granted cannot be sustained. Subdivision (a) does not in any way refer to or purport to modify (d) and, in view of the familiar rule that tax laws are to be construed liberally in favor of taxpayers, it cannot be said that, if it stood alone, (a) would extend to the transfers brought into the gross estate by (d). United States v. Field, supra, 264 of 255 U.S., 41 S.Ct. 256, 18 A.L.R. 1461. Moreover, Congress has progressively expanded the bases for such taxation. Comparison of section 302 with corresponding provisions of earlier acts warrants the conclusion that (d) is not a mere specification of something covered by (a), but that it covers something not included therein. Cf. Chase National Bank v. \n\n[288 U.S. 436, 443]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758; Gwinn v. Commissioner, \n287 \nU.S. 224\n, 53 S.Ct. 157; Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369.\n The net estate upon the transfer of which the tax is imposed is not limited to property that passes from decedent at death. Subdivision (d) requires to be included in the calculation all property previously transferred by decedent, the enjoyment of which remains at the time of his death subject to any change by the exertion of a power by himself alone or in conjunction with another. Petitioner argues that, as decedent was without power to revoke the transfers or to alter or modify the trusts in favor of himself or his estate, the property is not covered by subdivision ( d). But the disjunctive use of the words 'alter,' 'modify,' and 'amend' negatives that contention. We find nothing in the context or in the policy evidenced by this and prior estate tax laws or in the legislative history of subdivision (d) to suggest that conjunctive use of these words was intended, or that 'alter' and 'modify' were used as equivalents of 'revoke,' or are to be understood in other than their usual meanings. We need not consider whether every change, however slight or trivial, would be within the meaning of the clause. Here the donor retained until his death power enough to enable him to make a complete revision of all that he had done in respect of the creation of the trusts even to the extent of taking the property from the trustees and beneficiaries named and transferring it absolutely or in trust for the benefit of others. So far as concerns the tax here involved, there is no differences in principle between a transfer subject to such changes and one that is revocable. The transfers under consideration are undoubtedly covered by subdivision (d).\n Petitioners contend that so construed section 302(d) is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. They insist, and we assume, that the measures \n\n[288 U.S. 436, 444]\n\u00a0\n taken by means of decedent's letter to the trustee and the new deed of November 27, 1926, operated merely to alter and modify, but did not supersede the earlier trusts made for the benefit of his daughter and her son. They maintain that inclusion of the transfers in question would be to measure decedent's tax by property belonging to others, a thing condemned in Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 358, and Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S.Ct. 120, and would be to tax gifts inter vivos that were fully consummated prior to the enactment of subdivision (d), and therefore would be confiscatory under Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 52 A.L.R. 1081, and Heiner v. Donnan, supra.\n They treat as without significance the power the donor reserved unto himself alone and ground all their arguments upon the fact that deceased, prior to such enactment, completely divested himself of title without power of revocation. It is true that the power reserved was not absolute as in the transfer considered in Burnet v. Guggenheim, supra, in which this court, in the absence of any provision corresponding to subdivision ( d), held that the donor's termination of the power amounted to a transfer by gift within the meaning of section 319 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 313 (26 USCA  1131 note). But the reservation here may not be ignored for, while subject to the specified limitation, it made the settlor dominant in respect of other dispositions of both corpus and income. His death terminated that control, ended the possibility of any change by him, and was, in respect of title to the property in question, the source of valuable assurance passing from the dead to the living. That is the event on which Congress based the inclusion of property so transferred in the gross estate as a step in the calculation to ascertain the amount of what in section 301 (26 USCA  1092, 1093) is called the net estate. Thus was reached what it reasonably might deem a substitute for testamentary disposition. United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 116\n, 51 S.Ct. 446.

GREAT NORTHERN UTILITIES CO.(1933)\nNo. 627\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of Montana.\n Mr. Francis A. Silver, of Helena, Mont., for appellants.\n Messrs. E. G. Toomey and M. S. Gunn, both of Helena, Mont., for appellee. \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 131]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this appeal we are called on to decide whether an order of the commission prescribing specific, as distinguished from maximum, rates to be charged for natural gas furnished by a public utility is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 132]\n\u00a0\n The appellee, authorized by a nonexclusive franchise ordinance, has been engaged since 1923 in furnishing natural gas to consumers in Shelby, a Montana city having a population of about 2,000. It has an adequate distribution system. September 21, 1927, the commission instituted an inquiry as to the reasonableness of its rates. The schedule then in force specified for each customer a base rate of 60 cents per thousand cubic feet for the first five thousand and, by steps, lower rates based on monthly consumption. \n1\n Appellee filed a schedule effective November 25, 1927, reducing the base rate to 50 cents. The commission approved tentatively and continued investigation.\n The Citizens Gas Company, similarly authorized, installed a distribution system and, in October, 1928, commenced furnishing natural gas to consumers in Shelby. Its schedule, specifying a base rate of 35 cents, was approved by the commission. Within a brief period many of appellee's customers left it and have since obtained their gas from the other company. In November appellee filed and, though the commission did not approve, put in force a schedule specifying a base rate of 20 cents. The commission ordered it to submit evidence as to the reasonableness of such rates. Appellee did not support them as adequate or compensatory, but insisted that under competitive conditions then existing they were justified. And it declared that should the Citizens Company meet them it would propose a further reduction.\n The commission January 22, 1929, found the 20-cent schedule too low to yield enough to cover reasonable operating expenses including depreciation; that such rates would tend to imperil or impair appellee's ability dependably to serve, held such schedule contrary to the public \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 133]\n\u00a0\n interest, condemned the 50-cent schedule as unreasonable and prescribed a base rate of 35 cents, being precisely the same as that filed by the Citizens Company and approved by the commission. Appellee refused to charge the rates so ordered and sued to enjoin the enforcement of the order upon the ground that the commission was not empowered by statute to prescribe specific rates and that the order violated the state Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court gave appellee judgment on the pleadings. July 29, 1930, the Supreme Court sustained the order, reversed the judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings. 88 Mont. 180, 232, 293 P. 294.\n The Citizens Company had filed, January, 1930, and without the commission's approval put in force a schedule naming as a base rate 23 cents but subject to a reduction of 3 cents for prompt payment. The record shows that, notwithstanding appellee's reduction to the base rate of 20 cents and a further reduction September 1, 1931, to a flat rate of 15 cents, its sales of gas decreased from 129 million cubic feet in 1927 to 106 million in 1928, to 73 in 1929, to 67 in 1930, to 58 in 1931. The sales of the Citizens Company have correspondingly increased. During the first seven months of 1932, the latest period for which the figures are given, appellee sold less than 40 million cubic feet and the Citizens Company sold over 67 million.\n December 22, 1930, appellee brought this suit and dismissed the one in the state court. The district court granted a temporary injunction against the enforcement of the order on the ground that, as the utility necessarily lowered its rates for self-preservation, the order prescribing higher rates was unreasonable and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a concurring opinion one of the judges construed the complaint to charge confiscation, and maintained that the \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 134]\n\u00a0\n order shows that the commission deliberately disregarded the rule entitling public utilities to a fair return and that this, without further evidence, was sufficient ground for temporary injunction. 52 F.(2d) 802, 805. The commission appealed from the interlocutory decree and this court affirmed. \n285 \nU.S. 524\n, 52 S.Ct. 313. Upon the final hearing, on evidence taken before an examiner, the district court found that the community is insufficient to support, at rates affording fair return, the competing systems; that the prescribed rates deprive appellee of its right of competition and would fail to produce legitimate operating expenses, taxes, depreciation, and a fair return upon the value of appellee's property. As its conclusions of law, the court declared the order invalid and that the interlocutory injunction should be made permanent, 1 F.Supp. 328. It so decreed.\n The rights conferred upon appellee by the authorizing ordinance are subject not only to the proper exertion of power of the state to regulate its services and rates but also to authority of the city to grant to others the privilege similarly to serve. The city was free to admit other purveyors of gas. Madera Water Works v. Madera, \n228 \nU.S. 454\n, 33 S.Ct. 571; Piedmont Power Co. v. Graham, \n253 \nU.S. 193\n, 40 S.Ct. 453; Springfield Gas Co. v. Springfield, \n257 \nU.S. 66, 70\n, 42 S.Ct. 24. The appellee does not complain that the rates imposed upon it by the order differ from those which have been established and are binding on its competitor. The gravamen of its complaint is that the enforcement of the order will deprive it of the 'right of competition in rates essential to protection and preservation of its property and business' and of the 'right to charge rates concededly less than reasonable rates.' The demand for gas in the community served is not sufficient to require both systems and there is no suggestion that it is likely to become great enough to justify the expenditures made for them. The \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 135]\n\u00a0\n facts disclosed by the record compel the conclusion that, if competition shall continue in the future as in the past, appellee will not be able upon any rates within constitutional protection against reduction to earn a reasonable return upon the value of its property employed in the public service. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment safeguards against the taking of private property, or the compelling of its use, for the service of the public without just compensation. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 410\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 546\n, 18 S.Ct. 418; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 41\n, 29 S.Ct. 192, 48 L.R.

Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 31\n, 46 S.Ct. 363. But it does not assure to public utilities the right under all circumstances to have a return upon the value of the property so used. The loss of, or the failure to obtain, patronage due to competition does not justify the imposition of charges that are exorbitant and unjust to the public. The clause of the Constitution here invoked does not protect public utilities against such business hazards. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, page 412 of 154 U.S., 14 S.Ct. 1047; Covington, etc., Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 596\n, 17 S.Ct. 198; Smyth v.

Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 448 S., 48 S.Ct. 174.\n But appellee, having undertaken to serve under conditions permitting competition, now insists that it has a constitutional right by unrestrained cutting of rates to destroy the competitor. And for that purpose it has made reductions from the 60-cent schedule in force until shortly before the Citizens Company entered the field to the flat rate of 15 cents which yields less than the necessary cost of the service. The commission found that the \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 136]\n\u00a0\n rates specified in the 20-cent schedule are too low, unreasonable, liable to impair the service, and contrary to the public interest. The decision of the state Supreme Court is to the same effect. 88 Mont. 180, 218, 293 P. 294. The facts disclosed by the record are not sufficient to show that the exertion by the commission of its power to prescribe specific rates was arbitrary or an infringement of any constitutional right of the appellee. See Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 U.S. 251\n, 273 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 181; United States v. Illinois Central R.R., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 525\n, 44 S. Ct. 189; Town of Mapleton v. Iowa P.S.

App.) 55 S.W.(2d) 195, 200.\n The appellee contends that the rates prescribed by the order are so unreasonably low as to deprive it of just compensation. The appellants maintain that no such question is presented by the record. The complaint was grounded upon the claim, not that the rates were too low but, that the order prevented appellee from charging lower ones. It prayed judgment that it be allowed to charge less than the rates prescribed in the order. After the evidence was taken appellee proposed an amendment. It merely alleged that the rates prescribed 'are not sufficient to furnish plaintiff a fair or any return on the value of its gas plant or system and such rates, if made effective, would confiscate and deprive this plaintiff of its property' without due process of law. Appellee here admitted that its purpose in asserting the belated claim that the rates specified in the order are too low was not that it might collect more for its services but that it might continue, once the order was set aside, to serve at a loss and so if possible force the other company out of the field. It is a well- established rule that an allegation merely asserting in general language that rates are con- \n\n[289 U.S. 130, 137]\n\u00a0\n fiscatory is not sufficient and that, in order to invoke constitutional protection, the facts relied on must be specifically set forth and from them it must clearly appear that the rates would necessarily deny to plaintiff just compensation and deprive it of its property without due process of law. AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, supra, page 447 of 275 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 174. This allegation is not sufficient.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] All schules referred to in the opinion similarly specify step rates and are conveniently identified by the highest or base rate. \n\n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUBLIC SERVICE COM'N OF WISCONSIN v. WISCONSIN TELEPHONE CO.(1933)\nNo. 517\nArgued: March 15, 1933Decided: March 27, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Wisconsin. \n\n[289 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alvin C. Reis, of Madison, Wis., for appellants.\n Messrs. Edwin S. Mack and Arthur W. Fairchild, both of Milwaukee, Wis ., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court, composed of three judges, granting an interlocutory injunction which restrained the enforcement of an order of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin reducing telephone rates. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n In July, 1931, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin instituted a statewide investigation of the rates, rules, services, and practices of the Wisconsin Telephone Company. While hearings in this investigation were in progress, and on June 30, 1932, the commission issued an 'interlocutory' order reducing the rates for 'exchange' service, that is, rates for local service within a single exchange, by 12 1\/2 per cent. The commission found that the existing rates were unjust and unreasonable and that the reduced rates would be just and reasonable to be applied for a temporary period. The rates were to be effective for one year from July 31, 1932, the commission retaining jurisdiction to modify its order at any time for cause shown. The commission rendered an elaborate opinion (154 printed pages) setting forth the 'reasons and facts' underlying its findings. \n\n[289 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n On July 28, 1932, the company brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of the prescribed rates and two days later the District Judge made a temporary restraining order. Application for an interlocutory injunction was heard by three judges on September 21, 1932. The hearing was upon the pleadings and voluminous affidavits making a record of several hundred pages. On the same day, after argument, the court announced its decision granting the injunction upon the giving of a bond for $1,000,000 and meanwhile continuing the temporary restraining order. The decree for injunction was entered on October 18, 1932, and contained a general statement that the rates prescribed by the commission's order 'would result in the confiscation of the property' of the complainant, would deprive it of its property 'without compensation and without due process of law,' and that there would be irreparable injury if an interlocutory injunction were not issued.\n No opinion was rendered by the District Court and, apart from the general statement above mentioned, the court made no findings. Not only did the court fail to set forth the facts pertinent to a conclusion that an interlocutory injunction should issue, but the court declared that the prescribed rates were confiscatory without any findings warranting such a conclusion. Appellee moves to affairm the decree. Appellants, resisting the motion, contend that the District Court abused its discretion and that the decree should be reversed, or at least should be set aside and the cause remanded for findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of a statement of the grounds of decision, both as to facts and law, as an aid to litigants and to this court. While it is always desirable that an appellate court should be adequately advised of the basis of the determination of the \n\n[289 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n court below, we have pointed out that it is particularly important that this basis should appear when the decree enjoins the enforcement of a state law or the action of state officials under that law. Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S.Ct. 222; Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co., \n274 \nU.S. 588, 596\n, 47 S.Ct. 720, 71 L., ed. 1219; City of Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164, 171\n, 172 S., 48 S.Ct. 66; Railroad Commission v. Maxcy, \n281 \nU.S. 82, 83\n, 50 S.Ct. 228. 'For then the respect due to the state demands that the need for nullifying the action of its Legislature or of its executive officials be persuasively shown.' These reasons exist, and are not the less imperative, when the injunction is interlocutory. Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Co., supra. It was to insure careful and deliberate action upon such interlocutory applications that the Congress has required that they should be heard before three judges. That requirement applies only when an interlocutory injunction is sought. Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, \n282 \nU.S. 10, 15\n, 51 S.Ct. 8.\n It is true, as the appellee contends, that the terms of Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723), relating to decisions of suits in equity, apply to decisions upon final hearing and do not embrace decisions upon interlocutory applications. But the duty of the court in dealing with interlocutory applications, to which this court had previously directed attention, was not altered by the adoption of that rule. While an application for an interlocutory injunction does not involve a final determination of the merits, it does involve the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. That discretion can be exercised only upon a determination, in the light of the issues and of the facts presented, whether the complainant has made, or has failed to make, such a showing of the gravity of his complaint as to warrant interlocutory relief. Thus, if the issue is confiscation, the complainant must make a factual showing of the probable confiscatory effect of the statute or order with such clarity and per- \n\n[289 U.S. 67, 71]\n\u00a0\n suasiveness as to demonstrate the propriety in the interest of justice, and in order to prevent irreparable injury, of restraining the state's action until hearing upon the merits can be had. Phoenix Railway Company v. Geary, \n239 \nU.S. 277, 281\n, 36 S.Ct. 45; Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159, 207\n, 49 S.Ct. 282; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n279 \nU.S. 813, 815\n, 49 S.Ct. 256. The result of the court's inquiry into the issues and into the facts presented upon the interlocutory application, in order to satisfy itself as to the gravity of complainant's case and the probable consequences of unrestrained enforcement of the statute or order, should be set forth by the court in a statement of the facts and law constituting the grounds of its decision. While that decision is not on the merits and does not require the findings of fact and conclusions of law which would be appropriate upon final hearing, the court should make the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are appropriate to the interlocutory proceeding.\n That duty the court below failed to perform in the instant case and we are not called upon, unaided by opinion or findings, to search this voluminous record to find a basis for the court's decree. The decree is accordingly vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court, as specially constituted, for findings and conclusions appropriate to a decision upon the application for an interlocutory injunction, the temporary restraining order to remain in force pending that determination.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUERCIA v.

After testimony by agents of the government in support of the indictment, defendant testified, making a general denial of all charges. His testimony is not set forth in the record. Defendant's motion for a direction of verdict and requests for rulings substantially to the same effect were denied. The court instructed the jury concerning the rules as to presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, and stated generally that its expression of opinion on the evidence was not binding on the jury and that it was their duty to disregard the court's opinion as to the facts if the jury did not agree with it. The court ruled as matter of law that if the jury believed the evidence for the government, it might find the defendant guilty. The court then charged the jury as follows:\n'And now I am going to tell you what I think of the defendant's testimony. You may have noticed, Mr. Foreman and gentlemen, that he wiped his hands during his testimony. It is rather a curious thing, but that is almost always an indication of lying. Why it should be so we don't know, but that is the fact. I think that every single word that man said, except when he agreed with the Government's testimony, was a lie. \n\n[289 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n 'Now, that opinion is an opinion of evidence and is not binding on you, and if you don't agree with it, it is your duty to find him not guilty.'\n\n To this charge the defendant excepted.\n In a trial by jury in a federal court, the judge is not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the rial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law. Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., \n283 \nU.S. 91, 95\n, 51 S.Ct. 383. In charging the jury, the trial judge is not limited to instructions of an abstract sort. It is within his province, whenever he thinks it necessary, to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence, by drawing their attention to the parts of it which he thinks important, and he may express his opinion upon the facts, provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination.

Sir Matthew Hale thus described the function of the trial judge at common law: 'Herein he is able, in matters of law emerging upon the evidence, to direct them; and also, in matters of fact to give them a great light and assistance by his weighing the evidence before them, and observing where the question and knot of the business lies, and by showing them his opinion even in matter of fact; which is a great advantage and light to laymen.' Hale, History of the Common Law, 291, 292. Under the Federal Constitution the essential prerogatives of the trial judge as they were secured by the rules of the common law are maintained in the federal courts. Vicksburg & Meridian R.R. Co. v. Putnam, supra; St. Louis, I.M. & S. Rwy. Co. v. Vickers, \n122 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 7 S.Ct. 1216; Slocum v.

Southern Pacific Co., supra; Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Co., \n283 \nU.S. 494, 498\n, 51 S.Ct. 513\n\n\n This privilege of the judge to comment on the facts has its inherent limitations. His discretion is not arbitrary and uncontrolled, but judicial, to be exercised in conformity with the standards governing the judicial office. In commenting upon testimony he may not assume the role of a witness. He may analyze and dissect the evidence, but he may not either distort it or add to it. His privilege of comment in order to give appropriate assistance to the jury is too important to be left without safeguards against abuses. The influence of the trial judge on the jury 'is necessarily and properly of great weight' and 'his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.' This court has accordingly emphasized the duty of the trial judge to use great care that an expression of opinion upon the evidence 'should be so given as not to mislead, and especially that it should not be one-sided'; that 'deductions and theories not warranted by the evidence should be studiously avoided.' Starr v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 614, 626\n, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923; Hickory v. United States, \n160 U.S. 408\n, 421-423, 16 S.Ct. 327, 332. He may not charge the jury 'upon a supposed or conjectural state of facts, of which no evidence has been offered.' United States v. Breitling, 20 How. 252, 254, 255. It is important that hostile comment of the judge should not render vain the privilege of the accused to testify in his own behalf. Hicks v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 442, 452\n, 14 S.Ct. 144; Allison v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 203, 207\n, 209 S., 210, 16 S.Ct. 252, 255. Thus, a statement in a charge to the jury that 'no one who was conscious of innocence would resort to concealment,' was regarded as tantamount to saying 'that all men who did so were necessarily guilty,' and as magnifying and distorting 'the proving power of the facts on the subject of the concealment.' Hickory v. United States, supra. \n\n[289 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n And the further charge that the proposition that 'the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the innocent are as bold as a lion,' was 'a self-evident proposition' which the jury could 'take ... as an axiom, and apply it' to the case in hand, was virtually an instruction that flight was conclusive proof of guilt. Such a charge 'put every deduction which could be drawn against the accused from the proof of concealment and flight, and omitted or obscured the converse aspect'; it 'deprived the jury of the light requisite to safely use these facts as means to the ascertainment of truth.' Id. So where the trial judge, in referring to the defendant's story of self-defense, said, 'All men would say that. No man created would say otherwise when confronted by such circumstances,' this court held that the comment practically deprived the defendant of the benefit of his testimony. 'It was for the jury to test the credibility of the defendant as a witness, giving his testimony such weight under all the circumstances as they thought it entitled to, as in the instance of other witnesses, uninfluenced by instructions which might operate to strip him of the competency accorded by the law.' Allison v. United States, supra. Similarly, where no testimony had been offered as to the previous character of the accused, it was prejudicial error for the trial court to comment unfavorably upon his general character. Mullen v. United States (C. C.A.) 106 F. 892, 895, per Day, C.J. See, also, Parker v. United States (C. C.A.) 2 F. (2d) 710, 711; O'Shaughnessy v. United States (C.C.A.) 17 F.(2d) 225, 228; Cook v. United States (C.C.A.) 18 F.(2d) 50; Malaga v. United States (C.C.A.) 57 F. (2d) 822.\n In the instant case, the trial judge did not analyze the evidence; he added to it, and he based his instruction upon his own addition. Dealing with a mere mannerism of the accused in giving his testimony, the judge put his own experience, with all the weight that could be attached to it, in the scale against the accused. He told the jury \n\n[289 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n that 'wiping' one's hands while testifying was 'almost always an indication of lying.' Why it should be so, he was unable to say, but it was 'the fact.' He did not review the evidence to assist the jury in reaching the truth, but in a sweeping denunciation repudiated as a lie all that the accused had said in his own behalf which conflicted with the statements of the government's witnesses. This was error and we cannot doubt that it was highly prejudicial.\n Nor do we think that the error was cured by the statement of the trial judge that his opinion of the evidence was not binding on the jury and that if they did not agree with it they should find the defendant not guilty. His definite and concrete assertion of fact, which he had made with all the persuasiveness of judicial utterance, as to the basis of his opinion, was not withdrawn. His characterization of the manner and testimony of the accused was of a sort most likely to remain firmly lodged in the memory of the jury and to excite a prejudice which would preclude a fair and dispassionate consideration of the evidence.

SMITH(1933)\nNo. 601\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 172, 173]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Albert L. Hopkins, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1922 Doublas Smith, by five instruments, created as many trusts for the benefit of his wife and four children. The trustees named were the grantor, a son who was a direct beneficiary of one of the trusts and a contingent beneficiary of the others, and a banking company possessed of trust powers. Neither the grantor nor the corporate trustee was a cestui que trust under any of the writings. In each agreement it was stipulated:\n'Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, this Trust may be modified or revoked at any time by an instrument in writing signed by Douglas Smith (the grantor) and either one of the other two trustees or their successors.'\n\n October 22, 1924, each of the agreements was modified by striking out the quoted clause, and the grantor resigned as trustee. He did not report any of the income which accrued in the year 1924 upon the trust property. The Revenue Act of 1924,  219(g), 43 Stat. 253, 275, 277 (26 USCA  960 note), directs:\n'Where the grantor of a trust has, at any time during the taxable year, either alone or in conjunction with any person not a beneficiary of the trust, the power to revest in himself title to any part of the corpus of the trust, then the income of such part of the trust for such taxable year shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' \n\n[289 U.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that this section required a return by Smith of the trust income for the period January 1, 1924, to October 22, 1924, and assessed against him additional tax, which was paid under protest. The respondents, who are the personal representatives of Smith, now deceased, brought this suit to recover the sum paid. A demurrer to the declaration was overruled, and judgment given for the respondents. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, as to trusts created prior to the adoption of the act, section 219(g) violates the Fifth Amendment when applied to impose a tax by reason of property and the income therefrom disposed of by the grantor before the passage of that or any other law taxing the income of such a trust to the settlor. 61 F.(2d) 324. The case is here on certiorari, \n288 \nU.S. 596\n, 53 S.Ct. 397, 77 L.Ed . --.\n\n Petitioner maintains the section in terms applies in the circumstances disclosed; as the tax is laid only upon income accruing after January 1, 1924, the statute is not retroactive; and, as the grantor retained a measure of control, to tax him upon the income is not arbitrary or unreasonable though the trusts were created before any statute had laid a tax upon the settlor measured by the income of such a trust.\n The respondents argue in support of the judgment that the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust as the phrase is used in the section and the income in question is therefore exempt from taxation to the settlor, and that, if this view be rejected, the provision offends the Fifth Amendment.\n The unambiguous phraseology of the act precludes the suggested construction. A trustee is not subsumed under the designation 'beneficiary.' Both words have a common and accepted meaning-the former signifies the person who holds title to the res and administers it for the benefit of others; the latter the cestui que trust who enjoys the \n\n[289 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n advantages of such administration. The ordinary meaning of the terms used, which we are bound to adopt (Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 52 S.Ct. 211), and the view held by those charged with enforcement of the act, ratified by re-enactment of the section,1 alike forbid the adoption of the construction for which the respondents contend.\n Nor do we think the act has such a retroactive effect as to render its requirements arbitrary within the principle announced as to estate and gift taxes in Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 52 A.L.R. 1081, Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S.Ct. 353, and Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S.Ct. 105. In those cases the issue was the validity of a tax on a transaction consummated before the enactment of the statute authorizing the exaction. In the present case the subject of the tax is not the creation of the trusts or the transfer of the corpus from the grantor to the trustees, but the income of the trusts which accrued after January 1, 1924, the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1924. 2 Although the act was passed June 2, 1924, the imposition of the act on income received or accrued from the beginning of the year has been held unobjectionable. Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409, 411\n, 50 S.Ct. 164. Compare Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 379\n, 51 S.Ct. 144.\n We come then to the final position of the respondents: That when applied in this case the statute is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deny the due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, since the exaction is based, not on the settlor's income or on income from his property, but on that which accrued to other persons from property to which they alone had sole and exclusive title. The \n\n[289 U.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n argument proceeds upon the theory that until alteration or revocation of the trust the trustees held the legal title to the property for the sole benefit of the cestuis, and received the income; that both principal an d income were beyond the control of the grantor until the alternation of the trust on October 22, 1924\n\n\n We have not heretofore had occasion to pass upon the question thus presented. In Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n, 50 S.Ct. 336, the section of the Revenue Act of 1924 now under consideration was held to justify assessment of income tax to the settlor with respect to the income of a trust revocable by him alone. Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397, construed section 402( c) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 278), which included within the sweep of a transfer tax any interest of which a decedent had at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he had created a trust intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. The tax was upheld as applied to the corpus of trusts over which the grantor had sole power of revocation. It was, however, condemned as to those where revocation was dependent upon joint action of the grantor and the beneficiary, for the reason that the interest of the beneficiary was adverse and the grantor unable at will to alter or destroy the trust. In the latter case the transfer was said to be effective when made, not at death. As pointed out in Burnet v. Guggenheim (October Term, 1932) \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, the same considerations as to ownership and control affect the power to impose a tax on the transfer of the corpus and upon the income.\n In approaching the decision of the question before us, it is to be borne in mind that the trustee is not a trustee of the power of revocation and owes no duty to the beneficiary to resist alteration or revocation of the trust. Of course he owes a duty to the beneficiary to protect the trust res, faithfully to administer it, and to distribute the \n\n[289 U.S. 172, 177]\n\u00a0\n income; but the very fact that he participates in the right of alteration or revocation negatives any fiduciary duty to the beneficiary to refrain from exercising the power. The facts of this case illustrate the point; for it appears the trust in favor of the grantor's wife was substantially modified, to her financial detriment, by the concurrent action of the grantor and the trustees. This case must be viewed, therefore, as if the reversed right of revocation had been vested jointly in the grantor and a stranger to the trust.\n Decisions of this court declare that, where taxing acts are challenged, we look not to the refinements of title but to the actual command over the property taxed-the actual benefit for which the tax is paid. Corliss v. Bowers, supra, 281 U.S. at page 378, L.Ed. 991, 69 A.L.R. 758; Burnet v. Gug-50 S.Ct. 336; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 74 genheim, supra. A settlor who at every moment retains the power to repossess the corpus and enjoy the income has such a measure of control as justifies the imposition of the tax upon him. Corliss v. Bowers, supra. We think Congress may with reason declare that, where one has placed his property in trust subject to a right of revocation in himself and another, not a beneficiary, he shall be deemed to be in control of the property. We cannot say that this enactment is so arbitrary and capricious as to amount to a deprivation of property without due process of law. As declared by the committee reporting the section in question, a revocable trust amounts, in its practical aspects, to no more than an assignment of income. This court has repeatedly said that such an assignment, where the assignor continued to own the corpus, does not immunize him from taxation upon the income. Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345; Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241. It cannot therefore be successfully urged that, as the legal title was held by the trustees, the income necessarily must for income taxation be \n\n[289 U.S. 172, 178]\n\u00a0\n deemed to accrue from property of some one other than Douglas Smith. The case is plainly distinguishable from Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S.Ct. 120, on which respondents rely, for there the attempt was to tax income arising from property always owned by one other than the taxpayer, who had never had title to or control over either the property or the income from it. The measure of control of corpus and income retained by the grantor was sufficient to justify the attribution of the income of the trust to him. The enactment does not violate the Fifth Amendment.\n A contrary decision would make evasion of the tax a simple matter. There being no legally significant distinction between the trustee and a stranger to the trust as joint holder with the grantor of a power to revoke, if the contention of the respondents were accepted it would be easy to select a friend or relative as coholder of such a power and so place large amounts of principal and income accruing therefrom beyond the reach of taxation upon the grantor while he retained to all intents and purposes control of both. Congress had power, in order to make the system of income taxation complete and consistent and to prevent facile evasion of the law, to make provision by section 219(g) for taxation of trust income to the grantor in the circumstances here disclosed. Compare Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470, 482\n, 483 S., 49 S.Ct. 199, 64 A.L.R. 362; Tyler v.

RICHLAND IRR. DIST.(1933)\nNo. 516\nArgued: February 16, 1933Decided: March 27, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. \n\n[289 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.R. J. Venables and Charles H. Farrell, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. O. B. Thorgrimson, of Seattle, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Richland Irrigation District is a corporation organized under the laws of Washington; and appellant owns forty acres of agricultural land within its limits. In 1920 at an election duly held a majority of the votes cast (appellant objecting) authorized the directors to issue and sell $538,000 of its interest-bearing bonds. This was done and the proceeds were devoted to improvements for irrigation purposes as contemplated. Interest on the bonds was made payable semiannually; the principal in annual installments commencing July 1, 1931\n\n\n For ten years the directors assessed against separate tracts of land lying within the district, in proportion to estimated benefits received by each from the improvements, such sums as were necessary to pay accruing obligations. Prior to 1931 the appellant paid a total of $1,168.65 on account of assessments against his land. In \n\n[289 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n January of that year the directors threatened to make a further assessment of $757.53 to meet deficiencies resulting from failure of others to pay assessments against their lands.\n It is now asserted that appellant's land was benefited no more than $ 350 by the improvements ($10 for each irrigable acre); that he has already paid far more than that sum, with interest; and that to require further contributions to discharge the obligation represented by the bonds would deprive him of property without due process of law and thus violate the 14th Amendment. By bill, filed January 12, 1931, in the superior court of Benton county, he sought an injunction forbidding the threatened action. The trial court sustained a demurrer. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment; and in support of its action said:\n'An irrigation district is a public corporation having some of the powers of a municipal corporation. The bond obligation is a general corporate obligation. The landowner is not entitled to a segregation of his share of the obligation at the time it is created, or at a later time. There is no provision in the Irrigation Act for a segregation at any time. The obligation is a general one, and all lands within the district are subject to taxation for the payment of the entire obligation. State ex re. Clancy v. Columbia Irrigation District, 121 Wash. 79, 208 P. 27; State ex rel. Wells v. Hartung, 150 Wash. 590, 274 P. 181, 185.\n\n'In 1919 there was a due adjudication of the organization of the district determining the lands to be included within the district, the amount of bonds to be issued, and the interest to be paid thereon. It must be conclusively presumed, from that adjudication, as we said in State ex rel. Wells v. Hartung, supra, 'that the total benefits to the lands comprised in the district were then finally ad- \n\n[289 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n judicated. Each tract of land within the district then became generally liable for the payment of the bonds and interest.' ... Under the statute ( section 7434, Rem. Comp. Stat.), all lands within the district became and will remain subject to specific assessment, in proportion to benefits, until the obligation is paid. The statute provides that irrigation district bonds and interest thereon shall be paid by revenue derived from an annual assessment upon the real property of the district 'and all the real property in the district shall be and remain liable to be assessed for such payments until fully paid as hereinafter provided.' ...'\n\n Counsel for appellant admit that the directors rightly assessed appellant's land so long as the total did not substantially exceed actual benefits received. They concede liability because of delinquencies within the limit of benefits; but they assert that the threatened assessment would create a substantially larger charge and therefore is not permissible. The sole question now presented, they submit, is this: To what extent has the irrigation district the right to assess in order to provide for payment of delinquencies?\n The Supreme Court of the state has declared that under her laws (see Rem. Rev. Stat. Wash.  7434) the obligation of the bonds is a general one; that 'all lands within the district became and will remain subject to specific assessment, in proportion to benefits, until the obligation is paid.' And thus the only question for our consideration-the federal one-is whether the state had power to create such a corporation as that court has declared the irrigation district to be and to authorize the questioned assessment.\n The power of a state to create local improvement districts with authority to lay taxes according to value, acreage, front foot, or benefits is definitely recognized by this court. Also that the action of such a district in apportioning the burden of taxation cannot be assailed under \n\n[289 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n the 14th Amendment unless palpably arbitrary and a plain abuse. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 176\n, 17 S.Ct. 56; Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist., \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 36 S.Ct. 58; Miller & Lux, Inc., v. Sacramento & San Joaquin Drainage Dist., \n256 \nU.S. 129\n, 41 S.Ct. 404; Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester County, \n261 \nU.S. 155\n, 43 S.Ct. 261.\n If to meet a general obligation an irrigation district, proceeding under authority granted by the state, should lay a tax distributed according to value, there hardly could be reasonable doubt of its validity under the 14th Amendment. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, supra; French v. Barber Asphalt Pav. Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324\n, 21 S.Ct. 625; Webster v. Fargo, \n181 \nU.S. 394\n, 21 S.Ct. 623. And in the present case we are unable to say that because the assessment was distributed in proportion to estimated benefits that an exaction exceeding such benefits would amount to spoliation and represent a plain abuse of power. A general tax distributed in proportion to benefits received is not indicative of arbitrary action.\n The principle applied in Norwood v. Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269\n, 19 S.Ct. 187, and similar cases, has no application here. Appellant's land will be assessed to meet a general obligation of the corporation and the mere fact that the apportioned burden will exceed estimated benefits gives no color to the claim of confiscation. As pointed out in the cases cited, lands may be taxed to pay for local improvements although they receive no actual benefits. Never, as the Supreme Court of the state has said, was appellant entitled to the segregation of his share of the corporate obligation. The statute did not contemplate that assessments against any tract should be limited to payment of its increased value. A general obligation was created and every tract subjected thereto.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROCCO v. LEHIGH VALLEY R. CO.(1933)\nNo. 359\nArgued: January 18, 1933Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Abraham W. Feinberg, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Clayton R. Lusk, of Cortland, N.Y., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harold E. Simpson, of Ithaca, N.Y., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner's husband, while riding a track inspection tricycle, was killed in a headon collision with an electrically operated passenger train on a single track branch of the respondent's railroad connecting Ithaca and Auburn, New York. The line, which skirted the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, was subject to washouts in stormy weather. Primarily to protect four daily passenger trains, the decedent, Rocco, an experienced employee, was assigned to inspect a section extending from Ithaca to a point about 7 1\/2 miles north of that city. His schedule required him to leave Ithaca 6:30 a.m., preceding the morning north-bound train, and to return in advance of the south-bound train, which arrived at Ithaca at noon; to go out again at 3:30 p.m., about an hour and a half before the afternoon train left Ithaca, and to return ahead of the train from Auburn, which was due at Ithaca at 8:30 p.m.\n On December 8, 1927, there was a high west wind blowing across Lake Cayuga, which had driven the waters over the track at various points and been the clause of washouts and delays. The south-bound train due at Ithaca at 12:23 p.m. was over three hours late. At 3:30 in the afternoon Rocco left to cover his inspection beat, and was struck by the train about a mile from Ithaca, on a blind \n\n[288 U.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n curve, where he could not see the approaching train nor the motorman see him.\n A rule with which Rocco was familiar forbade trackwalkers to occupy the main track without first ascertaining from the operator the whereabouts of approaching trains in both directions. Rocco's practice had been to comply with this rule. On one or more occasions when he failed to do so he had been reprimanded for the omission. He must have known on the day of the accident that heavy washouts had occurred and that the train which should have arrived at 12:23 was somewhere on the line. It reached Ludlowville, eight miles north of Ithaca, the last reporting station prior to reaching Ithaca, at 3:14 p.m. This fact Rocco could have ascertained if, in compliance with the rule, he had inquired of the operator.\n Suit was brought in the Supreme Court of New York, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), by Rocco's executrix, who averred that his death resulted from negligent failure to operate the train at proper speed, omission to warn him of its approach by whistle or bell, and breach of the duty to provide him with a safe place to work. The defenses were that decedent assumed the risk and that his negligence barred a recovery. Upon the trial a verdict of $12,096 was rendered, which the jury reduced 40 per cent. on account of Rocco's contributory negligence. 135 Misc. 639, 239 N.Y.S. 157. The Appellate Division affirmed judgment for the petitioner. 231 App.Div. 323, 248 N.Y.S. 15. The Court of Appeals ordered that the complaint be dismissed. 259 N.Y. 51, 181 N.E. 11. The case is here on certiorari from the judgment of dismissal entered by the trial court pursuant to mandate.\n The questions presented are whether under the circumstances the respondent owed the decedent any duty to warn him of the approach of the train, or to keep a lookout for him; and whether Rocco's disobedience of the rule \n\n[288 U.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n was in such sense the primary cause of his death as to render immaterial any neglect on the part of the motorman. The Court of Appeals decided both questions against the petitioner.\n Respondent relies on the duty of a person employed on the tracks of a railroad to exercise vigilance for his own safety, and to keep out of the way of moving trains, and asserts that the chance of a collision was a risk assumed by an employee assigned to work on the roadbed. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, \n145 \nU.S. 418\n, 12 S.Ct. 835; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Nixon, \n271 \nU.S. 218\n, 46 S.Ct. 495. Those cases applied the principle to accidents on a stretch of track where the workman's view was unobscured. Here, according to the proof, the curve on which the collision occurred, and obstructions at the side of the roadway, prevented any but a very short view of the track ahead. We think these facts required that the jury should determine whether the motorman exercised reasonable care to have his train under control, to sound a warning before entering the curve, and to be on the lookout for workmen whose presence might be expected on the day in question, when the waters of the lake were washing over the tracks at this point and inspection and repair might be required. Under the authorities cited, the decedent assumed the risks ordinarily incident to his employment as a track inspector, but in the circumstances shown we do not think they included a failure on the part of the motorman to keep a lookout and to give warning in places where the view of one who might be expected to be on the track or approaching in the opposite direction was shut off and the probability of accident was therefore much greater than where the track is straight and the view unobstructed. The issues of negligence of the motorman and contributory negligence of the decedent were for the jury.\n The Court of Appeals held, as matter of law, that Rocco's negligence was the primary cause of the accident, and therefore the petitioner could not maintain the action. \n\n[288 U.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n This ruling was made in reliance upon the authorities of which Davis v. Kennedy, \n266 \nU.S. 147\n, 45 S.Ct. 33; Unadilla Valley Ry. Co. v. Caldine, \n278 \nU.S. 139\n, 49 S.Ct. 91; and Southern Ry. Co. v. Youngblood, \n286 \nU.S. 313\n, 52 S.Ct. 518, are typical. These were cases where a member of a train crew was killed as a result of disregarding orders to wait at a given point until a train moving in the opposite direction had passed. In each of them the decedent's negligence was the proximate and efficient cause of the accident; in each it was sought to show that the facility was in part due to alleged negligence of some other employee in omitting to give the decedent an order which would have reminded him of the orders previously given and by which he was bound. In none was there any negligence on the part of employees operating the train moving in the opposite direction, with which the collision took place.\n These decisions are not controlling in the present case, there is no suggestion that the rule upon which the respondent relies forbade Rocco to start on his inspection trip if he ascertained that the approaching train was within seven or eight miles of Ithaca. It was his duty to make his afternoon trip. The rule required no more than that before leaving he should acquaint himself with the whereabouts of trains on the branch and guide himself accordingly. If he had made inquiry, whether he should await the arrival of the train, or attempt to meet it at some point a short distance from that city, was a matter for his decision. If the rule had forbidden him to leave under circumstances such as inquiry by him would have disclosed, this case would be parallel with those cited. His disregard of the rule was none the less an element in the case. Whether he was guilty of negligence was to be determined in the light of all facts he knew, or ought in the exercise of reasonable care to have known. How he would have conducted himself, and what precautions he would have taken had he ascertained the exact whereabouts of the train, is a matter of speculation. The jury \n\n[288 U.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n adjudged him guilty of contributory negligence, and moulded its verdict accordingly. But it was open to the jury, as above shown, to find that the motorman of the train was also guilty of negligence which contributed to the collision. Rocco's infraction of the rule was a concurrent cause, but may not in any proper sense be held the primary cause of the accident. His negligence did not preclude a finding by the jury that his death was in part due to the negligence of the respondent's servants. The act imposes liability upon the carrier for injury or death resulting 'in whole or in part' from the negligence of any of its officers, agents or employees (U.S. C. tit. 45,  51 (45 USCA  51)).\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROGERS v. GUARANTY TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK(1933)\nNo. 227\nArgued: Decided: January 23, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard Reid Rogers and Evan Shelby, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, plaintiff below, owns 200 shares of the common stock of the American Tobacco Company which he acquired prior to the passage of chapter 175, p. 354, New Jersey Laws, 1920 (Comp. St. Supp.  47-183 to 47-187), that is here involved. He also owns 400 shares of common stock B. He brought two suits in the Supreme Court of New York: One against the tobacco company and some of its directors, the other against the trust company, Junius Parker and others. On application of defendants both were removed to the federal court for the southern district of that state. The first was discontinued as to some defendants and the cases were consolidated. The defendants before the court are the two companies, Parker, and five of the seventeen directors of the tobacco company including its president, one of its vice presidents, and its secretary.\n The tobacco company was organized under the laws of New Jersey, and in that state maintains its 'principal \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n and registered office' as designated in its charter, holds the stockholders' meetings, and does a substantial amount of business. It is authorized by the laws of New York to do business there and has in New York City its principal place of business where its directors usually meet, its executives have their offices and most of its records are kept. It carries on business in that and many other states and also in a number of foreign countries.\n The grievances alleged by plaintiff concern the issue, allotment, and sale of stock of the tobacco company. June 25, 1930, the board of directors adopted a resolution recommending the reduction by one-half of the par value and the doubling of the number of shares of its common stock and common stock B. It had outstanding 526,997 shares of preferred stock, and, as a result of action in accordance with that recommendation, 1,609, 696 shares of common and 3,077,320 shares of common B. And by another resolution the board advised approval by the stockholders of a plan for the issue and sale of common stock B to employees pursuant to chapter 175, New Jersey Laws, 1920.1 The plan submitted accords to such em- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n ployees and others actively engaged in the conduct of the business as may be selected an opportunity to purchase stock 'by way of additional compensation for services to be rendered,' and allots for subscription shares of unissued stock. The board may offer stock to such persons in the service at prices not less than par and upon other terms and conditions determined by the president pursuant to authority granted him for that purpose by the board. No employee or person actively engaged in the conduct of the business of the corporation or its subsidiaries shall be deemed ineligible to its benefits by reason of being also a director of the corporation or of any of its subsidiaries or of holding any office therein.\n July 28, 1930, the stockholders adopted the plan. And January 28, 1931, the board authorized a sale of 56,712 shares of common stock B at par value of $25 per share. It directed that there be furnished to the president, to be considered in determining to whom the stock should be allotted for purchase, a list showing the services rendered, and, having regard to the value of the same, the rating on a percentage basis given to each together with the total amount of his compensation for 1930. It recommended that the basis of distribution should be the number of shares having par value equal to one-third of that year's compensation to each allottee rated at 100 per cent. and correspondingly less to those having lower ratings. And there was accorded to each of 535 employees, including directors and others active in the business, the right to subscribe for the new stock on that basis. All \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n the shares allotted were sold at $25 for cash to the trust company. The trust company allowed each allottee to subscribe at the same price. At that time it was worth $112. The agreement stated that this was by way of additional compensation for service to be rendered between January 31 and December 31, 1931; that until the end of the year no allottee could take up his stock; that he was entitled to have dividends applied on the purchase price; and that, if he should terminate his employment before the end of the year, the trustees were to decide whether he should have his allotment.\n The complaint attacked the transaction upon the following grounds: The directors being disqualified by reason of their interest as allottees, the plan was not passed by a valid vote or adopted as required by chapter 175. The subsequent vote of the stockholders, required by the statute to be predicated upon action by the board, was likewise invalid. The plan was ultra vires in that the allotment 'by way of additional compensation for services to be rendered' violated chapter 195, p. 566, New Jersey Laws, 1917 (Comp. St. Supp. N.J.  47-176 et seq.). Under the Company's charter and the statutes of New Jersey-section 124, General Corporation Law as added by section 16 of chapter 318, p. 544, Laws 1926 (Comp. St. Supp. N.J .  47-119i)-every stockholder had the right according to the number of his shares to have pro rata distribution of the stock in question. And the complaint prayed decree that the defendants be enjoined from carrying out the plan; that the stock be declared void and canceled; and that the defendants, other than the tobacco company, be held for costs and damages sustained by that company.\n Four defenses were set up: Plaintiff failed to comply with Equity Rule 27 (28 USCA  723). The stockholders including plaintiff ratified the allotments to the directors. The suit is an attempt to regulate the internal affairs of a corporation foreign to New York, and the United States District Court sitting therein should decline to take jurisdiction. The \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n allotments were fair and reasonable and were made in accordance with the company's by-laws and the statutes of New Jersey. Plaintiff moved for an order striking out the defenses as insufficient and for a decree in accordance with the prayer of the complaint or, in the alternative, for an injunction pendente lite preventing the carrying out of the plan.\n The District Court (60 F.(2d) 106, 108) filed an opinion in which it said:\n'In the present case, the validity of the shares sought to be canceled depends primarily upon the interpretation and effect of the act of 1920. The directors cited this statute as their authority for the plan when they formulated it, and have all along insisted that the plan is in conformity with the statute. The plaintiff takes the position that the statute is not applicable and has been used by the directors merely as a cover for a raid upon the corporate treasury for their own profit. In addition, plaintiff submits that two other statutes, that of 1917 and that of 1926, must be taken as limiting the operation of the 1920 act. It is obvious that the case presents not merely questions of fact, but questions of some complexity under the New Jersey laws. There seem to be no decisions of the New Jersey courts to serve as a guide in the proper construction and possible interrelation of these statutes. The legality of the corporate proceedings which resulted in the issuance of this stock is peculiarly a matter for determination in the first instance by the New Jersey courts. It may be noted that the American Tobacco Company is not a local enterprise. While its chief office is said to be here and it unquestionably carries on business here, its activities are known to be world-wide. It has a New Jersey charter; it refers to the New Jersey office as its principal office; it holds its stockholders' meetings there. It is not a resident corporation in any sense of the word.' \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n And it entered judgment denying the motion and that 'in the exercise of this Court's discretion, each of the bills of complaint herein be and the same are hereby dismissed, without prejudice to the enforcement of the rights of plaintiff, if any, in the courts of New Jersey.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, 60 F.(2d) 114, dealing with plaintiff's contentions before it, held that the plan was authorized; that the stock was lawfully issued under New Jersey statutes; and that, for the reasons given in the opinion, the bill was properly dismissed. A dissenting opinion suggests that the plan was not sufficiently in detail to comply with the New Jersey statute. The court affirmed the judgment appealed form, and, upon its mandate, the District Court entered a decree that the bills of complaint be dismissed with costs.\n Among the points and contentions raised and pressed by plaintiff in his petition for certiorari and argument here are the following: The plan is not definite and formulated as required by chapter 175. That chapter as construed below is repugnant to the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (Const. art. 1,  10). The decision that the plaintiff failed to comply with Equity Rule 27 is contrary to chapter 175. Chapter 195, New Jersey Laws 1917, does not permit the issue of stock to employees for services to be rendered. The decree of the District Court declining to exercise jurisdiction is contrary to decisions of this court and in conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Williamson v. Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co., 56 F.(2d) 503.\n The authorization, allotment, and sale of the shares in question involved the proportionate ownership of stockholders and their rights inter sese. Unquestionably the steps taken and proposed to formulate and carry out the plan constitute the conduct and management of the internal affairs of the tobacco company. The controversy is solely between the plaintiff and other stockholders not \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n participating in the distribution on one side and the purchasers of the new stock, the corporation, its directors, and officers on the other. When, by acquisition of his stock, plaintiff became a member of the corporation he, like every other shareholder, impliedly agreed that, in respect of its internal affairs, the company was to be governed by the laws of the state in which it was organized. His rights, whatever the tribunal chosen for their vindication, are to be determined upon the ascertainment and proper application of New Jersey law.\n It has long been settled doctrine that a court-state or federal- sitting in one state will, as a general rule, decline to interfere with, or control by injunction or otherwise, the management of the injunction or otherwise, corporation organized under the laws of another state but will leave controversies as to such matters to the courts of the state of the domicile.

While the District Court had jurisdiction to adjudge the rights of the parties, it does not follow that it was bound to exert that power. Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Co., \n285 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 52 S.Ct. 413, and authorities cited. It was free in the \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n exercise of a sound discretion to decline to pass upon the merits of the controversy and to relegate plaintiff to an appropriate forum. Langnes v.

Obviously no definite rule of general application can be formulated by which it may be determined under what circumstances a court will assume jurisdiction of stockholders' suits relating to the conduct of internal affairs of foreign corporations. But it safely may be said that jurisdiction will be declined whenever considerations of convenience, efficiency, and justice point to the courts of the state of the domicile as appropriate tribunals for the determination of the particular case. Cohn v. Mishkoff-Costlow Co., 256 N. Y. 102, 105, 175 N.E. 529; Travis v. Knox Terpezone Co., 15 N.Y. 259, 263, 109 N.E. 250, L.R.A. 1916A, 542, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 387; Kimball v. St. Louis, etc., Railway, supra.\n The complaint shows that as of its date seven directors of the tobacco company were not residents of New York. Only six allottees are before the court. The others, over 525, are not mentioned in the complaint. It appears from the answer that many of them are outside New York, and it may be inferred that a large number of them reside in the other States and countries in which the company does business. At the time, February 23, 1932, of the dismissal of the bill the services of the employees, for which the allotments constitute part compensation, had been fully performed and they were entitled to have and presumably they, or at least some of them, had secured the delivery of the shares so allotted to them. As the tobacco company, in addition to its registered office, has property, operates directly or through subsidiary branch factories in New Jersey and carries on business there and in other states and countries, it may not be deemed to have been organized in that state as a mere matter of convenience for the purpose of carrying on all its business in another state \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n or be deemed in New York to be a local concern. This case is wholly unlike Williamson v. Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co., supra, relied on by plaintiff.\n The determination of plaintiff's contentions requires not only the ascertainment of the true meaning and intent of chapter 175 of New Jersey Laws, 1920, but also its constitutional validity. Its provisions have never been construed by the New Jersey courts and they or their like are not familiar in the statute law governing corporations organized in other states. And other New Jersey statutes among which are chapter 195, Laws of 1917, and chapter 318, section 16, Laws of 1926, are claimed by plaintiff to have an important bearing upon this case. But the courts of that state have had no occasion to consider the interrelation, if any, between them and chapter 175 pursuant to which the stock in question purports to have been issued to employees. A mere inspection of the New Jersey statutes directly involved suggests grave doubts as to their proper application to the facts in this case and the difference of opinion expressed below confirms that impression.\n So far as concerns the cancellation of the allotted shares and other relief sought by plaintiff the situs of the stock is in New Jersey and all questions relating to the validity of the plan, authorization, issue, allotment, and sale of the same may be conveniently and effectively determined in New Jersey courts, the authoritative and final interpreters of the statutes of that state. A proceeding in rem is authorized, process thereiin may be served by publication and a decree, final and binding upon all, canceling or sustaining the stock, may readily be enforced.

Co., 69 N.J.Eq. 211, 60 A. 568; Holmes v. Camp, 219 N.Y. 359, 114 N.E. 841. The facts and circumstances disclosed by the record clearly bring this case within the general rule and abundantly justify the exer- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n cise of discretion on the part of the District Court in dismissing the bills of complaint without prejudice. As the Circuit Court of Appeals considered and decided the merits of the case, its judgment is reversed, the judgment of the District Court entered upon its mandate is vacated, and the case will be remanded to the District Court with directions to reinstate the earlier judgment dismissing the bills of complaint without prejudice.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the court should decide this case on its merits in favor of the petitioner.\n Respondent, the American Tobacco Company, organized under the laws of New Jersey, is a large and prosperous corporation, engaged in the manufacture and distribution of cigarettes and other forms of tobacco. It has upwards of 40,000 stockholders. At the commencement of this suit it had a board of sixteen directors, including a president, five vice presidents, a secretary and a treasurer, all actively engaged in its management. For many years these officers have receive large annual fixed salaries, as well as large annual cash profit sharing bonuses paid under a by-law of the company, adopted in 1912. See Rogers v. Hill (C.C.A.) 60 F.( 2d) 109. In the year 1930, the profit sharing bonus of the president, added to his fixed salary of $168,000, gave him a total compensation of over $1,010,000, which was further augmented by a special 'credit' of $273, 470. In the same year, four of the five vice presidents received an aggregate annual salary and bonus of more than $2,077,000. In addition, a number of stock subscription plans have from time to time been put into operation by the directors, without authority of the charter of by-laws of the corporation, or the knowledge or ap- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n proval of its stockholders, by which they largely benefited. In that of 1926, the respondent Hill, the president and also a director of the company, acquired 8,000 shares of common stock, and other directors, who are respondents here, received substantial amounts. In that of 1929, one year before the transactions now complained of, 46,500 of 51,750 shares of common stock, purchased by the corporation and set aside for the purpose, were sold to the corporate directors at $47 per share less than market value. Convenient arrangements were made for postponed payment of the purchase price. Respondents received 23,050 shares, of which the president received 15,050.\n On January 28, 1931, a new allotment of stock was made, which is the subject of this litigation. On that day, the Board of Directors (the president and officers constituting a majority of those in attendance) considered and passed upon the adequacy of the compensation which its members were then receiving for their services to the corporation, and the necessity of conferring further benefits on themselves in order to insure the continuance of those services. Having resolved these questions in their own favor, they proceeded to award additional benefits in the form of the privilege to subscribe to unissued common stock B of the corporation, at a small fraction of its market value. By resolution of that date, they put into effect a stock subscription plan by which 56,712 shares of unissued common stock B of the corporation were distributed in accordance with recommendations made by the president. Of this number 32, 370, more than half, were allotted to the directors, of which 13,440 were allotted to the president. The remaining 24,342 shares were allotted in relatively small amounts to 525 employees. None of the recipients was of lower rank than factory subassistant. Four hundred and seventy-three received allotments of less than 100 shares each, the great majority receiving from 15 to 50 shares. The stated consideration for issue \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n of the stock was a subscription price of $25 per share, the par value, and the services of the allottee, not specifically described, to be rendered to the American Tobacco Company for the remainder of the year.\n The certificates of stock were to be delivered to the respondents, the Guaranty Trust Company of New York and an individual, as trustees. They were authorized to borrow money upon them to the extent of $25 per share, in order to effect immediate payment of the subscription price to the tobacco company, to apply dividends received on account of the purchase price to be paid by the allottees and to deliver the certificates to them after the close of the year, upon payment in full of their subscriptions. They were given discretion to waive performance of the stipulated service by any allottee and in the event that the subscriber was discharged or resigned from the employ of the company within the year, to cancel the subscription agreement or not, as they pleased.\n On the day of the resolution allotting the stock, its market price was $112 per share, more than four times the subscription price. It was then paying, and has ever since paid, dividends at the rate of $5 per year, sufficient to pay the subscription price in five years. Valuing the subscription privilege by the difference between the subscription price and the market value of the shares, the president received by the allotment the equivalent of $1,169,280, in addition to his annual compensation of more than $1,000,000. The stock subscription rights awarded the five vice presidents, similarly valued, amounted to $1,451,595. That the subscription privilege, accorded for the avowed purpose of assuring the continuance of these executives in the company's employ, was then and has been ever since of great value, upon any theory of valuation, is not questioned.\n Conceiving himself aggrieved by this transaction, petitioner, a nonassenting stockholder, brought two suits in \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 136]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court of New York, the state in which he resides, joining as defendants the American Tobacco Company, the trustees of the allotted stock, and certain of the directors, including the president, secretary, treasurer, and five vice presidents, one of whom has since died and two of whom were not served with process. Included in the relief sought was a decree that the corporation, its officers and directors be enjoined from carrying out the stock allotments and that the stock allotted to the directors be surrendered to the company. On motion of defendants, the tobacco company and a nonresident director, the causes were removed to the District Court for Southern New York on grounds of diversity of citizenship of the parties to a separable controversy, and there consolidated.\n Thus called upon in this suit to account for their stewardship and to justify their action, the defendants, the respondents here, place their whole reliance upon a statute of New Jersey in conformity with which, they contend, they secured, in advance, the authorization of the stockholders to make the challenged allotments of stock.\n Section 1, c. 175, of the New Jersey Laws for 1920 (Comp. St. Supp. N. J.  47-183(a), authorizes any New Jersey corporation to provide and carry out a plan for '(a) the issue or the purchase and sale of its capital stock to any or all of its employees and those actively engaged in the conduct of its business or to trustees on their behalf ... and for aiding any such employees and said other persons in paying for such stock by contributions, compensation for services, or otherwise. ...' Section 2(b), Comp. St. Supp. N.J.  47-184(b) provides that, where, as in this case, the corporation has been formed without charter or by-law provisions authorizing the issuance or the purchase and sale of stock for such purposes, 'the board of directors shall first formulate such plan or plans and pass a resolution declaring that in its opinion the adoption thereof is advisable, and shall call a meeting of the stockholders to \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 137]\n\u00a0\n take action thereon. ...' It requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds in interest of each class of stockholders, present at the meeting, for the adoption of the plan.\n In June, 1930, the directors, purporting to act under this statute, presented to the stockholders, by notice of a special meeting, a so-called 'plan' under which the employees of the corporation and those actively engaged in its business were to be permitted to subscribe to unissued shares of its common stock B. The notice of the meeting was accompanied by a document designated 'Employees' Stock Subscription Plan,' and by a copy of resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the submission of the plan to the stockholders, proposing a reduction in the par value of the common stock and the non-voting common stock B from $50 to $25 per share, and an increase of the authorized common stock from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 shares, and of the authorized common stock B from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares, each stockholder to receive two shares of the new stock for one of the old. By thus increasing the authorized, unissued shares of common B, stock was to be made available for subscription by employees.\n The Employees' Stock Subscription Plan proposed 'to allot for subscription ... by way of additional compensation for services to be rendered, shares of unissued common stock B ... to such employees of the corporation and\/or its subsidiaries and those actively engaged in the conduct of its or their business as may be selected. ...' The prescribed method of execution of the plan was that 'the Board of Directors may, at such time or times as it may determine ... offer and allot such stock for subscription ... in such amounts and proportions, to such persons, at such prices, not less than the par value of the shares allotted, payable in full or in such installments, and upon such other terms and conditions, all as shall be determined with respect to each offering of \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 138]\n\u00a0\n stock to each individual pursuant to authority to be granted by the Board of Directors to the President for such purpose.'\n Accompanying the notice of the meeting was a circular letter by the president to stockholders, in which they were told of the prosperous condition of the company, that the purpose of the stock allotment plan was to encourage those who had made the company's success possible to continue in its employ, and that it was the expectation of the Board of Directors, if the program set forth in the notice of the meeting and accompanying documents should be approved by stockholders, to declare an extra dividend of $4 per share on the common stock and common stock B, and to initiate regular quarterly dividends on the newly authorized shares of common stock and common stock B at the increased annual rate of $5 per share. The letter closed with a request to sign and return the enclosed proxy, thereby indicating 'your approval of the proposed steps and your support of your Company's management.'\n Moved, perhaps, by these inducements, the proposal was approved at the meeting by vote of the requisite number of shares of each class.\n No disclosure was made to the stockholders by the officers and directors of the stock subscription plans previously put into operation by them, without authority of the charter or by-laws or the knowledge and approval of the stockholders. No disclosure was made of the number or amounts of the annual cash bonuses which had been paid to the president and vice presidents of the company, under the by-law adopted in 1912, and never, so far as appears, subsequently mentioned to the stockholders until after the stock allotments here involved. The only hint of the intention of the management to participate in the proposed Employees' Stock Subscription Plan was contained in a single sentence appearing in the Plan: \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 139]\n\u00a0\n 'No employee, or person actively engaged in the conduct of the business of the Corporation, or its subsidiaries, shall be deemed ineligible to the benefits of the Plan by reason of being also a director of the Corporation or of any of its subsidiaries or of holding any office therein.'\n With all these facts presented by the pleadings, the District Court, acknowledging its jurisdiction both as a federal court and a court of equity to decide the cause on its merits, nevertheless, held that as the suit concerns the internal affairs of a New Jersey corporation, discretion should be exercised to dismiss it without prejudice to its maintenance in the courts of New Jersey. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Swan dissenting, considered the merits and upheld the legality of the stock allotments. The decree of dismissal was affirmed on the merits and the trial court has entered a final decree accordingly. This court now reverses that judgment, reestablishing the original decree of the trial court, on the ground that a proper exercise of judicial discretion requires that the cause should not be heard. Thus after approximately two years of litigation in state and federal courts, all of which could, and I think should, have decided the case on the merits, the plaintiff must now start the litigation afresh in the courts of New Jersey.\n In determining whether the federal courts should decline to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them by removal, the nature of this controversy and its merits cannot be ignored. I do not stop to consider numerous objections to the stock allotments, urged by petitioner, which are not without weight. It suffices for present purposes that no plan of sufficient definiteness to comply with the New Jersey statute was ever submitted to the stockholders for their approval; and that even if it be conceded that a 'plan' was approved, the action of the directors in allotting the stock to themselves, in violation of their duty as fiduciaries, exceeded the authority con- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 140]\n\u00a0\n ferred upon them by the stockholders, and was, therefore, ultra vires.\n The statute directs that the board of directors shall 'first formulate such plan,' declare it 'advisable,' and call a meeting of stockholders to act on it. Without presenting for the consideration of the stockholders any workable plan of stock allotment, the directors, in effect, asked the stockholders to confer plenary authority on them to formulate a plan and to carry it into execution without any disclosure of its provisions. After the meeting, as before, no stockholder, not in the confidence of the directors, knew in what the plan consisted, who were the persons to participate in it, what principle was to control their selection or determine the amount of stock they were to receive, or the price they were to pay. It is a misuse of words of plain meaning to speak of such a proposal as a 'plan,' much less a formulated plan for stock allotment to employees, or as one which, in the form presented to the stockholders, the directors could have pronounced advisable or have carried into operation. It was no more than an invitation to stockholders to abrogate the discretion which the statute vested in them to approve a formulated plan, having at least some aspects of definiteness, and vest in the directors powers which could be conferred on them only by charter amendment in the manner prescribed by the statute. The invitation was accompanied by a skillfully phrased suggestion that it was necessary to accept it in order to hold the services of employees, and that, if accepted, the directors would cause new benefits to flow into the pockets of stockholders in the form of extra and increased dividends. Such a maneuver cannot rightly be regarded as a compliance with the plain language of the statute, which requires the directors first to formulate a plan for stock allotment and declare it advisable, and then to submit it to the stockholders for \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 141]\n\u00a0\n their approval. If it were, it would be difficult to suggest any conceivable purpose of the statute which could not be thwarted by a similar procedure.\n The respondents stand in no better position, even if we assume that the proposal submitted to the stockholders was a formulated plan, within the meaning of the New Jersey statute. For in that case, authority for the directors' action must be found in the stockholders' approval of the proposal which they submitted, and we must interpret the proposal and the action taken by the stockholders in terms of their legitimate expectation that the directors were complying with their duty as fiduciaries and not dealing with them at arm's length. They were entitled to read the proposal in the light of the fundamental duty of directors to derive no profit from their own official action, without the consent of the stockholders, obtained after full and fair revelation of every circumstance which might reasonably influence them to withhold their consent. Wardell v. Railroad Co., \n103 U.S. 651\n; General Investment Co. v. American Hide & Leather Co., 97 N.J.Eq. 230, 233, 127 A. 659; see United States Steel Corp. v. Hodge, 64 N.J.Eq. 807, 813, 54 A. 1, 60 L.R.A. 742; Globe Woolen Co. v. Utica Gas & Electric Co., 224 N.Y. 483, 489, 121 N.E. 378; compare Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 164 N.E. 545, 62 A.L.R. 1; Wendt v. Fischer, 243 N.Y. 439, 154 N.E. 303. They were entitled to assume that the proposal involved nothing which did not fairly appear on its face and above all that it was not a cloak for a scheme by which the directors were to enrich themselves in great amounts at the expense of the corporation, of whose interests they were the legal guardians.\n The respondents must, therefore, rest their case on the bare statement in their proposal to the stockholders that no employee or person actively engaged in the business of the company 'shall be deemed ineligible to the bene- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 142]\n\u00a0\n fits of the Plan,' because a director or officer. But it would be extravagant to say that these words, addressed by men in the position of trustees to their beneficiaries, gave warning of the wholesale gratuities which the directors subsequently bestowed upon themselves. No more extensive authority could be derived from this language than the disclosure which it made. By consenting that the directors should be 'eligible' to share in a plan avowedly for the benefit of employees, the stockholders did not consent that they should be the chief beneficiaries of their own unrestrained munificence, or that they should add any new bounties to the unrevealed stock allotments and bonuses which the directors had previously enjoyed in secrecy. Even if the stockholders consented that some of the directors should be eligible to benefit from action taken by other disinterested directors, they certainly did not consent that the allotments should be made by a group of directors who, because of the magnitude of the benefits they anticipated for themselves, were obviously incapable of passing an independent and unbiased judgment upon the propriety of the distribution which they co-operated in making to each other. Respondents' contention that if the directors were unable to vote on each other's participation no plan could be put into effect under which a majority of the directors were to participate, is without weight, for it obviously could be if the statute were followed and the plan revealed in its entirety to the stockholders.\n To surmount these difficulties, respondents point to the fact that a representative of petitioner stated at the stockholders' meeting that favorable action on the proposal might result in the issuance of a large amount of stock to employees, including officers and directors, without adequate consideration, and that this did not induce the stockholders to express their disapproval. It is unnec- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 143]\n\u00a0\n essary to speculate whether this outcome is to be attributed to the fact that those present, being without the aid of prevision, regarded the prediction as too improbable to be credited, or to the fact that those who attended the meeting were not, for the most part, the stockholders, but the recipients of their proxies selected by the management of the corporation for the occasion. A statement made to them would, as a New Jersey court has said, fall 'upon ears not allowed to hear and minds not permitted to judge; upon automatons, whose principals are uninformed of their own injury.' See Berendt v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 108 N.J.Eq. 148, 151, 154 A. 321, 322. In any event it is enough that neither in the notice of meeting and accompanying documents, which the stockholders saw and on which they relied, nor at the meeting itself, did the officers and directors disclose that such was their purpose.\n We need not conjecture whether, if the directors had had the hardihood to disclose in advance the benefits which they were to award to themselves, the stockholders would nevertheless have given their approval. Nor is it important that these directors have successfully managed the corporation and that under their direction it has earned large profits for its stockholders. Their business competence did not confer on them the privilege of making concealed or unauthorized profits or relieve them of the elementary obligation which the law imposes on all corporate directors to deal frankly and openly with stockholders in seeking their consent to benefit personally by reason of their relationship to the corporation.\n The directors, having failed to comply with petitioner's seasonable demand that they exercise their authority to bring this suit in the name of the corporation, petitioner was not required by general equitable principles or by Equity Rule 27 to appeal to the stockholders before bringing it, as the action complained of here was not one which \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 144]\n\u00a0\n the stockholders could ratify. Continental Securities Co. v. Belmont, 206 N.Y. 7, 17, 99 N.E. 138, 51 L.R.A. (N.S.) 112, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 777; cf. Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Albany & Susquehanna R.R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 435\n, 29 S. Ct. 540. Authority of the directors to bestow gratuities upon themselves in the form of subscription rights must be found in a plan approved in advance as the statute provides, by two-thirds of each class of stockholders. If no plan was presented to stockholders, as I think was the case, the entire stock issue was ultra vires and cannot be ratified any more than any other unauthorized disposition of corporate assets. If the proposal to the stockholders is regarded as a plan, so far as ordinary employees are concerned, as it plainly does not embrace authority to the directors to confer such extravagant benefits upon themselves, the result is the same, as to the stock allotted to the directors.\n I cannot agree that a proper exercise of discretion requires us to deny to the petitioner the relief to which he is so clearly entitled. This is the first time that this court has held that a federal court should decline to hear a case on the ground that it concerns the internal affairs of a corporation foreign to the state in which it sits. We may assume, without deciding, that neither a federal nor a state court of equity will, as a general rule, undertake to administer the internal affairs of a foreign corporation. But the case before us is, in this respect, unlike a suit to dissolve the corporation and wind up its affairs, Wallace v. Motor Products Corp. (C.C.A.) 25 F.(2d) 655, 658; Pearce v. Sutherland (C.C.A.) 164 F. 609; Maguire v. Mortgage Co. of America (C.C.A.) 203 F. 858; cf. Burnrite Coal Co. v. Riggs, \n274 \nU.S. 208, 212\n, 47 S.Ct. 578; or compel the declaration of a dividend, Cohn v. Mishkoff-Costlow Co., 256 N.Y. 102, 175 N.E. 529, or interfere with the election of officers or the meetings of shareholders or directors, Wason v. Buzzell, 181 Mass. 338, 63 N.E. 909; State \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 145]\n\u00a0\n ex rel. Lake Shore Tel. & T. Co. v. De Groat, 109 Minn. 168, 123 N.W. 417, 134 Am.St.Rep. 764; see Travis v. Knox Terpezone Co., 215 N.Y. 259, 263, 109 N.E. 250, L.R.A. 1916A, 542, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 387.\n We are presented with no problem of administration. The only relief which the petitioner merits on the record before us or which he asks here is a decree that certain directors, now before the court, restore to the treasury of the corporation, also before the court, certain shares of stock alleged to have been illegally issued to them, and that certificates for the stock now in possession of the trusteees, who are likewise before the court, be surrendered. There are no more obstacles to the rendition of an effective decree than in any other case in which a stockholder seeks reparation for depredations upon the corporate property committed by directors, some of whom only are before the court. Compare Wineburgh v. United States Steam & Street Ry. Advertising Co., 173 Mass. 60, 53 N.E. 145, 73 Am.St.Rep. 261; Ernst v. Rutherford & B.S. Gas Co., 38 App.Div. 388, 56 N.Y.S. 403; Corry v. Barre Granite & Quarry Co., 91 Vt. 413, 101 A. 38; Ganzer v. Rosenfeld, 153 Wis. 442, 141 N.W. 121. The decree will be completely satisfied by delivery of the certificates, properly endorsed, to the corporation. There is and can be no suggestion that such a decree cannot be pronounced and enforced as effectively by the courts in New York as it could be by those in New Jersey. Cf. American Creosote Works v. Powell (C.C.A.) 298 F. 417, 419; see Babcock v. Farwell, 245 Ill. 14, 34, 91 N.E. 683, 137 Am.St.Rep. 284, 19 Ann.Cas. 74.\n The opinion of the court concedes, as, indeed, the authorities which it cites show, that the decision does not rest upon any definite rule of general application. It is said that jurisdiction will be declined whenever considerations of convenience, efficiency and justice point to the courts of the state of the corporate domicile as appropriate tribunals for the determination of the particular \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 146]\n\u00a0\n case. Such considerations are said to require that this suit be dismissed though the petitioner is thereby subjected to all the hazards of starting his action anew, in the courts of New Jersey.\n To support this conclusion, only two objections to the maintenance of the suit are suggested in the opinion of this court or in that of the district court below. One is that numerous beneficiaries of the stock allotment, most of whom are not officers or directors of the corporation, are not made parties to this suit and presumably can be reached as a group only by suit in New Jersey. Hence, the intimation is, if we decide this case and other suits should subsequently be brought in other jurisdictions, different results may be reached on the same questions, a possibility which can be avoided by forcing the petitioner to bring a single suit in New Jersey. The other objection is that the court would be called upon to decide a novel question of New Jersey law.\n As petitioner has chosen to assert demands necessarily restricted to the stock issued by the directors to themselves, he had no occasion to join as parties the several hundred lesser employees, the great preponderance of whom received allotments of less than fifty shares of stock. Indeed, as the unconscionable conduct of the participating directors, a major factor in this case, would afford no basis for proceeding against the other allottees, it is by no means certain that the suit would be cast in any different form if brought in New Jersey.\n The somewhat speculative possibility that those of the participating directors who have not been served with process in this suit may be called to answer in some other court and exonerated is of slight importance compared to the considerations favoring the exercise of jurisdiction. Petitioner has chosen to bring his suit in New York. He and all but one of the individual defendants reside there. \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 147]\n\u00a0\n The principal office of the American Tobacco Company is in New York City and it is there that its books and records are found, its board of directors meets and the acts complained of took place. There the respondent, Guaranty Trust Company, is located, and its cotrustee resides. Before the decree can be enforced it must be obtained and the litigation must be brought to a successful conclusion. That involves the production in court of the necessary evidence. Of the parties to this case none but the American Tobacco Company is amenable to process in New Jersey; all are amenable in the Southern District of New York. In New York, petitioner can compel them and others connected with the corporation to attend as witnesses; all can be ordered to make complete discovery; and petitioner can compel the production at the trial of the records of both corporate defendants. We cannot assume that compulsion will not be necessary. The tobacco company carried to the highest court of the state its resistance to petitioner's preliminary application to inspect its books. Rogers v. American Tobacco Co., 143 Misc. 306, 257 N.Y.S. 321, affirmed 233 App.Div. 708, 249 N.Y.S. 993, leave to appeal denied. In New York also the individual defendants and the trust company can be reached by injunction pendente lite, restraining the transfer to innocent purchasers of the stock, certificates for which are already issued and in the hands of the trust company. Under the circumstances of this case, only considerations of more compelling force than the possibility of inconsistent decrees should lead a forum, convenient in so many respects, to decline jurisdiction.\n I come then to the only ground which can plausibly be urged for declining the jurisdiction-that in one, but not necessarily a conclusive aspect of the case, the court may be called on to decide questions of New Jersey law which, although novel, can hardly be said to be complicated or \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 148]\n\u00a0\n difficult. If there were any principle of federal jurisprudence, generally applicable, that in cases between private parties federal courts of equity may, in their discretionD ecline jurisdiction because called upon to decide an unsettled question of state law, I would willingly acquiesce in declining it here. But this court has not declared such a principle and does not recognize it now. On the contrary, whether jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship or on a substantial constitutional question, this court has consistently ruled that it is the duty of a federal court of original jurisdiction, and of this court on appeal from its decree, to pass on any state question necessarily involved, however novel, and that the decision may be rested on that ground alone. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175\n, 29 S.Ct. 451; Risty v. Chicago, R.I. & Pacific Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S.Ct. 236.\n Unless we are now to abandon that long settled practice, I can see much more reason for passing on this question than upon many others which this court has decided. Our judgment would conflict with no local decisions, compare Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518\n, 48 S.Ct. 404, 57 A.L.R. 426; Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20\n, 2 S.Ct. 10; nor apply an alien policy to matters which are the subject of delicate feeling in the state. Compare Gelpcke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175; Railroad Commission of California v. Los Angeles Ry. Corp., \n280 \nU.S. 145\n, 50 S.Ct. 71. Indeed, we may not even avoid deciding the question of state law by sending the case to New Jersey, for it is not suggested that if petitioner should elect to sue in the federal court for New Jersey, or if the suit should be properly brought there by removal from the state court, either that court or this may decline jurisdiction. Thus we should do no more in deciding the question of New Jersey law now than if the case were brought to us from the federal courts in New Jersey. \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 149]\n\u00a0\n Even if decision of the question of New Jersey law were more embarrassing than it appears to be here, a proper exercise of discretion would seem to require that the bill be retained, and that an interlocutory injunction restraining any disposition of the stock by respondents be granted as prayed, pending the diligent prosecution by petitioner of a suit in New Jersey. Compare Mallow v. Hinde, 12 Wheat. 193; Dunn v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 1; Stover v. Wood, 28 N.J.Eq. 253.\n If federal courts are to continue the general practice of deciding novel questions of state law whenever there are necessary or convenient grounds for the disposition of cases pending before them, there are peculiarly cogent reasons why there should be no departure from the practice in cases like the present. While a corporation in legal theory has only one domicile, in practice its activities are often nationwide and the legal domicile of the corporation, as in this case, is neither the place of its real corporate life nor the home of its officers and directors. Hence, if stockholders' suits, such as the present, are to be maintained with any hope of success, the practical necessities of making parties, securing evidence, obtaining the production of documents and relief by injunction against individual wrongdoers, justify, if they do not compel, their prosecution in the particular jurisdiction where necessary parties and witnesses may be found, rather than in the place of the technical corporate domicile.\n Extension of corporate activities, distribution of corporate personnel, stockholders and directors through many states, and the diffusion of corporate ownership, separated from corporate management, make the integrity of the conduct of large business corporations increasingly a matter of national rather than local concern (cf. A. A. Berle, Jr. and Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932)), to which the fed- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 150]\n\u00a0\n eral courts should be quick to respond when their jurisdiction is rightly invoked. We should be slow, indeed, to make a reluctance to decide questions of state law, not exhibited in other classes of cases, the ground for declining to decide this one.\n BRANDEIS, J., concurs in this opinion.\n\n CARDOZO, J.\n Viewing the suit as one to reclaim the shares received by the directors in breach of their fiduciary duties to the corporation and the shareholders, I find no adequate reason for the refusal to exercise jurisdiction, and this though a different conclusion might be thought to be necessary if relief were to be given upon grounds affecting the validity of the issue as a whole.\n In the circumstances of this case, the certificates allotted to the directors may be charged with a constructive trust, and surrendered to the corporation to be held in its treasury, without impeaching a single certificate other than their own.\n There is no need to consider whether the 'plan' as proposed is insufficient on its face, with the result that the innocent employees as well as the culpable directors will be deprived of its benefits. If it be taken as sufficient, the shareholders who voted for it are not chargeable with notice that fiduciary powers would later be perverted by the award to the fiduciary of extraordinary benefits. Consent will not protect if reason and moderation are not made to mark the boundaries of what is done under its shelter.\n I leave the question open whether in other circumstances or with other consequences there may be a cancellation of the shares of a foreign corporation in the absence of an adjudication by the courts of the domicile. Here the or- \n\n[288 U.S. 123, 151]\n\u00a0\n ganic structure of the corporation, if affected by the decree at all, will not be changed in such a way as to work substantial detriment to any stranger to the suit, but the fruits of an unjust enrichment will be put back into the treasury. I think we are at liberty to do so much, if nothing more, without waiting upon the judgment of any other court.\n The doctrine of forum non conveniens is an instrument of justice. Courts must be slow to apply it at the instance of directors charged as personal wrongdoers, when justice will be delayed, even though not thwarted altogether, if jurisdiction is refused. At least that must be so when the wrong is clearly proved. The overmastering necessity of rebuking fraud or breach of trust will outweigh competing policies and shift the balance of convenience. Equity, it is said, will not be over-nice in balancing the efficacy of one remedy against the efficacy of another when action will baffie, and inaction may confirm, the purpose of the wrongdoer. Falk v. Hoffman, 233 N.Y. 199, 203, 135 N.E. 243. Of the shares allotted to directors as contrasted with those allotted to other employees, most are owned by the defendants sued. Whatever shares belong to others will be untouched by the decree. With all the procedural complexities possible hereafter if jurisdiction be declined, the hazard of inconsistent judgments affecting the directors inter se will not avail without more to halt the processes of justice and the award of such relief as the court is competent to give against those subject to its power.\n I agree with Mr. Justice STONE for the reasons stated in his opinion that a breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors is a legitimate inference from the allegations of the bill, and agree with his conclusion that the cause should be remanded to the District Court for a determination of the merits. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 of that act provides for the participation of employees in purchase of stock, profits, welfare work, and management of any corporation organized under the laws of the state, and declares: 'Any stock corporation ... may, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined in the manner hereinafter designated, provide and carry out a plan or plans for any or all of the following purposes: (a) The issue or the purchase and sale of its capital stock to any or all of its employees and those actively engaged in the conduct of its business or to trustees on their behalf, and the payment for such stock in installments or at one time with or without the right to vote thereon pending payment therefor in full, and for aiding any such employees and said other persons in paying for such stock by contributions, compensation for services, or otherwise.' And section 2 provides: 'The board of directors shall first formulate such plan or plans and pass a resolution declaring that in its opinion the adoption thereof is advisable, and shall call a meeting of the stockholders to take action thereon. ... If two-thirds in interest of each class of stockholders present at said meeting and voting shall vote in favor of any such plan or any modification thereof, the said plan shall thereupon become operative.' (Comp. St. Supp. N.J.  47-183, 47-184.) And that section gives to any dissenting stockholder the right upon surrender to receive from the company the appraised value of any stock that was acquired before the passage of the act. \n\n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROGERS v. HILL(1933)\nNo. 732\nArgued: May 11, 1933Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard Reid Rogers and Evan Shelby, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Nathan L. Miller, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Tobacco Company is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey. The petitioner, plaintiff below, acquired in 1916 and has since been the owner of 200 shares of its common stock. He also has 400 shares of common stock B. In accordance with by-law XII,1 adopted by the stockholders at their annual meeting, March 13, 1912, the company for many years has annually paid its president and vice presidents large \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n amounts in addition to their fixed salaries and other sums allowed them as compensation for services. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Plaintiff maintains that the by-law is invalid and that, even if valid, the amounts paid under it are unreasonably large and therefore subject to revision by the courts. In March, 1931, he demanded that the company bring suit against the officers who have received such payments to compel them to account to the company for all or such part thereof as the court may hold illegal. The company, insisting that such a suit would be without basis in law or fact, refused to comply with his demand. He brought suit in the Supreme Court of New York against the president and some of the vice presidents to require them so to account, and joined the company as defendant. The case was removed to the federal court for the Southern District of New York. In May, 1931, plaintiff brought suit in that court against Taylor, a vice president, not a \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n defendant in the earlier suit, to require him to account and made the company defendant. The cases were consolidated, plaintiff fi ed an amended complaint and defendants answered. The officers of the company now before the court are Hill, the president, Neiley, Riggio, and Taylor, vice presidents. The answer, after admissions, denials, and explanations, asserts several separate defenses.\n Plaintiff made a motion on the pleadings for judgment that the separate defenses be stricken, the by-law be adjudged invalid, and defendants Hill, Neiley, and Riggio be required to account for amounts so paid them and that further payments be enjoined; and in the alternative that such payments be restrained pendente lite. After argument upon the motion, the court, without decision upon any other question, granted a temporary injunction. Defendants appealed, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the interlocutory order and directed that a mandate issue to the District Court 'in accordance with this decree.' See 60 F.(2d) 109. The mandate directed further proceedings in accordance with 'the decision.' On the coming down of the mandate, the District Court vacated the temporary injunction and dismissed the bills of complaint upon the merits. Plaintiff appealed, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (62 F.(2d) 1079), citing its opinion on the former appeal, and this court granted plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari (\n289 \nU.S. 716\n, 53 S.Ct. 593, 77 L.Ed. --).\n Defendants, renewing a contention made in opposition to the petition for certiorari, assert that the appellate court on the first appeal determined in favor of defendants all the issues presented by the complaint, and maintain that, no application for certiorari having been made within three months after that decision, the only question that this court now has power to decide is whether the mandate directed dismissal.\n We are of opinion that the mandate did not direct dismissal. The granting of temporary injunction involved \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n no determination of the merits. Such a decree will not be disturbed on appeal except for improvident allowance, violation of the rules of equity, or abuse of discretion. National Fire Ins. Co. v. Thompson, \n281 \nU.S. 331, 338\n, 50 S.Ct. 288; Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S.Ct. 463; Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 \nU.S. 518, 526\n, 17 S.Ct. 407. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals did indeed deal with matters affecting the merits but the decree did not extend beyond mere reversal of the order from which the appeal was taken. It directed that mandate issue in accordance with 'this decree.' The mandate commanded proceedings in accordance with 'the decision.' A direction for proceedings in accordance with 'the opinion' makes it a part of the mandate. Gulf Refining Co. v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 125, 136\n, 46 S.Ct. 52. Here the mandate was to proceed not in accordance with the 'opinion' but with the 'decision.' These words, while often loosely used interchangeably, are not equivalents. The court's decision of a case is its judgment thereon. Its opinion is a statement of the reasons on which the judgment rests. Houston v. Williams, 13 Cal. 24, 27, 73 Am. Dec. 565; Adams v. Railroad Co., 77 Miss. 194, 304, 24 So. 200, 317, 28 So. 956, 60 L.R.A. 33; Craig v. Bennett, 158 Ind. 9, 13, 62 N.E. 273; Coffey v. Gamble, 117 Iowa, 545, 548, 91 N.W. 813. The Judicial Code uses 'decision' as the equivalent of 'judgment' and 'decree.' Sections 128, 238 (28 USCA  225, 345). As a mandate in the words of the decree was unquestionably sufficient to give effect to the ruling of the appellate court, 'decision' may not reasonably be held to have been used for 'opinion.'\n Moreover, if the court intended to direct dismissal, it is to be presumed that it would have done so unequivocally and directly by means of language, form of decree, and mandate generally employed for that purpose. But, assuming it included the opinion, the mandate would not prevent the District Court in the exercise of a sound dis- \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 588]\n\u00a0\n cretion from allowing plaintiff, were adequate showing ade, to file additional pleadings, vary or expand the issues, and take other proceedings to enforce the accounting sought by his bills of complaint. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175, 182\n, 41 S.Ct. 93; Metropolitan Co. v. Kaw Valley District, \n223 \nU.S. 519, 523\n, 32 S.Ct. 246; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

In any view of the matter, it is clear that the decree of the appellate court was not final and that plaintiff, in order to have the validity of the payments considered here, was not bound within three months after entry to petition this court for a writ of certiorari.\n Plaintiff contends that the stockholders were not authorized to adopt the by-law under which the payments were made.\n Section 11, General Corporation Act, Laws 1896, c. 185 (2 Comp. St. N. J. 1910, p. 1606,  11), provides: 'The power to make and alter by-laws shall be in the stockholders, but any corporation may, in the certificate of incorporation, confer that power upon the directors; by-laws made by the directors under power so conferred may be altered or repealed by the stockholders.' The charter empowers the directors to make and alter by- laws. But plaintiff argues that the stockholders having delegated to the directors authority to adopt by-laws lost the power to adopt the one in question. That is inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. Power to prescribe rules for the government of business corporations reasonably is deemed an incident of ownership and the voting power of the shares. It is quite generally conferred by statute or charter provisions upon the stockholders. Here the statutory grant to them is plenary. The charter provision is subordinate and not inconsistent. There are many thousand holders of shares of this corporation. Their annual meetings are the only regular \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 589]\n\u00a0\n ones, but the directors meet frequently. The company's business is extensive and complex and considerations of convenience may have suggested delegation to directors of authority to make and alter by-laws.\n That the statute did not intend to divest stockholders is clear for it expressly makes by-laws passed by directors subject to alteration and repeal by the stockholders. In the absence of statutory provision definitely and clearly disclosing that intention, a charter provision or by-law adopted by incorporators or shareholders delegating power to directors may not reasonably be held to take from the stockholders any of the power conferred upon them by the statute. Plaintiff's contention would leave the stockholders full power to alter and repeal by-laws made by directors but would deny them power to originate or adopt any by-law or to amend or repeal those made by themselves. We find no reason in support of that construction. Moreover, it seems in direct conflict with the decision of the highest court of New Jersey. In the case of In re Griffing Iron Co., 63 N.J. Law, 168, 41 A. 931, affirmed in the Court of Errors and Appeals on the opinion below, 63 N.J. Law, 357, 46 A. 1097, the court declared ( page 171 of 63 N.J. Law, 41 A. 931, 932): '... That the stockholders had delegated to the directors power to amend the by-laws did not curtail their own power to amend them, and, of course, the later statute (Revision, 1896) removed all possible restriction on such power. ... It would be preposterous to leave the real owners of the corporate property at the mercy of their agents, and the law has not done so.' The plaintiff cites and quotes from Scott v. P. Lorillard Co., 108 N.J.Eq. 153, 154 A. 515, affirmed 109 N.J.Eq. 417, 157 A. 388. But, when regard is had to the questions considered in that case, there is nothing in the opinion that lends support to his contention. It cannot be sustained. \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 590]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff suggests that, because the by-law purports to direct payments out of profits, it violates charter provisions which he construes to require the directors to apply al profits to the acquisition of property and the payment of dividends. We need not examine the charter for the contention rests upon a misapprehension of the meaning of 'profits' as used in the by-law. As there defined it includes the sums to be paid to the president and vice presidents. Compensation to an officer for his services constitutes a part of operating expenses deductible from earnings in order to ascertain net profits. It is immaterial whether such compensation is a fixed salary or depends in whole or in part upon earnings. There is no conflict between the charter and the by-law. Bennett v. Millville Improvement Co., 67 N.J. Law, 320, 323, 51 A. 706; Booth v. Beattie, 95 N.J.Eq. 776, 118 A. 257, 123 A. 925.\n It follows from what has been shown that when adopted the by-law was valid. But plaintiff alleges that the measure of compensation fixed by it is not now equitable or fair. And he prays that the court fix and determine the fair and reasonable compensation of the individual defendants, respectively, for each of the years in question. The allegations of the complaint are not sufficient to permit consideration by the court of the validity or reasonableness of any of the payments on account of fixed salaries or of special credits or of the allotments of stock therein mentioned. Indeed, plaintiff alleges that other proceedings have been instituted for the restoration of special credits, and his suits to invalidate the stock allotments were recently considered here. Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n288 \nU.S. 123\n, 53 S.Ct. 295. The only payments that plaintiff by this suit seeks to have restored to the company are the payments made to the individual defendants under the by-law. \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 591]\n\u00a0\n We come to consider whether these amounts are subject to examination and revision in the District Court. As the amounts payable depend upon the gains of the business, the specified percentages are not per se unreasonable. The by-law was adopted in 1912 by an almost unanimous vote of the shares represented at the annual meeting and presumably the stockholders supporting the measure acted in good faith and according to their best judgment. The tabular statement in the margin shows the payments to individual defendants under the by-law. Plaintiff does not complain of any made prior to 1921. Regard is to be had to the enormous increase of the company's profits in recent years. The 2 1\/2 per cent. yielded President Hill $447,870.30 in 1929 and $842,507.72 in 1930. The 1 1\/2 per cent. yielded to each of the vice presidents, Neiley and Riggio, $ 115,141.86 in 1929 and $409,495.25 in 1930 and for these years payments under the by-law were in addition to the cash credits and fixed salaries shown in the statement.\n While the amounts produced by the application of the prescribed percentages give rise to no inference of actual or constructive fraud, the payments under the by-law have by reason of increase of profits become so large as to warrant investigation in equity in the interest of the company. Much weight is to be given to the action of the stockholders, and the by- law is supported by the presumption of regularity and continuity. But the rule prescribed by it cannot, against the protest of a shareholder, be used to justify payments of sums as salaries so large as in substance and effect to amount to spoliation or waste of corporate property. The dissenting opinion of Judge Swan indicates the applicable rule: 'If a bonus payment has no relation to the value of services for which it is given, it is in reality a gift in part, and the majority stockholders have no power to give away corporate prop- \n\n[289 U.S. 582, 592]\n\u00a0\n erty against the protest of the minority.' 60 F.(2d) 109, 113. The facts alleged by plaintiff are sufficient to require that the District Court, upon a consideration of all the relevant facts brought forward by the parties, determine whether and to what extent payments to the individual defendants under the by-laws constitute misuse and waste of the money of t e corporation. Booth v. Beattie, 95 N.J.Eq. 776, 118 A. 257, 123 A. 925; Scott v. P. Lorillard Co., 108 N.J.Eq. 153, 156, 154 A. 515, affirmed 109 N.J.Eq. 417, 157 A. 388; Nichols v. Olympic Veneer Company, 139 Wash. 305, 311, 246 P. 941, 48 A.L.R. 504; Collins v. Hite, 109 W.Va. 79, 84, 153 S.E. 240; Putnam v.

Miller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment, five counts, in the United States District Court, Southern District of Illinois, alleged that petitioners had violated the internal revenue laws in sundry \n\n[289 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n ways. The third court charged them with carrying on the business of a distiller without having given the bond required by section 3260, Rev. St., U.S.C. title 26,  284 (26 USCA  284).1 The fourth charged possession and control of a still not registered as required by section 3258, Rev. St., U. S.C. title 26,  281 (26 USCA  281).2 They pleaded not guilty; waived a jury; went to trial before the judge. He found them guilty under both the third and fourth counts and imposed appropriate sentence.\n The only point presented by the record for our consideration is whether there was adequate evidence to support the conviction.\n There was enough to show that the petitioners had custody and control of a still for the manufacture of alcoholic spirits set up and operating, or ready for operation, in a dwelling house. They did not take the stand; no affirmative evidence of failure to register the still or to give bond as required by the Revised Statutes was presented.\n The United States claim that in such circumstances the burden of proof to show execution of the bond and regis- \n\n[289 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n tration of the still rested upon the petitioners; that, having failed to sustain this, the judge properly declared them guilty as charged. And with this view we agree.\n Section 3266, Rev. St., U.S.C. title 26,  291 (26 USCA  291), provides: 'No person shall use any still ... in any dwelling house, or in any shed, yard, or inclosure connected with any dwelling house; ... and every person who does any of the acts prohibited by this section, or aids or assists therein, ... shall be fined $1,000 and imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than two years, in the discretion of the court. ...'\n It was impossible for the petitioners lawfully to register the still or to give the required bond.\n The lower federal courts generally have accepted the doctrine that proof of the custody or control of a still for unlawful distillation of alcoholic spirits is enough to give rise to an inference of lack of registration and failure to give bond which the defendant must overcome by proof.

Myers, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. E. Leahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present two questions:\n Has the location where a corporation maintained its main office and transacted most of its business ceased to be the principal place of business for the purposes of jurisdiction in bankruptcy if, during the greater portion of six months preceding the filing of the petition, the company's assets and affairs were in custody and control of equity receivers?\n Have creditors standing to ask the vacation of an adjudication based on a petition filed by authority of the directors of the bankrupt, where a statute of the state of incorporation forbids transfer, except in the usual course of business, of the franchises or assets of the company, without stockholders' assent?\n The relevant facts may be briefly stated.\n The respondent, a Maine corporation, had its principal place of business in Chicago, Ill. May 21, 1931, unsecured creditors brought suit against it in the United States District Court for Northern Illinois, averring solvency and existing difficulty in meeting pressing obligations, and praying the appointment of receivers. On the same day other creditors filed a petition in bankruptcy in the same court. The company appeared in the equity suit and consented to the granting of the prayer of the bill. Receivers were appointed, took possession of the assets, and proceeded to administer them. An answer to the petition in bankruptcy denied insolvency or acts of bankruptcy. May 25, 1931, the Royal Indemnity Company \n\n[289 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n and others filed a petition in bankruptcy against the respondent in the United States Court for the District of Maine. Answer was made denying insolvency and the commission of the alleged acts of bankruptcy. The company sought to transfer the cause to the court in Illinois, which the petitioners opposed. Thereafter the petitioners moved in the Illinois bankruptcy proceeding to dismiss the petition for alleged defects, and to stay all proceedings under General Order No. 6 (11 USCA  53) pending hearing upon the involuntary petition in Maine. The court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted a stay effective until hearing in the Maine district. September 5, 1931, the respondent withdrew its answers in the Illinois and Maine bankruptcy cases, thus abandoning its contest of adjudication in both. On the same day it filed a voluntary petition in the Illinois District Court, and adjudication was immediately entered.\n September 10, 1931, the petitioners prayed the Illinois court to vacate the adjudication and for a stay pending action in Maine. The motion to vacate raised the questions of law we have stated. The court set the cause down under Equity Rule 29 (28 USCA  723) for disposition of these questions. By order entered April 6, 1932, it decided them adversely to the petitioners. The respondent having filed an answer denying certain of the averments of the petition, the court directed that the cause be set for hearing so that the petitioners, if they desired, might offer proof. No evidence was offered and in default thereof the court held a hearing on the petition and answer, and on May 3, 1932, made a final order refusing to vacate the adjudication. Separate appeals were allowed from both orders, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed them. 61 F.(2d) 875. The case is here on certiorari, \n288 \nU.S. 596\n, 53 S.Ct. 400, 77 L.Ed. --.\n First. The Bankruptcy Act (section 2) invests each district court, as a court of bankruptcy, with jurisdiction to 'adjudge persons bankrupt who have had their principal place of \n\n[289 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n business, resided, or had their domicile' within the court's territorial jurisdiction, 'for the preceding six months, or the greater portion thereof.' \n1\n For three months and ten days of the six months preceding the filing of the respondent's voluntary petition its affairs had been in the control of receivers having the usual powers of management. The decree appointing them included an injunction restraining the corporation, its officers and agents, from interfering with, transferring, selling, or disposing of the property, assets, or income of the respondent, or taking possession or attempting to sell or dispose of any part of the same. The result, say the petitioners, is that the corporation thereupon ceased to have a principal place of business in the Northern district of Illinois. The claim is that the Bankruptcy Act refers to the place where the bankrupt is doing business, and not to a place where a business the company once owned is being conducted by some one else; that the business is not a separate entity or essence irrespective of the identity of the person conducting it. The business is said to have passed out of the hands of the respondent and to have been taken over in such sense that the company ceased to be in the business theretofore conducted at its former place of business, even though the business itself, as such, was continued by the receivers.\n The argument ignores the practical purpose of the statute as applied to such a situation. The decree in equity and its execution by officers of the court did not change the ownership of the assets or of the business. The corporation continued to have the only business owned before the appointment of receivers, though the actual conduct of its operations was for the time being vested in the court's appointees. Its corporate existence \n\n[289 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n and functions as a corporation continued. Whether its affairs were in the course of winding up or were being managed in the hope of restoration of full control to the corporate agencies is immaterial. Until a winding up had been effected the business formerly conducted by the company in Chicago continued to be the respondent's business and not that of another, and the place where that business was conducted, whether by receivers or by the corporate officers, still remained the 'principal place of business,' in the common acceptation of the phrase. In these days of corporate activity it is not unusual for a company chartered in one of the states to conduct most, if not all its business in another state far removed from that of incorporation. Considerations of convenience no doubt prompted the Congress to permit the initiation of a bankruptcy in the state where the business is in fact transacted rather than that of the domicile, where often none is done. Unnecessary inconvenience and expense may be inflicted upon creditors if they are required to participate in a proceeding conducted hundreds or thousands of miles from the situs of the bankrupt's activities, where the books and records are usually kept. That Congress was mindful of this is evident from the provisions for transfer of a cause by one court of bankruptcy to another where a proceeding is pending against the same bankrupt, for the greater convenience of the parties in interest. \n2\n We should therefore construe the language of the act so as to effectuate the evident purpose of the legislation, and not so narrowly as to defeat the true intent of Congress. We hold that the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, in re- \n\n[289 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n spect of respondent's principal place of business, had jurisdiction to entertain the petition. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The Revised Statutes of Maine, chapter 56, under the caption 'Rights of Minority Stockholders,' enact: 'Sec. 63. Cor poration not to sell franchises or entire property without consent of stockholders. ... No corporation shall sell, lease, consolidate or in any manner part with its franchises, or its entire property, or any of its property, corporate rights or privileges essential to the conduct of its corporate business and purposes, otherwise than in the ordinary and usual course of its business, except with the consent of its stockholders at an annual or special meeting, the call for which shall give notice of the proposed sale, lease or consolidation. All such sales, leases and consolidations shall be subject to the provisions of this and the eleven following sections, and to the prior lien of stockholders as therein defined.'\n After providing that the act shall not apply to mortgages of corporate property the sections following regulate methods of effecting consolidations, the valuation and payment for the stock of dissenting minority shareholders, etc. We are told that this statute prohibits the filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy by authority of a resolution of the board of directors, and that a shareholders' vote is required to authorize such action. No case decided by the Maine courts is cited in support of this assertion. But it is said that the filing of such a petition is a conveyance of all of the corporate property, and so plainly within the statutory prohibition. We cannot agree. \n\n[289 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n The petition in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding is a pleading. The entry of an adjudication vests title in the trustee, and this is the act of the court, not of the petitioner. Moreover, it seems too plain to need elaboration that the statute does not in terms affect the initiation of a bankruptcy proceeding, and was passed for a wholly different purpose.\n We might rest our decision as to the second question upon this ground. But there is another equally persuasive. Statutes such as the one relied on are intended for the protection of stockholders and have nothing to do with the interests or rights of creditors. Even if action of directors authorizing the filing of a voluntary petition, or admitting inability of the corporation to pay its debts and its willingness on that ground to be adjudged a bankrupt, thus creating an act of bankruptcy under section 3a(6) of the act,4 were in excess of the authority conferred, or otherwise invalid, creditors could not for that reason attack the consequent adjudication. \n5\n The question is purely one of the internal management of the corporation.

U.S.(1933)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harry W. Colmery, of Topeka, Kan., and Charles L. Kagey, of Wichita, Kan., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Charles A. Shepard, a major in the medical corps of the United States Army, has been convicted of the murder of his wife, Zenana Shepard, at Fort Riley, Kan., a United States military reservation. The jury having qualified their verdict by adding thereto the words 'without capital punishment' (18 U.S.C.  567 (18 USCA  567)), the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for life. The judgment of the United States District Court has been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, one of the judges of that court dissenting. 62 F.(2d) 683; 64 F.(2d) 641. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n The crime is charged to have been committed by poisoning the victim with bichloride of mercury. The defendant was in love with another woman, and wished to make her his wife. There is circumstantial evidence \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n to sustain a finding by the jury that to win himself his freedom he turned to poison and murder. Even so, guilt was contested, and conflicting inferences are possible. The defendant asks us to hold that by the acceptance of incompetent evidence the scales were weighted to his prejudice and in the end to his undoing.\n The evidence complained of was offered by the government in rebuttal when the trial was nearly over. On May 22, 1929, there was a conversation in the absence of the defendant between Mrs. Shepard, then ill in bed, and Clara Brown, her nurse. The patient asked the nurse to go to the closet in the defendant's room and bring a bottle of whisky that would be found upon a shelf. When the bottle was produced, she said that this was the liquor she had taken just before collapsing. She asked whether enough was left to make a test for the presence of poison, insisting that the smell and taste were strange. And then she added the words, 'Dr. Shepard has poisoned me.'\n The conversation was proved twice. After the first proof of it, the government asked to strike it out, being doubtful of its competence, and this request was granted. A little later, however, the offer was renewed; the nurse having then testified to statements by Mrs. Shepard as to the prospect of recovery. 'She said she was not going to get well; she was going to die.' With the aid of this new evidence, the conversation already summarized was proved a second time. There was a timely challenge of the ruling.\n She said, 'Dr. Shepard has poisoned me.' The admission of this declaration, if erroneous, was more than unsubstantial error. As to that the parties are agreed. The voice of the dead wife was heard in accusation of her husband, and the accusation was accepted as evidence of guilt. If the evidence was incompetent, the verdict may not stand. \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n 1. Upon the hearing in this court the government finds its main prop in the position that what was said by Mrs. Shepard was admissible as a dying declaration. This is manifestly the theory upon which it was offered and received. The prop, however, is a broken reed. To make out a dying declaration, the declarant must have spoken without hope of recovery and in the shadow of impending death. The record furnishes no proof of that indispensable condition. So, indeed, it was ruled by all the judges of the court below, though the majority held the view that the testimony was competent for quite another purpose, which will be considered later on.\n We have said that the declarant was not shown to have spoken without hope of recovery and in the shadow of impending death. Her illness began on May 20. She was found in a state of collapse, delirious, in pain, the pupils of her eyes dilated, and the retina suffused with blood. The conversation with the nurse occurred two days later. At that time her mind had cleared up, and her speech was rational and orderly. There was as yet no thought by any of her physicians that she was dangerously ill, still less that her case was hopeless. To all seeming she had greatly improved, and was moving forward to recovery. There had been no diagnosis of poison as the cause of her distress. Not till about a week afterwards was there a relapse, accompanied by an infection of the mouth, renewed congestion of the eyes, and later hemorrhages of the bowels. Death followed on June 15.\n Nothing in the condition of the patient on May 22 gives fair support to the conclusion that hope had then been lost. She may have thought she was going to die and have said so to her nurse, but this was consistent with hope, which could not have been put aside without more to quench it. Indeed, a fortnight later, she said to one of her physicians, though her condition was then grave, \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n 'You will get me well, won't you?' Fear or even belief that illness will end in death will not avail of itself to make a dying declaration. There must be 'a settled hopeless expectation' (Willes, J. in Reg. v. Peel, 2 F . & F. 21, 22) that death is near at hand, and what is said must have been spoken in the hush of its impending presence. Mattox v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 140, 151\n, 13 S.Ct. 50; Carver v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 553\n, 16 S.Ct. 388; Id., \n164 \nU.S. 694\n, 17 S.Ct. 228; R. v. Perry, (1909) 2 K.B. 697; People v. Sarzano, 212 N.Y. 231, 235, 106 N.E. 87; 3 Wigmore on Evidence,  1440, 1441, 1442, collating the decisions. Despair of recovery may indeed be gathered from the circumstances if the facts support the inference. Carver v. United States, supra; Wigmore, Evidence,  1442. There is no unyielding ritual of words to be spoken by the dying. Despair may even be gathered, though the period of survival outruns the bounds of expectation. Wigmore,  1441. What is decisive is the state of mind. Even so, the state of mind must be exhibited in the evidence, and not left to conjecture. The patient must have spoken with the consciousness of a swift and certain doom.\n What was said by this patient was not spoken in that mood. There was no warning to her in the circumstances that her words would be repeated and accepted as those of a dying wife, charging murder to her husband, and charging it deliberately and solemnly as a fact within her knowledge. To the focus of that responsibility her mind was never brought. She spoke as one ill, giving voice to the beliefs and perhaps the conjectures of the moment. The liquor was to be tested, to see whether her beliefs were sound. She did not speak as one dying, announcing to the survivors a definitive conviction, a legacy of knowledge on which the world might act when she had gone.\n The petitioner insists that the form of the declaration exhibits other defects that call for its exclusion, apart from the objection that death was not imminent and that \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n hope was still alive. Homicide may not be imputed to a defendant on the basis of mere suspicions, though they are the suspicions of the dying. To let the declaration in, the inference must be permissible that there was knowledge or the opportunity for knowledge as to the acts that are declared. Wigmore,  1445(2). The argument is pressed upon us that knowledge and opportunity are excluded when the declaration in question is read in the setting of the circumstances. On the one side are such cases as Berry v. States, 63 Ark. 382, 38 S.W. 1038; State v. Wilks, 278 Mo. 481, 213 S.W. 118; State v. Williams, 67 N.C. 12; State v. Jefferson, 125 N.C. 712, 34 S.E. 648; Shaw v. People, 3 Hun, 272; Id., 63 N.Y. 36; Stewart v. Commonwealth, 235 Ky. 670, 679, 32 S.W.(2d) 29; and Commonwealth v. Griffith, 149 Ky. 405, 149 S.W. 825; on the other, Shenkenberger v. State, 154 Ind. 630, 57 N.E. 519; State v. Kuhn, 117 Iowa, 216, 228, 90 N.W. 733; Fults v. State, 83 Tex.Cr.R. 602, 204 S.W. 108; Cook v. State, 90 Tex.Cr.R. 424, 235 S.W. 875; cf. the cases cited in 63 A.L.R. 567, note, and 25 A.L. R. 1370, note. The form is not decisive, though it be that of a conclusion, a statement of the result with the antecedent steps omitted. Wigmore,  1447. 'He murdered me,' does not cease to be competent as a dying declaration because in the statement of the act there is also an appraisal of the crime. State v. Mace, 118 N.C. 1244, 24 S.E. 798; State v. Kuhn, supra. One does not hold the dying to the observance of all the niceties of speech to which conformity is exacted from a witness on the stand. What is decisive is something deeper and more fundamental than any difference of form. The declaration is kept out if the setting of the occasion satisfies the judge, or in reason ought to satisfy him, that the speaker is giving expression to suspicion or conjecture, and not to known facts. The difficulty is not so much in respect of the governing principle as in its application to varying and equivocal conditions. In this case, the ruling that there \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n was a failure to make out the imminence of death and the abandonment of hope relieves us of the duty of determining whether it is a legitimate inference that there was the opportunity for knowledge. We leave that question open.\n\n 2. \nWe pass to the question whether the statements to the nurse, though incompetent as dying declarations, were admissible on other grounds.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals determined that they were. Witnesses for the defendant had testified to declarations by Mrs. Shepard which suggested a mind bent upon suicide, or at any rate were thought by the defendant to carry that suggestion. More than once before her illness she had stated in the hearing of these witnesses that she had no wish to live, and had nothing to live for, and on one occasion she added that she expected some day to make an end to her life. This testimony opened the door, so it is argued, to declarations in rebuttal that she had been poisoned by her husband. They were admissible, in that view, not as evidence of the truth of what was said, but as betokening a state of mind inconsistent with the presence of suicidal intent.\n\n\n (a)\n The testimony was neither offered nor received for the strained and narrow purpose now suggested as legitimate. It was offered and received as proof of a dying declaration. What was said by Mrs. Shepard lying ill upon her death bed was to be weighed as if a like statement had been made upon the stand. The course of the trial makes this an inescapable conclusion. The government withdrew the testimony when it was unaccompanied by proof that the declarant expected to die. Only when proof of her expectation had been supplied was the offer renewed and the testimony received again. For the reasons already considered, the proof was inadequate to show a consciousness of impending death and the abandonment of hope; but inadequate though it was, there can be no \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 103]\n\u00a0\n doubt of the purpose that it was understood to serve. There is no disguise of that purpose by counsel for the government. They concede in all candor that Mrs. Shepard's accusation of her husband, when it was finally let in, was received upon the footing of a dying declaration, and not merely as indicative of the persistence of a will to live. Beyond question the jury considered it for the broader purpose, as the court intended that they should. A different situation would be here if we could fairly say in the light of the whole record that the purpose had been left at large, without identifying token. There would then be room for argument that demand should have been made for an explanatory ruling. Here the course of the trial put the defendant off his guard. The testimony was received by the trial judge and offered by the government with the plain understanding that it was to be used for an illegitimate purpose, gravely prejudicial. A trial becomes unfair if testimony thus accepted may be used in an appellate court as though admitted for a different purpose, unavowed and unsuspected. People v. Zackowitz, 254 N.Y. 192, 200, 172 N.E. 466. Such at all events is the result when the purpose in reserve is so obscure and artificial that it would be unlikely to occur to the minds of uninstructed jurors, and even if it did, would be swallowed up and lost in the one that was disclosed.\n\n\n (b)\n Aside, however, from this objection, the accusatory declaration must have been rejected as evidence of a state of mind, though the purpose thus to limit it had been brought to light upon the trial. The defendant had tried to show by Mrs. Shepard's declarations to her friends that she had exhibited a weariness of life and a readiness to end it, the testimony giving plausibility to the hypothesis of suicide. Wigmore,  1726; Commonwealth v. Trefethen, 157 Mass. 180, 31 N.E. 961, 24 L.R.A. 235. By the proof of these declarations evincing an unhappy state of mind, the defendant opened the door to the offer by the government \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 104]\n\u00a0\n of declarations evincing a different state of mind, declarations consistent with the persistence of a will to live. The defendant would have no grievance if the testimony in rebuttal had been narrowed to that point. What the government put in evidence, however, was something very different. It did not use the declarations by Mrs. Shepard to prove her present thoughts and feelings, or even her thoughts and feelings in times past. It used the declarations as proof of an act committed by some one else, as evidence that she was dying of poison given by her husband. This fact, if fact it was, the government was free to prove, but not by hearsay declarations. It will not do to say that the jury might accept the declarations for any light that they cast upon the existence of a vital urge, and reject them to the extent that they charged the death to some one else. Discrimination so subtle is a feat beyond the compass of ordinary minds. The reverberating clang of those accusatory words would drown all weaker sounds. It is for ordinary minds, and not for psychoanalysts, that our rules of evidence are framed. They have their source very often in considerations of administrative convenience, of practical expediency, and not in rules of logic. When the risk of confusion is so great as to upset the balance of advantage, the evidence goes out. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on the Law of Evidence, 266, 516; Wigmore, Evidence,  1421, 1422, 1714\n\n\n These precepts of caution are a guide to judgment here. There are times when a state of mind, if relevant, may be proved by contemporaneous declarations of feeling or intent. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, \n145 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 12 S.Ct. 909; Shailer v. Bumstead, 99 Mass. 112; Wigmore,  1725, 1726, 1730. Thus, in proceedings for the probate of a will, where the issue is undue influence, the declarations of a testator are competent to prove his feelings for his relatives, but are incompetent as evidence of his conduct or of theirs. Throckmorton v. Holt, \n180 U.S. 552\n, \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 105]\n\u00a0\n 571, 572, 573, 21 S.Ct. 474; Waterman v. Whitney, 11 N.Y. 157, 62 Am.Dec. 71; Matter of Kennedy, 167 N.Y. 163, 172, 60 N.E. 442. In suits for the alienation of affections, letters passing between the spouses are admissible in aid of a like purpose. Wigmore,  1730; Ash v. Prunier (C.C.A.) 105 F. 722; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.

In damage suits for personal injuries, declarations by the patient to bystanders or physicians are evidence of sufferings or symptoms (Wigmore,  1718, 1719), but are not received to prove the acts, the external circumstances, through which the injuries came about. Wigmore ,  1722; Amys v. Barton, (1912) 1 K.B. 40; Chicago & A.R.R. Co. v. Industrial Board, 274 Ill. 336, 113 N.E. 629; Peoria Cordage Co. v. Industrial Board, 284 Ill. 90, 119 N.E. 996, L.R.A. 1918E, 822; Larrabee's Case, 120 Me. 242, 113 A. 268; Maine v. Maryland Casualty Co., 172 Wis. 350, 178 N.W. 749, 15 A.L.R. 1536. Even statements of past sufferings or symptoms are generally excluded (Wigmore,  1722(b); Cashin v. New York, N. H. & H.R.R. Co., 185 Mass. 543, 70 N.E. 930), though an exception is at times allowed when they are made to a physician (Roosa v. Loan Co., 132 Mass. 439, 440; Cleveland, C., C. & I.R. Co. v. Newell, 104 Ind. 264, 271, 3 N.E. 836, 54 Am.Rep. 312; contra, Davidson v. Cornell, 132 N.Y. 228, 237, 30 N.E. 573). So also in suits upon insurance policies, declarations by an insured that he intends to go upon a journey with another may be evidence of a state of mind lending probability to the conclusion that the purpose was fulfilled. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon, supra. The ruling in that case marks the high-water line beyond which courts have been unwilling to go. It has developed a substantial body of criticism and commentary. \n1\n Decla- \n\n[290 U.S. 96, 106]\n\u00a0\n rations of intention, casting light upon the future, have been sharply distinguished from declarations of memory, pointing backwards to the past. There would be an end, or nearly that, to the rule against hearsay if the distinction were ignored.\n The testimony now questioned faced backward and not forward. This at least it did in its most obvious implications. What is even more important, it spoke to a past act, and, more than that, to an act by some one not the speaker. Other tendency, if it had any, was a filament too fine to be disentangled by a jury.\n The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maguire, The Hillmon Case, 38 Harvard Law Review, 709, 721, 727; Seligman, An Exception to the Hearsay Rule, 26 Harvard Law Review, 146; Chafee, Review of Wigmore's Treatise, 37 Harvard Law Review, 513, 519. \n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSINCLAIR REFINING CO. v. JENKINS PETROLEUM P. CO.(1933)\nNo. 752\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 689, 690]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dean S. Edmonds and Frank E. Barrows, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. C. Stanley Thompson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A bill of discovery in aid of an action at law was dismissed by the District Court (56 F.(2d) 272), but upheld upon appeal by the Circuit Court of Appeals (62 F.(2d) 663, 665). The question is whether the bill is good upon its face.\n The respondent, Jenkins Petroleum Process Company, loaned to the petitioner, Sinclair Refining Company, then known as the Cudahy Refining Company, an experimental still for cracking petroleum oils to produce gasoline. By written agreement, any improvements developed as the result of the work of the petitioner's engineers and experts in making themselves familiar with the Jenkins apparatus or process were to belong to the respondent. The petitioner, or its predecessor, undertook, so far as it was able, to cause its employees to execute applications for patents in the United States and elsewhere in order to protect such improvements, and to assign the applications to the petitioner together with the improvements affected thereby.\n In January, 1921, the respondent filed a bill in equity for specific performance. Isom, an employee of the peti- \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 691]\n\u00a0\n tioner, applied for a patent on September 10, 1917, and when the patent was issued on November 19, 1918, assigned it to his employer. The respondent made claim to the patent on the ground that it was an improvement of the Jenkins invention. After a trial upon the merits, the bill for specific performance was dismissed, the court holding that there was doubt whether Isom's invention was the outcome of his use of the Jenkins apparatus, or of independent thought and knowledge. (D.C.) 32 F.( 2d) 247. There was an appeal from the decree to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That court invoked the principle that to uphold a decree for specific performance there must be clear and convincing evidence, and not merely such evidence as would sustain a recovery at law. In that view the decree was affirmed in so far as it dismissed the prayer for equitable relief, but the dismissal was coupled with a direction that the cause be transferred to the law side of the court, the plaintiff to have leave to amend by turning his ause of action into one for the recovery of damages. 32 F.(2d) 252.\n The action at law is now at issue, and the plaintiff prays for a discovery. It alleges in its bill that the evidence of the facts to be discovered is contained in voluminous books and documents which could not be inspected or proved upon a trial at law for damages without confusion and delay. Discovery is demanded as to the number of cracking stills constructed by the defendant under the Isom patent; as to the extent and time of operation; and as to the amount of gasoline and other petroleum products yielded thereby, with an inspection of the relevant designs and drawings. The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the bill placing its decision upon two grounds, (1) that a bill of discovery will not lie when the facts to be discovered relate to damages only, and (2) that the value of the patents has no relation to the sales of the patented device, and that evidence of such sales \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 692]\n\u00a0\n would be inadmissible if offered. The Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting. In the view of the majority of the court, the damages to be recovered in an action at law may be proved by resort to a discovery in equity, if the ancillary remedy is reasonably necessary to advance the ends of justice. Munger v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (C.C.A.) 261 F. 921, and Loose v. Bellows Falls Pulp Plaster Co. (C.C.A.) 266 F. 81, were disapproved to the extent that they involve a ruling to the contrary. As to the measure of damages, and the evidence pertinent thereto, the court held that the plaintiff was not concerned with the defendant's profits, since it was suing for breach of contract, and not as equitable owner. Even so, in ascertaining the value of the patent at the time of the breach, the triers of the facts would be at liberty to consider the commercial use that had been made of the patented device. The court went on to indicate restrictions as to the order of proof which were thought to be appropriate. At first and as part of the case in chief, the plaintiff was to be confined within rather narrow limits. It might show 'the general facts about the Isom invention, not specific instances of profitable use by this person or that.' The need for greater detail, however, might develop with the trial. 'If ... the defendant should deny the utility and commercial success of the invention, evidence of the defendant's use of it might be highly significant; and under those circumstances the plaintiff would be entitled to discovery of them.' The information to be exacted of the defendant was thus, in the view of the court, to be adjusted to the need. To permit that adjustment the bill was to be retained until the trial, and prompt discovery would then be ordered if the situation thus developed should call for that relief. A writ of certiorari prayed for by the defendant has brought the case here. \n289 \nU.S. 717\n, 53 S.Ct. 595, 77 L.Ed . --. \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 693]\n\u00a0\n 1. The remedy of discovery is as appropriate for proof of a plaintiff's damages as it is for proof of other facts essential to his case.\n Help for the solution of problems of this order is not to be looked for in restrictive formulas. Procedure must have the capacity of flexible adjustment to changing groups of facts. The law of discovery has been invested at times with unnecessary mystery. There are few fields where considerations of practical convenience should play a larger role. The rationale of the remedy, when used as an auxiliary process in aid of trials at law, is simplicity itself. At times, cases will not be proved, or will be proved clumsily or wastefully, if the litigant is not permitted to gather his evidence in advance. When this necessity is made out with reasonable certainty, a bill in equity is maintainable to give him what he needs. Equity Rule 58 (28 USCA  723). There were other reasons in times past, when parties were not permitted to be witnesses, and when there was no compulsory process for the production of books or documents. Carpenter v. Winn, \n221 \nU.S. 533\n, 31 S.Ct 683; Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Union Pacific Co. (D.C.) 240 F. 135, 137. Today the remedy survives, chiefly, if not wholly, to give facility to proof. In the practice of many states there is a summary substitute by an order for examination before trial or for the inspection of books and papers. The substitute has never found its way into the procedure of the federal courts. Ex parte Fisk, \n113 \nU.S. 713\n, 5 S.Ct. 724. The remedy in those courts is still by bill in equity as in days before the codes. Colgate v. Compagnie Francaise, etc. (C.C.) 23 F. 82; Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Union Pacific Co ., supra.\n To state the function of the remedy is to give the password to its use. There are times when a suit is triable in separate parts, one affecting the right or liability, and the other affecting the measure of recovery. In suits of \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 694]\n\u00a0\n that order a discovery as to damages will commonly be postponed till the right or liability has been established or declared. Schrieber v.

Dickinson, 3 K. & L. 388; Peile, The Law and Practice of Discovery, pp. 26-29; Bray, Principles and Practice of Discovery, pp. 14, 15; Wigram, Points in the Law of Discovery,  45. As a general thing it will be useless to decree it any earlier, and may even be oppressive. 'The principle of judicial parsimony' (L. Hand, J., in Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra), if nothing more, condemns a useless remedy. This division of the trial into stages or installments will happen oftenest in suits in equity, though it is not unknown in actions at law where a jury has been waived. In equity it is common practice. Thus, a suit to establish a partnership or to restrain the infringement of a patent culminates, if successful, in an interlocutory decree, which will be followed by an accounting and a discovery of documents. In these and like cases, the accounts will not be probed until the right has been adjudged.\n A different situation is presented where the action is at law and is triable by judge and jury. There interlocutory judgments are unknown, at all events where the defendant has answered generally and not by special plea, and the verdict establishing the right establishes at the same time the amount to be recovered. The answer being general, the case according to common-law practice must be tried as a unit and not broken into parts. In such circumstances damages may be proved with the aid of a discovery, if the complication of accounts or other practical impediments make it necessary that the evidence be sifted in advance. Pape v. Lister, L.R. 6 Q. B. 242; Saunders v. Jones, L.R. 7 Ch.Div. 435, 452; Elkin v. \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 695]\n\u00a0\n Clarke, supra; Sherwood Bros., Inc., v. Yellow Cab Co., 283 Pa. 488, 491, 492, 129 A. 563; Wells v. Holman, 115 S.C. 443, 106 S.E. 224; McKinnon Young Co. v. Stockton, 55 Fla. 708, 46 So. 87; Burns v.

'I have consulted my learned Brothers,' said Lush, J., in Pape v. Lister, supra, 'and the conclusion at which we have arrived is that this rule must be made absolute. I do not agree with Mr. Wills' contention that 'relating to such action' means relating to the issues raised. I think if documents relate to the amount of damages, that is quite sufficient.'\n Munger v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. [C.C.A.] 261 F. 921, is cited by the petitioner as supporting a general rule that the necessity of proving damages is never a sufficient ground for a discovery in equity. If confined to its special facts, the decision may not be wrong. Very likely the bill was insufficient to make out a pri a facie showing of right or liability. If the case stands for more than that, as the opinion indicates it does, it does not have our approval. The point is made in it that damages are not part of the 'issues' in a lawsuit, and that the interrogatories to be answered by a defendant under a bill of discovery are to be directed to the issues and not to anything else. There is indeed a rule of common-law pleading that the statement of general damages in the ad damnum clause of a complaint is not an issuable allegation. McClelland v. Climax Hosiery Mills, 252 N.Y. 347, 356, 169 N.E. 605; Howell v. Bennett, 74 Hun, 555, 558, 26 N.Y.S. 627. This does not mean, however, that the plaintiff will not have to prove his damages if he wishes to get more than a nominal verdict. Quite to the con- \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 696]\n\u00a0\n trary, it means that he will have to prove them though the defendant has omitted to deny them in the answer. It is a non sequitur to argue from this that the quantum of the damages is not a part of the case to be proved through the aid of a discovery if proof upon the trial will be burdensome or difficult. To this it must be added that interrogatories today are no longer any part of the pleadings, whatever they may once have been. Equity Rule 58 (28 USCA  723) has taken that quality away from them. Luten v. Camp (D.C.) 221 F. 424. They are not instruments in any technical sense for the joinder of issue. They are forms of examination preliminary to trial.\n The petitioner is not helped by our decision in United States v. Bitter Root Development Co., \n200 \nU.S. 451, 472\n, 26 S.Ct. 318. The complainant in that suit did not seek a discovery in aid of an action at law for the recovery of damages. The suit was for general relief as well as for discovery, the prayer for discovery being merely incidental. The complainant was attempting to transfer to a court of equity the control of a suit that was triable at law. Cf. Colgate v. Compagnie Francaise, supra (C.C.) 23 F. page 85; Whittemore v. Patten (C.C.) 81 F. 527; Wigram, supra,  10. The incident fell with the fall of the principal.\n Loose v. Bellows Falls Pulp Plaster Co., supra, also cited by the petitioner, has a dictum approving the decision in Munger v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., supra, but the point was not involved, for the plaintiff was not asking for discovery as an auxiliary remedy in furtherance of his remedy at law, but was attempting, like the complainant in the Bitter Root Case, to subject the entire suit to the jurisdiction of equity.\n To hold that the plaintiff in an action at law may have discovery of damages is not to say that the remedy will be granted as of course, or that protection will not be given to his adversary against impertinent intrusion. Wigram, supra,  115. The court may decline to open \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 697]\n\u00a0\n the defendant's records to the scrutiny of a competitor posing as a suitor, if the suit has been begun without probable cause or as an instrument of malice. It is all a matter of discretion. Good faith and probable cause were here abundantly established. The remedy of specific performance had been refused, but the very court that refused it had found sufficient merit in the suit to call for an amendment of the pleadings that would give the plaintiff an opportunity to maintain a remedy at law.\n The decree under review protects the petitioner with sedulous forethought against an oppressive inquisition. Only the most general facts are to be discovered in advance of trial. The bill is to be retained, however, to be available in case of need. If the occasion for fuller scrutiny shall afterwards develop, there may thus be an inspection of the records without the delay that would be inevitable if a new bill had to be filed with a new opportunity to the defendant to answer or demur. Presumably the jury could be held together in the interval, and the trial at law adjourned. This relief may have been less than the plaintiff should have had. It was certainly not more.\n\n 2. \nThe use that has been made of he patented device is a legitimate aid to the appraisal of the value of the patent at the time of the breach.\n This is not a case where the recovery can be measured by the current prices of a market. A patent is a thing unique. There can be no contemporaneous sales to express the market value of an invention that derives from its novelty its patentable quality. Cf. United States v. Swift & Co., \n270 \nU.S. 124\n, 46 S.Ct. 308; Todd v. Gamble, 148 N.Y. 382, 42 N.E. 982, 52 L.R.A. 225. But the absence of market value does not mean that the offender shall go quit of liability altogether. The law will make the best appraisal that it can, summoning to its service whatever aids it can command. United States v. Swift & Co., supra; U.S. Frumentum \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 698]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Lauhoff (C.C.A.) 216 F. 610; Industrial & General Trust, Ltd., v. Tod, 180 N.Y. 215, 232, 73 N.E. 7; Sedgwick, Damages (9th Ed.) vol. 1, pp. 491, 504. At times the only evidence available may be that supplied by testimony of experts as to the state of the art, the character of the improvement, and the probable increase of efficiency or saving of expense. Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Moline Plow Co., \n235 \nU.S. 641, 648\n, 649 S., 35 S.Ct. 221; Suffolk Mfg. Co. v. Hayden, 3 Wall. 315, 320; U.S. Frumentum Co. v. Lauhoff, supra. This will generally be the case if the trial follows quickly after the issue of the patent. But a different situation is presented if years have gone by before the evidence is offered. Experience is then available to correct uncertain prophecy. Here is a book of wisdom that courts may not neglect. We find no rule of law that sets a clasp upon its pages, and forbids us to look within.\n Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 151\n, 49 S.Ct. 291, does not commit us to a different holding. The problem there before the court was one as to the appraisal of a life estate for the purpose of the assessment of a tax. The intention of the lawmakers was held to be that the computation of the tax should be made as of the death of the testator on the basis of a law of averages. Cf. Matter of Wagner v. Wilson & Co., 251 N.Y. 67, 71, 167 N.E. 174. A different question would have been here with a different result if we had been measuring the damages for a breach of contract or a tort. To correct uncertain prophecies in such circumstances is not to charge the offender with elements of value nonexistent at the time of his offense. It is to bring out and expose of light the elements of value that were there from the beginning. Brightson v. Claflin Co., 180 N.Y. 76, 83, 84, 72 N.E. 920; Wakeman v. Wheeler & Wilson Mfg. Co., 101 N.Y. 205, 217, 4 N.E. 264, 54 Am. Rep. 676; cf. City of New York v. Sage, \n239 \nU.S. 57\n, 36 S.Ct. 25; Cincin- \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 699]\n\u00a0\n nati Siemens-Lungren Gas Co. v.

(C.C.A.) 158 F. 79, 80, 81; Williston, Contracts, Vol. III, p. 2394\n\n\n Value for exchange is not the only value known to the law of damages. There are times when heed must be given to value for use, if reparation is to be adequate. Barker v. Lewis Storage & Transportation Co., 78 Conn. 198, 61 A. 363, 3 Ann.Cas. 889; Green v. Boston & Lowell Railroad Co., 128 Mass. 221, 35 Am.Rep. 370; Citizens' Bank v. Fitchburg Fire Ins. Co., 86 Vt. 267, 84 A. 970; McAnarney v. Newark Fire Ins. Co., 247 N.Y. 176, 184, 185, 159 N.E. 902, 56 A.L.R. 1149. Sedgwick, supra, pp. 504-507. An imaginary bid by an imaginary buyer, acting upon the information available at the moment of the breach, is not the limit of recovery where the subject of the bargain is an undeveloped patent. Information at such a time might be so scanty and imperfect that the offer would be nominal. The promisee of the patent has less than fair compensation if the criterion of value is the price that he would have received if he had disposed of it at once, irrespective of the value that would have been uncovered if he had kept it as his o n. Formulas of measurement declared alio intuitu may be misleading if wrested from their setting and applied to new conditions. See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pac. Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 155\n, 45 S.Ct. 465. The market test failing, there must be reference to the values inherent in the thing itself, whether for use or for exchange. Industrial & General Trust Co. v. Tod, supra. These will not be known by first imagining a forced sale, and then accepting as a measure its probable results. The law is not so tender to sellers in default.\n\n 3. \nSection 724 of the Revised Statutes [28 USCA  636] permitting the use of a subpoena duces tecum for the production of books and papers has not superseded the remedy of dis- \n\n[289 U.S. 689, 700]\n\u00a0\n covery in cases where inspection during the trial and in the presence of the jury will produce delay or inconvenience. Carpenter v. Winn, supra; Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra.\n The court did not exceed the bounds of a legitimate discretion in holding that these embarrassments might reasonably be expected to follow if discovery were refused.\n The decree should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTH CAROLINA v. BAILEY(1933)\nNo. 685\nArgued: April 21, 1933Decided: May 22, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 412, 413]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. C. Wolfe, of Orangeburg, S.C., and John M. Daniel, of Columbia, S.C., for the State of South Carolina. at* Mr. Clyde R. Hoey, of Shelby, N.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 412, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sunday night, May 1, 1932 (probably about 10:30 Eastern time), Hunt, a police officer, was murdered on a well-lighted street in Greenville, S.C. An affidavit by policeman Corea, May 5th, before a local magistrate charged Ray Bailey, respondent here, with the crime. As provided by the federal statute (18 USCA  662), demand was made upon the Governor of North Carolina for delivery of the accused as a fugitive from justice. Bramlett and Hammond were designated as agents to bring him back.\n This requisition was promptly honored; and a warrant issued directing officers in North Carolina to arrest respondent, 'afford him such opportunity to sue out a writ of habeas corpus as is prescribed by the laws of this State and to thereafter deliver him into the custody of the said C. R. Bramlett and L. W. Hammond, to be taken back to the said State, from which he fled.' June 7th, acting as commanded, the sheriff of Jackson county took him into custody. He at once obtained a writ of habeas corpus from the local superior court. His petition therefor alleged illegality of custody 'for that the defendant is charged with an offense in the State of South Carolina, to-wit, the murder of A. B. Hunt, on or about the 1st day of May, 1932, when, at which time, this affiant was in the State of North Carolina, and was not in the State of South Carolina.'\n The sheriff in his return to the writ alleged that Bailey 'is being legally and lawfully held in custody after having been arrested on a warrant of extradition issued by the Governor of North Carolina on the 9th day of May, 1932, upon requisition for same by the Governor of South Carolina, on and for a charge of murder alleged to have been committed in the State of South Carolina, said war- \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 415]\n\u00a0\n rant of extradition having been duly executed by me on the said Ray Bailey, alias Ray Keith, on the 7th day of June, 193 .'\n The judge of the superior court sitting at Sylva, N.C., heard the cause June 27, 1932. A number of affidavits were received without objection, and thirty or more witnesses were examined in open court. At the conclusion of the testimony the judge announced: 'Gentlemen, I think there has been an issue raised here, I don't think I have a right to pass on, that of identity, and at the same time I don't think it would be fair to the defendant to send him to South Carolina to stand a trial, as it would be very expensive to him and his folks; under the testimony I don't think there would be a jury anywhere that would ever find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I shall, therefore, discharge him under the writ and let him go.' This formal judgment followed:\n'1. That Ray Bailey (alias Ray Keith) is a citizen and resident of the State of North Carolina.\n\n'2. That he is not a fugitive from justice from the State of South Carolina, and was not present at the time of the commission of the alleged crime at Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n'3. That the State of South Carolina has failed to show probable cause for holding the said Ray Bailey in custody, or that he committed the alleged crime-the murder of A. B. Hunt, and has failed to produce sufficient evidence to warrant the Court in refusing the Writ, and the Court finding from all the evidence introduced in this cause that the petitioner is entitled to the relief sought in his petition and the Writ of Habeas Corpus; ...\n\n'It is, therefore, upon motion ... considered, ordered, decreed and adjudged by the Court that the petition and Writ be allowed and that the defendant be and he is hereby released from custody.' \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of North Carolina reviewed the cause upon certiorari under title-'In the matter of Ray Bailey alias Ray Keith.' It affirmed the challenged judgment and, among other things, said (203 N.C. 362, 166 S.E. 165, 167):\n\n'In the case at bar, a controversy of fact arose between the contending parties, that is the demanding state and the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner was in the demanding state at the time the alleged offense was committed. The writ of habeas corpus was created and fashioned for the express purpose of determining such controverted fact. The statute and public policy require that such fact be determined in a summary manner. Doubtless in given cases different minds would work out diverse conclusions, but, after all, it is perhaps wise that the determination of the ultimate fact should be lodged in the sound legal discretion of an impartial judge, commissioned by the law of the land and the inherent sense of the responsibility of his high office 'to do what to justice appertains.' He hears the witnesses and observes their mental leanings or bias toward the question involved. He senses the atmosphere of the case. Moreover, it would doubtless be a dangerous experiment to undertake by a judicial decree of an appellate court to prescribe a legal strait-jacket for such matters.\n\n'Exercising the power delegated by statute and supported in principle by the decisions of this state, the hearing judge found certain facts and set them forth in his judgment. The last inquiry in the solution of the appeal is: What is the effect of the findings of fact set out in the judgment? What ever may be the variable conclusions reached by other courts, that inquiry is settled in North Carolina. The law is thus stated: 'The findings of fact made by the judge of the Superior Court, found, as they are, upon competent evidence, are also conclusive on us ... \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n and we must therefore base our judgment upon his findings, which amply sustain his order.' In re Hamilton, 182 N.C. 44, 108 S.E. 385, 386. See, also Clegg v. Clegg, 186 N.C. 28, 118 S.E. 824; In re Hayes, 200 N.C. 133, 156 S.E. 791, 73 A.L.R. 1179.'\n\n The matter is here on certiorari.\n No question is raised concerning the form or adequacy of the writ issued by the Governor of North Carolina.\n Prima facie Bailey was in lawful custody and upon him res ed the burden of overcoming this presumption by proof. McNichols v. Pease, \n207 \nU.S. 100, 109\n, 28 S.Ct. 58.\n This he undertook to do. His own affidavit positively asserted his presence in North Carolina when the alleged crime occurred. He narrated his movements, all within that state, from Sunday morning, May 1st, when he was at Asheville (north of Greenville, S.C., sixty-one miles over a well-paved highway) until 5:30 o'clock Monday morning when he entered the hospital at Sylva, N.C., fifty miles southwest of Asheville (a paved highway connects these towns) under an assumed name. A number of affidavits and the testimony of several witnesses given in open court tend to support his narrative.\n He claimed that he left Asheville about dark Sunday night, May 1st, in a car with a friend with whom he had been drinking and gambling during the afternoon; both were under the influence of alcohol; they were going towards Bailey's home in Yancey county; at a point on the roadside some twenty-five miles north of Asheville, between 10 and eleven o'clock, p.m. ( Central time) this friend after shooting him left him on the roadside; shortly thereafter two strangers appeared, put him in their car and carried him to his brother's house in Asheville; from there an ambulance conveyed him to the hospital, fifty miles away, where he gave an assumed name.\n The doctors found two bullets had passed through his body; also that a bullet had wounded his right hand at the base of the thumb. \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n Although present in court at the hearing Bailey did not take the stand and several persons who probably could have thrown much light upon the issue were neither called nor accounted for. Among these were the respondent's friend who shot him, the brother to whose house at Asheville respondent was taken, two women said to have been there, and the doctor who there dressed his wounds. Other important witnesses made ex parte affidavits.\n Such a tale should have been subjected to rigid scrutiny. The hearing was in no sense a criminal trial and the judge would have been well advised if he had demanded that the prisoner present himself for examination; also should show what effort had been made to secure the presence of important witnesses in order that they might be questioned. Viewed as a whole the evidence for respondent leaves much to be desired- certainly it is unsatisfactory. If true, it supports the conclusions of the Judge that Bailey had not fled from the justice of South Carolina.\n On the other hand, the demanding state presented three witnesses- police officers Corea and Singleton and a merchant-residents of Greenville, S.C., who identified Bailey and positively asserted that in their presence he shot officer Hunt about 10:30 Sunday night, May 1st. They had never seen Bailey until he suddenly appeared and commenced to shoot. The officers gave a circumstantial account of the homicide, declared they were within a few feet of the assailant, shot at him nine times after he had fatally wounded Hunt and thought they wounded him in the body and right hand. They further said that during the melee an automobile stopped nearby and its occupants shot at them many times. The culprit finally entered and escaped in that car. The whole affray continued for only a very short time- a few moments.\n While some circumstances tend to support these statements, they are not free from doubt. If true, Bailey was a fugitive. \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n The record presents an irreconcilable conflict of evidence. It is not possible to say with certainty where the truth lies.\n The rights of the parties depend upon the proper construction and application of article 4,  2, par. 2, of the Federal Constitution1 and section 5278, Rev. Stat. (U.S. Code, tit. 18,  662 (18 USCA  662))2 derived from the Act of February 12, 1793\n\n\n The demanding state asserted a right to the custody of the respondent under the Federal Constitution and statute. He claimed that these impliedly forbade his surrender since the evidence made it clear that he was beyond the limits of South Carolina at the time of the homicide and, therefore, was not a fugitive from the justice of that state. \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n These questions of federal right were properly submitted for consideration by the state court upon the return to the writ of habeas corpus. And it was the duty of that court to administer the law prescribed by the Constitution and statute of the United States, as construed by this court. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44; Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rankin, \n241 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 36 S.Ct. 555, L.R.A. 1917A, 265.\n In effect the matter for determination was whether the accused appeared to be held contrary to the Federal Constitution and laws. The ultimate question of his guilt or innocence of the charge of murder preferred against him did not arise-the sole point for decision related to his absence from the state of South Carolina at the time of the crime. It was wholly beyond the province of the judge to speculate, as he seems to have done, concerning the probable outcome of any trial which might follow rendition to the demanding state. The circumstances require this Court to search the record and determine for ourselves whether upon the facts presented the courts below reached the proper conclusion.\n The applicable provision of the Federal Constitution and of the statute intended to supplement it have often been considered here. Some of the more important cases are collected in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In Munsey v. Clough, \n196 \nU.S. 364, 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 282, 285, through Mr. Justice Peckham, this Court said: 'When it is conceded, or when it is so conclusively proved that no question can be made, that the person was not within the demanding state when the crime is said to have been committed, and \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 421]\n\u00a0\n his rrest is sought on the ground only of a constructive presence at that time, in the demanding state, then the court will discharge the defendant. Hyatt v. Corkran, \n188 \nU.S. 691\n, 23 S.Ct. 456, affirming the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals, 172 N.Y. 176, 64 N.E. 825, 60 L. R.A. 774, 92 Am.St.Rep. 706. But the court will not discharge a defendant arrested under the governor's warrant where there is merely contradictory evidence on the subject of presence in or absence from the state, as habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding to try the question of alibi, or any question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.'\n Speaking for the Court in McNichols v. Pease, \n207 \nU.S. 100, 112\n, 28 S. Ct. 58, 62, Mr. Justice Harlan said: 'When a person is held in custody as a fugitive from justice under an extradition warrant, in proper form, and showing upon its face all that is required by law to be shown as a prerequisite to its being issued, he should not be discharged from custody unless it is made clearly and satisfactorily to appear that he is not a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States. We may repeat the thought expressed in Appleyard's Case, above cited, that a faithful, vigorous enforcement of the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to fugitives from justice is vital to the harmony and welfare of the states, and that 'while a state should take care, within the limits of the law, that the rights of its people are protected against illegal action, the judicial authorities of the Union should equally take care that the provisions of the Constitution be not so narrowly interpreted as to enable offenders against the laws of a state to find a permanent asylum in the territory of another state.\"\n Considering the Constitution and statute and the declarations of this Court, we may not properly approve the discharge of the respondent unless it appears from the record that he succeeded in showing by clear and satisfactory evidence that he was outside the limits of South \n\n[289 U.S. 412, 422]\n\u00a0\n Carolina at the time of the homicide. Stated otherwise, he should not have been released unless it appeared beyond reasonable doubt that he was without the state of South Carolina when the alleged offense was committed and, consequently, could not be a fugitive from her justice.\n The record discloses only a conflict of evidence; the requirement which we have indicated has not been met; and the challenged judgment must be reversed.\n The cause will be remanded to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of the opinion that the evidence, while possibly sufficient to sustain, does not require a finding that there is probable cause to believe that the accused was a fugitive from South Carolina, and therefore this court is not warranted in reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'A person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be deli ered up to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rev. St.  5278 (18 USCA  662).

CO. v. COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA(1933)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of virginia. \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sidney S. Alderman, of Washington, D.C., and Thomas B. Gay, of Richmond, Va., for appellant.\n Messrs. J. F. Hall and Brockenbrough Lamb, both of Richmond, Va., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal questions the validity of chapter 62, Acts General Assembly of Virginia, 1930, Michie's Code 1930,  3974a. Pertinent portions are in the margin. \n1\n The \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n claim is that enforcement of the act as construed by the state Supreme Court would deprive appellant of property without due process of law, and thus violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Purporting to proceed under the challenged chapter, the Highway Commissioner, without prior notice, advised appellant that in his opinion public safety and convenience required elimination of the grade crossing near Antlers; also, he directed construction there of an overhead passage according to accompanying plans and specifications. Replying, the company questioned the Commissioner's conclusion upon the facts, denied the validity of the act, and refused to undertake the work. Thereupon, by petition he asked the State Corporation Commission for an order requiring it to proceed. A demurrer to this questioned the constitutionality of the statute. It especially pointed out that the Commissioner undertook to ordain, \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n without prior notice, and that there was no provision for any review except in respect of the proposed plans for the structure. The Commission overruled the demurrer and directed the railway to construct the overhead. The Supreme Court construed the statute and approved this action.\n As authoritatively interpreted the challenged act permits the highway commissioner-an executive officer-without notice or hearing to command a railway company to abolish any designated grade crossing and construct an overhead when, in his opinion, necessary for public safety and convenience. His opinion is final upon the fundamental question whether public convenience and necessity require the elimination unless what the Supreme Court denominates 'arbitrary' exercise of the granted power can be shown. Upon petition, filed within sixty days, the Corporation Commission may consider the proposed plans and approve or modify them, but nothing more. The statute makes no provision for review by any court. But the Supreme Court has declared that a court of equity may give relief under an orginal bill where 'arbitrary' action can be established.\n As construed and applied, we think the statute conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Certainly, to require abolition of an established grade crossing and the outlay of money necessary to construct an overhead would take the railway's property in a very real sense. This seems plain enough both upon reason and authority. Washington ex rel. Oregon R.R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 523\n, 524 S., 32 S.Ct. 535; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 \nU.S. 340, 345\n, 35 S.Ct. 753. See Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Company v. Board of Commissioners, 76 Mont. 305, 247 P. 162.\n If we assume that by proper legislation a state may impose upon railways the duty of eliminating grade crossings, when deemed necessary for public safety and convenience, the question here is whether the challenged statute meets the requirements of due process of law. \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n Undoubtedly, it attempts to give an administrative officer power to make final determination in respect of facts-the character of a crossing and what is necessary for the public safety and convenience-without notice, without hearing, without evidence; and upon this ex parte finding, not subject to general review, to ordain that expenditures shall be made for erecting a new structure. The thing so authorized is no mere police regulation.\n In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185, 186, replying to the claim that a Commission's order made without substantial supporting evidence was conclusive, this Court declared:\n'A finding without evidence is arbitrary and baseless. And if the government's contention is correct, it would mean that the Commission had a power possessed by no other officer, administrative body, or tribunal under our government. It would mean that, where rights depended upon facts, the Commission could disregard all rules of evidence, and capriciously make findings by administrative fiat. Such authority, however beneficently exercised in one case, could be injuriously exerted in another, is inconsistent with rational justice, and comes under the Constitution's condemnation of all arbitrary exercise of power.\n\n'In the comparatively few cases in which such questions have arisen it has been distinctly recognized that administrative orders, quasi judicial in character, are void if a hearing was denied; if that granted was inadequate or manifestly unfair; if the finding was contrary to the 'indisputable character of the evidence.\"\n\n Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 457\n, 458 S., 462, 466, 10 S.Ct. 702, involved an act of the Minnesota Legislature, which permitted the Commission finally to fix railway rates without notice. It was challenged because of conflict with the due process clause. This Court said:\n'It deprives the company of its right to a judicial investigation, by due process of law, under the forms and \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n with the machinery provided by the wisdom of successive ages for the investigation judicially of the truth of a matter in constroversy, and substitutes therefor, as an absolute finality, the action of a railroad commission which, in view of the powers conceded to it by the state court, cannot be regarded as clothed with judicial functions, or possessing the machinery of a court of justice. ... No hearing is provided for; no summons or notice to the company before the commission has found what it is to find, and declared what it is to declare; no opportunity provided for the company to introduce witnesses before the commission,-in in fact, nothing which has the semblance of due process of law. ...\n\n'The question of the reasonableness of a rate of charge for transportation by a railroad company, involving, as it does, the element of reasonableness both as regards the company and as regards the public, is eminently a question for judicial investigation, requiring due process of law for its determination. If the company is deprived of the power of charging reasonable rates for the use of its property, and such deprivation takes place in the absence of an investigation by judicial machinery, it is deprived of the lawful use of its property, and thus, in substance and effect, of the property itself, without due process of law, and in violation of the constitution of the United States. ...'\n\n The claim that the questioned statute was enacted under the police power of the state, and therefore is not subject to the standards applicable to legislation under other powers, conflicts with the firmly established rule that every state power is limited by the inhibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167\n, 20 S.Ct. 336; Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 33 S.Ct. 76, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1123, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 192; Adams v. Tanner, \n224 \nU.S. 590, 594\n, 37 S.Ct. 662, L.R.A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 549\n, 550 S., 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238\n\n\n Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133\n, 14 S.Ct. 499, points out that the right to destroy private property-nuisances, etc.-for pro- \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n tection against imminent danger, has long been recognized. Such action does no violence to the Fourteenth Amendment. The principles which control have no present application. Here, the statute itself contemplates material delay; no impending danger demands immediate action. During sixty days the railway may seek modification of the plans proposed.\n Counsel submit that the Legislature, without giving notice or opportunity to be heard, by direct order might have required elimination of the crossing. Consequently, they conclude the same end may be accomplished in any manner which it deems advisable without violating the Federal Constitution. But, if we assume that a state Legislature may determine what public welfare demands and by direct command require a railway to act accordingly, it by no means follows that an administrative officer may be empowered, without notice or hearing, to act with finality upon his own opinion and ordain the taking of private property. There is an obvious difference between legislative determination and the finding of an administrative official not supported by evidence. In theory, at least, the Legislature acts upon adequate knowledge after full consideration and through members who represent the entire public.\n Chapter 62 undertakes to empower the Highway Commissioner to take railway property if and when he deems it necessary for public safety and convenience. It makes no provision for a hearing, and grants no opportunity for a review in any court. This, we think, amounts to the delegation of purely arbitrary and unconstitutional power unless the indefinite right of resort to a court of equity referred to by the court below affords adequate protection.\n Considering the decisions here, it is clear that no such authority as that claimed for the Commissioner could be intrusted to an administrative officer or body under the power to tax, to impose assessments for benefits, to regulate common carriers, to establish drainage districts, or to \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 198]\n\u00a0\n regulate business. Turner v. Wade, \n254 \nU.S. 64, 70\n, 41 S.Ct. 27; Browning v. Hooper, \n269 \nU.S. 396, 405\n, 46 S.Ct. 141; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., \n227 \nU.S. 88\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242, 247\n, 36 S.Ct. 317; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064. Appellee makes no claim to the contrary. He affirms, however, that under the police power the Legislature could rightly grant the challenged authority. But, as pointed out above, this is subject to the inhibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment and we think the suggested distinction between it and other powers of the state is unsound.\n This Court has often recognized the power of a state acting through an executive officer or body or order the removal of grade crossings, but in all these cases there was the right to a hearing and review by some court. See Great Northern Ry. v. Clara City, \n246 \nU.S. 434\n, 38 S.Ct. 346; Erie R.R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commissioners, \n254 \nU.S. 394\n, 41 S.Ct. 169; Lehigh Valley Co. v. Board of Commissioners, \n278 \nU.S. 24\n, 49 S.Ct. 69, 73 L.Ed 161, 62 A.L.R. 805.\n After affirming appellant's obligation to comply with the Commissioner's order, the court below said: 'The railroad is not without remedy. Should the power vested in the Highway Commissioner be arbitrarily exercised, equity's long arm will stay his hand.' But, by sanctioning the order directing the railway to proceed, it, in effect, approved action taken without hearing, without evidence, without opportunity to know the basis therefor. This was to rule that such action was not necessarily 'arbitrary.' There is nothing to indicate what that court would deem arbitrary action or how this could be established, in the absence of evidence or hearing. In circumstances like those here disclosed, no contestant could have fair opportunity for relief in a court of equity. There would be nothing to show the grounds upon which the Commissioner based his conclusion. He alone would be cognizant of the mental processes which begot his urgent opinion. \n\n[290 U.S. 190, 199]\n\u00a0\n The infirmities of the enactment are not relieved by an indefinite right of review in respect of some action spoken of as arbitrary. Before its property can be taken under the edict of an administrative officer, the appellant is entitled to a fair hearing upon the fundamental facts. This has not been accorded. The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO dissent upon the ground that there has been a lawful delegation to the state highway commissioner of the power to declare the need for the abatement of a nuisance through the elimination of grade crossings dangerous to life and limb; that this power may be exercised without notice or a hearing ( Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 77\n, 18 S.Ct. 513), provided adequate opportunity is afforded for review in the event that the power is perverted or abused; and that such opportunity has been given by the statutes of Virginia as construed by its highest court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 62, Acts General Assembly of Virginia 1930, p. 74 (Michie's Code  3974a).\n'...

SMITH(1933)\nNo. 388\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. Marshall Bullitt and Leo T. Wolford, both of Louisiville, Ky., for petitioner. \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 431]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jesse I. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was a United States soldier in the World War and while in the service suffered permanent mental incompetency. He became entitled to receive from the United States war risk insurance and disability compensation. \n1\n September 19, 1919, the county court of Breathitt county, Ky., appointed for him the guardian above named who qualified and has ever since acted as such. The United States paid to the guardian \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n the installments due his ward. The guardian deposited them in the Hargis Bank & Trust Company. It became insolvent and February 5, 1930, conformably to the laws of the state, all its assets were taken over by respondent acting as special deputy banking commissioner and liquidating agent. At that time the guardian had on deposit $6,070.80 derived from such payments. The assets of the bank were not sufficient to pay more than one-half the total owing to depositors. Claiming priority under R.S.  3466,2 the guardian demanded payment of his deposit in full. Respondent held that petitioner was only entitled to share ratably with other creditors and refused to pay.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the circuit court of Breathitt county to enforce the asserted priority. That court gave him judgment as prayed. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the bank was not indebted to the United States on account of the deposit made by the guardian. 244 Ky. 68, 50 S.W.(2d) 64. The question has not been considered here and, decisions upon it in the state courts being in conflict,3 we granted a writ of certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 590\n, 53 S.Ct. 96, 77 L.Ed. --. \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner relies upon the clause of section 3466 declaring that whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent the debts due to the United States shall first be satisfied. He asserts that, under acts of Congress later to be considered, the war risk insurance and disability compensation paid to a guardian of an incompetent veteran remains the money of the United States so long as it is subject to his control and suggests that the guardian is a mere instrumentality of the United States for the disbursement of such money for the benefit of the veteran. And he maintains that the deposit here involved is money of the United States and that the bank is indebted to it therefor.\n The pertinent substance of the provisions invoked by petitioner follows. Section 21(1) and (2) of the World War Veterans' Act 1924, provides that where any payment under the act is to be made to a person mentally incompetent, it may be made to the person who is constituted guardian by the laws of the state or is otherwise legally vested with responsibility or care of the claimant or his estate. It authorizes the director to suspend payments to a guardian who shall neglect or refuse to render to the director from time to time an account showing the application of such payments for the benefit of the incompetent. 4 Section 22 declares that such payments shall not be assignable or subject to the claims of creditors and that they shall be exempt from taxation, but makes them subject to claims of the United States under the act against the veteran. \n5\n Sections 21(3) and 26 provide that in specified cases insurance and disability com- \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 434]\n\u00a0\n pensation remaining unpaid or in the hands of a guardian at the death of the veteran shall escheat to the United States. \n6\n Section 214 provides that where an incompetent veteran receiving disability compensation disappears the director may make payments to his dependents. \n7\n Section 505 provides for punishment of guardians who shall embezzle such funds. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The guardian, appointed by the county court, was by the laws of the state given the custody and control of the personal estate of his ward and was authorized to collect and receive the money in question. Ky. Stats.  2030. And unquestionably payment to the guardian vested title in the ward and operated to discharge the obligation of the United States in respect of such installments. Taylor v. Bemiss, \n110 \nU.S. 42, 45\n, 3 S.Ct. 441; Lamar v. Micou, \n112 \nU.S. 452, 472\n, 5 S.Ct. 221; Maclay v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, \n152 \nU.S. 499, 503\n, 14 S.Ct. 678; Martin v.

Shawnee County Comm'rs, 132 Kan. 233, 243, 294 P. 915, certiorari denied \n283 \nU.S. 855\n, 51 S.Ct. 648. Schouler, Dom. Rel. (6th Ed.)  892.\n The provisions for exemption, nonassignability, and suspension of payments plainly imply the passage of title from the United States to the veteran. The denunciation of embezzlement by guardians is not inconsistent with that intention. These regulations, like many to be found in pension laws, disclose a purpose to safeguard to bene- \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n ficiaries the appropriations and payments made for their benefit (United States v. Hall, \n98 U.S. 343\n, 353; Westfall v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 256\n, 47 S.Ct. 629) and evince special solicitude for the protection of veterans who by reason of mental incompetency are unable to protect themselves. The clauses subjecting such payments to claims of the United States against the veteran and providing for escheat to the United States make against petitioner's claim. Neither would be appropriate or necessary if the money paid to such guardian continued to belong to the United States until actually disbursed by him for the veteran's benefit.\n Petitioner cites United States v. Hall, supra. The question there was whether Congress has power to prescribe punishment for the embezzlement by guardians of pension money paid them in behalf of their wards. The indictment showed that the money alleged to have been embezzled was the property of the accused guardian's ward. The court held that to insure transmission unimpaired to the beneficiary to United States might annex such conditions to the donation as it deemed appropriate and that the guardian was bound to accept the payment subject to the terms of the grant and that Congress had power to protect its gift until it passed into the hands of the beneficiary. There is no suggestion in the opinion that the United States had any interest as owner in the money embezzled. The power of Congress to punish such misappropriation is not limited to acts causing loss to the United States. Westfall v. United States, supra, pages 258-259 of 274 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 629. Petitioner also cites Bramwell v. U.S. Fidelity Co., \n269 \nU.S. 483\n, 46 S.Ct. 176. But in that case the United States itself was the guardian and through its officer, the superintendent of an Indian reservation, made the deposit which upon insolvency of the bank was held a preferred claim under section 3466, R.S. (31 USCA  191). The case is not in point as here the guardian was appointed pursuant to state law \n\n[288 U.S. 430, 436]\n\u00a0\n to act for and on behalf of his ward. He was not an agent or instrumentality of the United States. Shippee v. Commercial Trust Co., 115 Conn. 326, 161 A. 775; Puffenbarger v. Charter (W. Va.) 165 S.E. 541; State ex rel. v. Shawnee County Comm'rs, supra. It results that the deposit in question does not belong to the United States and, as indebtedness to it is essential to priority, the guardian's claim under that section is without merit. Other contentions made by petitioner are so plainly inapplicable here as not to require discussion.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Articles 3 and 4, War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 405, 409; titles 2 and 3, World War Veterans' Act 1924, approved June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 615, 624, as amended (38 U.S.C.  471-502, 511-518 ( 38 USCA  471-502, 511-518)). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.' 31 U.S.C.  191 (31 USCA  191). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The decisions supporting petitioner's contention are: State ex rel.

A statute provides that the railroad commission 'shall have exclusive power to determine and prescribe the manner, including the particular point of crossing and the terms of installation, operation, maintenance, apportionment of expenses, use and protection of each crossing of one railroad by another railroad. ...' Act April 1, 1919, No. 571, pp. 411, 419,  9, Crawford & Moses' Digest,  1643\n\n\n Proceeding under that statute, without first obtaining from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity under paragraph 18 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by Transportation Act 1920,1 the Missouri Pacific Railroad applied to the Arkansas commission for a crossing with an industrial track of a spur of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway at grade, at a point in North Little Rock-the crossing to be constructed at the applicant's expense and in accordance 'with the terms of installation, operation, maintenance and protection of such crossing as may be fixed by' the commission. At the hearing thereon the St. Louis Southwestern appeared in opposition; but it filed no pleading and made no statement as to the ground of its opposition. \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n Both companies are interstate carriers. The record of the proceedings before the Arkansas commission occupies 82 pages of the printed record. But there is in it nothing which indicates that either party had then in mind any question arising under the Interstate Commerce Act. The application to the Arkansas commission alleged that the Missouri Pacific hauls over its extensive system most of the traffic to and from the plant of the Dixie Cotton Oil Mills at North Little Rock; that in order to handle this traffic, cars must now be switched from or to its lines for a distance of 500 feet over tracks of the St. Louis Southwestern; that if the Missouri Pacific were enabled to reach the plant wholly over its own lines, operations would be facilitated; that to this end it had arranged to build to the plant a spur 5,460 feet long; and that to make this connection with its main line the crossing is necessary. At the opening of the hearing, counsel for the Missouri Pacific asked leave to amend the application by alleging that the proposed industrial track would be 'an industrial lead throughout its entire length, for the service of the public generally, and operation and serving of industries that may be located in this new territory'-that is, an industrial track from which switches would lead to new industries that might be located there.\n The St. Louis Southwestern objected to the allowance of the amendment; its objection was sustained by the commission; and its counsel stated that the introduction of any evidence of the purpose to make the track an industrial lead would be objected to. But as the hearing proceeded there was evidence (brought out largely through the cross-examination by the St. Louis Southwestern's counsel) that it was the hope of the Missouri Pacific that the proposed track would ultimately be used as an industrial lead track. The Arkansas commission denied the Missouri Pacific's application to fix the place \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n and manner of the crossing. Why it did so does not appear. It rendered no opinion; and its order stated merely that 'having heard all the evidence' and 'after having made a personal inspection of all the physical properties described in the petition and involved in this proceeding (the commission) is of the opinion that said application should be denied.' A rehearing sought was also denied without opinion or other indication of the reason for the commission's action.\n From the order, and upon the record made before the commission, the Missouri Pacific appealed to the circuit court of Pulaski county. Act of February 15, 1921, No. 124, p. 177,  20; Crawford & Moses' Digest ( Castle's 1927 Supp.),  8417z3. There, the St. Louis Southwestern set up, by requests for findings and rulings, several objections to the granting of the application. Among them, was a request to find that the proposed track of the Missouri Pacific was an extension of its lines into new territory, as distinguished from a spur to an industry; and to rule that, for this reason, the track could not be lawfully built or used without first procuring from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The circuit court refused to make the finding and ruling requested; held that the Missouri Pacific was entitled to the crossing as prayed for; and directed the commission to take action accordingly. The St. Louis Southwestern then appealed to the Supreme Court of Arkansas; and, besides a claim based wholly on the state law, insisted that the Arkansas commission was without power to fix the point and manner of crossing, since no certificate of public convenience and necessity had been secured from the Interstate Commerce Commission. That court, in affirming the judgment, held specifically that the proposed track was a spur located wholly in the state of Arkansas, within the meaning of paragraph 22 \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act,2 and so not subject to the requirement of a certificate from the federal commission. 185 Ark. 824, 49 S.W.(2d) 1054. Because of the decision of that federal question certiorari was granted. \n287 \nU.S. 589\n, 53 S.Ct. 95, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The St. Louis Southwestern asks us to reverse the judgment on the ground that upon the evidence introduced before the Arkansas commission the proposed track should be held to be an extension of the Missouri Pacific's line into new territory, within the meaning of paragraph 18, as applied in Texas Pacific R.R. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263. The Missouri Pacific insists that its right to the crossing cannot be questioned in this proceeding, which is limited to fixing the place and manner of the crossing; that under the state practice its right to a crossing could be challenged only by an independent suit, a bill in equity; that, in any event, the judgment should be affirmed, because, if the character of the proposed track is relevant in this enquiry, the Supreme Court properly held it to be a spur; and that since it is located wholly within the state of Arkansas, the Interstate Commerce Commission had no authority over its construction.\n The Supreme Court of Arkansas (185 Ark. 824, 49 S.W.(2d) 1054, 1055) stated in its opinion the contentions of the St. Louis Southwestern and then proceeded to answer them. The contentions stated were that 'the circuit court erred in directing the commission to fix the point and manner of crossing, because, first, under the statute it has no authority to act until appellee acquires the right of way by condemnation proceedings, \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n and, second, until it obtains a certificate of convenience and necessity for the crossing from the Interstate Commerce Commission.' That court's answers to the contentions were: First, that the right to the crossing exists under the state constitution and that 'the orderly way would be to first fix the place and manner of crossing, and then proceed in the proper tribunal to condemn the land needed to effect the crossing at the place fixed or designated.' Second, that upon the evidence the proposed track, which is located wholly within Arkansas, is a spur; and being so, it was unnecessary to secure the certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission. Thus, the Arkansas court decided the case by determining the character of the proposed track, without expressly passing upon, or so far as appears considering, the question whether that federal issue was relevant in the proceeding under review.\n We think that it was not relevant. If the proposed track is believed to be an extension, the remedy is not by way of defense to an application to fix the place and manner of the crossing. The statute of Arkansas which confers upon the railroad commission exclusive power to determine the place and manner of crossing antedates Transportation Act 1920, which introduced paragraphs 18 to 22 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act. The St. Louis Southwestern does not contend that the law of Arkansas requires denial of the application in the absence of a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission. It contends that the federal law requires the state commission to refrain from fixing the place and manner of crossing unless a certificate for building the proposed track shall have been secured from the Interstate Commerce Commission. There is no basis for such a contention. Transportation Act 1920, which confers upon an interested carrier the right not to be subjected \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n to such new competition unless it is found to be in the public interest, prescribes the remedy for the protection of that right. The remedy prescribed is a proceeding to enjoin. Paragraph 20 of section 1 declares that 'any construction, (or) operation' contrary to the provisions of paragraphs 18, 19 or 20 'may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the commission, any commission or regulating body of the state or states affected, or any party in interest.' That procedure affords an opportunity 'to secure an orderly hearing and proper determination of the matter,' Western Pacific California R.R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 52 S.Ct. 56, 57; and the remedy is 'both affirmative and complete,' Texas Pacific R.R. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 273\n, 46 S.Ct. 263.3 The propriety of \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n requiring resort to the remedy by injunction is illustrated by the proceedings in the case at bar. The question whether the proposed track is a spur or an extension has been decided by the Supreme Court of the state upon a record made before the state commission although, so far as appears, the issue was not raised there and neither that body nor the parties treated it as relevant.\n Confining the St. Louis Southwestern to the remedy prescribed by Transportation Act 1920 does not abridge the protection of its rights. If the proposed track is a spur, the question of the place and manner of the crossing presents a purely local problem to be decided by the state commission under the laws of the state, unless a claim were made that by allowing a crossing at grade the operation of trains in interstate commerce over the spur of the St. Louis Southwestern would be obstructed. The record is barren of any such suggestion. If the proposed track is an extension, the order of the state commission does not impair the right of the St. Louis Southwestern to be free from invasion of its territory unless the extension is in the public interest. The application to the Arkansas commission is not for leave to build the track or for leave to use it; it is solely to have fixed the place, manner, and terms of the crossing. The order of the state commission does not purport to authorize the construction of the track, or its use when constructed. It would seem that a proposed larger use of the track, if an industrial lead and not a spur to a single industry, might well have been deemed relevant to the state commission's determination of the appropriate place and manner of crossing. But its determination of that matter in no way \n\n[289 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n concludes the federal claim of the St. Louis Southwestern here asserted. And postponement of the determination whether the track is a spur or an extension will prejudice no federal right of the St. Louis Southwestern. If the track should be held in the later proceeding to be a spur, obviously the St. Louis Southwestern will have no ground to complain of the order of the state commission. If the track is held to be an extension, that order will not become effective unless the Missouri Pacific should secure a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission. Indeed, the prior determination by the state commission of the place, manner and terms of the crossing may, by making the plan more concrete and definitive, aid the federal commission in reaching an informed judgment on the application. Compare Los Angeles Passenger Terminal Cases, 100 I.C.C. 421, 459.\n For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, as it directed merely that an order be entered fixing the place and manner of the crossing, is not in conflict with the federal law, whether the proposed track is a spur or an extension; and that in passing upon the character of the track, the state court determined a federal question not pertinent to the decision of the case. It was stated at the bar that there is now pending, in the federal court for Arkansas, a suit commenced by the St. Louis Southwestern, under paragraph 20 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, to enjoin construction of the proposed track on the ground that it is an extension. Since the question whether the proposed track is a spur or an extension was not pertinent to the decision of this case in the state courts, and as we necessarily refrain from passing on that question, it follows that neither the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, nor the judgment of this Court, will operate as res judicata on that issue.\n As thus defined the judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No carrier by railroad subject to this chapter shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line of railroad. ...'

BLASIUS(1933)\n\nArgued: October 11, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry H. Peterson, of St. Paul, Minn., and Harold E. Stassen, of South St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. D. L. Grannis, of South St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, George Blasius, is a trader in live stock at the St. Paul Union Stockyards in South St. Paul, Minn. On May 1, 1929, he owned and had in his possession in these yards eleven head of cattle which were assessed for taxation as his personal property, under the general tax law of the state. In this action, brought to collect the tax, Blasius defended upon the ground that the cattle were in course of interstate commerce, and a part of that commerce, and were not subject to state taxation. The Supreme Court of the state, overruling the decision of the trial court, sustained this defense and this Court granted certiorari. 187 Minn. 420, 245 N.W. 612; Id., \n289 \nU.S. 717\n, 53 S.Ct. 656\n\n\n The material facts, as found by the trial court, are these: At the St. Paul Union Stockyards, thousands of head of live stock arrive daily by railroad and truck and are promptly sold and moved. The live stock comes from the state of Minnesota and other states throughout the northwest. The class of live stock which Blasius buys on the market are those that go immediately thereafter into the hands of feeders or growers within and without the state of Minnesota and principally beyond the borders of that state. He has not dealt in live stock for immediate slaughter. Thus, it was the practice of Blasius to go upon the market at the stockyards and buy livestock to meet the requirements of his trade, and in the regular course of his business practically all cattle purchased by him were sold and shipped to nonresidents of the state, \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n although selling and shipping to residents of the state did sometimes occur.\n The eleven head of cattle in question came to the yards from some point outside the state of Minnesota; they had been consigned to commission firms for sale at the South St. Paul market; the consignors 'had no intent to transport said cattle to any other place than South St. Paul, nor did they have any intent that such cattle should be transported to any particular place after their sale'; they were bought by Blasius from the commission merchants on April 30, 1929, and on May 1, 1929, the tax date, they were owned by him and 'had not been entered with any carrier for shipment to any point,' but were being offered for sale on the market; seven of the eleven head were sold on that day to a nonresident purchaser and were immediately shipped by the purchaser to points outside the state of Minnesota; the remaining four head were similarly sold and shipped on the following day. After his purchase Blasius placed the cattle in pens leased by him from the stockyards company; he paid for their feed and water up to the time of resale.\n The court found that Blasius was not 'subject to any discrimination in favor of cattle solely the product of the State of Minnesota'; that the assessment was made at the regular time and in the usual manner for taxation of personal property within the state; that the transportation of the cattle ceased after purchase from the commission men; that the cattle were not held by Blasius for the purpose of promoting their safe or convenient transit but were purchased and held by him because he desired to make a profit at their resale; that they were held at his pleasure and that he would sell to any one, resident or nonresident, who was the highest bidder; that Blasius did not buy the cattle for the purpose of export or shipment to another state; and that after their purchase by him, and until he resold, the cattle were 'at absolute and \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n complete rest in the yards at South St. Paul' and 'were a part of the general mass of cattle in the State and locally owned.' The court also found that the cattle were 'handled by the defendant as a part of the chain of title from the original producer thereof to the final consumer thereof,' and that such handling was 'a necessary factor in the center of chain of commerce from West to the East and South.'\n The dealings at the South St. Paul Stockyards including the transactions of Blasius, as described in these findings, manifestly were so related to a current of commerce among the states as to be subject to the power of regulation vested in the Congress. Applying the cardinal principle that interstate commerce as contemplated by the Constitution 'is not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of business,' this Court said, in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 399 S., 25 S.Ct. 276, 280: 'When cattle are sent for sale from a place in one state, with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase, in another, and when in effect they do so, with only the interruption necessary to find a purchaser at the stock yards, and when this is a typical, constantly recurring course, the current thus existing is a current of commerce among the states, and the purchase of the cattle is a part and incident of such commerce.' In that case, the question was as to the reach of the federal power through the prohibitions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890 (26 Stat. 209 ( 15 USCA  1-7, 15 note)) and these were held to apply to an attempt to monopolize commerce among the states by 'a combination of independent dealers to restrict the competition of their agents when purchasing stock for them in the stock yards.' On the same fundamental principle, the Court sustained the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 159 (7 USCA  181 et seq.)) providing for the supervision by federal authority of the business of commission men and live stock dealers in the great stockyards of the country. Stafford v. \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229.1 It was in deference to these decisions that the state court denied validity to the tax here assailed. 187 Minn. 420, 426, 245 N.W. 612.\n But because there is a flow of interstate commerce which is subject to the regulating power of the Congress, it does not necessarily follow that, in the absence of a conflict with the exercise of that power, a state may not lay a nondiscriminatory tax upon property which, although connected with that flow as a general course of business, has come to rest and has acquired a situs within the state. The distinction was recognized in Stafford v. Wallace, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 525, 526\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229, where the Court cited, as an illustration, the case of Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299, in which such a nondiscriminatory property tax was sustained. And the Court in the Stafford Case quoted from the opinion in the Bacon Case, supra, \n227 \nU.S. 516\n, 33 S.Ct. 299, 303, the following statement of the distinction: 'The question (that is, as to the validity of the state tax), it should be observed, is not with respect to the extent of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, but whether a particular exercise of state power, in view of its nature and operation, must be deemed to be in conflict with this paramount authority.'\n The states may not impose direct burdens upon interstate commerce; that is, they may not regulate or restrain that which from its nature should be under the control of the one authority and be free from restriction save as it is governed in the manner that the national legislature constitutionally ordains. This limitation applies to the exertion of the state's taxing power as well as to any other interference by the state with the essential freedom of in- \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n terstate commerce. Thus, the states cannot tax interstate commerce, either by laying the tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it, or upon the receipts, as such, derived from it. \n2\n Similarly, the states may not tax property in transit in interstate commerce. \n3\n But, by reason of a break in the transit, the property may come to rest within a state and become subject to the power of the state to impose a non-discriminatory property tax. Such an exertion of state power belongs to that class of cases in which, by virtue of the nature and importance of local concerns, the state may act until Congress, if it has paramount authority over the subject, substitutes its own regulation. \n4\n The 'crucial question,' in determining whether the state's taxing power may thus be exerted, is that of 'continuity of transit.' Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, \n279 \nU.S. 95, 101\n, 49 S.Ct. 292, 293.\n If the interstate movement has not begun, the mere fact that such a movement is contemplated does not withdraw the property from the state's power to tax it. Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S.Ct. 475; Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 \nU.S. 82\n, 23 S.Ct. 266. If the interstate movement has begun, it may be regarded as continuing, so as to maintain the immunity of the property from state taxation, despite temporary interruptions due to the necessities of the journey or for the purpose of safety and convenience in the \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n course of the movement. Coe v. Errol, supra; Kelley v. Rhoads, \n188 \nU.S. 1\n, 23 S.Ct. 259; Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 25 A.L.R. 1195. Formalities, such as the forms of billing, and mere changes in the method of transportation, do not affect the continuity of the transit. The question is always one of substance, and in each case it is necessary to consider the particular occasion or purpose of the interruption during which the tax is sought to be levied. Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 25 A.L.R. 1195; Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 31 S.Ct. 279; Texas & N.O.R.R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111\n, 33 S.Ct. 229; Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, supra. The mere power of the owner to divert the shipment already started does not take it out of interstate commerce if it appears 'that the journey has already begun in good faith and temporary interruption of the passage is reasonable and in furtherance of the intended transportation.' Hughes Bros. Co. v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 469, 476\n, 47 S.Ct. 170, 172.\n Where property has come to rest within a state, being held there at the pleasure of the owner, for disposal or use, so that he may dispose of it either within the state, or for shipment elsewhere, as his interest dictates, it is deemed to be a part of the general mass of property within the state and is thus subject to its taxing power. In Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091, 1096, coal mined in Pennsylvania and sent by water to New Orleans to be sold there in the open market was held to have 'come to its place of rest, for final disposal or use,' and to be 'a commodity in the market of New Orleans,' and thus to be subject to taxation under the general laws of the state; although the property might, after arrival, be sold from the vessel on which the transportation was made for the purpose of shipment to a foreign port. As the Court said in Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 376\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 149, 25 A.L.R. 1195, the coal in Brown v. Houston 'was being held for sale to any one who might \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n wish to buy.' A similar case is Pittsburgh & Southern Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 \nU.S. 577\n, 15 S.Ct. 415. In General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S.Ct. 475, 482, the company conducted an oil business at Memphis where it gathered oil from the North and maintained an establishment for its distribution. Part of the oil was deposited in a tank, appropriately marked for distribution in smaller vessels in order to fill orders for oil already sold in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Court held that the first shipment had ended, that the storage of the oil at Memphis for division and distribution to various points was 'for the business purposes and profit of the company,' and that the tank at Memphis had thus become a depot in its oil business for preparing the oil for another interstate journey. This decision followed the principle announced in American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 365. See Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 375\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 25 A.L.R. 1195; Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Standard Oil Co., \n275 \nU.S. 257, 270\n, 48 S.Ct. 107; Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 104, 105\n, 49 S.Ct. 292.\n In Bacon v. Illinois, supra, Bacon, the owner of the grain and the taxpayer, had bought it in the South and had secured the right from the railroads transporting it to remove it to his private grain elevator for the purpose of inspecting, weighing, grading, mixing, etc. He had power to change its ownership, consignee, or destination, or to restore the grain, after the processes above mentioned, to the carrier to be delivered at destination in another state according to his original intention. The Court held that, whatever his intention, the grain was at rest within his complete power of disposition, and was taxable; that 'it was not being actually transported, and it was not held by carriers for transportation'; that the purpose of the withdrawal from the carriers 'did not alter the fact that it had ceased to be transported and had been placed in his hands'; that he had 'the privilege of continuing the \n\n[290 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n transportation under the shipping contracts, but of this he might avail himself or not, as he chose. He might sell the grain in Illinois or forward it, as he saw fit.' What he had done was to establish a 'local facility in Chicago for his own benefit, and while, through its employment, the grain was there at rest, there was no reason why it should not be included with his other property within the state in an assessment for taxation which was made in the usual way, without discrimination.' Id., \n227 \nU.S. 516\n, 33 S.Ct. 299, 303. In Champlain Co. v. Brattleboro, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 375\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 148, 25 A.L. R. 1195, the court thus restated the point of the Bacon Case: 'His storing of the grain was not to facilitate interstate shipment of the grain, or save it from the danger of the journey. ... He made his warehouse a depot for its preparation for further shipment and sale. He had thus suspended the interstate commerce journey and brought the grain within the taxable jurisdiction of the state.' See, also, Susquehanna Coal Co. v. South Amboy, \n228 \nU.S. 665, 669\n, 33 S.Ct. 712, and Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 266\n, 53 S.Ct. 345.\n The case of Blasius is a stronger one for the state tax than that of Bacon. Here the original shipment was not suspended; it was ended. That shipment was to the South St. Paul Stockyards for sale on that market. That transportation had ceased, and the cattle were sold on that market to Blasius, who became absolute owner and was free to deal with them as he liked. He could sell the cattle within the state or for shipment outside the state. He placed them in pens and cared for them awaiting such disposition as he might see fit to make for his own profit. The tax was assessed on the regular tax day while Blasius thus owned and possessed them. The cattle were not held by him for the purpose of promoting their safe or convenient transit. They were not in transit. Their situs was in Minnesota where they had come to rest. There was no federal right to immunity from the tax.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Eureka Pipe Line Co. v.

FISKE(1933)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roy McKittrick, Atty. Gen., and Gilbert Lamb and Powell B. McHaney, Asst. Attys. Gen., of Salisbury, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. G. A. Buder, Jr., of St. Louis, Mo. (Mr. Oscar E. Buder, of St. Louis, Mo., on the brief), for respondents.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an ancillary and supplemental bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States, respondents sought an injunction against the state of Missouri restraining the state from prosecuting certain proceedings in the probate court of the city of St. Louis in relation to the estate of Sophie Franz, deceased. The state appeared specially and moved to dismiss the bill upon the ground, among others, that it was a suit against the state, which had not consented to be sued, in violation of the Eleventh Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The District Judge granted the motion upon that ground. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of dismissal, holding that the Eleventh Amendment was inapplicable, in the view that the ancillary and supplemental bill had been brought to prevent an interference with the jurisdiction of the federal court. 62 F.(2d) 150. The case comes here on certiorari, \n289 \nU.S. 720\n, 53 S.Ct. 696\n\n\n The circumstances are these: By the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz, who died in 1898, his property was left to his \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n wife, Sophie Franz, for life, with remainder to his ten children. The will was probated in the probate court of the city of St. Louis. In 1909 Sophie Franz transferred certain securities, in part belonging to her husband's estate, to trustees to hold during her life. On its creation, the trust embraced shares, belonging to her husband's estate, which had been increased by stock dividends; later, these shares were exchanged for shares of a successor corporation, and these were further increased by stock dividends.\n There has been protracted litigation in relation to this trust and the property held by the trustees. The present suit was brought, in 1924, in the District Court of the United States, by one of the sons of Ehrhardt D. Franz, to determine and quiet his remainder interest and to obtain an accounting and security for his protection. Indispensable parties (owners of other remainder interests) being absent, the original bill was dismissed. Franz v. Buder (C.C.A.) 11 F.(2d) 854, 858. An amended bill was filed and the present respondents, who are children of Ehrhardt D. Franz and not residents of Missouri, were brought in with others. On an ancillary bill, it appearing that the federal court had first acquired jurisdiction over the subject-matter in an action quasi in rem, defendants Sophie Franz and her trustees were enjoined from prosecuting a suit in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis for the determination of the same issues. Franz v. Franz (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 797. The present suit in the federal court then proceeded to decree, in 1927, which, with modifications as to security and costs, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the following year. Buder v. Franz, 27 F.(2d) 101.\n There is a question between the parties here as to the scope of this decree, but we may assume, for the present purpose, that this decree, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the decision under review (62 F.( 2d) 150, pages \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n 151, 153, 154), determined the rights of the present respondents by virtue of their remainders under the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz. The decree, as thus construed, determined that certain shares, with their increase through stock dividends, were corpus of the estate of Ehrhardt D. Franz, and not income, and hence that Sophie Franz had only a life interest. Buder v. Franz (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 101, pages 105, 113, 114.\n Later, in 1930, Sophie Franz died, and her estate is in the course of administration in the probate court of the city of St. Louis. Her executor, in view of the decree of the federal court, did not include the shares above mentioned in his inventory of her estate. Thereupon, in 1931, the state of Missouri procured the issue, on behalf of the state, of a citation in the probate court to compel the executor to inventory these shares as assets of the estate of Sophie Franz. The state of Missouri then moved in the federal court for leave to intervene. The state set forth the issue of the citation in the probate court; that the respondents, and others in interest, were seeking in the federal court to obtain distribution of the shares of stock in question, and that to protect the state's right to inheritance taxes intervention was necessary to oppose that distribution pending the determination of the issues involved in the proceeding in the probate court. The application for intervention was granted.\n The state then filed its intervening petition alleging that the decree of the federal court, while finding the interests in remainder of certain children of Ehrhardt D. Franz, made no finding as to other children, and that the latter, including the present respondents, although remaindermen, had 'prior to the entry of said decree, by diverse acts and by pleadings filed in this cause, extinguished, transferred and assigned their remainder interest to the life tenant, Sophie Franz'; that the stcok in question 'should have been inventoried,' and was subject 'to the assessment and collection of inheritance taxes \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n of the State of Missouri under the terms of the will of Sophie Franz,' and that for these taxes the state had a lien upon this stock. The petition prayed that a portion of the stock should be transferred to the registry of the federal court to be held until the probate court determined whether the stock should have been inventoried by the executor of the estate of Sophie Franz. The present respondents (with others) answered the petition in intervention denying that the decree of the federal court had been limited as alleged and setting up their rights under the decree as res judicata. They asked that the petition be dismissed and that their motions for distribution be sustained.\n Shortly before filing this answer, the present respondents brought their ancillary and supplemental bill of complaint to enjoin the state of Missouri from 'prosecuting further the said citation in the Probate Court' and 'from seeking or obtaining any order, decree, or judgment therein' until the further direction of the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in sustaining the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the bill for this purpose, stated that the extent to which that jurisdiction should be exercised was 'the protection of the jurisdiction and decrees of the trial court;' that it did not extent to matters not involved in the main litigation. 62 F.(2d) 150, page 157.\n First. The first question is whether the state has waived the immunity it now claims. Immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment is a personal privilege which may be waived. Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 448 S., 2 S.Ct. 878; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 273, 284\n, 26 S.Ct. 252. It may be waived by a voluntary proceeding in intervention (Clark v. Barnard, supra) and the question is as to the effect of the state's application to intervene in this suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that it did not \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 25]\n\u00a0\n amount to a waiver, but the respondents press the question in supporting the decree under review.\n While the motion of the state was for leave to intervene as 'a party defendant,' the Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out that by the petition in intervention the state did not seek the determination 'of any rights or title,' that it expressly pleaded 'that such determination will take place in the Probate Court,' and that the only relief asked was that the federal court should not distribute the stock from the trustees to the present respondents, but should 'place it in its registry to abide the result of the determination of the rights of the State by the Probate Court.' The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion that the only purpose and result of the intervention would be to retain the stock within Missouri in a place where it could be made to respond to the tax claims of the state if these claims were upheld. In determining the question presented to it on the appeal, the court was not concerned with the propriety of allowing the intervention for that purpose or with its legal classification as pro interesse suo or otherwise. As only a 'temporary impounding' was sought, which was 'in no sense a matter of right, but rather partakes of grace,' the court concluded that the intervention was too limited in character to constitute a waiver of the immunity given by the amendment, if that immunity would otherwise exist. 62 F.(2d) 150, pages 152, 153. We think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.\n Second. The Eleventh Amendment is an explicit limitation of the judicial power of the United States. 'The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.' However important that power, it cannot extend into the forbidden sphere. Considerations of convenience open no \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 26]\n\u00a0\n avenue of escape from the restriction. The 'entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a state without consent given.' Ex parte State of New York, \n256 \nU.S. 490, 497\n, 41 S.Ct. 588, 589. Such a suit cannot be entertained upon the ground that the controversy arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 10 S.Ct. 504; Palmer v. Ohio, \n248 \nU.S. 32, 34\n, 39 S.Ct. 16; Duhne v. New Jersey, \n251 \nU.S. 311, 313\n, 314 S., 40 S.Ct. 154.\n The ancillary and supplemental bill is brought by the respondents directly against the state of Missouri. It is not a proceeding within the principle that suit may be brought against state officers to restrain an attempt to enforce an unconstitutional enactment. That principle is that the exemption of states from suit does not protect their officers from personal liability to those whose rights they have wrongfully invaded. Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 \nU.S. 204\n, 17 S.Ct. 770; Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537, 543\n, 23 S.Ct. 398; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra; Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 150 et seq., 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764. Here, respondents are proceeding against the state itself to prevent the exercise of its authority to maintain a suit in its own court.\n The proceeding by ancillary and supplemental bill to restrain the state from this exercise of authority is unquestionably a 'suit.' Said Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 407, 408: 'What is a suit? We understand it to be prosecution or pursuit of some claim, demand or request; in law language, it is the prosecution of some demand in a court of justice. ... To commence a suit is to demand something by the institution of process in a court of justice; and to prosecute the suit, is, according to the common acceptation of language, to continue that demand. By a suit commenced by an individual against a state, we should understand process sued out by that individual against \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 27]\n\u00a0\n the state, for the purpose of establishing some claim against it by the judgment of a court; and the prosecution of that suit is its continuance.' The fact that the motive for the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment was to quiet grave apprehensions that were extensively entertained with respect to the prosecution of state debts in the federal courts cannot be regarded, as respondents seem to argue, as restricting the scope of the amendment to suits to obtain money judgments. The terms of the amendment, notwithstanding the chief motive for its adoption, were not so limited. Expressly applying to suits in equity as well as at law, the amendment necessarily embraces demands for the enforcement of equitable rights and the prosecution of equitable remedies when these are asserted and prosecuted by an individual against a state. This conception of the amendment has had abundant illustration. Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 \nU.S. 711, 720\n, 2 S.Ct. 128; Hagood v. Southern, \n117 \nU.S. 52, 67\n, 6 S. Ct. 608; In re Ayers, \n123 \nU.S. 443, 497\n, 8 S.Ct. 164; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 19 S.Ct. 269.\n Respondents' bill asserts a right to maintain their interests as remaindermen under the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz with respect to certain shares of stock against an attempt of the state to lay inheritance taxes on these shares as the property of Sophie Franz, the deceased life tenant. In order to enforce this asserted right, respondents bring their bill to obtain the equitable remedy of injunction against the state. This is not less a suit against the state because the bill is ancillary and supplemental. The state had not been a party to the litigation which resulted in the decree upon which respondents rely. The state has not come into the suit for the purpose of litigating the rights asserted. Respondents are attempting to subject the state, without its consent, to the court's process.\n The question, then, is whether the purpose to protect the jurisdiction of the federal court, and to maintain its \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 28]\n\u00a0\n decree against the proceeding of the state in the state court, removes the suit from the application of the Eleventh Amendment. No warrant is found for such a limitation of its terms. The exercise of the judicial power cannot be protected by judicial action which the Constitution specifically provides is beyond the judicial power. Thus, when it appears that a state is an indispensable party to enable a federal court to grant relief sought by private parties, and the state has not consented to be sued, the court will refuse to take jurisdiction. Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 446, 451\n, 457 S., 3 S.Ct. 292, 609; In re Ayers, supra, 123 U.S. page 489, 8 S.Ct. 164; Christian v. Atlantic & N.C. R. Co., \n133 \nU.S. 233, 244\n, 10 S.Ct. 260; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508, 518\n, 13 S.Ct. 418; South Carolina v. Wesley, \n155 \nU.S. 542, 545\n, 15 S.Ct. 230; Belknap v. Schild, \n161 \nU.S. 10, 20\n, 16 S.Ct. 443. And, if a state, unless it consents, cannot be brought into a suit by original bill, to enable a federal court to acquire jurisdiction, no basis appears for the contention that a state, in the absence of consent, may be sued by means of an ancillary and supplemental bill in order to enforce a decree.\n The fact that a suit in a federal court is in rem, or quasi in rem, furnishes no ground for the issue of process against a nonconsenting state. If the state chooses to come into the court as plaintiff, or to intervene, seeking the enforcement of liens or claims, the state may be permitted to do so, and in that event its rights will receive the same consideration as those of other parties in interest. But, when the state does not come in and withholds its consent, the court has no authority to issue process against the state to compel it to subject itself to the court's judgment, whatever the nature of the suit. See The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 154; The Davis, 10 Wall. 15, 19; Georgia v. Jesup, \n106 \nU.S. 458, 462\n, 1 S.Ct. 363; Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co ., supra, 109 U.S. pate 452, 3 S.Ct. 292, 609; Ex parte State of New York, supra, 256 U.S. pages 497-500, 41 S.Ct. 588. \n\n[290 U.S. 18, 29]\n\u00a0\n We express no opinion upon the question whether the decree of the District Court, entered during the lifetime of Sophie Franz, the life tenant, in this suit to which she, her trustees, and the remaindermen were parties, can be regarded as binding upon the state of Missouri with respect to its subsequent claim for inheritance taxes against the shares in controversy as a part of the life tenant's estate. That question is not before us. Whatever may be found to be the effect of this decree in that relation, the result is the same so far as the present question of the right of respondents to bring this bill against the state is concerned. If the state, by reason of the fact that it was not a party to the litigation, is not bound by the decree, it is manifestly free to litigate its claim to the taxes in the proceeding it has instituted in its own court. United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 222\n, 1 S.Ct. 240; Tindal v. Wesley, supra, 167 U.S. page 223, 17 S.Ct. 770; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 282\n, 30 S.Ct. 501. But, if the decree of the federal court can be considered as determining the ownership of the shares so as to bind the state in later tax proceedings upon the death of the life tenant, and there is a federal right to have that effect given to the decree, that federal right can be specially set up and claimed in the proceeding in the state court, and, if the right is finally denied, the decision may be the subject of review by this Court in case the appropriate procedure is followed. Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33, 46\n, 30 S.Ct. 10. See Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43\n, 28 S.Ct. 1. The contention that the question of ownership of the shares has been finally determined by the federal court affords no ground for the conclusion that the federal court may entertain a suit against the state, without its consent, to prevent the state from seeking to litigate that question in the state court.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the ancillary and supplemental bill.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY v. CITY OF NEW YORK(1933)\nNo. 12\nArgued: November 6, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. Duane E. Minard, of Newark, N.J., and William A. Stevens, of Red Bank, N.J., for the State of New Jersey.\n Messrs. Arthur J. W. Hilly and E. S. Benedict, both of New York City, for defendant.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Leave having been granted, \n279 \nU.S. 823\n, 49 S.Ct. 478, the state of New Jersey, May 20, 1929, filed its bill of complaint against the city of New York and prayed that the city be enjoined from dumping garbage or other noxious, \n\n[290 U.S. 237, 238]\n\u00a0\n offensive, or injurious matter into the ocean or other waters of the United States off the coast of New Jersey and from otherwise polluting its waters and its beaches. Defendant answered, raising issues of fact. The Court appointed Edward K. Campbell special master, \n280 \nU.S. 514\n, 50 S.Ct. 15, who took the evidence and reported the same, together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for a decree.\n He found that defendant had created, and was continuing to create, a public nuisance upon beaches and other property of plaintiff, concluded plaintiff was entitled to relief, and recommended that injunction be granted as prayed, but that defendant should be allowed a reasonable time within which to provide incinerators for the disposal of its garbage and rubbish. After hearing upon exceptions filed by defendant, the Court approved the master's report. As no evidence had been taken to show what time would be required, the master was directed to take evidence upon that subject and report his findings and a form of decree. \n283 \nU.S. 473\n, 51 S. Ct. 519. After evidence had been taken, the parties agreed upon the terms of an injunction and prepared a proposed form of decree, which together with the master's report was filed with the clerk.\n December 7, 1931, the Court entered its decree, in the form of that submitted by the parties. Among other things, it ordered, adjudged, and decreed that on and after June 1, 1933, defendant be enjoined as prayed, and until then defendant utilize existing facilities to reduce dumping to the lowest practicable limit and file reports showing progress of construction and quantities of garbage and rubbish dumped. \n284 \nU.S. 585\n, 52 S.Ct. 120.\n Defendant's reports, filed in April and October, 1932, and April, 1933, show that it failed to take action necessary to cease dumping within the time specified in the decree. May 8, 1933, plaintiff filed its petition that defendant be ordered to show cause why it should not be adjudged in contempt of court. Defendant answered. It represented that, because of lack of financial means, the construction \n\n[290 U.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n of the plants had been unavoidably delayed, and that it was unable, within the time allowed, to complete the plants and to cease dumping. It prayed that April 1, 1934, be fixed as the effective date of the decree.\n The Court ordered these applications to be heard November 6, 1933, and appointed Edward K., Campbell special master to take evidence to show the progress of defendant's work of plant construction up to September 15, 1933, the time reasonably required to enable defendant to comply with the decree, the amounts expended by plaintiff and its political subdivisions subsequent to June 1, 1933, to prevent or lessen defilement or pollution of waters, shores, or beaches within the state and the damages respectively sustained by them as a result of defendant's failure to comply with the decree. The order directed him to make findings thereon. \n289 \nU.S. 712\n, 53 S.Ct. 718\n\n\n October 19, 1933, the special master filed his report showing, and the Court finds: Defendant has two incinerators under construction which, as estimated by its sanitation engineer, will be ready for operation on April 21, and June 30, 1934, respectively. These plants will not be quite adequate for disposal of defendant's garbage and rubbish. Plaintiff's municipal subdivisions expended between June 1 and September 15, 1933, the sum of $2,160.79.\n At the hearing, November 6, 1933, defendant, through its counsel, represented that, by the use of these incinerators and other means to be provided, it would be able fully to comply with the decree on and after July 1, 1934, and it prayed that the decree be modified to take effect on that day. The Court grants the extension prayed, and modifies the decree by changing its effective date, adds provisions for its enforcement, and adjudges defendant liable for the amounts expended by plaintiff's political subdivisions, and that defendant pay costs, the expenses incurred by the master and his compensation. \n\n[290 U.S. 237, 240]\n\u00a0\n Accordingly, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed:\n\n 1. \nOn and after July 1, 1934, the defendant, the city of New York, its employees and agents, and all persons assuming to act under its authority, be, and they are hereby, enjoined from dumping, or procuring or suffering to be dumped, any garbage or refuse, or other noxious, offensive or injurious matter, into the ocean, or waters of the United States, off the coast of New Jersey, and from otherwise defiling or polluting said waters and the shores or beaches thereof or procuring them to be defiled or polluted as aforesaid.\n\n 2. \nIf defendant shall fail to comply with paragraph 1 of this decree by July 1, 1934, it shall pay to plaintiff $5,000 a day until it does so comply; such payments, however, are to be without prejudice to any other relief to which complainant may be found entitled.\n\n 3. \nPlaintiff shall have and recover from defendant the sum of $2,160. 79 for the use and benefit of its political subdivisions above referred to.\n And it is further ordered that the costs, the expenses incurred by the special master, and his compensation, to be fixed by the Court, shall be taxed against the defendant. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WISCONSIN v. STATE OF ILLINOIS(1933)\nNo. 253\nArgued: April 17, 1933Decided: May 22, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Raymond T. Jackson, of Mineral Point, Wis., and Wm. J. Morgan and Ralph M. Hoyt, both of Milwaukee, wis., for complainants State of Wisconsin and others.\n Messrs. Wm. Rothmann and Joseph B. Fleming, both of Chicago, Ill., for defendant Sanitary Dist. of Chicago.\n Mr. Cornelius Lynde, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant State of Illinois.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In October, 1932, complainant states, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, and Michigan, applied for the appointment of a commissioner or special officer to execute the decree of April 21, 1930 (\n281 \nU.S. 696\n, 50 S.Ct. 331) on behalf and at the expense of defendants. The applicants complained of the delay in the construc ion of the works and facilities embraced in the program of the Sanitary District of Chicago for the treatment and disposition of sewage so as to obviate danger to the health of the inhabitants of the district \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n on the reduction, as the decree provides, of the diversion of water from Lake .michigan through the drainage canal. The court directed defendants to show cause why they have not taken appropriate steps to effect compliance with the requirements of the decree.\n After hearing upon the return to the rule, the court appointed Edward F. McClennen as special master to make summary inquiry and to report to the court (1) as to the causes of the delay in obtaining approval by the Secretary of War of the construction of controlling works in the Chicago river and the steps which should now be taken to secure such approval and prompt construction; (2) as to the causes of the delay in providing for the construction of the Southwest Side Treatment Works and the steps which should now be taken for that purpose or, in case of a change in site, for the construction of an adequate substitute; and (3) as to the financial measures on the part of the sanitary district or the state of Illinois which are reasonable and necessary in order to carry out the decree of the court. \n287 \nU.S. 578\n, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. --. The master has proceeded accordingly, and, after full hearing and careful review of the evidence received by him, has submitted his report and recommendations, upon which the parties have been heard.\n The master has found that the causes of the delay in obtaining approval of the construction of controlling works in the Chicago river 'are a total and inexcusable failure of the defendants to make an application to the Secretary of War for such approval,' and that the causes of the delay in providing for the construction of the Southwest Side Treatment Works 'are (1) an inexcusable and planned postponement of the beginning of construction of these Works to January 1, 1935, which left an inadequate time for their completion before December 31, 1938, at the rate of progress expected or to be expected under the methods pursued by the Sanitary District, and \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n (2) the failure to proceed to a difinite decision as to a site and to the acquisition of the site so chosen, and (3) the failure to proceed with reasonable diligence to prepare designs, plans, and specifications for the Works at this site or on the site of the West Side Works.' The evidence taken by the master supports these findings.\n With respect to the steps which should now be taken to secure completion of the works above mentioned, the master finds that, because of its financial situation, the defendant sanitary district is at present powerless to contract 'for the design or for the construction of controlling works, or for the construction in a large way of the Southwest Side Treatment Works.' This is found to be due to the unmarketability of its bonds and its inability to obtain the needed moneys through levy of taxes or assessments. The master finds that 'in the conditions which now exist, there is no reasonable financial measure which the Sanitary District can take, which it is failing to take'; and that 'no way has come to light, whereby this decree can be performed under tolerable conditions, unless the State of Illinois meets its responsibility and provides the money.' The master recommends that the decree be enlarged so as to require the state of Illinois to provide the moneys necessary and to take the appropriate steps to secure the completion of adequate facilities for the treatment and disposition of sewage in order to carry out the decree of this court.\n First. The state of Illinois raises questions as to its relation to this suit and its obligation under the decree. Counsel for the state present the view that the sanitary district is the 'active defendant,' and that, while no objection has been, or is, made to the joining of the state as a party defendant, there has been no determinat on in this suit as to the exact nature and extent of the 'legal liability of the State of Illinois for the acts of the Sanitary District,' and that this court 'should not now assume the \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 400]\n\u00a0\n existence of a legal liability on the part of the State.' This argument is untenable.\n In this controversy between states, the state of Illinois by virtue of its status and authority as a state is the primary and responsible defendant. While the sanitary district is the immediate instrumentality of the wrong found to have been committed against the complainant states by the diversion of water from Lake Michigan, that instrumentality was created and has continuously been maintained by the state of Illinois. Every act of the sanitary district in establishing and continuing the diversion has derived its authority and sanction from the action of the state, and is directly chargeable to the state. The adjudication as to the right of the complainant states to have the diversion reduced as provided in the decree is an adjudication not merely as against the sanitary district but as against the state as the defendant responsible under the Federal Constitution to its sister states for the acts which its creature and agent, the sanitary district, has committed under the state's direction.\n This conclusion would be inevitable even if the drainage canal had been established solely as a project for local benefit, that is, for the sanitation of the area immediately concerned and thus to meet the needs of the inhabitants of the great metropolis within that area. But, while the establishment and use of the drainage canal were primarily, as heretofore found, for the purpose of sanitation, the state did not authorize it with that purpose exclusively in view, but the canal project from its first initiation has been promoted by the state of Illinois to provide a waterway for general state purposes and the advantage of the people of the state at large. The act of the state Legislature of 1836 (Illinois Laws 1834-1837, p. 118), contemplated a canal to insure navigation and to be supplied with water from Lake Michigan and such other sources as the canal commissioner should think proper. \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 401]\n\u00a0\n By the act of 1861 (Illinois Laws 1861, p. 277), the Legislature provided for improvement in the canal and a larger flow of water from Lake Michigan. He menace from the pollution of the Chicago river through the introduction of sewage made it imperative to provide plans for purification, and while a waterway of such dimensions as to furnish ample dilution was regarded as the most economical plan, the advantages to the state of such a waterway as a highway of commerce were also in view. Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 U.S. 367\n, 401-403, 419, 49 S.Ct. 163. When the provision was made in 1889 (Illinois Laws 1889, p. 125) for the creation of sanitary districts to provide for drainage and to improve navigable waterways, the Legislature, by joint resolution (Illinois Laws 1889, p. 376), set forth 'the policy of the state of Illinois to procure the construction of a water-way of the greatest practicable depth and usefulness for navigation from Lake Michigan via the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers, to the Mississippi river.'\n In this suit, the state of Illinois has depended from the beginning upon the ground that diversion was essential with reference not only to the needs of sanitation but also for a continuous waterway from the lake to the Gulf. Wisconsin v. Illinois, supra, \n278 \nU.S. 388, 396\n, 49 S.Ct. 163. But the court found this contention unavailing and that the existing diversion was unlawful. The court found no basis for the argument that the diversion had been authorized by the Congress. Id., pages 416-420 of 278 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 163, 171.\n After a full examination of the facts, and considering the questions presented in all their aspects, the court deemed it to be its duty 'by an appropriate decree to compel the reduction of the diversion to a point where it rests on a legal basis, and th  to restore the navigable capacity of Lake Michigan to its proper level.' Id., page 420 of 278 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 163, 172. The 'restoration of the just rights of the complainants was made gradual rather than immediate in order to avoid so far as might be the possible pestilence and ruin with \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 402]\n\u00a0\n which the defendants have done much to confront themselves.' Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n281 \nU.S. 179, 196\n, 50 S. Ct. 266. The final decree fixed the time and amount of the reduction of the diversion with this object in view. Id. That decree in terms bound the state of Illinois, no less than its creature, the sanitary district. In delivering the opinion of the court, Mr. Justice Holmes summed up the matter by saying: 'It already has been decided that the defendants are doing a wrong to the complainants and that they must stop it. They must find out a way at their peril. We have only to consider what is possible if the State of Illinois devotes all its powers to dealing with an exigency to the magnitude of which it seems not yet to have fully awaked. It can base no defences upon difficulties that it has itself created. If its Constitution stands in the way of prompt action it must amend it or yield to an authority that is paramount to the State.' Id., page 197 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 266, 267.\n Second. The state of Illinois and the sanitary district contend that the provision of the Rivers and Harbors Act of July 3, 1930 (c. 847, 46 Stat. 918, 929) with respect to the Illinois waterway is an exercise of the paramount authority of the Congress and requires modification of the decree. That provision-an enactment made after the decree and in the light of its terms-is as follows:\n'Illinois River, Illinois, in accordance with the report of the Chief of Engineers, submitted in Senate Document Numbered 126, Seventy-first Congress, second session, and subject to the conditions set forth in his report in said document, but the said project shall be so constructed as to require the smallest flow of water with which said project can be practically accomplished, in the development of a commercially useful waterway: Provided, That there is hereby authorized to be appropriated for this project a sum not to exceed $7,500,000: Provided further, That the Water authorized at Lockport, Illinois, by the decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, rendered \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 403]\n\u00a0\n April 21, 1930, and reported in volume 281, United States Reports, in Cases Numbered 7, 11, and 12, Original-October term, 1929, of Wisconsin and others against Illinois, and others, and Michigan against Illinois and others, and New York against Illinois and others, according to the opinion of the court in the cases reported as Wisconsin against Illinois, in volume 281, United States, page 179 (50 S.Ct. 266), is hereby authorized to be used for the navigation of said waterway: Provided further, That as soon as practicable after the Illinois waterway shall have been completed in accordance with this Act, the Secretary of War shall cause a study of the amount of water that will be required as an annual average flow to meet the needs of a commercially useful waterway as defined in said Senate document, and shall, on or before January 31, 1938, report to the Congress the results of such study with his recommendations as to the minimum amount of such flow that will be required annually to meet the needs of such waterway and that will not substantially injure the existing navigation on the Great Lakes to the end that Congress may take such action as it may deem advisable.'\n\n The text of the statute is a complete answer to defendants' contention. So far as the Congress purports to authorize a diversion of water from Lake Michigan for the navigation of the waterway, the authorization is explicitly limited to the amount allowed by the court's decree. The Congress expressly withholds further action until there is opportunity to consider the results of the study which the Secretary of War is required to make. Meanwhile, and that is sufficient for the present purpose, nothing has been determined or enacted in any way conflicting with the terms of the decree. It is urged that the act of Congress discloses an intention to control the extent of the diversion in aid of the waterway. We find in the provision no evidence of any controlling purpose. Intention and future action remain a matter of conjecture. Whatever its \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 404]\n\u00a0\n intention or authority, the Congress has taken no action which affects the operation of the decree, but on the contrary has adopted the amount fixed in the decree as the limit of permitted withdrawal.\n Third. Similar considerations apply to the argument based on the provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act of July 3, 1930,1 and of the pending treaty with Canada as to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Waterway, in relation to compensation works through which, it is urged, the restoration of lake levels may be effected. The reference is to the construction of compensation works in the Niagara and St. Clair rivers. Counsel for Illinois say that 'upon the adoption of this Treaty the appropriation made for the projects authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Bill of 1930, including compensation works, by the War Department Appropriation Bill of 1931, becomes immediately available for carrying out this Treaty requirement,' and that the court should assume that, either under the treaty or under the act of 1930, compensation works with the desired result will be installed. But it is apparent that there is no basis for the suggested assumption. It would be manifestly inappropriate to discuss the provisions of the pending treaty, bearing upon the diversion of water from Lake Michigan, as the treaty is not in effect. And there is no ground for concluding that the compensation works to which reference is made could be installed in the absence of treaty. \n2\n What, if anything, will be done in the establishment of compensation works is undetermined.\n The decisive point is that nothing has been done which affects the operation of the decree and that the obligation of defendants to carry out its terms is in full force. \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 405]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. Resisting the master's recommendations for the enlargement of the decree, so as to insure compliance with its provisions, the state of Illinois contends that the terms of the decree have not yet been vioalted; that the decree is confined to relief through injunction against the continuance of the diversion, beyond specified amounts at stated times. Counsel for the state argue that measures for the protection of the lives and health of its citizens are exclusively within the police power of the state, and that no obligation to exercise that power is imposed upon the state by the Federal Constitution.\n The argument ignores the fact that the question does not concern the ordinary exercise of the police power of the state, but rather concerns the duty of the state to take measures to end the condition which it has urged, and still urges, as a ground for the postponement of the relief to which the complainant states have been found to be entitled. The wrong has been inflicted and is a continuing one. The decision was that this wrong must be stopped. It was not stopped at once merely because of the plight of the residents of Chicago and the adjacent area, in whose interest time was sought to provide works and facilities for sewerage disposal. The court fittingly recognized this exigency. The court directed a careful inquiry in order to ascertain the time necessary to provide adequate protection. The duty to supply that protection was, and is, the duty of the state. The sanitary district, acting under the authority of the state- as its instrumentality-presented its program for the construction of sewage w rks. That program was thoroughly examined and was made the subject of report to the court. After full hearing the court fixed the times and extent of diminution of the diversion in the light of the time found to be necessary for carrying out that program. The reduction of the diversion was graduated accordingly. The decree required reports as to the progress of construction. The \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 406]\n\u00a0\n court retained jurisdiction of the cause, and the decree provided that any of the parties complainants or defendants, might 'apply to the Court for such action or relief, either with respect to the time to be allowed for the construction, or the progress of construction, or the methods of operation, of any of said sewage treatment plants, or with respect to the diversion of water from Lake Michigan, as may be deemed to be appropriate.' \n281 \nU.S. 698\n, 50 S.Ct. 331, 332. The present application of complainants is based upon this provision of the decree and upon the charge that defendants have unwarrantably delayed the installation of the works which they sought an opportunity to supply before the injunction of the diversion should become effective.\n In this aspect of the case, there is no room for the contention that the defendant state, if it were so disposed, by failing to provide protection for its people and by trusting to what it terms 'the same compelling humanitarian necessity which originally induced the Court to postpone the final stoppage of diversion,' could, in effect and according to its pleasure, by reason of the inability of the court to impose specific requirements as to needed measures, delay or prevent the enforcement of the decree. The court did not exhaust its power by the provisions enjoining the diversion according to the times and amounts prescribed. The court omitted further specific requirements, not because of want of power, but in the expectation that the diligence of defendants in carrying out the program they had submitted to the court would give no occasion for such specifications. In deciding this controversy between states, the authority of the court to enjoin the continued perpetration of the wrong inflicted upon complainants, necessarily embraces the authority to require measures to be taken to end conditions, within the control of defendant state, which may stand in the way of the execution of the decree. \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 407]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. We pass from questions of power to the consideration of the requirement that is now reasonable and necessary.\n The master was directed to report, in particular, with respect to the controlling works in the Chicago river and the Southwest Side Treatment Works, as these works appeared to be pivotal in defendants' program. The controlling works were proposed to avoid the danger of the pollution of the water supply of the city of Chicago by reversals of the Chicago river in times of storm. Because of that danger, it was not deemed to be practicable to direct a reduction of the diversion below the initial reduction to an annual average of 6,500 cubic feet per second (required to be made by July 1, 1930) pending the completion of the sewage treatment works and without controlling works. Two years were found to be an adequate time for the installation of controlling works in the river after authorization by the Secretary of War. With this fact in view, the decree provided that, unless good cause were shown to the contrary, the diversion should be reduced to 5,000 cubic feet per second, in addition to domestic pumpage, on and after December 31, 1935. \n281 \nU.S. 198, 696\n, 50 S.Ct. 266, 331, 1123. Not only were these controlling works embraced in defendants' construction program, but they have been set forth as a part of that program in all of the semiannual reports filed by the sanitary district under the decree. Despite this, it appears from the findings of the master that no appropriate application and submission of plans for such works have been made to the Secretary of War, and the master finds this delay t be inexcusable. He finds that it was not due to bad faith and that there was no intention to violate the decree. It is unnecessary to review the circumstances.\n Defendants now assert, upon the conclusions reached by the sanitary district engineers, that controlling works will not be needed so long as the diversion does not fall \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 408]\n\u00a0\n below 5,000 cubic feet per second (the limit fixed for December 31, 1935), and that, if they are needed at a later time, appropriate proceedings for their installation will be taken. Formal representation is made to the court as follows:\n'The Sanitary District is prepared, upon the completion of the intercepting sewers along the main channel of the Chicago River adjacent to Lake Michigan, to accept the reduction to 5,000 c.f.s. without controlling works. Upon this determination by the Sanitary District involving a conclusion on an engineering and sanitation problem which is not challenged by the complaining States, this Court has been relieved of responsibility and the grounds for the apprehension of the former Special Master have been removed. If the provision of the decree, directing a reduction in diversion to 1500 c.f.s. at the end of 1938, is not changed as a result of the study to be made by the Chief of Engineers under the Rivers and Harbors Act of July 3, 1930, and if it appears that controlling works are necessary to keep Lake Michigan free of pollution upon the completion of all sewage treatment projects, with a diversion of 1500 c.f. s., controlling works will be designed and constructed, if the War Department approves, to meet the reduction. Compulsion will be unnecessary.'\n\n The state of Illinois 'joins with and affirms' the contention submitted by the sanitary district with respect to these works, and in its separate brief states that 'the defendants will undoubtedly be prepared under existing circumstances to accept the reduction called for by the original decree to 5,000 c.f.s. at the end of 1935.' In view of these representations, the court does not deem it necessary at this time to enlarge the decree by a special requirement as to controlling works.\n Upon the hearing preceding the entry of the decree, the vast plant known as the Southwest Side Treatment Works \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 409]\n\u00a0\n was considered by all parties to be the critical, or controlling, factor in the sewage treatment program, as it was found to require the longest time to construct. The project involved the acquisition of site, preliminary studies, the designing of the plant, the awarding of contracts and the physical construction. The time necessary for completion was in sharp controversy. The former special master reported to the court that a reasonable time for this purpose, assuming available funds, and thus for carrying out the entire program for sewage treatment, would be nine calendar years from January 1, 1930, that is, until December 31, 1938. On this basis, considering the time allowance to be as liberal as the evidence permitted, the court fixed December 31, 1938, unless good cause were shown to the contrary, for the reduction of the diversion to the final limit stated in the decree. \n281 \nU.S. 198, 199\n, 697 S., 50 S.Ct. 266, 331, 1123. Now it appears that, after more than three years, there has been no definite selection of site and that the contemplated proceedings for the construction of these works have not been taken.\n The master finds that the failure to purchase or condemn a site has not delayed construction because the sanitary district has altered its plans. The sanitary district has brought forward new methods which it asserts to be more economical both for construction and for operation. It appears that, without definite action, it has been virtually decided to place the works wholly on the presently owned site on which other works, known as the West Side Works, are located. The master finds that it is 'only by the exercise of unusual diligence that the time already lost to progress on the Southwest Side Treatment Works can be counteracted and the Works c mpleted before December 31, 1938.' But he also finds that 'they can be completed by that date if the work of design and construction begins at once and is pressed vigorously.' For our present purpose we take this last-mentioned find- \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 410]\n\u00a0\n ing as presenting the controlling fact, and we shall not attempt to review the charges and excuses as to the delay.\n The finding of the master that it is still possible to complete the sewage treatment works, within the time fixed by the decree for the ultimate limit of the diversion, finds support in the statements now submitted by the defendants. On the hearing before the master the sanitary district took the position that 'ample time remains for this construction assuming that funds will be available and 'that a finding that the District will not obtain the necessary funds or will not construct these Works by December 31, 1938, is premature and unwarranted.' And in its present argument before this court the sanitary district states:\n'No delay has occurred which will affect the ultimate completion of the works before the end of 1938, except the delay caused by a lack of money. The evidence does not disclose that there need be any apprehension on the part of this Court as to the diligence it may expect from the Sanitary District. On the contrary, the testimony to which we have referred indicates that this Court may anticipate that the Sanitary District will act with all possible speed in the performance of work necessary to effect compliance with the decree.'\n\n The question, then, comes down to the procuring of the money necessary to effect the prompt completion of the sewage treatment works and the complementary facilities. To provide the needed money is the special responsibility of the state of Illinois. For the present halting of its work the sanitary district is not responsible. It appears to be virtually at the end of its resources. The master states that, due to its financial situation, the sanitary district cannot go forward in any adequate manner with either contracts or construction. We find that the master's conclusion, that there is no way by which the \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 411]\n\u00a0\n decree can be performed under tolerable conditions 'unless the State of Illinois meets its responsibility and provides the money,' is abundantly supported by the record.\n That responsibility the state should meet. Despite existing economic difficulties, the state has adequate resources, and we find it impossible to conclude that the state cannot devise appropriate and adequate financial measures to enable it to afford suitable protection to its people to the end that its obligation to its sister states, as adjudged by this court, shall be properly discharged.\n We do not undertake to prescribe the particular measures to be taken or to specify the works and facilities to be provided. But, in view of the delay that has occurred and the importance of prompt action, and in order that there may be no ground for misapprehension as to the import of the decree or the duty of the defendant state, we think that complainant states are entitled to have the decree enlarged by the addition of the following provision:\n That the state of Illinois is hereby required to take all necessary steps, including whatever authorizations or requirements, or provisions for the raising, appropriation, and application of moneys may be needed in order to cause and secure the completion of adequate sewage treatment or sewage disposal plants and sewers, together with controlling works to prevent reversals of the Chicago river, if such works are necessary, and all other incidental facilities, for the disposition of the sewage of the area embraced within the Sanitary District of Chicago so as to preclude any ground of objection on the part of the state or of any of its municipalities to the reduction of the diversion of the waters of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system or watershed to the extent, and at the times and in the manner, provided in this decree.\n And the state of Illinois i hereby required to file in the office of the clerk of this court, on or before October \n\n[289 U.S. 395, 412]\n\u00a0\n 2, 1933, a report to this court of its action in compliance with this provision.\n The decree will be enlarged accordingly, and, except as thus provided, the application of complainant states is denied. Costs, including the expenses incurred by the special master and his compensation, to be fixed by the court, shall be taxable against defendants. \n281 \nU.S. 200\n, 50 S.Ct. 266.\n It is so ordered.\n Order of Court.

CO.(1933)\nNo. 71\nArgued: November 14, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. C. mcLean, of Tampa, Fla., for Stringfellow.\n Messrs. McKinney Barton and James R. Bussey, both of St. Petersburg, Fla., for Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Guy Stringfellow and two of his minor children who were riding with him in an automobile lost their lives as the result of a collision with a train of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at a right angled level crossing in Dunedin, Fla. His widow instituted five actions in the District Court for Southern Florida, one as widow to recover for the death of her husband; two as widow for the loss of the services of the deceased children; and two as administratrix of the children. The cases were consolidated for trial, and verdicts were directed for the defendant in all of them. Separate judgments were entered. Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in the action for the death of the husband, but reversed and remanded for new trials in the remaining cases. \n\n[290 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n There was conflicting testimony as to the speed of the train and the sounding of warnings of its approach, but verdicts were, nevertheless, directed because the trial judge thought the evidence permitted of no conclusion but that Stringfellow's negligence in driving up to and across the railroad tracks, with the approaching train in full view when he could have stopped and avoided the collision, was the sole proximate cause of the casualties. A majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals, upon a re- examination of the evidence, concurred with the trial court so far as the husband's case was concerned, but found that in the actions brought on account of the children's deaths there was room for a finding by a jury that the negligence of the husband and that of the railroad's employees concurred in bringing about the disaster. The dissenting judge thought the train crew's negligence concurred with Stringfellow's in causing the collision, and therefore all of the cases presented a question for the jury. The widow petitioned for the writ of certiorari in the action for the husband's death, and the company in the cases relating to the children; and the prayers of both were granted.\n The applicable rules are not those of the common law (as to which compare Miller v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n290 \nU.S. 227\n, 54 S.Ct. 172, decided this day), but are declared by the Compiled General Laws of Florida, which are:\n'7051. A railroad company shall be liable for any damage done to persons, live stock or other property, by the running of the locomotives, or cars, or other machinery of such company, or for damage done by any person in the employ and service of such company, unless the company shall make it appear that their agents have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, the presumption in all cases being against the company. \n\n[290 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n'7052. No person shall recover damages from a railroad company for injury to himself or his property, where the same is done by his consent, or is caused by his own negligence. If the complainant and the agents of the company are both at fault, the former may recover, but the damages shall be diminished or increased by the jury in proportion to the amount of default attributable to him.'\n\n\n Under decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida construing and applying these statutes, the railroad may overcome the presumption created by section 7051 and defeat recovery in all the actions by establishing that the injury was caused solely and proximately by the negligence of the husband. This was the unanimous holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and counsel do not dispute its accuracy. Applying this rule, the majority said: 'It is appellee's contention that the presumption of its negligence, which arose under that section (7051), upon proof of the injuries as alleged, was overcome by further proof which disclosed that those injuries were caused solely by the negligence of the injured persons, and that the case presented is not one which calls for the application of the rule prescribed in section 7052 for apportionment of damages, because no fault was attributable to it.' And further: 'A careful and prudent driver of an automobile would not under the circumstances have undertaken to drive over the crossing in front of the approaching train. Notwithstanding section 7052, he could not have recovered for an injury, and so recovery cannot be had on account of his death.'\n As respects the actions brought for the children's deaths, the majority held that the jury should have been allowed to decide whether the negligence of their father concurred with that of the railroad to bring about the injurious result. \n\n[290 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n On its face the opinion is inconsistent, for, under the second clause of section 7052, if the husband's negligence were concurrent with that of the railroad's employees, the plaintiff might recover, although her damages would be diminished by reason of the concurring negligence of the decedent. In order to defeat her, it must be found that his negligence was the sole proximate cause of his death. But, if that be found, it is impossible to understand how the same negligence could be a concurring and proximate cause with the negligence of the train crew in bringing about the deaths of the children. And the converse is true; for, if both concurrently participated in causing the accident, it is impossible to see how the negligence of either could be the sole proximate cause of the result.\n Plainly one of the two holdings is erroneous; but it is not our province to examine the testimony and determine which is correct. This should be done below. The judgments are reversed and the cases remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with instructions to determine whether the evidence justified the direction of verdicts on the ground that the deceased husband's negligence was the sole proximate cause of the collision, or required a submission of that question, and the question of concurrent negligence to the jury; and to enter judgments accordingly.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAIT v. WESTERN MARYLAND R. CO.(1933)\nNo. 842\nArgued: May 12, 1933Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Eugene S. Williams and William C. Purnell, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Between the years 1902 and 1908 the Western Maryland Rail Road Company, a Maryland c rporation, sold and issued at a discount, large amounts of its first mortgage bonds. In foreclosure proceedings under a second mortgage its entire property was sold to a reorganization committee representing second mortgage bondholders, and a new company formed under the name the Western \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n Maryland Railway Company took title to all the assets and operated the railroad. In 1911 the latter issued and sold at a discount additional bonds secured by the first mortgage of the original corporation.\n In 1917 the Western Maryland Railway Company was consolidated, pursuant to Maryland statutes, with some seven subsidiaries. The new corporation so formed, named Western Maryland Railway Company, recognized as its own obligations the outstanding first mortgage bonds issued by its two predecessors. In computing this company's income tax for the years 1918 and 1919 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to allow as a deduction from gross income an amortized proportion of the discount on the sales of bonds by the first and second companies. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the ruling. 1 The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision of the Board. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In returns for 1920, 1921, and 1922 the company neglected to take any deduction for amortization of the bond discount in question. It made timely claim for refund for all three years, and, upon denial, brought a suit for the amount claimed against the petitioner, as collector; and also sued the United States for refund of the alleged overpayment for 1920. Deductions taken on the same ground for 1923, 1924, and 1925 were disallowed by the Commissioner, the resulting deficiencies in tax were paid under protest, claims for refund filed and disallowed, and suit brought against the petitioner as collector. The District Court consolidated the cases and tried them without a jury on an agreed stipulation. That court found that no facts were presented which had not been before the Board of Tax Appeals in the litigation over the 1918 and 1919 taxes, that the parties were concluded by the \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n former decision, and rendered judgment for the respondent,3 which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner seeks a reversal on the merits, asserting that a judgment in a suit concerning income tax for a given year cannot estop either of the parties in a later action touching liability for taxes of another year. He urges further that, if this position is not well taken, he is not concluded by the former judgment because neither the proofs nor the parties are the same as in the prior proceeding.\n\n 1. \nThe scope of the estoppel of a judgment depends upon whether the question arises in a subsequent action between the same parties upon the same claim or demand or upon a different claim or demand. In the former case a judgment upon the merits is an absolute bar to the subsequent action. In the latter the inquiry is whether the point or question to be determined in the later action is the same as that litigated and determined in the original action. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351, 352\n, 353 S.; Southern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 18 S.Ct. 18; United States v. Moser, \n266 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, 45 S.Ct. 66. Since the claim in the first suit concerned taxes for 1918 and 1919 and the demands in the present actions embraced taxes for 1920-1925, the case at bar falls within the second class. The courts below held the lawfulness of the respondent's deduction of amortized discount on the bonds of the predecessor companies was adjudicated in the earlier suit. The petitioner, admitting the question was in issue and decided in respect of the bonds issued by the second company, and denying, for reasons presently to be stated, that this is true as to the bonds of the first company, contends that as to both the decision o the Court of Appeals is erroneous, for the reason that the thing adjudged in a \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n suit for one year's tax cannot affect the rights of the parties in an action for taxes of another year.\n As petitioner says, the scheme of the revenue acts is an imposition of tax for annual periods, and the exaction for one year is distinct from that for any other. But it does not follow that Congress in adopting this system meant to deprive the government and the taxpayer of relief from redundant litigation of the identical question of the statute's application to the taxpayer's status.\n This court has repeatedly applied the doctrine of res judicata in actions concerning state taxes, holding the parties concluded in a suit for one year's tax as to the right or question adjudicated by a former judgment respecting the tax of an earlier year. New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 371\n, 17 S.Ct. 905; Third National Bank of Louisville v. Stone, \n174 \nU.S. 432\n, 19 S.Ct. 759; Baldwin v. Maryland, \n179 \nU.S. 220\n, 21 S.Ct. 105; Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499\n, 24 S.Ct. 154. Compare United States v. Stone & Downer Co., \n274 \nU.S. 225, 230\n, 231 S., 47 S.Ct. 616. The public policy upon which the rule is founded has been said to apply with equal force to the sovereign's demand and the claims of private citizens. Alteration of the law in this respect is a matter for the law making body rather than the courts. New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 398, 399\n, 17 S.Ct. 905. It cannot be supposed that Congress was oblivious of the scope of the doctrine, and in the absence of a clear declaration of such purpose, we will not infer from the annual nature of the exaction an intent to abolish the rule in this class of cases.\n We are not persuaded that the operation of the principle of the thing adjudged in tax cases will, as petitioner insists, produce serious inequalities, or result in great confusion; but any adverse consequence in the administration of the law furnishes no sufficient reason for the abandonment of a rule founded in sound policy, to the enforcement of which suitors are in justice entitled. \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n We cannot agree that the decision in United States v. Stone & Downer Co. requires a reversal of the judgment. The Court of Customs Appeals had from its organization consistently held the rule of res judicata inapplicable to its decisions as to the classification of imported commodities for the imposition of tariff duties. For some years that court's jurisdiction of customs cases was exclusive and final, and its practice, in this respect, had come to be settled. After Congress granted a right of review we were urged to overturn the practice and to apply the doctrine of estoppel by judgment in this class of litigation. The court refused to do so, not only because of the settled practice, but also on account of the unique character of the questions presented under the tariff acts. The ruling was justified by considerations which are absent in tax litigation; and the court mentioned and recognized the authority of the precedents for estoppel by judgment in the latter.\n\n 2. \nIs the question or right here in issue the same as that adjudicated in the former action? The pertinent language of the revenue acts is identical;5 the regulations issued by the Treasury remained unchanged;6 and of course the facts with respect to the sale of the bonds and the successive ownership of the railroad property were the same at the time of both trials. The petitioner suggests, however, that significant facts were stipulated in the present case which were not made to appear in the former proceeding. He shows that in the earlier case the Commissioner inadvertently stipulated that the first company 'may be taken as identical' with the second, \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 626]\n\u00a0\n whereas in the present suit the exact devolution of title from the first to the second through the foreclosure and reorganization is definitely ex ibited by the stipulation of the parties. From this he concludes that the Circuit Court of Appeals might well have reached a different result on the merits, if the former case had been more fully and accurately presented. But the Circuit Court of Appeals has found that all the facts stipulated in the present cause were before it in the former one, and we accept this finding. It holds also that the former decision was based on a view of the law quite as pertinent to the bonds sold by the first company as to those marketed by the second. The petitioner may not escape the effect of the earlier judgment as an estoppel by showing an inadvertent or erroneous concession as to the materiality, bearing or significance of the facts, provided, as is the case here, the facts and the questions presented on those facts were before the court when it rendered its judgment. Compare Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 511 S., 24 S.Ct. 154. The very right now contested arising out of the same facts appearing in this record, was adjudged in the prior proceeding.\n\n 3. \nAs we have seen, the demand for refund of 1918-1919 taxes was against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The present suits are against the United States and the collector. Are the parties the same or in such privity that the claimed estoppel binds them? The petitioner concedes that the former judgment is, so far as identity of parties is concerned, conclusive in the suits in which the United States is now the defendant, since the Commissioner acted in the earlier suit in his official capacity and as representative of the government. This leaves for consideration the question whether the Commissioner and the collector are for purposes of application of the rule of estoppel, to be regarded as different parties. \n\n[289 U.S. 620, 627]\n\u00a0\n In a suit for unlawful exaction the liability of a collector is not official but personal. Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1\n, 42 S.Ct. 1; Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 430\n, 51 S.Ct. 186. And for this reason a judgment in a suit to which he was a party does not conclude the Commissioner or the United States. Bankers Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 53 S.Ct. 150. We think, however, that where a question has been adjudged as between a taxpayer and the government or its official agent, the Commissioner, the collector, being an official inferior in authority, and acting under them, is in such privity with them that he is estopped by the judgment. See Second National Bank of Saginaw v. Woodworth (D.C.) 54 F.(2d) 672; Bertelsen v. White (D.C.) 58 F.(2d) 792.\n\n 4. \nThese views render unnecessary any consideration of the merits of the controversy.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 12 B.T.A. 889. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Western Maryland R.

Co. et al.\n Mr. R. C. Fulbright, of Houston, Tex., for appellees Galveston Chamber of Commerce et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Galveston Commercial Association complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission that carload commodity rates on import, export, and coastwise traffic between a portion of western classification territory and Galveston were unreasonable, and their relationship with those to and from Houston, Texas City, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, Texas, and New Orleans, La., was unduly prejudicial to Galveston. \n1\n The claim of unreason \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 631]\n\u00a0\n ableness was abandoned, as was also the assertion of discrimination in favor of the other Texas ports. The latter intervened and prayed the same relief as might be accorded Galveston in respect of rate relationship with New Orleans. The issue was therefore narrowed to one of prejudice to them and preference of New Orleans. Railroads serving the Texas ports and various shippers and commercial bodies intervened in support of the complaint; interests connected with the port of New Orleans and shippers intervened in opposition.\n The Commission found that export and import rates on fourteen commodities from or to points in Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Southern Kansas, and Louisiana west of the Mississippi river were unduly prejudicial to Galveston and unduly preferential of New Orleans. In all instances where the distance to Galveston is less than the distance to New Orleans by not over one hundred miles it permitted equal rates; but for differences in distance exceeding one hundred miles it prescribed certain named minimum differentials in favor of Galveston. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n On rehearing the prior decision was modified b including the other Texas ports with Galveston in the finding of undue prejudice; substituting a 25 per cent. difference in distance for the 100-mile basis; exempting from the scope of the order rates to or from points on the Texas & Pacific and the Louisiana Railroad & Navigation Company;3 exempting rates on petroleum \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 632]\n\u00a0\n and its products; and making certain other changes not here material. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The proceeding was later reopened for the purpose of deciding whether the Texas & Pacific and the L.R. & N. should continue to be exempted. The Commission reversed its previous finding and included them within its orders. 5 Both carriers filed bills in the District Court to enjoin the enforcement of all the orders except in so far as the second exempted them from the finding of preference and prejudice. The cases were consolidated, and upon final hearing before three judges the bills were dismissed. \n6\n The plaintiffs, Texas & Pacific and L.R. & N., and also the state of Louisiana, the New Orleans traffic bureau, and other interveners appealed.\n The Texas ports are served by some half dozen lines which either themselves or through their connections reach the areas of origin or destination embraced in the Commission's order. Generally speaking, their routes trend north rather than east of Galveston. The Southern Pacific is the only carrier serving both Galveston and New Orleans. Texas is also connected with New Orleans by the Gulf Coast Lines, by the Texas & Pacific, extending east from El Paso through Dallas and Fort Worth to Shreveport, La., and thence southeast to New Orleans, and by the L.R. & N., which connects Eastern Texas and Western Louisiana with that port. Several other lines extend between New Orleans and Western Louisiana, Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma.\n With minor and immaterial exceptions, the carriers serving the Texas ports and New Orleans have for many years equalized the import and export commodity carload rates between the territory embraced in the Commission's orders and Galveston and New Orleans. The gravamen \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 633]\n\u00a0\n of the complaint is that in many instances the distance to New Orleans is so much greater than that to the Texas ports, and the increased haul so important a part of the service rendered, that this factor should be reflected in a fixed differential in rates. The Commission's order prescribing differentials is challenged only in so far as it compels the Texas & Pacific and the L.R. & N. to establish rates to New Orleans higher by the amount of the fixed differentials than those charged between the same interior points and the Texas ports. Inasmuch as the assertion of unreasonableness was withdrawn and the Commission made no finding that the Galveston rates were unreasonable, the prohibitions of section 1 of the act to regulate commerce, as amended, are not involved. \n7\n The evidence failed to show that the rates of the Texas & Pacific and the L.R. & N. on export and import shipments to and from New Orleans were not compensatory. The Commission refused to find that they were so low as to cast a burden on other traffic. There was therefore no basis for an order fixing minimum reasonable rates under section 15(1) of the Act. \n8\n The parties agree that authority for the order must be found in section 3(1), which is:\n'It shall be unlawful for any common carr er ... to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.' 9\n\n The appellants contend that in the circumstances disclosed the ports as such are not localities preferred or \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 634]\n\u00a0\n prejudiced, but that, if they may be so denominated, the Texas & Pacific and the L.R. & N. cannot be held responsible for any undue prejudice to the Texas ports, since they do not reach those ports with their own lines or control the rates to or from them. They also assert that the orders violate article 1,  9, of the Constiution, which prohibits any regulation of commerce giving preference to ports of one state over those of another; are without support in the evidence, and arbitrary.\n The cause has been twice argued; it was first presented at the October term, 1931, and on account of the importance of the questions involved a reargument was ordered and was had at the October term, 1932.10 Statement of certain facts and settled principles will tend to clarify and define the issues presented.\n The traffic with which we are concerned does not move on through bills of lading, but the movement is, nevertheless, from points of origin to a foreign or coastal destination, or vice versa, and is therefore essentially through transportation. Compare Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 309\n, 44 S.Ct. 96. As the Commission said in this case: 'A port is neither the destination nor the origin of traffic passing through it. It levies toll on the traffic, in substantially the same manner as do common carriers, in its charges for the use of its facilities in the transfer of traffic between the rail and water carriers.' \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 635]\n\u00a0\n Although the shipper in the first instance consigns the commodity to the port and a separate contract is made for ocean carriage, the through rate none the less consists of the rail rate to the port, plus the ocean freight, which is the same from all Gulf ports. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The choice of route is determined solely by the rail rates from or to the ports. If these are equalized, the shipper has an option; but, if they are disparate, the route through the port taking the higher rate is necessarily excluded. A very slight differential in the rail rate, in some instances as little as a fraction of a cent per hundred pounds, will divert the traffic through the port so advantaged. The application of a distance scale to the rail rate automatically precludes shipment through the more distant port.\n Long prior to the passage of the act to regulate commerce the railroads, recognizing this situation, and desiring to hold to their own lines the traffic running to ports which they serve, equalized rates through the ports reached by their own lines with those maintained by their rivals to other ports, or established differentials in favor of their own ports in order to retain a portion of the competitive export business. And a carrier serving two ports has for like reason fixed an equal or lower rate to the more distant of the two, solely to meet the competition of rivals who reached it by more direct routes. These practices have not been indulged either to aid or to harm a port as such, but solely to obtain or retain business for the carrier's own line. 12 With the abstract fairness of such ad- \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 636]\n\u00a0\n justment neither the Commission nor the courts have any concern. This is not to say, however, that the rates promulgated are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction. While that body has no control over the ocean rate, it has power to compel a reasonable charge for the rail haul. Compare Armour Packing Co. v. United States (C.C.A.) 153 F. 1, 14 L.R.A.(N. S.) 400; News Syndicate Co. v. New York Central R.R., \n275 \nU.S. 179, 186\n, 187 S., 48 S.Ct. 39.13 As the carriers are in competition for the business, they may, within the zone of reasonableness,14 prescribed by the statute, adjust their rates so as to obtain or retain the desired traffic for their own lines.

Illinois Central R.R., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 522\n, 44 S.Ct. 189.\n The theory of the act is that the carriers in initiating rates may adjust them to competitive conditions, and that such action does not amount to undue discrimination; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197\n, 16 S.Ct. 666. There the charging of rates on import traffic moving from a port on through bills of lading, much lower than those fixed for domestic transportation, was held not to amount as matter of law to discrimination forbidden by section 3. The carrier showed, in justification of the lower rates on import traffic, that, unless these were permitted, water and rail-and-water competition would divert the traffic away from the port of New Orleans and the carrier's lines extending from that \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 637]\n\u00a0\n port. Since that decision it has been recognized that export and import shipments, although not made on through bills, might lawfully be transported at rates below those charged for domestic traffic between the same points. \n15\n The same purpose not to stifle competition justifies relief under section 4 from the prohibition against charging the same or less for a longer than for a shorter haul. Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n145 \nU.S. 263, 276\n, 12 S.Ct. 844; Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Alabama Midland Ry.

And relief under the fourth section has been granted on this ground in respect of export and import rates. Export and Import Rates, 169 I.C.C. 13.\n While the carriers may therefore, meet competition by equalizing rates or maintaining differentials both to interior points and to ports, they may not adjust their rates with the motive of injuring or aiding a shipper, a particular kind of traffic, or a locality, for so to do is to depart from the transportation standard, conformity to which the act contemplates, and substitute others which are prohibited. A tariff published for the purpose of destroying a market or building up one, of diverting traffic from a particular place to the injury of that place, or in aid of some other, is unlawful; and, obviously, what the carrier may not lawfully do, the Commission may not compel.

United States (D.C.) 25 F.(2d) 462, 471.16\n\n 1. \nIn the light of the facts exhibited by the record and the principles underlying the act, are ports, in respect of export, import, and coastwise traffic, localities susceptible of undue preference or prejudice within the meaning of section 3? The purpose of sections 2, 3, and 4 (49 USCA  2-4), as exhibited by committee reports and explained by those in charge of the bill in Congress, was to prevent unjust discrimination resulting from existing practices. Similar commodities were, without reason or excuse, carried at different rates. Shippers similarly situated were put on unequal terms. Producers and consumers at points of origin and destination were prejudiced by unequal treatment in the matter of rates or service. Obviously localities of origin or destination might also be prejudiced by undue discrimination. One of the most prevalent and reprehensible practices at which the act was aimed was the charging of a less or an equal rate for a longer haul upon the same line or route. The act was passed for the protection of those who pay or bear the rates. The standards it establishes are transportation standards, not criteria of general welfare. The word 'localities,' therefore, has its proper office as denoting the origin or destination of traffic and the shipping, producing, and consuming areas affected by rates and practices of carriers. The phrase was, however, not intended to cover a junction, a way station, a gateway, or a port, as respects traffic passing through it.\n Considered as points of origin or destination, any or all of these are localities within the purview of the section. \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 639]\n\u00a0\n All of them may, moreover, though not considered as localities served, be involved in acts of discrimination. The situation here presented furnishes a close analogy to proportional rates or combination rates, and with respect to either of these the charge on shipments through a given gateway or port may discriminate against traffic passing through another so as to deprive a shipper of his right of choice of route through either. \n17\n In such case, however, the discrimination operates upon the shipper, not upon the port. There are through rates, proportional rates, and combination rates, applicable to traffic routed through river crossings and gateways. It seems too plain for argument that the Commission has no authority, upon a showing by a gateway that under an existing tariff too much traffic passes through another, or too little thr ugh it, to readjust the rates and prescribe differentials so as to divert traffic through the complaining gateway. The interests and industries of a gateway are not entitled thus to obtain a benefit reflected from additional traffic which would be diverted by such action of the Commission. We perceive no difference in principle as to export or import traffic routed through ports.\n The legislative history of the act demonstrates that Congress did not intend to forbid the equalization of export or import rates by lines serving several ports in order to meet competition. These rates, it was said, were not to be proportioned to the respective distances between inland origins or destinations and the ports. \n18\n Both \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 640]\n\u00a0\n equalizations and differentials had for some time been maintained in the rates to various Atlantic ports. Congress was aware of this, and had no intention of interfering with the maintenance of these rate adjustments.\n Appellees say, however, that the Commission has always treated ports as localities within the meaning of section 3, and exercised the power to abate discrimination by prescribing differentials in export rates. They add that, though the act has been several times amended, this section has been retained in its original form, and Congress has thus sanctioned the Commission's interpretation. Where a statutory body has assumed a power plainly not granted, no amount of such interpretation is binding upon the courts. Interstate Commerce Comm. v. C., N.O. & T.P. Ry. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 479, 510\n, 17 S.Ct. 896. This we think is the situation here presented, for, as we have said, the word 'localities' is used with reference to places of origin and \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 641]\n\u00a0\n destination; its employment is not intended to permit the Commission, in its discretion, to favor or hamper a community having no such relation to the service of transportation.\n Moreover, we do not find that any such settled construction had been adopted or that Congress intended to sanction it. With few and occasional exceptions the Commission has not until a recent date essayed to prescribe differentials in export rates. Prior to the Hepburn Amendment in 1906 (34 Stat. 584), port differentials were considered in three cases. \n19\n In the first certain carriers applied for leave to equalize their export rates to Boston with those charged to New York. The petitions were dismissed on the ground that the Commission should not authorize what the carriers might lawfully do without permission. In the second, a New York trade association complained that the maintenance of differentials in export rates to Philadelphia and Baltimore voluntarily established by the carriers worked undue prejudice against New York. The Commission found they did not result in undue prejudice; though it treated the ports as localities which would be entitled to relief under a proper showing. In the third case shippers and carriers serving north Atlantic ports submitted to the Commission the question of the fairness of the current differentials, and that body acted merely as an arbitrator and not in its official capacity.\n The legislative history of the Hepburn Amendment discloses a clear intent not to confer power to circumscribe the adjustment of export and import rates by the carriers to meet competition. \n20\n The expressions used disclose \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 642]\n\u00a0\n no thought that the Commission had held the contrary. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Between the dates of the Hepburn Amendment (34 Stat. 584) and the Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456), the Commission had before it two cases relevant to the power to prescribe port differentials. \n22\n In the first the Commission recognized its lack of power to deal with the relationship of the rates. \n23\n In \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 643]\n\u00a0\n the second the complaint was that Astoria was prejudiced by exaction of higher export rates from origin territory than those to Seattle and Tacoma. Though the haul to Astoria was longer, the Commission required equalization. The Commission in this case asserted its authority to deal with export rate relationship solely in the interests of the affected ports. Whether the order made was within the competence of that body or not, the important fact is that it did not prescribe differentials, but in the interest of competition opened the three ports to export shipment on equal terms. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n We think that at the date of the passage of the Transportation Act no such administrative practice had been established as to require the conclusion that in failing to amend section 3 the Congress approved any asserted power to adjust export and import rates in the interests of the ports alone.\n It remains to determine whether since 1920 there has been such a uniform and repeated assertion of this authority as would constrain us to adopt the principle. The instances in which the Commission has considered export and import traffic fall into several classes: First, where shippers' complaints concerning port differentials established by carriers were dismissed,25 or were found justified and prejudice ordered removed;26 secondly, where, on \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 644]\n\u00a0\n shippers' complaint against differentials, equalization of rates was ordered; 27 thirdly, where on complaint by a port differentials voluntarily established by the carriers were altered. \n28\n These are not relevant to the present controversy. In two decisions rendered prior to the instant one the Commission, on complaint of port interests, exercised the supposed power to compel the establishment of differentials as between ports. \n29\n But we are not persuaded these rulings form a body of administrative action sufficient to overthrow the evident purpose of section 3.\n We conclude that ports as such are not localities with respect to export and import traffic routed through them, susceptible of undue preference or prejudice within the intent of the act.\n While the Commission's jurisdiction of port rate relation was fully argued, the appellees seek to support the orders under the power to abate discrimination between persons and shippers. The argument is based upon averments of the complaint as to prejudice of persons at Galveston. There is, however, no allegation that shippers or consignees in the interior are prejudiced or preferred by the equalization of the New Orleans rates with those to the Texas ports, and the Commission made no finding of preference or prejudice of shippers or consignees, or localities of origin and destination. 30 It compared at great \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 645]\n\u00a0\n length the facilities of the ports, their volume of traffic, the relative growth of their export and import business, their respective steamship facilities, and reached the conclusion that, though relative distance is not conclusive and competitive conditions are to be regarded, the Texas ports are entitled to an advantage in rate consequent upon the shorter haul to and fr m the interior territory. The Commission's three reports abound with statements that a differential in favor of the Texas ports will divert traffic running to New Orleans and send it through the Texas ports. Petroleum is one of the commodities as to which complaint was made. There is no transportation difference discoverable in the record between this traffic and that of the other freights affected by the order. But the Commission concluded that New Orleans was not receiving more than its fair share of this business, and that a differential advantage would be of little benefit to the Texas ports by diverting this commodity to them, and therefore refused to make any order respecting the rates on petroleum and its products. 31 It has since, apparently upon similar considerations, refused to prescribe differentials in the rates on blackstrap molasses. \n32\n The actual basis of the decision is, moreover, avowed by the Commission. In the first report it said:\n'We find that the present relationships of the assailed rates on export, import, and coastwise traffic, ... are unduly prejudicial to Galveston and unduly preferential of New Orleans.' 100 I.C.C. 122.\n\n In its second report it stated:\n'We find that the present parity of rates as between the Texas and Louisiana ports ... does not result in substantial injury to the Texas ports in respect of \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 646]\n\u00a0\n petroleum and its products, but does result in substantial injury to and prejudice against the Texas ports in respect of the other commodities considered. ...' 128 I.C.C. 388.\n\n And finally:\n'Upon further consideration we now find ... that the present relationships of the assailed carload rates on export, import, and coastwise traffic ... are, and for the future will be, unduly prejudicial to Galveston and the other Texas ports taking the same rates, and unduly preferential of New Orleans.' 160 I.C.C. 359.\n\n The action of the Commission cannot be justified upon any theory that it was protecting shippers and consignees, who would naturally desire all possible routes for foreign shipment. On the contrary, the orders prohibited a practice born of competition, and not proved to involve a loss of revenue to the appellants. The plain purpose of the orders was to build up the Texas ports by diverting export and import traffic to them. As we have shown, section 3 grants no such power.\n\n 2. \nThe Commission's action is challenged for another and wholly independent reason, which, if sustained, also requires a reversal of the decree. By its second order the Commission excluded the Texas & Pacific and the L.R. & N. from its findings of undue preference and prejudice and exempted them from the requirement as to differentials. The Texas & Pacific had been included by the first order on the theory that it was part of the Missouri Pacific system which served both New Orleans and the Texas ports. Upon rehearing the conclusion was that the line was independently operated. Exemption was thereupon granted both appellants pursuant to a rule which the Commission had consistently followed since its organization: namely, that a carrier may not be held responsible for undue prejudice or preference unless both of the localities affected are upon its lines, or it effectively participates in the rates to both. In the final report these roads were \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 647]\n\u00a0\n denied exemption under the belief that this court had held the principle inapplicable in the circumstances here disclosed. The appe lants insist the rule is a reasonable one, consonant with the purposes of the act, and that our decisions have not narrowed it so as to exclude this case from its scope.\n The line of the Texas & Pacific in Texas is intersected at intervals of about 40 miles by north-and-south lines directly or indirectly serving the Texas ports. The population of these junction points is over ten times as great as that of all other open stations on this appellant's line in Texas, and the greater volume of export and import traffic originates and terminates at the junctions. \n33\n Thus the question is whether the Texas & Pacific may continue to participate in the handling of the traffic moving through the ports to and from points on its own rails, on an equality of rates with competing lines which extend to the Texas ports, or may be forbidden so to do because it is a party with the competing carriers to joint rates from stations on its own line to the Texas ports. The same issue is presented with respect to the L.R. & N. Neither of the appellants controls the rates to the Texas ports, and the Commission so finds. \n34\n Though the Texas port lines can reduce their rates to and from those ports without the concurrence of the New Orleans lines, no reductions can be made in those rates by the New Orleans lines, \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 648]\n\u00a0\n even from or to their local stations, without the concurrence of one or more lines reaching the Texas ports. Clearly the New Orleans carriers have no effective control over the rates between their junction points and the Texas ports. As respects local stations, their participation in joint rates with the lines to Texas ports is required by section 1(4) of the act ( 49 USCA  1(4); but such rates may not be higher than reasonable maxima fixed by national or state authority nor lower than the amount agreed to by their connections to the Texas ports. The appellants insist that their compulsory participation in rates to and from the Texas ports has no legal significance, and the question remains whether they in fact exercise effective control over those rates.\n The classical case of discrimination in rates is presented where a single carrier serving two points approximately equidistant from a common origin on the carrier's line exacts unequal rates for the two hauls. Not only is the prejudice obvious, but equally so the ability of the carrier to abate it by raising the rates to the point enjoying the lower rates, or decreasing those to the point subject to the higher charge. The principle comprehends, as well, instances of joint rates where the same carriers participate in the rates to both points,35 and where the originating (or delivering) carriers are different, but the delivering (or originating) carriers are the same. \n36\n So, too, a carrier may be responsible for preference or prejudice where it participates in one of several through routes between point of origin and the prejudiced destinations, although its own line may reach only one or neither of the latter, St. Louis S.W. Ry. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136\n, 38 S.Ct. 49, for the discrim- \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 649]\n\u00a0\n ination is brought about by the disparity of rates, and the order requiring its abatement necessarily runs against all the carriers parties to them. f one or more of the railroads whose lines make up the through route should refuse, upon an order to equalize rates, to afford one of the others a proper division of the rate, the latter may obtain redress from the Commission under section 15(6) (49 USCA  15(6). Where, however, a carrier whose lines reach, or which controls the rate to, one of the destinations, is a party to a joint rate to the other but cannot make or control the latter rate, or though it were to withdraw as a party thereto, or to cancel the rate, the discrimination would still continue-it cannot be held responsible, nor can any order to remove the prejudice run against it. \n37\n This rule has been consistently applied in respect of export and import rates to the ports. \n38\n The reason for the doctrine is that preference or prejudice can be found only by a comparison of two rates. If these are the rate of one \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 650]\n\u00a0\n carrier to point A and that of another to point B while a relationship of one to the other may be determined, neither the first nor the second carrier alone can be held to have created the relation. Assuming that neither rate is unreasonable, the one carrier cannot be compelled to alter its rate, because the other's is higher or lower for the same service. A carrier or group of carriers must be the common source of the discrimination-must effectively participate in both rates, if an order for correction of the disparity is to run against it or them. Where an order is made under section 3 an alternative must be afforded. \n39\n The offender or offenders may abate the discrimination by raising one rate, lowering the other, or altering both. Compare American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S.Ct. 656; United States v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n266 \nU.S. 191\n, 45 S.Ct. 43; Chicago, I. & L. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287, 292\n, 46 S.Ct. 226; Minneapolis & St. L.R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin U.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 580, 582\n, 46 S.Ct. 402. The situation must be such that the carrier or carriers, if given an option, have an actual alternative.\n The principle has been approved in decisions of this court with respect to practices, Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42\n, 32 S.Ct. 22; Central Railroad of New Jersey v. United States et al., \n257 \nU.S. 247\n, 42 S.Ct. 80, and rates, East Tenn., V. & G. Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n181 \nU.S. 1\n, 21 S.Ct. 516; Penn Refining Co. v. Western N.Y. & P.R.R. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 208, 221\n, 28 S.Ct. 268.\n In the Central Railroad Case it was said [page 259 of 257 U.S., 42 S. Ct. 80, 83]: 'But participation merely in joint rates does not make connecting carriers partners. They can be held jointly and severally responsible for unjust discrimination only if each carrier has participated in some way in that which causes the unjust discrimination, as where a lower joint rate is \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 651]\n\u00a0\n given to one locality than to another similarly situated. (Citing cases.) If this were not so, the legality or illegality of a carrier's practice would depend, not on its own act, but on the acts of its connecting carriers. ... What Congress sought to prevent by that section (3) as originally enacted was not differences between localities in transportation rates, facilities, and privileges, but unjust discrimination between them by the same carrier or carriers.' While this language was used with respect to circumstances differing from those here disclosed, it applies to the situation of appellants, who are by the Commission's order held responsible for what is not and cannot be the result of their own acts-the level of the rates to the Texas ports.\n In the East Tennessee Case the court said (page 18 of 181 U.S., 21 S. Ct. 516, 522):\n'The prohibition of the 3d section, when that section is considered in its proper relation, is directed against unjust discrimination or undue preference arising from the voluntary and wrongful act of the carriers complained of as having given undue preference, and does not relate to acts the result of conditions wholly beyond the control of such carriers.'\n\n The appellees contend, however, and the Commission concluded that in later cases the court has held the principle inapplicable in circumstances so like those here exhibited that it should not control our decision in the instant case. One of these is St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136\n, 38 S.Ct. 49, cited for the proposition that the Commission has power to prevent carriers which participate in rates from blanket territory from discriminating against a particular destination, although one of them does not with its own lines reach such destination, but bills through traffic to it over connecting lines. The order there under review was for the establishment of a reasonable joint rate, or in the alternative new through routes with joint rates, under section 15 of the act, and was held by \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 652]\n\u00a0\n this court to be primarily an order under that section, and not under section 3. The statement with respect to the possibility of unjust discrimination by all the participating carriers, even though the rails of some did not reach the locality prejudiced, is clearly sound, but is beside the point here in issue; for in that case no question as to the control of the rate to both points by any carrier affected by the order was raised or decided.\n Chicago, I. & L. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287\n, 46 S.Ct. 226, 228, is relied upon because of the statement in the opinion that, 'wherever discrimination is, in fact, practiced, an order to remove it may issue, and the order may extend to every carrier who participates in inflicting the injury.' This was said with respect to a mandate to three carriers serving Michigan City, each of which had refused to enter into interchange arrangements with an electric railroad. Their lines did not connect directly with the electric line, but required for interchange the service of an intermediate switching carrier. The order of the Commission was held proper because each defendant railroad was solely responsible for the prejudice resulting from its own refusal to maintain interchange arrangements with the electric line, and for the preference of maintaining such arrangements with other carriers at Michigan City. Each could, without reference to the conduct of any other, correct the unjust discrimination which it individually practiced. The very question here is whether the New Orleans lines in fact control the rates to the Texas ports, and the Commission has answered it in the negative.\n Principal reliance is placed upon United States v. Ilinois Central R. R., and Wyoming Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 515\n, 44 S.Ct. 189. In the first it appeared that the Illinois Central equalized rates on lumber to certain destinations from all its main and branch line points in blanket origin territory, and from points on certain independent short lines within the blanket area, but refused \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 653]\n\u00a0\n to extend similar blanket rates to producing points on the Fernwood & Gulf, an independent short line serving the same area. The Illinois Central's excuse was that it could not afford to shrink its earnings by larger divisions to the Fernwood & Gulf. The complaint before the Commission was against both carriers, and the Commission required that both should abate the unjust discrimination. \n40\n\u00a0\n\n In the second case it was shown that the Burlington published a blanket rate on lumber to destinations on a portion of its main line and to points located on its branch lines, but refused to join in an equal rate to a point on an independent branch line connected with the blanketed portion of the main line. The service to the latter point at the higher combination rate was less than was rendered to points on the Burlington's branch lines. The Commission ordered both carriers to abolish the undue preference and prejudice. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n It will be noted that in the one case the Illinois Central and in the other the Burlington made the one rate and was a party to the other. Not only so, but in each case the trunk line carrier controlled the joint or combination rate to or from the prejudiced locality. Quite clearly the independent line could not equalize that rate with the one in force to the preferred locality without the concurrence of the trunk line. Both railroads joined in the bill to enjoin enforcement of the order in the Illinois Central Case, but only the independent carrier filed the bill in the Burlington Case.\n The appellees insist that, as the orders ran against the independent road as well as the trunk line, and this court refused to set them aside, it necessarily follows that a carrier may be liable for unjust discrimination by virtue of its mere participation in one of the rates whether or \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 654]\n\u00a0\n not it controls that rate. The argument ignores the substance and basis of the decision. The trunk line controlled both rates, and by its action alone could the disparity be corrected. But the short line was a party to one of the rates which created the illegal relation; and was therefore properly joined in the order. Compare Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 47 S.Ct. 222. The fact, however, that the order included the short line is entirely insignificant on the question whether the same carrier in fact controlled both rates and was, in fact, responsible for the undue preference and prejudice. The contention of the short line that it did not participate in the discrimination because it did not join in the lower rates to the preferred locality maintained by the Illinois Central, and could not, therefore, by its own act, remove the discrimination, was properly overruled. As said by the court, that carrier, in joining the Illinois Central in establishing the prejudicial through rate, was as much a party to the discrimination as if it had also joined in the lower rates to the other points alleged to be unduly preferred. If Fernwood & Gulf could not persuade the Illinois Central to join in a new nondiscriminatory rate and accord it a proper division, t had a plain remedy under section 15 of the act. To make the decision a precedent for the instant case, it would have to be found that the New Orleans carriers effectively controlled both the rates to New Orleans and those to the Texas ports. If they did, obviously, an order might run, not only against the New Orleans carriers, but against their connections to the Texas ports, albeit the latter did not control those rates.\n We find nothing in any of the decisions which renders inapplicable the principle upon which the Commission has acted, with the approval of this court, for more than forty years in the administration of section 3, and conclude that the New Orleans lines could not properly be held guilty of unjust discrimination against the Texas ports, in the ab- \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 655]\n\u00a0\n sence of a finding of effective participation in the rates to them.\n\n 3. \nThe conclusions announced render it unnecessary to consider the other questions pressed by the appellants.\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under section 3(1) and section 15(1), of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended by Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 456 (49 USCA  3(1), 15(1), after extensive investigation, has found that the rates of rail carriers on commodities moving in import, export, and coastowise transportation from or to points in Texas, Oklahoma, and Southern Kansas, and in Louisiana west of the Mississippi river were unduly prejudicial to Galveston and other Texas gulf ports and unduly preferential of New Orleans. Its order, framed to restrict, but not to remove entirely, the discrimination, sustained by the District Court of three judges below, is now held void and set aside by this Court. I think that the order is within the competency of the Commission, is supported by the evidence, and should in all respectrs be upheld.\n Stated generally, the discrimination complained of is the maintenance of rates by the rail carriers which give no recognition to the proximity of Galveston and other Texas ports to the interior points involved. The rates thus deprive the Texas ports of the natural advantage of their geographical position over that of a rival port, New Orleans; and, as the commercial advantages of New Orleans exceed those of the Texas ports, the rates result in the diversion of traffic to the former from territory normally tributary to the latter. The Commission found that, although the length of haul from the interior shipping \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 656]\n\u00a0\n points to the Texas ports is less than that to New Orleans, that difference varying from 162 to 213 miles from typical points,1 the carriers have long maintained the same, and in many instances substantially lower rates to New Orleans. In territory nearer to New Orleans than to the Texas ports, the lesser service has, on the other hand, been given recognition by correspondingly lower rates. The Commission has found, and it is not questioned, that transportation costs and conditions throughout the southwest territory are substantially the same; that the rates established by the carriers disregard generally and materially the amounts and costs of service; that the discrimination has deprived, and will continue to deprive, the Texas ports of the natural advantage of their more favorable geographical position, and has resulted, and will continue to result, in building up the port of New Orleans to their detriment and at their expense. The order assailed seeks to curtail this discrimination and the injury which it inflicts. It leaves undisturbed the lower rates in force to New Orleans from points nearer that city than Galveston, and permits parity of rates where the distance to New Orleans does not exceed that to Galveston by more than 25 per cent., but for differences in distance exceeding 25 per cent. it has named minimum differentials under the rates mai tained to New Orleans.\n In holding that the Commission is without power to make the order, the Court does not deny that a discrimination which is produced by charging equal rates for unequal service is prohibited by the statute as much as one resulting from unequal rates for equal service. Compare The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 346\n, 34 S.Ct. 833. Nor does the Court consider material, in this respect, the findings \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 657]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission that the rates to Texas ports and New Orleans are both reasonable to shippers, in that the former are not too high, or the latter so low as to cast a burden on other traffic. For it is not denied that the Commission may remove a discrimination effected by rates which are within the zone of reasonableness if the discrimination is one forbidden by section 3(1) of the act. American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617\n, 37 S.Ct. 656; United States v. Illinois Central Ry. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 524\n, 44 S.Ct. 189. It is not suggested that a discrimination effected by reasonable rates may not result in gross injury to the locality discriminated against; and the opinion does not question the correctness of the findings here that such injury is inflicted on the Texas ports by the prohibited rates. The issue is thus narrowed to two questions, first, whether the acts of Congress giving broad powers to the Commission to remove discriminations resulting in undue or unreasonable prejudice to a 'locality' have conferred any power on the Commission to curtail an unduly prejudicial discrimination against a port, and, second, whether, assuming that the Commission has such power, it may order the removal of the discrimination by the appellant carriers who participate in the discriminatory rates, although their rails reach only New Orleans, and not the Texas ports.\n First. The Court holds that this power is lacking because the locality injured by the discrimination, a port, is neither the origin nor the ultimate destination of the traffic involved, but a gateway through which it passes, albeit it is arrested there pending its transshipment upon a new and independent contract for ocean transportation. It is said that a gateway is not a 'locality' within the meaning of the act because it was never intended that the statute should forbid discrimination against localities which are not points of origin or ultimate destination, however unreasonable and unjust the discrimination may be. \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 658]\n\u00a0\n The words of the statute neither state nor suggest such an exception.\n Section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  3(1) declares:\n That 'it shall be unlawful for any common carrier ... to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, cirporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.'\n Section 15(1), 49 USCA  15(1), gives to the Commission plenary power to remove any such 'unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential' individual or joint rate, by ordering the carrier or carriers to cease and desist from the violation, and by prescribing a just and reasonable individual or joint rate to be observed by the carrier or carriers concerned. On its face the prohibition of any undue and unreasonable prejudice to 'any particular locality,' 'in any respect whatsoever,' soever,' would seem so plainly to include a port as to leave no room for construction. Compare United States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., \n287 \nU.S. 77\n, 53 S. t. 42; Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55\n, 51 S.Ct. 49; Van Camp & Sons v. American Can Co., \n278 \nU.S. 245, 253\n, 49 S.Ct. 112, 60 A.L.R. 1060\n\n\n I can find nothing in the purpose or history of the statute which suggests that it means any less than it says. This Court has often declared that the purpose of the all-embracing language of the statute was to suppress every form of unreasonable discrimination which it was within the power of Congress to condemn. Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 512\n, 51 S.Ct. 505; Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740, 749\n, 750 S., 51 S.Ct. 297; The Shreveport Case, supra, \n234 \nU.S. 356\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671. It has said that discrimination was the principal thing aimed at, and 'the \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 659]\n\u00a0\n purpose of Congress was to cut up by the roots every form of discrimination, favoritism, and inequality.' Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley, supra, \n219 \nU.S. 478\n, 31 S.Ct. 265, 269, 34 L. R.A.(N.S.) 671.\n Statutory language so unambiguous and a purpose so comprehensive do not readily yield to the conclusion that a locality which is a port is not a 'locality' within the meaning of the act. The bare fact that a port is a gateway and not the ultimate destination of the traffic does not support that conclusion, for the commercial interests of a port, always of great magnitude, may suffer the same destruction from discriminatory rates as do shippers or other industrial interests at points of origin or destination. A rate structure which diverts from one port to another a portion of the ocean-borne traffic, which would otherwise naturally pass through the former, sufficient to destroy the business of banks, marine insurance companies, freight forwarders, freight and ship brokers, stevedores, tonnage companies, pilots, dry docks, ship supply and bunker coal merchants, customs brokers, export and import commission houses, centered there, would seem to have an effect upon the commerce and general welfare of the country of precisely the kind which the act was intended to prohibit and the Commission empowered to prevent. So the Commission has concluded in a series of cases dealing with discrimination against ports, going back to the first years of its existence. See New York Produce Exch. v. B. & O.R.R. Co., 7 I.C.C. 612, 658, 660; In re Export and Domestic Rates, 8 I.C.C. 214; In re Differential Rates, 11 I.C.C. 13; Chamber of Commerce of N.Y. v. New York Central & H.R.R. Co., 24 I.C.C. 55; Id., 27 I. C.C. 238; Astoria v. S., P. & S. R. Co., 38 I.C.C. 16; In re Import Rates, 24 I.C.C. 78; New York Harbor Case, 47 I.C.C. 643; Mobile Chamber of Commerce v. Mobile & O.R. Co., 57 I.C.C. 554; Coffee from Galveston, Tex., and other Gulf Ports, 58 I.C.C. 716; Id., 64 I.C.C. 26; Charleston Traffic Bureau v. Ala. \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 660]\n\u00a0\n G.S.R. Co., 89 I.C.C. 501; Maritime Ass'n of Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Ann Arbor R. Co., 95 I.C.C. 539; Oswego v. B. & O. R. Co., 151 I.C.C. 717.\n This administrative practice and construction cannot be dismissed with the observation that where 'a statutory body has assumed a power plainly not granted no amount of such interpretation is binding upon the court,' for the question obviously is whether or not a power was granted which the language of the statute plainly embraces and which certainly was not plainly denied. In determining that question when the meaning of the statute is doubtful on its face, we have often said that administrative construction is of persuasive force, see United States v. Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee R.R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 53 S.Ct. 245; New York, N.H. & H.R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 401\n, 26 S.Ct. 272, particularly where, as here, the statute has been frequently amended and the provision relied upon retained in identical form. Compare Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 147\n, 40 S. Ct. 237. This construction certainly cannot be summarily disregarded in favor of another which departs both from the plain meaning of the words and from the policy which has hitherto been thought to have inspired their use.\n To support such a departure it is said that, as the railroads, before the enactment of the statute, had in some instances attempted to equalize competing ports by setting up a rate structure which did not conform wholly to the carrier service involved, and as Congress, in the Interstate Commerce Act, evinced no intention to prevent competition for business between rail carriers, it could not have intended by this legislation forbidding discrimination prejudicial to localities to forbid discriminations between rival ports, however unreasonable and injurious.\n The port differentials and equalizations maintained prior to the passage of the original act, in order to secure \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 661]\n\u00a0\n a fair distribution of traffic among the Atlantic ports and the carriers serving them, were very different in quality and prejudicial effect upon the localities concerned from the rate structure resulting in the discrimination disclosed here. \n2\n The existence of those equalizations before 1887 and the fact that in some instances since that date they have been regarded as innocuous even by the Commission itself can hardly lend support to the supposition that the statute was not intended to forbid destructive discriminations in that form as well as in any other. The argument seems to be that the statute cannot be deemed to forbid unjust discriminations against ports since, if it did, all rates to competing ports not measured by mileage or carrier service would be forbidden whether unjust or not. With equal plausibility it was argued that, because competition between carriers was an established practice before the enactment of section 3 and is not forbidden by the act, no discrimination induced by carrier competition was forbidden. But that construction was rejected by this Court, Wight v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 512, 517\n, 17 S.Ct. 822; United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., supra; Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, supra, for the same reason that the present construction should be rejected-that, although carrier competition was not destroyed by the Interstate Commerce Act, it was limited by the prohibition of section 3 of those discriminations which, in the light of all the circumstances, are found to be undue or unreasonable. \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 662]\n\u00a0\n The statute does not purport to prohibit all discriminations. It reaches only those against either localities or shippers which result in prejudice which is 'undue or unreasonable.' Cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 43 S.Ct. 583. Hence, in determining whether a discrimination involved in a port equalization is 'undue or unreasonable' competition is a factor which may not be ignored ( see Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Ry., \n168 \nU.S. 144, 170\n, 18 S.Ct. 45), the Commission is not to leave out of account either past history or practical experience, or the effect of the discrimination on the ports concerned. But, even though he exigencies of competition may be entitled to greater consideration in a case of discrimination between ports than in one of discrimination between shippers, the weight which is given to it and to the other relevant facts, in determining whether the discrimination is so unjust as to be forbidden, does not go to the Commission's power but to the propriety of its exercise. United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., supra, 263 U.S., 525, 44 S.Ct. 189; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Ry., supra. That the Commission so conceives its powers and function in considering a rate adjustment equalizing ports is apparent from its statement of the problem in the present case:\n'Such an adjustment necessarily disregards distance and commercial instead of natural advantages control. We have consistently refused to condemn such an adjustment where it is shown to serve the best interests of the public, but where, as here, it builds up one port at the expense of another equally favored by natural advantages from the origin territory here considered, a line must be found beyond which distance may not be disregarded.'\n\n This language of the Commission appears to me to suggest the only reasonable interpretation of the statute consonant with its language, its history, and its background. The statute does not command, or the Commission's order \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 663]\n\u00a0\n direct, that the rates shall be measured exclusively by mileage or carrier service; carrier competition for business passing through gateways or elsewhere is not forbidden, but, when the discrimination goes so far beyond the line of reasonableness as to result in the commercial destruction of a locality, the Commission may declare it 'undue or unreasonable,' and therefore forbidden by the statute, whether aimed at ports or points of shipment or destination. Nothing that this Court has ever said is inconsistent with this conclusion. The legislative history of the statute seems to support, rather than to deny, it.\n Close scrutiny of the legislative history of the original act and of the Hepburn Amendment (34 Stat. 584) fails to disclose any intention to except from the forbidden discriminations against localities, undue or unreasonable discriminations against ports. Senator Cullom, who was in charge of the earlier bill, made no reference to the present question in his explanatory statement,3 cited in the opinion of the \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 664]\n\u00a0\n Court,4 and none is to be found in the House proceedings to which reference is also made. \n5\n Senator Cullom emphasized the fact that the discriminations forbidden included those against localities, and nowhere suggested any exceptions. Mention in the Report of the Senate Committee of the investigation of a committee of the British Parliament and the quotation of its conclusions,6 are without significance here. Those conclusions were not indorsed by the Senate Committee and did not deal with undue discriminations produced by railroad competition. It is true that in the debates in Congress on the Hepburn Amendment it was pointed out in several instances that the bill did not confer on the Commission the general \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 665]\n\u00a0\n power to fix differentials to ports or to any other points,7 but it was also pointed out that 'section 3 of the original act (24 Stat. 380) applies just the same. We have not undertaken to amend, limit, or extend section 3. Whatever is unjust and discriminatory under section 3 is unjust under the provisions of this bill, and such will be prohibited. ...'8 Moreover, the basis for this want of power to fix differentials was not that a port is not a 'locality' within the meaning of section 3, but that differential rates on different roads cannot be fully controlled without the fixing of a minimum rate. \n9\n And it was recognized in the decisions of \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 666]\n\u00a0\n this Court prior to the enactment of Transportation Act 1920, conferring the power to fix minimum rates, that unjust discriminations produced by the relation of rates charged or participated in by the same carrier might be forbidden by the Commission by lowering the higher rate (compare St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 144\n, 38 S.Ct. 49) or by an order which left the carrier free to raise or continue the lower rate; 'the compulsion being that if the low rate is retained, the rate applicable to the locality or article discriminated against must be reduced.' Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 566\n, 39 S.Ct. 375, 378.\n Second. The Court also holds that, even if a port is a 'locality' within the meaning of the statute, and prejudicial discriminations against it are forbidden, still the Commission is without power to order the Texas & Pacific Railroad Company and the Louisiana Railroad & Navigation Com- \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 667]\n\u00a0\n pany to remove the discrimination. Both these lines reach New Orleans with their own rails and both participate in through rates and a full line of joint rates between local and junction points on their own lines and the Texas ports. They thus control the rate to New Orleans and are parties to rates to the Texas ports and to the prejudicial discrimination. Nevertheless, it is said that the Commission is without power to make an order removing the discrimination which does not afford to the carriers an alternative method of removing it, either by lowering the rates to the Texas ports or raising those to New Orleans, and that the present order does not afford such an alternative because of the appellants' inability to control the rates to the Texas ports.\n The Commission may, in directing the removal of a discriminatory rate or practice, not otherwise objection- \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 668]\n\u00a0\n able, allow to the carrier a choice of methods of removing the discrimination by the modification of one rate or practice or the other. By the present order the two carriers are left free to remove the discrimination by raising the New Orleans rate which they control, or by entering into lower joint or through rates with the connecting carriers to the Texas ports-a latitude which may serve the interest of the carriers better than would an order specifically directing them to raise the New Orleans rates. Beyond question these roads can remove the discrimination by raising the New Orleans rates, and it neither appears, nor is it argued, that they cannot remove it by lowering the rates to the Texas ports by agreement with their connecting carriers or, in default of agreement, by reducing their own division and securing a corresponding reduction of the joint rate on application to the Commission under section 15(6), 49 USCA  15(6). See St. Louis Southwestern R.R. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 139, note 2, 38 S.Ct. 49, 50, note 4, 205, note 4; compare United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., supra, \n263 \nU.S. 521\n, 44 S.Ct. 189.\n But the statute does not compel the Commission to afford such an alternative or permit an offending carrier to avoid its salutary provisions merely for the reason that, although participating in both the offending rates, it can with certainty control only one. It is true that in cases arising before the enactment of Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456), by which power was given to the Commission to fix a minimum rate, it could not remove a discrimination by prescribing a minimum rate to one of the competing localities. But it could remove the discrimination by imposing a lower maximum rate, even though a joint rate participated in by the carrier whose rails did not reach the locality discriminated against ( compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, supra) or, as already mentioned, it could leave the carriers free to remove the discrimination by raising one or lowering the other. See American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, supra, \n244 \nU.S. 624\n, 37 S.Ct. 656; United \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 669]\n\u00a0\n States v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., \n266 \nU.S. 191\n, 45 S.Ct. 43. And now that the Commission has power under section 15(1) to fix a minimum rate it may equally command the removal of the discrimination by directing a rate to be raised, just as where the carrier maintains discriminatory practices the Commission may direct the modification of one and not the other, and is not bound to allow the carrier a choice. Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 513\n, 51 S.Ct. 505; New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, \n200 \nU.S. 404\n, 26 S.Ct. 272. The fact that the Commission has given to the carrier an option to remove the discrimination by arrangement with the connecting carriers, through which the traffic reaches the Texas ports, does not afford to the carrier any ground for complaint or impair the power of the Commission to make the order.\n The situation here appears to be identical with that presented to this Court in United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., supra, and in St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, supra. In both cases the carriers' rails reached one of the competing points only through its connections. In the first, the order leaving the carrier free to remove the discrimination by raising one rate or lowering the other, and in the second an order requiring the carrier to remove the discrimination by establishing a lower joint rate with its connections, was upheld by this Court. In St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, this Court said, \n245 \nU.S. 144\n, 38 S.Ct. 49, 52:\n'Carriers insist also that the order is void on the ground, that since their 'rails do not reach Paducah, they cannot be guilty of discrimination against that city.' They, however, bill traffic via Cairo or Memphis through to Paducah in connection with the Illinois Central, thus reaching Paducah, although not on their own rails. And, thereby, they become effective instruments of discrimination. Localities require protection as much from combinations of connecting carriers as from single carriers whose 'rails' \n\n[289 U.S. 627, 670]\n\u00a0\n reach them. Clearly the power of Congress and of the Commission to prevent interstate carriers from practicing discriminating against a particular locality, is not confined to those whose rails enter it.'\n\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The complaint also attacked rates to and from a portion of the state of Illinois and the port of Mobile, Ala. The Commission, however, did not deal with these, and the averments of the complaint in this respect are immaterial to the decision of the case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Galveston Commercial Ass'n v.

It is one of very great importance-interesting, however, as a rule-to certain particular communities rather than to the public at large. It involves conflicts between towns and cities rather than the public generally, and it relates more to the building up of certain local interests of a local nature rather than to the interests of the people of the whole country.' \n[\nFootnote 22\n] Chamber of Commerce of N.Y. v.

The Boston interests join in the contention that the railroads should so adjust their rates as to insure movement of a certain or substantial part of the traffic through those ports. Neither the carriers nor the Commission has any right to undertake to so apportion the traffic between rival ports or cities. ... The Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio have the lawful right to maintain lower rates to and from Baltimore and Philadelphia than they contemporaneously maintain to and from New York. They would probably also have the right to make these rates the same to and from all of those ports if they chose to do so. The Boston lines have an undoubted right to make such rates to and from Boston as their interests demand, subject only to the limitations that the rates must be reasonable. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Compare, however, Galveston Commercial Ass'n v.

Their effect was to preserve rather than to destroy a fair distribution of the traffic from the West to the Atlantic Seaboard. See John B. Daish, Atlantic Port Differentials (1918); Preferential Transportation Rates, Report of the United States Tariff Commission, 1922, p. 279. Cf. Commissioner Prouty, In the Matter of Differential Rates, 11 I.

The section covers two subjects. The first paragraph prohibits the giving of any undue or unreasonable preference to any particular person or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatever, and declares such a preference unlawful. ... This covers in general terms, though by no means so completely, the provision of section 2 as to discriminations against persons, but goes further and includes discriminations against localities or particular descriptions of traffic. The language adopted in this paragraph is substantially that of the English statute on the subject which has been repeatedly construed by the English courts, so that its meaning has already been judicially established. ...' Cong. Rec. 49th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 17, p. 3472. It may not be without significance that the English antecedents of section 3, The Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854 (17 & 18 Vict., c. 31,  2), and the act of 1873, amending it (36 & 37 Vict., c. 48,  11), failed to include preference of localities.\n See, also, Senator Cullom's final answer to Senator Hoar's question whether the effect of section 4 of the proposed act, prohibiting the charging of more for a shorter than a longer distance over the same line under substantially similar conditions, would not eliminate port differentials, then in existence, favoring Boston: '... If we are going to regulate these corporations at all, if we are going to stop unjust discriminations and the secret rebates by which towns are built up and towns are destroyed, by which individuals are destroyed and individuals are built up, we must have something in the bill which will mean something, or else we might as well lay the bill on the table and go at other business.' Cong., Rec., 49th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 15, pp. 485, 486. Compare his statement in discussing the conference report: 'It has been said over and over again here that the railroad companies would build up one man and crush another; that their policy has been to destroy one locality or city and build up another. Here we have undertaken to so regulate them as to prevent them from doing those things so far as we can do so.' Cong. Rec. 49th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 18, p. 660. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See the opinion of the Court, note 18. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Cong.

Compare the Committee's statement of the fundamental theory and purpose of the bill (p. 215): 'The provisions of the bill are based upon the theory that the paramount evil chargeable against the operation of the transportation systems of the United States as now conducted is unjust discrimination between persons, places, commodities, or particular descriptions of traffic. The underlying purpose and aim of the measure is the prevention of these discriminations. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Corg. Rec., 59th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 40, pp. 1788, 2084-5, 2247, 2248, 3792, 6683. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] For the full quotation, see note 9, infra. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Compare the statement of Mr. Stevens, a member of the House Commitee: 'My people are just as much interested that there should not be any undue control of differential rates. ... But it is just as clear to us and to the whole committee that there is no such power in this bill . ... The situation presented by the bill and the reasons why differentials are not covered are very sim le. Under this bill the Commission would have authority to fix what, in its judgment, would be a just, reasonable, and fairly remunerative rate or rates as the maximum to be charged. It would have no authority to fix an absolute rate, which must be observed by the carrier, and no authority to fix a minimum rate, below which the carrier cannot go; and a preferential can not be controlled without there is authority to control absolutely both legs of the differential. In this case the Commission cannot control either. It must fix a rate which shall be just and reasonable and fairly remunerative as the maximum to be charged. This leaves the carrier to charge anything it pleases below the maximum. And since there is no power to fix any absolute rate and no minimum rate, there is no power in the Commission to control the relation of rates, and so no power to control the differential.' Mr. Olmsted then asked whether 'under this bill the railroads may make as many unjust discriminations as they please and the Commission would be powerless to correct them.' Mr. Stevens answered: 'Oh, no; ... Section 3 of the original act applies just the same. We have not undertaken to amend, limit, or extend section 3. Whatever is unjust and discriminatory under section 3 is unjust under the provisions of this bill, and such will be prohibited; but we will not allow the making of a minimum or absolute rate, which is the only adequate way of controlling a differential.' Cong. Rec., vol. 40, p. 2085. It does not appear that Mr. Mann's statement (Cong. Rec., vol. 40, p. 2247) quoted by the Court (note 20) was intended to have any different meaning. Indeed, his reference to ports and to 'cities' would seem to indicate that he did not believe that ports were in any different position with reference to differentials than points of origin or destination. See, also, Cong. Rec., vol. 40, p. 3792, and compare the remarks of Senator Lodge, Cong. Rec., vol. 40, p. 4111, which indicate, if anything, his belief that the differentials between Boston and other Atlantic ports were within the control of the Commission. \n It was also pointed out that relative rates on different roads were not within the control of the Commission. In discussing differentials, Senator Raynor pointed out that the provisions of the bill 'are limited to discriminations upon the same roads. The words 'unjustly discriminatory' or 'unduly preferential' or 'prejudicial' apply to rates and regulations and practices upon the same road, because there can be no such thing as an unjust discrimination or an undue preference between different roads supplying different territory and terminating at different points. ... If one road charges an unreasonable rate or a discriminating rate, that would surely not justify the Commission's adjusting the rate between this road and some other road that has no connection with it by law or privity of contract. ...' Cong. Rec., vol. 40, p. 6683. Read in the light of this statement, there is nothing to support the conclusion of the Court in the other statement of Senator Raynor referred to in the opinion (note 20) that there is no 'power whatever in the Commission to adjust relative rates and strike the proper proportions between them. The ports of the United States, therefore, are not within the jurisdiction of the Hepburn Act. If there is a differential between different ports upon different lines of railroads, there is no provision in this measure that invests the Commission with the right to change it. It has a perfect right, of course, where discrimination exists upon the same line, as if a rate to an inland point compared with a rate to a terminal point is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, to prescribe a maximum rate; but it has no right to bring competitive roads struggling for competitive markets within its jurisdiction, and I deny in its entirety the proposition that the Commission could by any exercise of its power, direct or inferential, take away from any railroad its right to charge its own rates, unless the rate is unreasonable or u duly preferential or discriminatory upon its own line.'

Roger Englar, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Chauncey I. Clark, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[288 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in admiralty brought by petitioner in the Southern district of New York against the tug Talisman, of which respondent is the owner and claimant, to recover damages to carfloat No. 37 belonging to petitioner. The case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts.\n Petitioner and respondent were common carriers engaged in interstate commerce. The damages resulted from a collision October 29, 1926, between petitioner's carfloat No. 58 while in tow of the Talisman and carfloat No. 37 which was moored in a carfloat bridge of respondent's terminal at Long Island City. The collision was occasioned solely by the negligence of the Talisman and those in charge of her. Respondent received No. 37 at the terminal named in connection with the transportation in interstate commerce of freight cars and freight. Petitioner had received by registered mail from respondent a notice dated July 31, 1920: 'We beg to inform you that it has become necessary to cease being responsible for vessels lying at our terminals, Long Island City and Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. On and after September 1, 1920, the following conditions will apply to all floating equipment lying at Long Island Railroad Company terminals, Long Island City and Bay Ridge, Brooklyn: All vessels, floats, craft or any kind of floating equipment, lying at the Long Island Railroad terminals, Long Island City or Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, are at the risk of the vessel, float or craft. This company will not be responsible for any damage received by said floating equipment while lying at the above mentioned terminals, whether said damage arises through the negligence of this company and\/or its employees, or through other causes. This notice applies to all floats whether in charge of a floatman or not, while lying moored at the Long \n\n[288 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n Island Railroad Company terminals, Long Island City or Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.'\n Petitioner had made no reply to the notice.\n The district court held respondent liable. The Talisman, 52 F.(2d) 691. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The Car Float No. 37, 57 F.(2d) 144.\n Petitioner and respondent were connecting carriers. As such, each in the discharge of its duties to the public, owed to shippers of freight in its possession destined to points on or routed over the railway of the other the duty to deliver to the connecting line for further transportation; and each was correspondingly bound to receive and carry.

Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287, 296\n, 21 S.Ct. 115; Atchison, T. & S.F. Railroad v. D . & N.O. Railroad, supra. The Interstate Commerce Act empowered the commission to require such connections. Alabama Ry. v. Jackson Ry., \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S.Ct. 535.\n And section 3(3) of the act (49 USCA  3(3), provides that all carriers shall, according to their respective powers, 'afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines.' Respondent's terminal and carfloat bridge constituted the place and means long used for such interchange. It is not suggested that at the time of the collision, petitioner's carfloat was not where respondent intended to have it brought or that petitioner could have selected any other place or means. It was not free elsewhere to tender the traffic. In view of the \n\n[288 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n duty put upon respondent by the policy of the law, it was bound to exercise reasonable care for the safety of petitioner's carfloat while engaged in delivering and receiving traffic. Bennett v. Railroad Co., \n102 U.S. 577\n; Woodruff v. Painter & Eldridge, 150 Pa. 91, 96, 24 A. 621, 16 L.R.A. 451, 30 Am.St.Rep. 786.\n But respondent insists that, if dissatisfied with the terms of the notice it sent, petitioner's remedy was to appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission for relief under paragraph (4) of section 3 of the act ( 49 USCA  3(4). That position is not tenable. The place and bridge furnished by respondent for interchange are not terminal facilities within the intention of that paragraph. The expression 'terminal facilities, including main-line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminal, of any carrier' does not include mere interchange facilities. Petitioner's use of respondent's property involved no taking requiring the ascertainment of just compensation as provided in that paragraph. Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 368\n, 35 S.Ct. 370. Moreover, the requirement in paragraph (3) that carriers shall furnish 'equal' facilities for interchange negatives the suggestion that paragraph (4) applies.\n For the better discharge of their duties, these public servants were required by the act to co-operate in effecting interchange of traffic. Respondent could not by its own act relieve itself of any duty imposed upon it by law or arising out of the nature of its undertaking in respect of the required interchange. It was powerless by mere announcement to fix the terms on which it would participate with petitioner and other connecting carriers in effecting such interchange. It cites Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., \n287 \nU.S. 291\n, 53 S.Ct. 135. But the towage company was not bound to render the service there involved and was not a common carrier or liable as such. That case, and the cases cited which arose under contracts for towage, plaintly have no application to the question under consideration. Here \n\n[288 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n the respondent's duty to petitioner arose out of the law governing its occupation. Petitioner made no reply to the notice sent it by respondent. In view of the character of respondent's duties, no contract can be implied from petitioner's silence. That quite as reasonably may be deemed to imply, if any implication is to be drawn, that petitioner intended to stand on its rights and not to surrender them. And, as respondent was not in position to dictate terms, petitioner was under no obligation to repudiate those proposed or to reply in any manner to the notice. New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v.

AETNA CASUALTY & SURETY CO.(1933)\nNo. 13\nArgued: October 12, 1933Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David L. Ullman and Joseph J. Brown, both of Philadelphia, Pa ., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph W. Henderson, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On October 13, 1927, petitioner conveyed to a building company a tract of real estate consisting of fifty-two lots, with the result that the building company became indebted to petitioner in the sum of $28,000, being part of the purchase price. The building company, in order to finance its operations, borrowed sums of money from two different corporations, to one of which it gave a first mortgage upon the real estate, and to the other a second mortgage. The building company then gave to petitioner its note for $28,000, and assigned as collateral security there- \n\n[290 U.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n for its equity in the second mortgage. Petitioner accepted this security- in effect a third mortgage-upon the representation and warranty of the building company that a building and certain improvements would be erected, in accordance with plans and specifications, upon each of the fifty-two lots. The performance of this obligation was guaranteed by a bond in the sum of $220,000, executed by respondent, conditioned, among other things, to become void if within ten months from the date thereof, October 13, 1927, each of the fifty-two lots should be fully improved with a building, together with certain other improvements, in keeping with, and as shown by, the plans, specifications, etc.; otherwise to remain in full force and effect. The property is located in Pennsylvania, and the contract and the obligations of the bond were to be performed within that state.\n Suit was brought in a Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover damages for a breach of the bond. A jury was waived; and after a hearing, the trial judge found that on August 13, 1928, the date fixed for the completion of the buildings and improvements, twenty-four of the houses had been completed and twenty-eight had not been fully completed. The value of the lots with the twenty-eight uncompleted houses, as of the date last mentioned, was $6,700 each, an amount slightly in excess of the sum of petitioner's mortgage on each and of all prior liens. Completed, they would, on that date, have been worth $7,950 each. It is not disputed that at the time of the breach of the bond petitioner, under the terms of the mortgages, was powerless to protect itself by foreclosure; and the court found that thereafter the value of real estate generally and in the locality, had steadily declined. On January 25, 1930, the first mortgage was foreclosed and the property bought in for the sum of $50, thus wiping out the second mortgage and the equity of petitioner therein. Petitioner has \n\n[290 U.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n received on account of the indebtedness of $28,000 the sum of $13,026.02 only, leaving $14,973.98 still owing on the principal.\n Upon these facts the trial court held that while the owner of property, in case of a default after partial performance of a building contract, would be entitled to recover from the surety the diffirence between the value of the property with the uncompleted buildings and its value with the buildings completed, the rule is otherwise in the case of a mortgagee-obligee. Following this view, that court concluded that the measure of damages in the instant case 'is so much of the difference between the value of the property as of August 13, 1928, with the houses uncompleted, and the value it would have had on that date had the houses been completed as would have been necessary to pay the plaintiff's mortgage debt as well as all prior liens. Since the value of the property as of August 13, 1928, was more than the sum of the plaintiff's mortgage and prior liens, the plaintiff is not entitled to any substantial damages.' The court, therefore, awarded nominal damages only. (D.C.) 49 F. (2d) 769. This judgment the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 62 F.(2d) 487, 488. With that conclusion we are unable to agree.\n It is very clear that the settled rule in Pennsylvania is to the contrary. In Purdy v. Massey, 306 Pa. 288, 159 A. 545, where prior cases are deviewed, the court held that where there is an absolute undertaking to erect and complete a building, the surety in case of default is bound to take the place of the principal and erect the building, and the cost of doing that which should have been done is the measure of damages for which the surety is liable, not exceeding the amount of the bond. There the owner of a first purchase money mortgage had subordinated per security to another mortgage in consideration of the giving of a bond in all substantial respects like the one here under consideration. The building provided for was not \n\n[290 U.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n erected, and the mortgagee brought suit against the surety on the bond. The court held that the bond was one of guaranty and awarded as damages the full cost of completion, such cost not exceeding the amount due on the mortgage. The applicable rule is thus stated (page 295 of 306 Pa., 159 A. 545, 547): 'In fixing compensation for damage resulting from breach of a contract, the general rule is that the injured party should be placed in the same position as if there had been no breach. The object of the law is to place such party in as good position as if the contract had been kept. In the instant case, the bond guaranteed the completion of the building; if there had not been a breach of the obligation of the bond, the building would have been erected. Since this was not done, the plaintiff can only be put in as good position as if the contract had been carried out by giving her the cost of construction, not exceeding, of course, the amount of the bond. The measure of damage on a bond guaranteeing completion is the cost of completion. ... And in a case such as this, where the work was never begun, this cost will be the whole cost of construction.'\n See, also, Mechanics' Trust Co. v. Fid. & Cas. Co., 304 Pa. 526, 533, et seq., 156 A. 146. A like rule obtains in other states. United Real Estate Co. v. McDonald, 140 Mo. 605, 612, 41 S.W. 913; Kidd v. McCormick, 83 N.Y. 391. Compare Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wall. 94, 99.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Pennsylvania decisions merely declared the common law of that state with regard to suretyship, and, since that law is derived from the principles of general jurisprudence common to all the states, a federal court in determining what it is might exercise an independent judgment. We do not deem it necessary to discuss the principle enunciated or to decide whether the Pennsylvania decisions come within it. It is enough to say that even where the principle applies, 'for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the federal \n\n[290 U.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.'

Maryland Casualty Co. (C.C.A.) 8 F.(2d) 678, 680. In the present case it would not be going far enough to say merely that the question is 'balanced with doubt,' for it seems to us that the Pennsylvania decisions, and those of the other states cited above, are plainly right. Compare Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 32 S.Ct. 739\n\n\n The petitioner here, not being willing to accept a third mortgage on the unimproved land to secure its debt, required the added security which would be afforded by completed improvements. These improvements the building company agreed to make within a definitely fixed time, and for the performance of that undertaking respondent, for a valuable consideration, stood sponsor. Plainly the obligation of the bond was one of guaranty and not indemnity, and could be fulfilled only by the erection of the buildings or payment of the penalty in case of default. It is no answer to say that the value of the property immediately after the default exceeded the sum of the mortgage together with all prior liens. Petitioner was then without remedy against the property because its mortgage was not in default. It was, therefore, obliged to sit by and await the action of others over which it had no control. In the meantime, the uncompleted buildings necessarily lay unrented, subject to expense in the way of taxes, insurance, accumulating interest, etc., deteriorating in quality and steadily declining in value. Petitioner is entitled to be put in as good position in respect of its debt as it would have occupied if the buildings had been completed in accordance with the terms of the undertaking; and this can be done here only by giving it the amount of the difference between the \n\n[290 U.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n value of the unfinished buildings and their value as it would have been if completed in accordance with the agreement-see Kidd v. McCormick, supra, 83 N.Y. page 398-but exceeding neither the amount due on its debt nor the amount of the bond.\n It appears from the findings that this difference would be about $26, 000, while the amount now due petitioner is $14,973.98, together with interest thereon from August 13, 1928. It follows that the judgments of the courts below must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to enter judgment for the last named sum.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRANSIT COMMISSION v. UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 535\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George H. Stover, of New York City, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General andMr. John Lord O'Brian, of Washington, D.C., for appellees the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Alfred A. Gardner, of New York City, for appellees Pennsylvania R. Co. and Long Island R. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Each appellant sued the United States and the railroad companies to set aside an order made by the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  1(18). The commission intervened. The order certifies that the present and future public convenience and necessity require that upon terms specified the Long Island continue to operate over tracks, and to share in the use of other facilities, of the Pennsylvania Tunnel and Terminal Railroad Company. Appellants applied for a temporary injunction, the cases were consolidated, the evidence before the commission was introduced and, the cases having been submitted on such application and upon the merits, the court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law and entered a decree that the preliminary injunction be denied and that the bills be dismissed. 1 F. Supp. 595. \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n Appellants contend that the use by the Long Island of the terminal company's tracks and facilities is not within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission but is governed by section 148 of the New York Railroad Law (Consol. Laws, N.Y. c. 49). That section provides that subject to the permission and approval of the public service commission ( the transit commission is its successor) any corporation owning or operating a railroad route may contract with any other such corporation for the use of their respective roads. And appellants maintain that the Interstate Commerce Commission was not authorized to issue the certificate; that section 1(18) does not apply to railroad operation under trackage rights; that, if it does, it is not retroactive and does not apply to a use which began before the enactment; and that the commission is without power, to the exclusion of the state authorities, to pass on or prescribe the terms and conditions of the agreement made by the carriers to govern such operation.\n The Pennsylvania railway station and yards in midtown Manhattan constitute the eastern terminus of that system. In addition to such station and yards the terminal properties include four single-track tunnels extending easterly under the city and East River, the Sunnyside yards in Queens, and connecting lines. The Long Island Railroad connects with that yard. The legal title of the terminal properties is in the terminal company. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company is its lessee and owns all its stock, and practically all that of the Long Island.\n The station was opened for use in 1910 and in September of that year the Long Island commenced to operate its trains over the terminal lines of railroad through the tunnels to and from the station and yards in Manhattan. This operation was pursuant to an agreement made by the carriers for which they obtained the approval of the first district state public service commission. The rental payable by the Long Island was, in \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n 1920 and again in 1922, increased with the approval of the public service commission and, after 1921, of its successor, the transit commission. In 1923 the carriers sought approval of an amendment of the agreement that would involve a further increase. The application was denied. In March, 1925, the carriers submitted another agreement. After modification to lessen the proposed rental, the transit commission, July 28, 1925, approved. In November the carriers made application for approval of a higher charge. In December the commission disallowed it but granted extension to January 1, 1927, of the agreement which it had approved July 28, 1925\n\n\n In 1929 the carriers, invoking section 1(18), applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the Long Island to continue operation at the rental rejected by the transit commission in December, 1925. The Interstate Commerce Commission held that it had jurisdiction, but denied the application without prejudice upon the ground that the agreement imposed unreasonable terms on the Long Island. 162 I.C.C. 218. December 27, 1930, the carriers submitted a proposed agreement somewhat more favorable to the Long Island. February 8, 1932, the commission approved and subject to conditions specified granted the certificate. 180 I.C.C. 439. The carriers accepted the prescribed terms. In addition to the facts above stated, the court found that between January 1, 1927, and the consummation of the agreement pursuant to the certificate, the Long Island was a tenant at will and that the carriers continued during that period to operate under the conditions approved July 28, 1925.\n The commission found, and it is conceded, that public convenience and necessity require that the Long Island continue to use the lines and other facilities covered by the trackage agreement. It declared that the reasonableness of a joint facility rental is a matter of public inter- \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n est, as well as one affecting the operations of the carriers, and should be considered in deciding upon public convenience and necessity; that the financial, as well as the transportion features of the carriers' application, might be dealt with under the authority conferred by section 1(18), and that in cases of extensions of operations under trackage rights, the cost is not less important than in cases of extension by construction, acquisition, or lease. Appellants raise no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the order or as to the reasonableness of the rentals or other terms of the agreement.\n The District Court found that operation under trackage agreements over existing lines of another carrier may affect interstate commerce; that an extension, whether arising out of such agreements or otherwise. has a vital effect on such commerce; and that the same dangers that are to be guarded against when a railroad extends its line for its own use, or leases it for the sole use of another, exist where it agrees to a joint use by itself and another road. And upon a consideration of the language of section 1(18) in the light of facts found and of settled governmental policies in respect of the regulation of interstate transportation, the court concluded that the case is within the statute; that the federal commission had jurisdiction over the trackage agreements and that section 148 of the New York Railroad Law no longer applies.\n Section 1(18) was added by Transportation Act 1920, 49 USCA  1(18). It provides: 'No carrier ... shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, or shall acquire or operate any line of railroad, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transportation under this Chapter over or by means of such additional or extended line of railroad, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line of railroad. ...' The paragraph also declares that no carrier shall abandon the operation of any portion of a line of railroad until it obtains the commission's certificate that public convenience and necessity permit it. Paragraph (20) authorizes the commission to impose such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require, and provides that 'without securing approval other than such certificate' the carrier may 'proceed with the construction, operation, or abandonment covered thereby.'\n These provisions do not specifically mention trackage agreements providing for joint use of railroad lines, tracks, or other facilities by two or more carriers. The question is whether the general language of paragraph (18) includes the arrangement under consideration. Prior to the Transportation Act 1920, regulations coincidentally made by federal and state authorities were frequently conflicting, and often the enforcement of state measures interfered with, burdened, and destroyed interstate commerce. Multiple control in respect of matters affecting such transportation had been found detrimental to the public interest as well as to the carriers. Dominant federal action was imperatively called for. The Minnesota Rate Case, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 433\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. And it was everywhere known that enormous sums had been expended by interstate railroad carriers for the construction and operation of lines that were not needed or likely to be needed. Such investments had brought financial ruin to some and had made doubtful the power of many to continue operation in other than flush times. Need for effective regulation in this field had become urgent, and undoubtedly the Congress, by the provisions above referred to, intended to \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n confer upon the commission plenary power to limit interstate carriers' expenditures for construction or operation to lines of railroad reasonably necessary for the service of the public.\n So far as concerns the purpose to be attained by this legislation, there is no room for a distinction between unjustifiable expenditures for the construction or operation of new mileage on the one hand and inadequate rentals or extortionate exactions under trackage agreements on the other. The reasons for the exertion of federal authority, to the exclusion of state regulation, apply with like force to both. The act, including paragraph (18) and related provisions, is construed to make federal authority effective to the full extent that it has been exerted and with a view of eliminating the evils that Congress intended to abate.

Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244, 249\n, 46 S.Ct. 535.\n The words employed are broad enough to include the Long Island operations under the trackage agreement. The phrase 'to operate any line of railroad' seems quite sufficient to include such use. There is nothing to suggest that the 'operation' for which the commission's approval is required may not be by other than the owner or lessee of the line or that it is to be limited to exclusive use. For more than a score of years the Long Island has used these lines for the passage of frequent trains carrying an enormous and ever increasing traffic between the terminus of its own railroad at Sunnyside and the Pennsylvania station. It is no stretch to say that it has been operating such lines or that they constitute an 'exten- \n\n[289 U.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n sion' of its own railroad. The use is a joint one but it is nevertheless 'operation.' And the phrase, 'engage in transportation ... by means of such additional or extended line of railroad' reasonably may be deemed to include a line owned by another carrier. The Long Island's use of the Pennsylvania lines covered by the agreement serves the same purpose as would the acquisition of such lines by purchase or the construction by it of a like extension into Manhattan. The provision as to abandonment is also significant, for, if the Long Island were to cease to use the lines covered by the agreement, it reasonably might be held to have abandoned a 'portion of a line of railroad.' Any interpretation excluding the lines of railroad in question would conflict with implications of our decisions. Alabama & V.R. Co. v. Jackson, etc., R. Co., supra, \n271 \nU.S. 250\n, 46 S.Ct. 535; Cleveland, etc., R. Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 409\n, 48 S.Ct. 189. The provisions of paragraph (18) undoubtedly apply to the operations under trackage agreements such as that under consideration.\n There is no merit in appellants' contention that, because the joint use commenced prior to the Transportation Act and has since been continuous, the provisions of paragraph (18) do not apply. The extended term of the contract approved by the state commission expired January 1, 1927. The agreement submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval was made long after such expiration and when there was no agreement for continuing joint operation or use of the lines and other facilities. On the taking effect of the Transportation Act the state commission was stripped of power to prescribe terms for such operation. The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission is paramount and, in respect of the operation and agreement under consideration, it is necessarily exclusive.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTROTTER v. STATE OF TENNESSEE, FOR USE AND BENEFIT OF BLOUNT(1933)\nNo. 79\nArgued: November 14, 1933Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Russell R. Kramer, of Maryville, Tenn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Sam Johnson, of Maryville, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether lands in Tennessee purchased by the guardian of a veteran with moneys received from the United States for the use of the disabled ward are subject to taxation.\n Joseph A. Leake became mentally incompetent by reason of his service in the Army during the World War. Since May, 1922, the United States government has paid compensation to his guardian at the rate of $100 a month in accordance with the provisions of part II of the World War Veterans' Act (38 U.S.C.  471 et seq. (38 USCA  471 et seq.)), and disability benefits at the rate of $57.50 a month under a policy of war risk insurance in accordance with the provisions of part III of the same act. 38 U.S.C.  511 et seq. (38 USCA  511 et seq.). On June 3, 1924, the guardian purchased land and buildings in Blount county, Tenn., paying therefor $2,500 in cash out of the moneys theretofore received from the government, $2,000 in promissory notes, which have been paid out of later moneys derived from the same source, and $1,500 by assuming the payment of a mortgage, which has been discharged by the use of the proceeds of fire insurance covering one of the buildings. State and county taxes assessed upon the land for the year 1929 are in arrears with interest and penalties. The state \n\n[290 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n of Tennessee, the respondent here, brought suit in the chancery court to declare the tax a lien enforceable by a sale. The guardian and his ward answered that by force of the federal statutes the land was exempt. The chancellor sustained the defense and dismissed the complainant's bill. The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed, and directed the court of chancery to award judgment to the state. State v. Blair, 165 Tenn. 519, 57 S.W.(2d) 455. The case is here on certiorari.\n By the World War Veterans' Act, 'The compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable under Parts II, III, and IV, respectively, shall not be assignable; shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made under Parts II, III, or IV; and shall be exempt from all taxation.' Act of June 7, 1924, c. 320 ,  22, 43 Stat. 613, 38 U.S.C.  454 (38 USCA  454); cf. 38 U.S.C.  618 ( 38 USCA  618).\n Exemptions from taxation are not to be enlarged by implication if doubts are nicely balanced. Chicago Theological Seminary v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 662, 674\n, 23 S.Ct. 386. On the other hand, they are not to be read so grudgingly as to thwart the purpose of the lawmakers. The moneys payable to this soldier were unquestionably exempt till they came into his hands or the hands of his guardian. McIntosh v. Aubrey, \n185 \nU.S. 122\n, 22 S.Ct. 561. We leave the question open whether the exemption remained in force while they continued in those hands or on deposit in a bank. cf. McIntosh v. Aubrey, supra; State v. Shawnee County Commissioners, 132 Kan. 233, 294 P. 915; Wilson v. Sawyer, 177 Ark. 492, 6 S.W.(2d) 825; and Surace v. Danna, 248 N.Y. 18, 24, 25, 161 N.E. 315. Be that as it may, we think it very clear that there was an end to the exemption when they lost the quality of moneys and were converted into land and buildings. The statute speaks of 'compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable' to the veteran, and declares that these shall be \n\n[290 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n exempt. We see no token of a purpose to extend a like immunity to permanent investments or the fruits of business enterprises. Veterans who choose to trade in land or in merchandise, in bonds or in shares of stock, must pay their tribute to the state. If immunity is to be theirs, the statute conceding it must speak in clearer terms than the one before us here.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee disallowing the exemption has support in other courts. State v. Wright, 224 Ala. 357, 140 So. 584; Martin v. Guilford County, 201 N.C. 63, 158 S.E. 847, 76 A.L.R. 978. There are decisions to the contrary, but we are unable to approve them. Rucker v.

Smith, \n288 \nU.S. 430\n, 53 S.Ct. 415, 84 A.L.R. 1525, leaves no room for the contention that the exemption is enlarged by reason of payment to the guardian instead of payment to the ward.\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Addison C. Burnham, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, granted on petition of the government, \n287 \nU.S. 588\n, 53 S.Ct. 88, 77 L.Ed. --, to review a judgment of the Court of Claims in favor of the intervener, the Liberty Trust Company, respondent here. 74 Ct.Cl. 82. The suit was brought by Acme Operating Corporation, as plaintiff, to recover just compensation alleged to be due to it as the charterer of two steamships, the James S. Whitney and the H. M. Whitney, the use of which was requisitioned in behalf of the government by the Shipping Board, under the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition of the plaintiff, but gave judgment for the intervener, which claimed as the assignee and successor in interest of the Fidelity Trust Company, mortgagee of the two vessels. The sole question presented by the petition is whether the Court was right in giving judgment for the intervener.\n The vessels were each subject to a mortgage of the Fidelity Trust Company, later assigned to the intervener. \n\n[288 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n The owners chartered them to the Acme Corporation, plaintiff below, and, at about the same time, they were placed in repair yards for alteration and repairs, the cost of which for each ship was paid only in part. On April 27, 1918, shortly before the maturity of the mortgages, the use of the vessels was requisitioned by the Shipping Board. Having been arrested under libels in admiralty by the construction companies for the balance due for the repairs, they were released to the government by court orders.\n August 12, 1918, the United States, through the Shipping Board, entered into a contract with the owners of the ships and the mortgagee, predecessor in interest of the intervener, by which it was provided that the government should retain from the amounts which would otherwise be due as just compensation for the use of the vessels, its expenditures in behalf of the owners, for transporting to their destinations the cargoes which were in the ships at the time of requisition. If just compensation due 'for the requisitioning' of the vessels exceeded the debt to the government, the government was authorized to apply the excess to the payment of the mortgages and liens on the vessels. It was also provided that, if the ships should be released from the requisition or returned to the owners before the government should be fully reimbursed for carrying the cargoes forward to destination, the government should have liens upon them for the amount of the unpaid balance, which the owners and the mortgagee agreed should be superior to the mortgage liens.\n In December, 1918, requisition charter parties between the government and the owners of the ships were executed as of the date of the requisitions. The charter parties are not set forth in the findings, but they provided that 'the owner accepts this requisition charter in full satisfaction of ... all claims ... against the United States arising out of the requisition,' and accepts \n\n[288 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n the compensation provided by the charter parties 'as the just compensation required by law.'\n The ships were subsequently released by the government and returned by the Board to the owners, the H. M. Whitney on July 8, 1919 and the James S. Whitney on July 10, 1919. They were placed in dock for repairs and reconditioning, upon completion of which they were removed by the agent of the owners and Fidelity Trust Company, the mortgagee. The court below found that the Fidelity 'advanced and paid,' for the account of the owners of the two vessels, a total of $129,299.76 'for sundry services and materials in connection with' the repairs, and gave judgment for the intervener for that amount.\n A final accounting was had between the owners and the government which the court below found to be correct. The account, after crediting to the owners $87,706.84, the estimated cost of reconditioning the ships as fixed by a survey, showed a balance of $77,068.54 still owing to the government for delivering the cargoes which were in the ships at the time of requisition. The total amount due the government at the time the vessels were returned thus exceeded the claim of the intervener. In September, 1920, the Fidelity Trust Company became financially embarrassed, was taken over by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, and, in April, 1921, its assets were transferred to the intervener which, for purposes of the present litigation, may be regarded as standing in its stead.\n The court below held that the requisition of the use of the ships when they were in the custody of the admiralty court and when the mortgagee was neither in possession nor entitled to possession did not entitle the mortgagee to compensation; but it nevertheless held that the intervener was entitled to recover the $129,297.66, which it \n\n[288 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n expended to repair the vessels after their return by the government, on the ground that 'the injury to the vessels themselves was an injury to the res' on which the intervener held a mortgage. In this we think it was in error.\n The intervener endeavors to support the judgment below on the grounds that the injury or depreciation of the vessels while in use by the government under the requisition charters was, in effect, a destruction of them pro tanto, which in itself operated as a requisition of the mortgagee's interest, for which just compensation must be paid (see United States v. Welch, \n217 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 30 S.Ct. 527, 28 L.R.A.( N.S.) 385, 19 Ann.Cas. 680; A. W. Duckett & Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 149, 151\n, 45 S.Ct. 38), and that in any case, the mortgagee's security was impaired to the full extent of the damage done, and it is entitled to recover the cost to it of rehabilitating its security by reconditioning the vessels.\n It is unnecessary to consider in detail numerous objections raised by the government to the soundness of these contentions and to the sufficiency of the findings to support them, if sound. It is enough that the agreement of August 12, 1918, between the United States, the owners of the vessels, and the mortgagee, which is binding on the intervener, contemplated that the government should be reimbursed in full for its transportation charges from 'the compensation due for requisitioning' the vessels, before any payments of compensation should be made to the mortgagee. To this end the agreement provided that, in the event that the steamers were returned before the government was fully paid for carrying the cargoes, the government should have 'and there are hereby created liens upon said steamers and both of them, for the amount of the unpaid balance ... which amount shall be forthwith due and payable on the release of said steamers or either of them, and which liens the parties ... agree shall be superior to the mortgage liens.' We think the effect of \n\n[288 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n this agreement was to confer upon the claim of the government priority over that of the mortgagee. The superiority of the government's claim to that of the mortgagee is certainly not affected by the fact that the vessels have been returned, and the mortgagee seeks, not the full amount of its mortgages, but the amount in which it contends its interest has been destroyed or its security impaired.\n When the vessels were returned, $164,775.38 was due the government for unpaid transportation charges. The government has credited upon its claim the cost of repairs found reasonable by the survey, $87,706.84. But, even if the full amount of $129,297.66, claimed by the intervener to represent the damage to the vessels while in the service, be regarded as due to the owners and mortgagee as their interests may appear, the most that the mortgagee can ask is that the government's prior claim be reduced by that amount. Even if that is done, the government's claim is not satisfied, or its lien discharged. Hence there is no foundation upon any theory for the recovery of a money judgment against the government by the intervener, as mortgagee.\n The intervener seeks also to sustain its recovery upon the ground that it owns the construction liens for repairs and alterations of the vessels before they were requisitioned. The findings show that the claims of the construction companies were acquired by the Fidelity Trust Company, and, in 1921, transferred to the intervener along with the other assets of that company. But no claim founded upon these construction liens was asserted by the intervener's petition or considered by the court below. The case was decided, as it was evidently tried, on the basis of intervener's claim upon its mortgages. The status of the liens at the time of the trial is neither revealed by the findings nor mentioned in the opinion; the findings do not admit of a determination of their validity. \n\n[288 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n The vessels were placed in full repair by the mortgagee; to the extent that they were repaired before the liens were assigned, the lienors could have had no rights against the government for the impairment of their security and they transferred none by the assignments. There is no finding which shows to what extent the repairs had been made at the time of the assignments, although it appears that some of them, at least, were then completed. The intervener does not say, and cannot, on these findings, that it made the repairs to protect the security of the liens rather than that of its own mortgages, which are subordinate to the claims of the government. Accordingly, there is no basis in the findings for contending that the intervener stands in any better position as the holder of the construction liens than it does as mortgagee.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. ARZNER(1933)\nNo. 191\nArgued: December 13, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[287 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n Paul D. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Samuel H. Williams, of Lynchburg, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent Arzner enlisted in the Army March 29, 1918, and was discharged January 16, 1919. While in the service he took out a war risk insurance policy for $10,000 on which premiums were paid through January, 1919. The policy lapsed; but March 1, 1920, it was reinstated and then converted into an ordinary life policy. Premiums upon the latter were paid through February, 1921. The respondent then gave up $5,000 of it and received the cash surrender value-$45; he surrendered the remaining $5,000 in December, 1921, and accepted the cash value-$18.30.\n March 5, 1929, he began this proceeding in the United States District Court. He alleged total disability, resulting from injuries received in battle, commencing in 1918, and sought recovery under his original war risk insurance policy of 1918-$57.50 per month.\n Upon properly framed issues the cause went to trial in June, 1931. The jury found respondent's total and permanent disability commenced September 29, 1918, and returned a verdict in his favor. An appropriate judgment \n\n[287 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n followed; the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed.\n Because of conflicting views in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari.\n Here it is said that the court below erred in holding that respondent was entitled to recover upon his original policy, since, at the time final judgment went down, he could not surrender the converted policy as required by section 307, amended World War Veterans' Act 1924, c. 320, 43 Stat. 607, 627, Act July 3, 1930, c. 849, 46 Stat. 991, 1001 (38 USCA  518). The facts are not in dispute.\n Prior to July, 1930, federal courts held divergent views concerning the rights of veterans whose original term insurance policies had lapsed and thereafter had been reinstated or converted into some other form. Stevens v. United States (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 904; United States v. Buzard ( C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 883; United States v. Kusnierz (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 887; United States v. Cross (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 887; United States v. Allen (C.C. A.) 33 F.(2d) 888; United States v. Barker (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 556; Duggan v. United States (D.C.) 36 F. (2d) 804; Franks v. United States (D.C.) 43 F.(2d) 455; United States v. Golden (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 367; United States v. Acker (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 646; United States v. Schweppe (C.C.A.) 38 F.( 2d) 595; Woolfolk v. United States (C.C.A.) 44 F.(2d) 701; Crawford v. United States (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 199; United States v. Andrews (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 80.\n With the evident purpose to accord liberal treatment to those veterans who at any time had become entitled to receive benefits under any insurance policy, Congress by the Act of July 3, 1930, amended World War Veterans' Act, supra, so as to read:\n'All contracts or policies of insurance heretofore or hereafter issued, reinstated, or converted shall be incontestable from the date of issuance, reinstatement, or conversion, except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or on the ground that the applicant was not a member of the military or naval forces of the United States, and subject to \n\n[287 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of section 447 (23) of this title: Provided, That the insured under such contract or policy may, without prejudicing his rights, elect to make claim to the bureau or to bring suit under section 445 (19) of this title on any prior contract or policy, and if found entitled thereto, shall, upon surrender of any subsequent contract or policy, be entitled to payments under the prior contract or policy: Provided further, That this section shall be deemed to be effective as of April 6, 1917, and applicable from that date to all contracts or policies of insurance.'\n\n When the trial court rendered final judgment, respondent had given up his converted policy, and therefore could not surrender it again. For petitioner it is said that, being unable to comply with the literal terms of the 1930 amendment, he could not recover under the original (1918) policy. Also: 'The Government, of course, does not question the right of a veteran who has converted his term insurance to sue on his prior policy, even if he has allowed the converted policy to lapse, provided he surrenders the converted policy.' The suggested construction of the statute is too narrow. It would deprive veterans of a right which we think Congress intended to confer. The probable reason for requiring surrender of the subsequent contract or policy was to prevent any further claim and thus silence controversy.\n Undoubtedly respondent became entitled in September, 1918, during the life of his original policy, to the benefits therein provided. And we think Congress by the act of 1930 intended to permit him to assert the right which then accrued. To deprive him of this simply because he could not actually surrender a writing already delivered to the United States would defeat the generous purpose behind the enactment.\n True it is, respondent agreed to cancellation of his converted policy and accepted the surrender value-a portion of the money paid by him for premiums there- \n\n[287 U.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n on. But this action worked no material disadvantage to the government. Indeed, the veteran made payments when in fact entitled to receive monthly benefits for total disability. If the converted policy had been allowed finally to lapse because of nonpayment of premiums, the agreement between the parties would have been fully complied with. Nevertheless the proper admission is that under such circumstances there could have been a recovery on the original policy, upon actual surrender of the expired policy. The government now has possession of the canceled converted policy and is in no worse position than it would be in the supposed circumstances.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. DARBY(1933)\nNo. 653\nArgued: March 14, 1933Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Lucien H. Mercier, of Washington, D.C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case involves the construction of a statute of the United States which makes it a crime for an officer or employee of a Federal Reserve Bank, or of any member bank, to make any entry in its books with intent to defraud. R.S.  5209, as amended by the Act of Septem- \n\n[289 U.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n ber 26, 1918, c. 177,  7, 40 Stat. 972, 12 U.S. Code,  592 (12 USCA  592).1\n An indictment in sixteen counts charges the appellee, John G. Darby, with a violation of this statute. Eight entries are alleged to have been falsely made. Each has relation to a separate promissory note discounted by the Montgomery County National Bank of Rockville, Md. The notes bore the genuine signature of J. G. Darby as maker. They bore what appeared to be the signature of Bessie D. Darby as comaker or indorser. In was a forgery. With this knowledge he entered in the discount book the name of Bessie D. Darby as comaker or indorser, and did this in the course of his employment as assistant cashier. The odd-numbered counts charge an intent to injure and defraud the bank, and the even-numbered counts an intent to deceive the officers of the bank and the Comptroller of the Currency. A demurrer to the indictment was sustained by the District Court on the ground that the discount of the paper had been recorded as it occurred, and hence that the entries were not false within the meaning of the statute (2 F.Supp. 378). The case is here \n\n[289 U.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n under the Criminal Appeals Act (Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S. Code, 682 (18 USCA  682); cf. Judicial Code,  238, 28 U.S. Code,  345 (28 USCA  345)) upon an appeal by the Government.\n'The crime of making false entries by an officer of a national bank with the intent to defraud ... includes any entry on the books of the bank which is intentionally made to represent what is not true or does not exist, with the intent either to deceive its officers or to defraud the association.' Agnew v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 36, 52\n, 17 S.Ct. 235, 241. The act charged to the appellee is criminal if subjected to that test. At the time of the entry, no note was in existence with the signature of Bessie D. Darby as comaker or indorser. No note with such a signature had been discounted by the bank. The foreged signature was a nullity, as much so as if the name had been blotted out before the discount, or never placed upon the notes at all. Verity was not imparted to the entry by the simulacrum of a signature known to be spurious. Agnew v. United States, supra; Coffin v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 664, 683\n, 16 S. Ct. 943; United States v. Morse (C.C.) 161 F. 429, 436; Morse v. United States (C.C.A.) 174 F. 539, 552, 20 Ann.Cas. 938; United States v. Warn (D.C.) 295 F. 328, 330; Billingsley v. United States (C.C.A .) 178 F. 653, 659, 662; Peters v. United States (C.C.A.) 94 F. 127, 144. As well might it be said that dollars known to be counterfeit might have been entered in the books as cash.\n\n To read the statute otherwise is to be forgetful of its aim. Its aim was to give assurance that upon an inspection of a bank, public officers and others would discover in its books of account a picture of its true condition. United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 241\n, 242 S., 30 S.Ct. 81; Billingsley v. United States, supra. One will not find the picture here. Upon the face of the books there was a statement to examiners that paper with two signatures had been discounted by the bank and was then in its possession. \n\n[289 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n In truth, to the knowledge of the maker of the entries, there were not two signatures, but one.\n Nothing at war with our conclusion was said, much less decided, in Coffin v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 432, 462\n, 15 S.Ct. 394. The opinion in that case is to be read in the light of a later opinion in the same case (\n162 \nU.S. 664\n, 16 S.Ct. 943), and of the still later opinion in Agnew v. United States, supra. Whether the conclusion would be the same if the signature had been genuine, but the signer had been known to be an insolvent, or a man of straw (cf. Cooper v. United States (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 16; Morse v. United States, supra; United States v. Warn, supra; Billingsley v. United States, supra), there is no occasion to determine. Our decision does not go beyond the limits of the case before us.\n The judgment should be reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 5209.

Reidy, of Washington, D.C ., for appellant Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Karl Knox Gartner, of Washington, D.C., for appellants Northwest Petroleum Ass'n and others.\n Mr. M. L. Countryman, Jr., of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal brings here for review a decree of a District Court of three judges (60 F.(2d) 302) setting aside and enjoining the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission establishing rates on petroleum from the midcontinent field to destinations in Western Minnesota and North Dakota. \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n The appellees' petition charged that the Commission exceeded its powers, denied a fair hearing, and abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the case and to receive proof of changes in economic conditions arising after the closing of the evidence. The District Court held against the appellees as respects the first two charges, but found that the third was sustained, and therefore set aside the order. This the appellants say was error. The appellees, however, assert that the allegations and proofs as to changed conditions support the decree, and urge, in the alternative, that, if this position be untenable, the action of the court was required for the other reasons recited in the petition.\n The complaint, filed July 15, 1925, alleged the existing rates were unreasonable. A hearing was held in October, 1925, and a report and order entered March 5, 1928, fixing rates effective June 14, 1928. A rehearing was granted June 10, 1929, the case was reheard, and the record closed on January 15, 1930. A petition of the carriers that the case be reopened and consolidated with certain others was denied April 14, 1930. The final report and order were entered December 1, 1931, prescribing rates to become effective March 15, 1932. On February 3, 1932, the appellees presented a petition praying that the Commission vacate the order or postpone its effective date, grant a rehearing, and reopen the case for the admission of further evidence to show a change in economic conditions since the record had been closed. This was dismissed, and the present suit was then instituted.\n The appellees urge that the decision in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146, requires us to hold that the Commission's refusal to reopen the proceeding was an abuse of discretion. That case, however, exhibited a substantially different state of facts. There the Commission conducted an investigation, pursuant to the Hoch-Smith Resolution (49 USCA  55) touching the \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n entire structure of rates on export grain from the territory west of the Mississippi river and from Illinois. Here the inquiry embraced rates from origin points to a relatively small destination area. The diminution of carrier revenue consequent upon the new rates, while substantial, is far less than that effected by the order in the Santa Fe proceeding. In that case, the record was closed in September, 1928, the matter submitted on argument July 1, 1929, and a report and order entered July 1, 1930, establishing rates to be charged on and after October 1, 1930. The effective date was postponed from time to time on account of the difficulty of adjusting the tariffs in accordance with the order. In September, 1930, the carriers requested a rehearing. Prior to action thereon the railroads brought to the Commission's attention their changed financial condition due to the economic depression. In November, 1930, a rehearing was denied. On February 18, 1931, a second petition for rehearing was presented, which was in effect a bill of review. It averred that due to the nation-wide depression which had its inception in November, 1929, the facts exhibited by the record as closed in September, 1928, were utterly unrepresentative of conditions existing at the effective date of the order some two and onehalf years later.\n In the proceedings under review, the record was closed January 15, 1930. The economic depression, then begun, grew in intensity throughout that and the following year. During the pendency of the case appellees filed several petitions for rehearing; that of May 4, 1928, reciting that the carriers were unable under existing rates to earn the fair return contemplated by section 15a of the act (49 USCA  15a). Between January 15, 1930, and February 3, 1932, no application based on changed economic conditions was made to the Commission, and that body was allowed to consider the record and prepare a report without notice of any claim in that behalf. \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n The Commission is not bound to allow existing unreasonable rates to stand solely because revision will in some degree adversely affect carriers suffering from economic depression. The decision in the Santa Fe Case is not to be extended to require a rehearing in every rate case for changed economic conditions, however insignificant the effect of the order on carrier revenue. The rule announced, while intended to safeguard substantial rights of the railroads, may not be invoked where its application would disenable the Commission to protect the interest of the public.\n Though the order substantially reduced the carriers' revenues, we do not consider the merits of the application for rehearing, as we think the carriers' lack of diligence in bringing this matter to the Commission's attention deprived them of any equity to complain of the refusal of their petition. They sat silent and took the chance of a favorable decision on the record as made. They should not be permitted to reopen the case for the introduction of evidence long available and susceptible of production months before the Commission acted. The denial of a rehearing, in view of this delay, was not such an abuse of discretion as would warrant setting aside the order.\n This conclusion requires the reversal of the decree, unless, as the appellees contend, it may be sustained upon the other grounds presented to the District Court. We turn then to these aspects of the controversy.\n The complaint attacked the existing rates as unreasonable, and did not charge undue preference or prejudice; but, it is said, the Commission based its order solely upon prejudice due to the relation of these rates with others in force in adjacent territory. The argument is that the relief granted was different from that invoked and so beyond the Commission's power. The appellees also claim that when they discovered that the Commission \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n was proceeding upon the basis of relationship, rather than reasonableness, they vainly sought an opportunity to show that the rates used as comparatives were unreasonably low, and therefore of no probative value. The Commission's dismissal of certain petitions for further hearing upon consolidated records, presently to be described, is represented as a denial of a fair hearing, in that the carriers were prevented from showing the impropriety of the comparisons used. The examination of these contentions requires a detailed statement with respect to this and other proceedings before the Commission.\n Prior to the filing of the complaint in this case (No. 17304), the Commission was engaged in an investigation (No. 15584) of rates on petroleum from midcontinent territory to western trunk line destinations and Indiana, Illinois, and Northern Michigan. Midcontinent origins had been grouped for rate-making purposes, and the principal contention in No. 15584 was that the rates from the different blanket origins were not properly related. In that proceeding, however, interveners residing in North and South Dakota alleged that the rates from the midcontinent field as a whole to destinations in those states were unreasonably high and prejudicial when compared with the tariffs in force to other territory. Certain related complaints were consolidated with No. 15584, and all were heard on a single record. While the investigation was under way the complaint in the present case, No. 17304, was filed by North Dakota and Western Minnesota complainants, and was heard on a separate record. There had also been filed a complaint, known as No. 16309, by South Dakota consignees, attacking the rates to that territory as unreasonable and also as unduly prejudicial in their relation to rates to Iowa and Southern Minnesota. In May, 1926, a report was filed in No. 15584 (Midcontinent Oil Rates, 112 I.C.C. 421) readjusting the rates from various origin blankets in \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n the midcontinent field to western trunk line destinations and declaring the new rates to be just, reasonable, and nonpreferential. Referring to the interventions of consignees in North and South Dakota and to case No. 16309, affecting South Dakota, the Commission stated that the record was not adequate for a finding with respect to the rates to those destinations, and announced that No. 15584 would be held open for further consideration in connection with No. 16309. It subsequently consolidated No. 16309 and the present case, No. 17304, with No. 15584, and on March 5, 1928, filed a supplemental report establishing rates to the territory here in question, effective June 14, 1928, adjudging them reasonable and properly related to the rates to western trunk line territory theretofore prescribed Midcontinent Oil Rates, 139 I.C.C. 605.\n May 4, 1928, the appellees asked the Commission to postpone the effective date of this order, and to vacate its outstanding orders 'in No. 15584 and associated cases, in so far as said orders related to rates to Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, Sioux City, Fort Dodge, and Mason City, Iowa, Duluth and St. Paul, Minnesota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and to grant them a further hearing upon a single record with respect to the level of the rates from the midcontinent field to destinations in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota.' It will be observed the rehearing requested would affect all rates established in No. 15584 and related cases in the original and supplemental reports. The petition was denied February 11, 1929\n\n\n The required schedules having been put into effect, the carriers filed tariffs reducing the rates on petroleum from origins in Wyoming to points in North Dakota, South Dakota, and certain cities in Iowa, Nebraska, and Montana-this upon the theory that these should be reduced to bring them into proper relationship with the new charges on petroleum from the midcontinent field. After \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n hearing the Commission suspended the rates so promulgated (153 I.C.C. 363).\n In November, 1928, Dacotah Oil Company et al. filed a complaint, No. 21737, alleging that the rates fixed by the order of March 5, 1928, to certain North Dakota points, were unjust and unreasonable, and praying the establishment of just and reasonable rates for the future. This was heard in March, 1929, and the record then closed. April 19, 1929, the complainants in this cause, No. 17304, filed a petition alleging that the rates prescribed March 5, 1928, were unjustifiably high as compared with those to the Minnesota gateways adjoining the destination territory in Western Minnesota and North Dakota. On June 10, 1929, the Commission reopened the case. Three months later the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, operating refineries at Casper, Wyo., filed its complaint alleging that rates on petroleum from Casper to North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota were unreasonable and unduly prejudicial to the complainant, and unduly preferential of producers in the midcontinent field. This complaint was docketed as No. 22714. At about the same time the Public Service Commission of Wyoming filed a similar complaint (No. 22733) with respect to rates from Wyoming origins to the same destinations. The Commission thereupon assigned the present case, No. 17304, for further hearing on January 13, 1930. Just prior to that date, the appellees petitioned the Commission asking that this complaint and the two just mentioned, concerning rates from Wyoming, should be consolidated for hearing and decision upon a common record, alleging that, if any change were made in No. 17304 in the rates prescribed by the Commission March 5, 1928, from the midcontinent field, such readjustment would directly and necessarily disturb the relationship between midcontinent and Wyoming rates, which relationship was brought into issue by the complaints in Nos. 22714 and 22733. \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n On January 14, 1930, the appellees filed with the Commission a petition in No. 15584 and associated cases, requesting that they be reopened for further hearing with respect to rates therein prescribed from the midcontinent field to the key or gateway points such as Lincoln and Omaha, Neb., Des Moines, Fort Dodge, Sioux City, and Mason City, Iowa, Sioux Falls, S.D., and St. Paul and Duluth, Minn., and to the territory beyond such gateway points, and that the abovementioned cases be consolidated with the two complaints respecting rates from Wyoming; this on the ground that the whole structure of rates ought not to be dealt with and adjusted piecemeal, since to do so would inevitably result in unnecessary dissipation of carrier revenue and create inconsistencies and dissatisfaction, and that the only way in which the complaints of discrimination, preference, and prejudice in the rate structure could be satisfied would be by proceeding upon one record, with all interested parties before it, to work out a harmonious, consistent, and otherwise lawful adjustment which would protect rather than unnecessarily sacrifice the revenues of the carriers. April 14, 1930, the petition was denied.\n On December 1, 1931, the Commission made and filed its report and order in this cause and No. 21737, whereby the rates established by the order of March 5, 1928, were revised. 179 I.C.C. 435.\n The petition in the District Court sets forth the matters above outlined, and summarizes the action of the Commission in the various proceedings. The answers of the United States and the Commission admit the filing of the several complaints and the making of the reports and orders thereon, deny that the description of the Commission's action set out in the petition is accurate or complete, and refer to the reports and orders for a correct statement of what the Commission did. At the \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n trial, none of the records in any of the complaints was put in evidence. The several petitions for rehearing and for consolidation are recounted and summarized in the petition, but are not set forth, nor included in the record. In considering the questions presented, we are thus confined to the Commission's reports supplemented by the averments of the pleadings as to the substance of the applications for reopening, consolidation, and rehearing.\n It should be noted that appellees were parties respondent in each of the proceedings above mentioned. In some, the rates under attack in the present cause, No. 17304, were alleged to be unreasonable under section 1 of the act (49 USCA  1) and also unduly prejudicial within the intent of section 3 (49 USCA  3), and the carriers had full opportunity to be heard on both issues. In No. 15584, the Midcontinent Case, the Commission expressly held open the question of the rates to North Dakota and Western Minnesota for further consideration in connection with No. 16309, which charged that existing rates to South Dakota were unreasonable and unduly prejudicial as compared with the rates fixed in the Midcontinent Case to the gateways and to western trunk line territory. In the supplemental report in the latter, the Commission dealt with the South Dakota rates and those here involved. In the order of March 5, 1928, and in the final order of December 1, 1931, the Commission found that the rates prescribed were just and reasonable, and were properly related to those established in No. 15584. Note was taken of the fact that the rates to certain of the gateways were unduly depressed, and it was said that those established to South Dakota points, than which the rates prescribed herein are higher, had for that reason been raised above the depressed level of rates to the gateways.\n In the absence of the evidence before the Commission, we cannot say that there was no adequate and sufficient \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 500]\n\u00a0\n proof on which to base a finding of the reasonableness of the rates prescribed. \n1\n It is true that in both reports touching the rates here in controversy the Commission used as comparatives rates from the midcontinent field to South Dakota points and those from Wyoming origins to South Dakota and North Dakota destinations. But it appears from the reports that the carriers themselves presented comparisons of these very rates in support of their contentions. Thus both the appellees and the Commission recognized what has long been settled-that existing rates for similar service to other destinations may be used for comparison as one test, though not a controlling one, upon the question of the reasonableness of the rates in issue. The Commission's reports do not sustain the averments of the petition that the question of reasonableness was disregarded and the order based solely upon a comparison with rates which were unduly and unreasonably low.\n But the appellees say that, if the Commission intended to give weight to the relationship of the rates established in No. 16309, to South Dakota, it should, in fairness, have permitted that case to be reopened and should have afforded opportunity for proof that the South Dakota rates were fixed in relation to the western trunk line tariff, which was unreasonably low due to competitive conditions. The record in the District Court fails to support this argument. As above noted, the carriers had been parties to the record in No. 16309, and confessedly the \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 501]\n\u00a0\n rates there established for South Dakota destinations were made relatively higher than those to trunk line territory. Moreover, the petition of January 14, 1930, did not specifically request the Commission to reopen No. 16309 for the purposes of proof as to the South Dakota rates.\n The appellees now insist that what they desired was an opportunity to show that the South Dakota tariffs were worthless as a guide to the proper charges to North Dakota destinations. But their petition disclosed no such purpose. It requested the reopening of the records 'in No. 15584 and associated cases, including the Wyoming complaints.' The granting of a rehearing upon this petition might have involved the retrial of all the midcontinent cases and the Commission was warranted in understanding that this was the scope of the application. The relief asked was much broader than was necessary to the purpose appellees now avow, and we think they cannot successfully challenge the Commission's refusal to consider all midcontinent petroleum rates established after full hearings to which the carriers had been parties. We are not referred to any request for the reopening of the South Dakota complaint, No. 16309, which appellees say was the specific proceeding they desired consolidated with this case, No. 17304.\n It is further asserted that the failure to consolidate the present proceeding with the two complaints as to rates from Wyoming to North Dakota points deprived the appellees of a fair hearing because the scale of rates from the midcontinent field ought to bear a just relation to those from Wyoming origins. The answer to this contention is found in the Commission's reports. All of the parties complainant and defendant in this case and in No. 15584 introduced evidence as to the existing rates from Wyoming origins and compared them with those from the midcontinent field to North and South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the complainants in order to sustain their \n\n[288 U.S. 490, 502]\n\u00a0\n position that the latter were unreasonable, the respondents to support the view that they bore a proper relation to the Wyoming rates and ought not to be reduced. It cannot therefore be said that by the refusal to consolidate the Wyoming complaints with the present proceeding the carriers were denied a fair hearing on the question of relationship between the two rate structures.\n The District Court was right in holding that the appellees did not make out the claims that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority or denied a fair hearing. But, as we think the District Court erred in holding that the Commission improperly refused the petition of February 3, 1932, for a rehearing based upon changed conditions, the judgment must be reversed. So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The principal reliance of the appellees is a statement by a dissenting commissioner that 'the adjustment here required is based very largely upon our previous findings in the Midcontinent Cases, which we have repeatedly stated required rates below reasonable maxima.' The Commission's report is at variance with the state conclusion, and, in the absence of the record on which the report and order were based, we cannot infer that, in the determination of reasonableness, undue weight was given to relationship. \n\n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. REILY(1933)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. George C. Sweeney, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. F. H. Reily, of Shawnee, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States to enforce its rights and regulations in respect of allotted Indian land held under a so-called trust patent. The land was allotted, and the trust patent issued, with the express restriction that the land should be inalienable for a designated period, which the President might extend, and that any alienation contrary to the restriction should be absolutely void. \n1\n After the allottee's death and during the period of restriction, as extended by the President, the heir conveyed part of the land to the defendant.\n The defendant prevailed in both courts below (C.C.A. 62 F.(2d) 621, and the United States petitioned for certiorari, which this court granted. \n289 \nU.S. 721\n, 53 S.Ct. 791\n\n\n It is settled, and is conceded, that a restriction on alienation such as is here shown is not personal to the allottee but runs with the lands and operates upon the heir the same as upon the allottee. \n2\n So it is apparent the heir's conveyance was void, unless in some way the restriction was removed before the conveyance was made.\n The real question is whether the restriction was removed by Congress by the Act of June 21, 1906,3 which will be set forth later on.\n The material findings of the District Court stand unchallenged and are to the following effect: The allottee, a \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n Kickapoo Indian woman, and her infant son were members of the Kickapoo tribe of Oklahoma whose lands were allotted in severalty among its members in 1894. Both were then living with the tribe in Oklahoma and each received an allotment from the tribal lands. In 1903 the mother, taking the son with her, moved into the Republic of Mexico and established a residence in a Mexican community or tribe of Kickapoos to be described later on. She continuously maintained that residence and affiliated with that tribe until 1929, when she died intestate, leaving the son as her only heir. The son resided in Mexico until 1920 and then gave up that residence and returned to the Kickapoo Reservation in Oklahoma. Continuously thereafter he made the latter place his residence and home. He was residing there in 1929 when his mother died, in 1930 when he made the conveyance to the defendant, and in 1931 when this suit was begun.\n In turning to the Act of June 21, 1906, it will be helpful to have in mind the conditions existing when it was enacted. At one time the Kickapoos were a single tribe occupying a treaty reservation in Kansas;4 but through dissensions and migrations they had come in 1906 to comprise three separate communities or tribes having distinct places of abode. One tribe was still located on the old treaty reservation in Kansas and had been given allotments there. \n5\n Another was located in the Republic of Mexico on a reservation set apart for them by that government. In the main this tribe comprised Kickapoos who had separated from the Kansas tribe and settled in Mexico, some in 1852 and others in 1863.6 There were also later accessions as will appear presently. A third tribe \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n was located in Oklahoma and chiefly comprised Kickapoos who had left the Mexican tribe and returned to the United States, mostly in 1873.7 A reservation in Oklahoma (then the Indian Territory) was established for them by executive order in 1883.8 The lands in this reservation were allotted among the members of this tribe in 1894,9 the allotment to which this suit relates being one which was made then. Some of the allottees on this reservation removed to Mexico and established a residence with the Mexican tribe; and some of the allottees of neighboring Oklahoma tribes, such as Shawnees, Delawares, Caddos, and Wichitas, did likewise. Not infrequently allottees who had gone to the Mexican tribe gave up their residence there and returned to Oklahoma. The migration to and from the Mexican tribe, while intermittent, was continuing when the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 363), was passed. The part of that act which is material here reads as follows:\n'All restrictions as to sale and incumbrance of all lands, inherited and otherwise, of all adult Kickapoo Indians, and of all Shawnee, Delaware, Caddo, and Wichita Indians who have heretofore been or are now known as Indians of said tribes, affiliating with said Kickapoo Indians now or hereafter nonresident in the United States, who have been allotted land in Oklahoma or Indian Territory are hereby removed: Provided, That any such Indian allottee who is a nonresident of the United States may lease his allotment without restriction for a period not exceeding five years: Provided further, That the parent or the person next of kin having the care and custody of a minor allottee may lease the allotment of said \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n minor as herein provided, except that no such lease shall extend beyond the minority of said allottee.'\n\n In any view of the act its words are not happily chosen. They are wanting in clarity and lend themselves to ambiguity. Both administrative officers and courts have found need for resorting to interpretation and construction when applying the act.\n In Johnson v. United States (C.C.A.) 283 F. 954, 955, many conveyances-some by original allottees and some by heirs of such allottees- were assailed by the United States as made in violation of the restriction on alienation, and the defendant relied upon the act as having removed the restriction. Because of the varying facts relating to the several conveyances the act was considered from different angles. The principal question, common to all of the conveyances, was whether the main provision and the two provisos were inconsistent and mutually destructive. The District Court had held that they were, and therefore that the act was ineffective. But the Circuit Court of Appeals disapproved that view and, after observing that if reasonably possible the act should be so construed that the main provision and the provisos could stand together, came to the following conclusion:\n'The purview discloses plainly and clearly a legislative intention to remove restrictions under given conditions; ... when the whole paragraph is read with a view of sustaining it in all its parts the word 'otherwise,' in the second line, seems to be in contradistinction to allotment, so that it was clearly intended that all restrictions as to sale and incumbrance of lands, inherited or otherwise acquired (except allotments of surviving allottees), were removed under the conditions named.'\n\n In other words, that court construed the main provision removing restrictions under given conditions as not relating to lands acquired by direct personal allotment but only to those acquired in other ways, such as inheritance, \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n devise, etc., and construed the provisos permitting limited leases as relating only to lands acquired by direct personal allotments. On that basis the court proceeded to determine whether the facts shown brought any of the conveyances within the conditions named. As to the conveyances described in eleven out of fifty-four counts the court found that the lands were inherited and the grantors were heirs who came within the classes and conditions fixed in the act. In that connection the court said:\n'And the counts each allege that the deceased ancestor was an absentee Shawnee allottee, a member of the absentee Shawnee tribe of Indians, that the grantor was his heir and conveyed his inherited interest in his ancestor's allotment; and the stipulation shows that each grantor was an absentee Shawnee Indian and had been allotted lands in his own right. We think it also fairly inferable from the record that the grantors had been allotted lands in Oklahoma or Indian Territory, and that they and their ancestors were affiliated with nonresident Kickapoos.'\n\n On these findings the conveyances described in the eleven courts were held valid and the decree of the District Court as to them was reversed. Of the conveyances described in the other counts the court briefly said that the facts obtained from the record did not support the claim of a removal of restrictions, and so the decree of the District Court canceling those conveyances was affirmed.\n Both parties acquiesce in and place some reliance on that decision. It is pertinent in so far as it holds that the act of 1906 did not remove the restriction on alienation from an allotment during the life of the allottee. Under that holding, with which we are in accord, the allotment in question remained subject to the restriction throughout the life of the mother, the original allottee.\n On other points the facts in the Johnson Case and those in this are not alike. In that case none of the heir- \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n grantors was a Kickapoo. All were absentee Shawnees affiliated with the Kickapoos in Mexico. Here the heir-grantor was a Kickapoo permanently residing with the Kickapoos in Oklahoma when he inherited from his mother and continuously thereafter.\n The defendant insists that the act of 1906 makes a distinction between Kickapoos and Shawnees, etc., in that it removes the restriction on alienation as to the former regardless of their residence and as to the latter only where they reside outside the United States. No reason for making such a distinction is suggested; nor is any perceived by us. The relation of all these Indians to the United States was the same. All were emerging from the old Indian life-the Kickapoos not in advance of the others. Some of each of the designated tribes had migranted to Mexico and others of each were inclined to do so. It was this migration, accomplished and prospective, which led to the act. In short, the circumstances were such as to suggest that a line of distinction be drawn at residence in or out of the United States and not at membership in one or another of the designated tribes. This we think is what was intended. Although inartificially framed, the act taken as a whole comports with this view quite as well if not better than with the other, and due regard for the status and interests of the Indians affected, which always are to be considered in construing such laws,10 requires that it be preferred and given effect. Therefore we conclude that the qualifying phrase 'now or hereafter nonresident of the United States' applies to the Kickapoos as well as to the Shawnees, etc.\n In United States v. Estill, 62 F.(2d) 620, 621, the Circuit Court of Appeals applied the act as we construe it. That suit involved a conveyance by heirs of a Kickapoo who \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n had received an allotment in the Oklahoma reservation in 1894 and had died in Mexico in 1905. The heirs were Kickapoos who had received allotments in the same reservation in their own right. The court deemed their residence material and gave the matter particular attention. It said: 'The lower court also found, and the proof sustains it, that I-nesh-kin and Nah-she- pe-eth (the heirs) 'were adults and residing in the Republic of Mexico on the twenty-first day of June, 1906, and thereafter.\" The conveyance was made on a later date. Thus the heirs' inherited ownership and their residence in Mexico coincided before the conveyance was made. On the facts recited the court ruled that the case came within the act, and accordingly sustained the conveyance.\n That court disposed of the present case in the belief that its facts 'are not substantially different from the facts in United States v. Estill.' Whether this belief was occasioned by some inadvertence does not appear. But the real fact shown by the evidence, found by the District Court, and not questioned by the defendant, is that the son, although at an earlier time a resident of Mexico, became an actual resident of the Kickapoo reservation in Oklahoma in 1920, and resided there continuously thereafter. The mother, the allottee, died in 1929. Then, and not before, the son became her heir and inherited the land. At no time with him did ownership of the land and nonresidence in the United States coincide. That he had been a nonresident for several years ending nine years before the mother died in not material. During that period he had no right in the land and the restriction was of no concern to him. When later on he inherited the land nonresidence, the chief condition on which the act made removal of the restriction to depend, was wanting. He was then and thereafter an Indian, resident in the United States among the people of his tribe, and holding the land under the restricted trust patent given to his \n\n[290 U.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n mother. In our opinion such a situation was not within but outside the act, and the heir's conveyance to the defendant was void.\n Apparently the act has been a source of much trouble,11 and recently it has been repealed, but with saving clauses protecting rights lawfully acquired under it. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts Feb. 8, 1887, c. 119,  5, 24 Stat. 388 (25 USCA  348); March 3, 1893, c. 203, art. 4, 27 Stat. 557, 558. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Bowling v.

Coleman, both of Birmingham, Ala ., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., of Montgomery, Ala., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Union Bank & Trust Company, the petitioner, organized under the laws of Alabama and located in Montgomery county, receives deposits and carries on a general commercial and savings bank business. It sued respondent in a state court to recover $2,521.69, alleged to have been illegally exacted as taxes assessed for the year ending September 30, 1931. The assessment followed section 6, Revenue Act of Alabama, 1923 (General Acts, 1923, p. 152), which directs: 'Every share of any incorporated bank or banking association incorporated under the laws of this State, or any other state, or of the United States, shall be assessed for taxation in the county, and in the city or town where such bank is located at sixty per cent of its fair and reasonable market value.'\n During 1930, 1931, and 1932 there were building and loan associations, industrial loan companies and corporations, and industrial banks in Montgomery county which loaned money in substantial competition with petitioner to the extent of hundreds of thousands of dollars; the shares and the capital of which were exempted from ad valorem taxes. Also, there were mortgage companies and corporations, and individuals, persons, firms, and associations engaged in like business and employing moneyed capital to the extent of many thousands of dollars in substantial competition with petitioner, which were either untaxed or definitely exempted.\n The federal court had ruled that shares of national banks in Alabama could not be subjected to taxation under section 6, Act of 1923, since the tax was not laid in conformity with section 5219, U.S. Rev. Stats., as amended by the Acts of March 4, 1923, c. 267, 42 Stat. 1499, and March 25, 1926, c. 88, 44 Stat. 223 (12 USCA  548), which only permits taxation of shares of national banking associations at a rate no \n\n[288 U.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n greater than the one required of other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens coming into competition with the business of such associations. The state officers had accepted these decisions as correct declarations of the law.\n Petitioner based its claim to recover upon the theory that the tax assessed against its shares had been exacted in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; also in violation of sections 211 and 217, Constitution of Alabama, which provide that all taxes shall be assessed in exact proportion to value, and the property of private corporations, associations, and individuals shall be taxed at the same rate.\n The trial court gave judgment for petitioner. The Supreme Court reversed this action and denied any recovery, holding that the Legislature had not exceeded its powers in making classifications and exemptions; and, specifically, that there was no violation of the Federal Constitution.\n Only the federal question is before us. Was the petitioner denied equal protection of the laws?\n Because of existence within the state of untaxed moneyed capital and shares of corporations in actual competition with national banks, the shares of the latter during the years in question were not subject to ad valorem taxation under section 6, Revenue Act of Alabama of 1923, or otherwise. And the state Supreme Court so held.\n We cannot say that the state Legislature exceeded its power to make reasonable classification when it directed that moneyed capital or the property and shares of building and loan associations, industrial loan corporations, industrial banks, mortgage companies, etc., should be exempt from ad valorem taxation or taxed on a different basis from the one prescribed for banks accepting deposits and doing a general commercial business, notwithstanding actual competition between them. \n\n[288 U.S. 181, 186]\n\u00a0\n Mere competition between them is not enough to show two concerns must be burdened alike. The state Legislature reasonably might have determined that there was fair ground for distinction; and upon the record we may not hold that its action was arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unreasonable.\n There was sharp disagreement in the court below, but none of the judges suggested disapproval of the view just stated. The minority did not discuss the federal question, but found violation of the uniformity clause of the state Constitution.\n The doctrine applicable here was recently expounded in Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S.Ct. 310, and need not be restated.\n Counsel for petitioner stoutly maintain shares of state and national banks belong to the same species of property. Not only are they essentially similar, but for many years the revenue statutes of Alabama have put them in the same category. Under the scheme of taxation presently existing in the state, national bank shares escape assessment while shares of state banks are subject thereto. Consequently, the latter are deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n A sufficient answer is that within the intendment of the Fourteenth Amendment shares of national and state banks are not essentially the same when considered in connection with taxation. Nor do they become so merely because the state has attempted to subject them to like treatment.\n The several states lack power to tax national bank shares, except as expressly permitted by Congress. Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 664, 668\n, 19 S.Ct. 537; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 44 S.Ct. 23; First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 347\n, 46 S.Ct. 135. This is enough to negative the idea that shares of \n\n[288 U.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n national and state banks are essentially the same for purposes of taxation. And the Alabama Supreme Court has held that under her Constitution, although the Legislature may have included them in the same class of taxable objects, there is permissible distinction between them.\n To accept the doctrine that as the states can only tax a federal instrumentality when permitted by Congress, therefore they cannot tax competitors of such instrumentalities within their general jurisdiction in some other fashion without violating the Fourteenth Amendment, would be both illogical and destructive of their proper independence.\n Such instrumentalities are exempted from state taxation without the express consent of Congress, by the Federal Constitution. They are of a class wholly distinct from the property of ordinary corporations or individuals, and this fact cannot be disregarded by the state. If the state sees fit to tax unrestricted property within her jurisdiction, and to omit national bank shares, the classification cannot be said to be arbitrary and wholly unreasonable; the basis of it is plain enough. It may be vastly more important for the state to omit national bank shares and tax ordinary moneyed capital according to a plan not permissible in respect of national bank shares, rather than conform to the standard prescribed by Congress. There is nothing to indicate that Congress ever supposed that mere establishment of a national bank within a state could upset the scheme for taxation, theretofore entirely proper, by producing conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. This view would subject the taxing power of the state to the will of Congress far beyond what is necessary for the protection of federal agencies. The constitutional inhibition against taxing these agencies does not abridge the taxing power of the several states in respect of other property. The implied exemption is a shield for federal \n\n[288 U.S. 181, 188]\n\u00a0\n agencies; not the source of congressional power to control state action in respect of other matters.\n Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239\n, 52 S.Ct. 133, much relied upon by petitioner, is not controlling; the circumstances and issues there involved were wholly different from those here presented. The Iowa Supreme Court found, or assumed, and this was accepted here, that through the wrongful action of state taxing officials the complaining banks had been subjected to intentional, arbitrary, and systematic discrimination through assessments greatly in excess of those imposed upon competing moneyed capital; and the unequal exactions complained of were in violation of the Iowa laws. The points for decision in this Court concerned the effect of unauthorized action by state officers (Could such action be attributed to the State?) and the proper remedy. Unlawful inequality of treatment as between the banks and competing capital was not controverted. There was no occasion to consider whether failure by a state to tax national banks while subjecting her own banks to taxation would occasion discrimination against the latter forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES EX REL.

Returning, he landed from an airplane at Key West, Fla , and secured admission by Immigrant Inspector Phillips.\n December 15, 1930, Volpe was taken into custody under a warrant issued by the Secretary of Labor which charged him with being unlawfully in this country because 'he has been convicted of, or admits the commission of a \n\n[289 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n felony, or other crime or misdemeanor, involving moral turpitude, to-wit: possessing and passing counterfeit U.S. War Savings Stamps, prior to his entry into the United States.'\n Following a hearing, a warrant of deportation issued, and he was taken into custody. Claiming unlawful detention, he instituted habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court of the United States at Chicago. That court dismissed the petition and remanded him to the custody of S. D. Smith, district director of immigration at Chicago, for deportation. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (62 F.(2d) 808), and the matter is here by certiorari (\n289 \nU.S. 715\n, 53 S.Ct. 526, 77 L.Ed. --).\n The only substantial point which we need consider is this: Was the petitioner subject to deportation under the provisions of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 875, 889, 890 (U.S.C., title 8,  136, 155, 173 (8 USCA  136, 155, 173)). because he re-entered the United States from a foreign country after conviction during permitted residence in the United States of a crime committed therein which involved moral turpitude? Relevant provisions of the act of 1917 are in the margin. 1 \n\n[289 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n Upon this question federal courts have reached diverse views. The cases are cited in the opinion announced below in the present cause.\n We accept the view that the word 'entry' in the provision of section 19 which directs that 'any alien who was convicted, or who admits the commission, prior to entry, of a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; ... shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported,' includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one. And this requires affirmance of the challenged judgment.\n The power of Congress to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which aliens may enter or remain in the United States is no longer open to serious question. Turner v. Williams, \n194 \nU.S. 279\n, 24 S.Ct. 719; Low Wah Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 468\n, 32 S.Ct. 734; Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 U.S. 585\n, 5 1, 33 S.Ct. 607.\n That the second coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States is an entry within the usual acceptation of that word is clear enough from Lewis v. Frick, \n233 \nU.S. 291\n, 34 S.Ct. 488; United States ex rel. Claussen v. Day, \n279 \nU.S. 398\n, 49 S.Ct. 354.\n An examination of the Immigration Act of 1917, we think, reveals nothing sufficient to indicate that Congress did not intend the word 'entry' in section 19 should have its ordinary meaning. Aliens who have committed crimes while permitted to remain here may be decidedly more objectionable than persons who have transgressed laws of another country. \n\n[289 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n It may be true that, if Volpe had remained within the United States, he could not have been expelled because of his conviction of crime in 1925, more than five years after his original entry; but it does not follow that, after he voluntarily departed, he had the right of re-entry. In sufficiently plain language Congress has declared to the contrary.\n With hesitation, the Solicitor General suggested here that possibly the cause had abated, since S. D. Smith is no longer district director of immigration at Chicago, where he formerly held the petitioner in custody. The record indicates that Smith has continued to be an officer in the Department of Labor, although not presently stationed at Chicago. So far as we are advised, under existing regulations, he may carry into effect the order of deportation. Moreover, the cause was permitted to proceed without question, as instituted, long after Smith is said to have left Chicago; and the petitioner insists that no cause has been shown for abatement. The point, we think, lacks merit.\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1: That 'the word 'alien' wherever used in this subchapter shall include any person not a native-born or naturalized citizen of the United States. ...'\n Section 3: That 'the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: ... Persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. ...'\n Section 19: That 'at any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law; any alien who shall have entered or who shall be found in the United States in violation of this subchapter, or in violation of any other law of the United States; ... except as hereinafter provided, any alien who ... is (hereafter) sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States, or who is (hereafter) sentenced more than once to such a term of imprisonment because of conviction in this country of any crime involving moral turpitude, committed at any time after entry; ... any alien who was convicted, or who admits the commission, prior to entry, of a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; at any time within three years after entry, any alien ... who enters without inspection, shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. BURROUGHS(1933)\nNo. 683\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 159, 160]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr.Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Robert H. McNeill and Levi H. David, both of Washington, D.C., for Burroughs and Cannon.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia has certified the following questions:\n'Question No. 1: Where on a criminal indictment a demurrer is sustained and the indictment quashed on two grounds, one involving a construction of the statute and the other the interpretation of the indictment as a pleading, will an appeal lie at the instance of the United States from the trial court of the District of Columbia to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia?\n\n'If Question No. 1 be answered in the affirmative, then\n\n'Question No. 2: May the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia on such appeal review the ruling of the trial court based on the construction of the statute?' \n\n[289 U.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n We are advised by the certificate that the defendants were indicted by a grand jury of the District of Columbia for violation of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. \n1\n They interposed a demurrer asserting that the conduct imputed to them did not constitute the offense defined by the act, and that, in any event, the indictment was insufficient as a pleading in omitting to aver knowledge on the part of the defendants, which was claimed to be an essential element of the crime. From a judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia sustaining the demurrer and quashing the indictment the Government appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appellees contended that court lacked jurisdiction, since the Criminal Appeals Act2 governs the right of review in such cases and permits only a direct appeal to this court. The solution of the questions propounded therefore requires that we answer another: Does the Criminal Appeals Act embrace cases triable in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia?\n\n In the absence of express statutory authority no appeal may be taken on behalf of the United States in any criminal case. United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n, 12 S.Ct. 609; United States v. Ainsworth, 3 App.D.C. 483. March 3, 1901, Congress adopted the Code of Law for the District of Columbia, 3 whereby it defined the jurisdiction of the police court and the Supreme Court of the District, sanctioned appeals from both to the Court of Appeals, and by section 935 enacted:4 'In all criminal prosecutions the United States or the District of Columbia, as the case may be, shall have the \n\n[289 U.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n same right of appeal that is given to the defendant, including the right to a bill of exceptions: Provided, That if on such appeal it shall be found that there was error in the rulings of the court during a trial, a verdict in favor of the defendant shall not be set aside.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Criminal Appeals Act was not adopted until 1907. It authorized a writ of error (now an appeal) 'by and on behalf of the United States from the district (or circuit) courts direct to' this court 'in all criminal cases, in the following instances.' Three classes are enumerated: Decisions quashing or sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute on which the indictment is founded; decisions arresting judgment for insufficiency of the indictment, based upon such invalidity or construction of the statute; and decisions sustaining a special plea in bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy. No appeal is permitted where there has been a verdict in favor of the defendant. The Court of Appeals holding this act, so far as applicable, superseded section 935 of the District Code,6 desires a ruling as to its jurisdiction on appeal where a decision will involve both a construction of the statute on which the indictment is based and a ruling as to the validity of the indictment as a pleading. We think, however, the answer is clear; for we are of opinion that the Criminal Appeals Act is inapplicable to criminal cases tried in the Supreme Court of the District. These are regulated solely by section 935 of the Code of 1901 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 6,  355).\n It is said that the Criminal Appeals Act is pertinent because the Code provides that the Supreme Court is to \n\n[289 U.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n be 'deemed a court of the United States'; 7 (compare Embry v. Palmer, \n107 \nU.S. 3\n, 2 S.Ct. 25) but designation of a tribunal as a court of the United States, does not constitute it a district court. In re Mills, \n135 \nU.S. 263, 267\n, 268 S., 10 S.Ct. 762; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445\n, 19 S.Ct. 722\n\n\n Appellees further urge the statement in the Code8 that the Supreme Court 'shall possess the same powers and exercise the same jurisdiction as the district courts of the United States' has the effect of making it a district court as that phrase is used in the Criminal Appeals Act. Where a statute uses this or similar language to define the jurisdiction of a court such a court is authorized to try statutory actions declared to be cognizable by district courts, as if the tribunal were in fact a district court of the United States. And the same rule is applicable to appellate proceedings. Compare In re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 494\n, 12 S.Ct. 453; Hine v. Morse, \n218 \nU.S. 493\n, 31 S.Ct. 37, 21 Ann. Cas. 782; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n274 \nU.S. 145, 154\n, 47 S.Ct. 557; United States v. California Coo perative Canneries, \n279 \nU.S. 553, 558\n, 49 S.Ct. 423. But vesting a court with 'the same jurisdiction as is vested in district courts' does not make it a district court of the United States. This has been repeatedly said with reference to territorial courts. Reynolds v. United States, \n98 U.S. 145\n, 154; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, supra, page 476 of 174 U.S ., 19 S.Ct. 722; Summers v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 92, 101\n, 34 S.Ct. 38.\n The Criminal Appeals Act in naming the courts from which appeals may be taken to this court employs the phrase 'district courts'; not 'courts of the United States,' or 'courts exercising the same jurisdiction as district courts.' We need not, however, determine whether the statute should be construed to embrace criminal cases tried in the Supreme Court of the District if section 935 of the District Code were not in effect. That \n\n[289 U.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n section deals comprehensively with appeals in criminal cases from all of the courts of first instance of the District and confers on the Court of Appeals jurisdiction of appeals by the Government seeking review of the judgments of those courts. The Criminal Appeals Act, on the other hand, affects only certain specified classes of decisions in district courts, contains no repealing clause, and no reference to the courts of the District of Columbia or the territorial courts, upon many of which jurisdiction is conferred by language quite similar to that of the Code of Law of the District. \n9\n We cannot construe it as impliedly repealing the complete appellate system created for the District of Columbia by section 935 of the Code 1901 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 6,  355), in the absence of expression on the part of Congress indicating that purpose. Implied repeals are not favored, and if effect can reasonably be given to both statutes the presumption is that the earlier is intended to remain in force. Frost v.

CHAVEZ(1933)\nNo. 162\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Mexico. \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. George R. Craig, of Albuquerque, N.M., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By indictment in the federal District Court for New Mexico Gregorio Chavez and Jose Maria Chavez, described as 'non-Indians,' were charged with the larceny, on January 3, 1932, 'at and within the limits of the Pueblo of Isleta, the same being Indian Country, in the State and district of New Mexico,' of certain live stock belonging to designated Indians of that pueblo. By a demurrer, the defendants challenged the indictment as not stating an offense against the United States, and in support of the challenge asserted (1) that the pueblo of Isleta is not Indian country within the meaning of the statutes whereon the indictment is founded; and ( 2) \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n that, even if the pueblo be Indian country, larceny committed therein by the who is not an Indian is not within those statutes. The court sustained the demurrer, dismissed the indictment, and gave a certificate declaring in effect that the judgment was put entirely on the ground that when the statutes underlying the indictment are properly construed-and particularly when construed in the light of the act enabling New Mexico to become a state-they do not make larceny within the pueblo of Isleta by one not an Indian, even of property belonging to an Indian, an offense against the United States, but leave the same to be dealt with exclusively by and under the laws of the state.\n The case is here on appeal by the United States under the criminal appeals law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n By sections 451 and 466, title 18, U.S.C. (18 USCA  451, 466),2 larceny committed in any place 'under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States' is made an offense against the United States, the punishment described varying according to the value of the property stolen; and by section 217, title 25, U.S.C. (25 USCA  217),3 the general laws of the United States relating to the punishment of crimes committed in any place within its exclusive jurisdiction are extended, with exceptions not material here, to 'the Indian country.' These are the statutes on which the present indictment is founded.\n By the Enabling Act of June 20, 1910,4 and two subsequent Joint Resolutions,5 Congress provided for the admission of New Mexico into the Union as a state 'on an \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n equal footing with the original States.' Compliance with stated conditions was made a prerequisite to the admission, and these conditions were complied with. The admission became effective through a Proclamation of the President on January 6, 1912.6 One of the conditions related to Indians and Indian lands and to the respective relations thereto of the United States and the state. The provisions embodying this condition are copied in an appended note. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The lands of the pueblo of Isleta, like those of other pueblos of New Mexico, are held and occupied by the people of the pueblo in communal ownership under a grant which was made during the Spanish sovereignty, \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n was recognized during the Mexican dominion, and has since been confirmed by the United States.\n The people of these pueblos, although sedentary rather than nomadic, and disposed to peace and industry, are Indians in race, customs, and domestic government. Always living in separate communities, adhering to primitive modes of life, largely influenced by superstition and fetichism, and chiefly governed according to crude customs inherited from their ancestors, they are essentially a simple, uninformed, and dependent people, easily victimized, and ill-prepared to cope with the superior intelligence and cunning of others. By a uniform course of action, beginning as early as 1854 and continued up to the present time, the legislative and executive branches of the government have regarded and treated them as dependent Indian communities requiring and entitled to its aid and protection, like other Indian tribes. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n In 1904 the territorial court, finding no congressional enactment expressly declaring these people in a state of tutelage or assuming direct control of their property, held their lands taxable like the lands of others. \n9\n But Congress quickly forbade such taxation by providing:10\n'That the lands now held by the various villages or pueblos of Pueblo Indians, or by individual members thereof, within Pueblo reservations or lands, in the Territory of New Mexico, and all personal property furnished \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n said Indians by the United States, or used in cultivating said lands, and any cattle and sheep now possessed or that may hereafter be acquired by said Indians shall be free and exempt from taxation of any sort whatsoever, including taxes heretofore levied, if any, until Congress shall otherwise provide.'\n\n In 1907 the territorial court, for a like reason, held that the Pueblo Indians were not wards of the government in the sense of the legislation forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquor to Indians and its introduction into the Indian country. \n11\n But that decision was soon followed by the declaration, in the Enabling Act of 1910, that 'the terms 'Indian' and 'Indian country' shall include the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico and the lands now owned or occupied by them.' And in 1924 Congress, in taking measures to protect these Indians in their land titles, expressly asserted for the United States the status and powers belonging to it 'as guardian of said Pueblo Indians.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n In United States v. Sandoval, \n231 \nU.S. 28\n, 34 S.Ct. 1, this court, after full examination of the subject, held that the status of the Indians of the several pueblos in New Mexico is that of dependent Indian tribes under the guardianship of the United States, and that by reason of this status they and their lands are subject to the legislation of Congress enacted for the protection of tribal Indians and their property. We there said (pages 45, 46 of 231 U.S., 34 S.Ct. 1, 5):\n'Not only does the Constitution expressly authorize Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, but long-continued legislative and executive usage and an unbroken current of judicial decisions have attributed to the United States as a superior and civilized nation the power and the duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n borders, whether within its original territory or territory subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the limits of a state. ...\n\n'Of course, it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe, but only that in respect of distinctly Indian communities the questions whether, to what extent, and for what time they shall be recognized and dealt with as dependent tribes requiring the guardianship and protection of the United States are to be determined by Congress, and not by the courts.'\n\n We then pointed out that neither their citizenship, if they are citizens, nor their communal ownership of the full title in fee simple, is an obstacle to the exercise of such guardianship over them and their property. We also there disapproved and declined to follow the decision in the early case of United States v. Joseph, \n94 U.S. 614\n, relating to these Indians, because it was based upon reported data which in the meantime had been found to be at variance with recognized sources of information and with the long-continued action of the legislative and executive departments.\n In United States v. Candelaria, \n271 \nU.S. 432\n, 46 S.Ct. 561, we were called upon to determine whether the people of a pueblo in New Mexico were a 'tribe of Indians' within the meaning of section 2116 of the Revised Statutes (25 USCA  177), declaring that no purchase of lands 'from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians' shall be of any validity unless made with specified safeguards; and the conclusion to which we came, and the reasons for it, are shown in the following excerpt from the opinion (pages 441, 442 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 561, 563):\n'This provision was originally adopted in 1834 (4 Stat. 730, c 161,  12), and, with others 'regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,' was extended over 'the Indian tribes' of New Mexico in 1851, 9 Stat. 587, c. 14,  7. \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n 'While there is no express reference in the provision to Pueblo Indians, we think it must be taken as including them. They are plainly within its spirit, and, in our opinion, fairly within its words, 'any tribe of Indians.' Although sedentary, industrious, and disposed to peace, they are Indians in race, customs, and domestic government, always have lived in isolated communities, and are a simple, uninformed people, ill- prepared to cope with the intelligence and greed of other races. It therefore is difficult to believe that Congress in 1851 was not intending to protect them, but only the nomadic and savage Indians then living in New Mexico. A more reasonable view is that the term 'Indian tribe' was used in the acts of 1834 and 1851 in the sense of 'a body of Indians of the same or a similar race, united in a community under one leadership or government, and inhabiting a particular, though sometimes ill-defined, territory.' Montoya v. United States, \n180 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 21 S.Ct. 358, 359. In that sense the term easily includes Pueblo Indians.'\n\n Section 217 now being considered, like the section considered in that case, was originally a part of the act of 1834. One speaks of 'Indian country' and the other of an 'Indian nation or tribe of Indians.' The act as a whole makes it apparent that the term 'Indian country' was intended to include any unceded lands owned or occupied by an Indian nation or tribe of Indians, and the term continues to have that meaning, save in instances where the context shows that a different meaning is intended. \n13\n Nothing in any of the statutes now being considered requires that it be given a different meaning in this instance.\n It follows from what has been said that the people of the pueblo of Isleta are Indian wards of the United States; that the lands owned and occupied by them under \n\n[290 U.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n their ancient grant are Indian country in the sense of section 217; that the United States, in virtue of its guardianship, has full power to punish crimes committed within the limits of the pueblo lands by or against the Indians or against their property, even though, where the offense is against an Indian or his property, the offender be not an Indian;14 and that the statutes in question, rightly construed, include the offense charged in the indictment.\n There is nothing in the Enabling Act which makes against the views here expressed. True, it declares, in keeping with the constitutional rule that the state shall be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original states. But the principle of equality is not disturbed by a legitimate exertion by the United States of its constitutional power in respect of its Indian wards and their property. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n As the District Court's judgment rested upon a mistaken construction of the statutes, the judgment cannot stand.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (U.S.C.,  682, title 18 (18 USCA  682)), and section 345, title 28, U.S.C.

William D. Mitchell, Atty. Gen., and John LordO'Brian, Asst. to the Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert E. Quirk, of Washington, D.C., Ralph R. Bradley, of Chicago, Ill., and Claude D. Cass, of Washington, D.C., for appellee.\n\n\n[288 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought pursuant to section 12(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended,1 to enjoin the appellee from issuing any securities or assuming any obligation or liability in respect of the securities of others without first having obtained an order from the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing such action, as required by section 20a of the act. \n2\n The petition avers appellee's intention to issue or become guarantor of securities in violation of the last-mentioned section.\n The District Court, after making detailed and elaborate fact findings, concluded as matter of law that the rail- \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n road was an independently operated electric interurban railway expressly excepted from the requirements of the section. The question is whether the facts found warrant the decision.\n Section 20a forbids a carrier to issue shares, bonds, or obligations, evidence of interest or indebtedness, or to assume any obligation or liability of any other person or corporation, unless the commission, upon application, after investigation, shall by order authorize such issue or assumption, as within the applicant's corporate purpose and compatible with the public interest. After prescribing the procedure before the commission, and declaring its jurisdiction plenary and exclusive, the section enacts that securities or obligations not issued pursuant to its terms shall be void, and imposes civil and criminal liability upon officers and directors participating in their creation.\n Paragraph 1 provides: 'As used in this section the term 'carrier' means a common carrier by railroad (except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway which is not operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of transportation). ...'\n The properties of the appellee have developed, through various transfers and reorganizations, out of a street railway company organized more than twenty-five years ago. The company has for some years owned and operated in interstate commerce an electrified railroad, the main line of which extends from Chicago, Ill., to Milwaukee, Wis. There are 138 route miles of line, 132 miles of second track, and 42 miles of yard and other track. About 40 miles of main and second track are in city streets, on some of which the appellee operates in common with street cars and vehicular traffic. In addition to the main line between Chicago and Milwaukee, there is an alternate line for part of the distance; a branch some 36 miles in length; and two other branches, one of which is 3 and \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n the other 8 miles long. Operation in Chicago is over the elevated tracks of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company from the south side northerly through the loop district to a point on the north side (approximately 16 miles). Thence the line runs northerly through Chicago and Evanston to Wilmette, approximately 8 miles, over elevated dirt fill tracks owned by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, leased by the appellee jointly with the Chicago Rapid Transit Company. The remainder of the appellee's lines are upon its own right of way, or in streets the use of which is granted by local franchise. The total laid under local franchises, outside of Milwaukee, is approximately 3 miles; in the latter city the operation for 2.67 miles is over the tracks of a street surface railway owned by the appellee.\n Twenty fast through passenger trains are operated daily in each direction between downtown Chicago and downtown Milwaukee with a running time equalling that of the fastest trains of the Chicago & Northwestern Railway, which operates fifteen through trains daily between the same cities. Dining cars and parlor cars are included in some of the appellee's fast trains. Modern, well-equipped passenger stations are maintained at a number of points; 51 have agents selling passenger tickets; at some 96 places shelters and platforms are maintained, at 35 platforms only; and at 42 locations at which certain trains stop at streets or highways no facilities are provided. Through railroad and Pullman tickets are sold to any part of the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Local passenger fares are computed on the mileage basis used by steam railroads.\n Appellee's tracks are of standard gauge, and are physically connected with those of four steam railroads at some thirteen points, and with those of three electric lines. Eight connections are used for handling interchange carload freight. The railroad has substantial facilities for \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n serving various industries located on its lines, such as side, industrial, team, and switch tracks, and freight classification tracks. It owns seven electric locomotives which are of a small type and unable to haul freight trains of the size usually employed by steam railroads, and 114 freight cars which have no electrical equipment and are interchangeable with steam railroads. Sixteen local freight tariffs are published; in 206 tariffs the railroad participates as initial carrier, and in more than 800 as a delivering or intermediate carrier, in conjunction with steam railroads.\n The total transportation revenue in 1930 was over $6,000,000, about 76 per cent. from passenger traffic, and about 22 per cent. from freight. This ratio has been substantially maintained for some years. In 1930, 87 per cent. of carload freight traffic was interchange, and 78 per cent. of all freight traffic was interline, but only 42 per cent. of freight revenue was derived from interline business.\n Locomotives are not employed in the passenger service, the cars having installed electrical equipment, and being somewhat shorter and narrower than standard passenger railroad coaches. Freight is hauled by electric locomotives. A merchandise package delivery freight service is supplied by cars similar to baggage cars used on steam railroads, having self-contained electric equipment, operated from the loop in Chicago to Milwaukee in trains of from one to five cars. At certain points gantlet tracks are required for handling freight cars, as the clearances on the main line are insufficient to permit their passage. Grades are much heavier than those customary on steam railroads, and some of the curves are of so short a radius as not to permit the passage of a steam locomotive. The company maintains no facilities for receipt or delivery of carload freight at its terminii in Chicago and Milwaukee, and cannot accomplish interchange of such freight at either; connections for this purpose being outside those cities. \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n The railroad was constructed to afford a fast electric passenger service between Chicago and Milwaukee and suburban passenger service into and out of Chicago. The freight business is subsidiary to this primary function, and is not fairly comparable to that ordinarily transacted by a standard steam railroad. Passenger traffic, whether measured by car service or by gross earnings, heavily preponderates over interline freight business. The main terminals serve only the passenger and merchandise freight traffic.\n We thus have a typical example of an interurban electric line for passenger service, which has developed, in addition, such freight traffic as could advantageously be undertaken without interfering with performance of the main purpose of the carrier. The facts differentiate the present case from Piedmont & Northern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n286 \nU.S. 299\n, 52 S.Ct. 541, 545. There the railway was predominantly a carrier of interchange carload freight, and the proposed extension of line, which was the subject of that litigation, had as its object the creation of a link in a trunkline route composed of the electric line and a number of steam railroads, which would divert from other steam railroad trunk-line routes some $4,000,000 of revenue annually. The purely local traffic in freight, passengers, baggage, and express was there relatively inconsequential; but here greatly preponderates. It was there said: 'In cases where an appreciation of the facts is requisite to proper classification, it is not always easy to draw the line. Instances may be supposed where great difficulty might be experienced in determining whether an electric railway line falls within or without the exception of paragraph (22) (49 USCA  1(22) which is couched in the same words as the exception in section 20a(1)). But this is not such a case. The facts clearly require a holding that petitioner's railway is not within the true intent and purpose of the exclusion intended by the paragraph.' If the \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n status of the appellee were a matter of first impression, we should, though the decision is not free from difficulty, be inclined to hold section 20a inapplicable. But, for the reasons about to be stated, we consider the question settled.\n The definitions embodied in section 1, paragraphs (2)(a) and (3), 49 USCA  1(2)(a), (3), embrace the appellee and render it subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by the remaining sections, unless excepted by their terms. Interurban electric railways are expressly saved from the requirement of sections 1(18) to (21), inclusive, 15a and 20a, 49 USCA  1 (18 to 21), 15a, 20a. The language of the excepting clauses in the first and third instances is identical except for the use in one case of the singular and in the other of the plural number. That applicable to 15a, which is the section providing for fixing rates to yield a fair return and for recapture, differs in substance from the two others, and is: 'Excluding ... (c) interurban electric railways unless operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of transportation or engaged in the general transportation of freight.'\n As indicated in the Piedmont Case, supra, the phrase 'interurban electric railway' may not in all circumstances be susceptible of exact definition. The Commission has realized the difficulty. In its thirty- fifth annual report, for 1921, this was said (page 21):\n'Under the law as it now stands, we have no jurisdiction over the issuance of securities of a 'street, suburban, or interurban electric railway which is not operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of transportation.' Certain electric railways independently operated are engaged in the general transportation of freight in interstate commerce in addition to the transportation of passengers. The use of electricity as motive power for railways is rapidly increasing. Some electric lines correspond substantially to steam roads in all important particulars except that of motive power. Under Section 15a \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n of the act we are given authority to include in groups of carriers for rate-making purposes such interurban electric lines as are engaged in the general transportation of freight. It seems desirable that Section 20a of the interstate commerce act be so amended as to indicate definitely the classes of electric railway companies subject to that section.'\n\n The recommendation was repeated in the annual reports for 1923, 1924, and 1925.3 In the report for 1928 (page 83) the following appears:\n'That the present exemption provisions of paragraph (22) of section 1, paragraph (1) of section 15a, and paragraph (1) of section 20a, applicable to electric railways, be amended by substituting provisions exempting all electric railways except such as interchange standard freight equipment with steam railways and participate in through interstate freight rates with such carriers; provision to be made for exemption of particular electric railways falling within the excepted class, if upon application they are able to show to the satisfaction of the commission, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that they are not affected with an important national interest so far as the provisions in question are concerned.'\n\n See, also, the 1929 report, p. 89.\n The position heretofore taken by the Commission with respect to the appellee is of great significance. In 1923 a brief was filed with the Commission supporting the view that section 15(a) had no application to the company because it was an interurban electric railway not operated as part of a general steam railroad system of transportation and not engaged in the general transportation of freight. The Director of the Bureau of Finance replied that, unless later advised to the contrary, the carrier would \n\n[288 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n not be required to file returns under the section. No such advice has ever been communicated to the appellee.\n The District Court finds that since July, 1916, when the Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee Railroad, the immediate predecessor of appellee, acquired the properties, the appellee and its predecessors have issued securities aggregating $71,327,200 par value. Of this total $61,662,600 have been issued since March 1, 1920, the date of the incorporation of section 20a into the Interstate Commerce Act. All of these securities were issued upon the authority and with the approval of the regulating commissions of Wisconsin and Illinois, and, of those issued since March 1, 1920, $38,935,608 were outstanding in the hands of the public on April 30, 1931. The required annual reports filed by the appellee with the Commission have shown all securities issued since March 1, 1920, and in compliance with the rules have stated that these issues were each approved by the state commissions.\n With this knowledge of the situation the Commission never, until it requested the Attorney General to institute the present suit, by word or act intimated that the procedure followed by the railroad was illegal or the state regulatory bodies without jurisdiction. It would be difficult indeed to conceive a clearer case of uniform administrative construction of section 20a as applied to this company. Conceding that the proper classification of the railway is not free from difficulty, all doubt is removed by the application of the rule that settled administrative construction is entitled to great weight and should not be overturned except for cogent reasons.

Evidently entertaining serious doubts on this question, it has for more than a decade resolved them in favor of the carrier, and the company and its officers have acted in reliance on the administrative tribunal's construction of the statute. At this late day the courts ought not to uphold an application of the law contradictory of this settled administrative interpretation.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Code, tit. 49,  12(1), 49 USCA  12(1). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S. Code, tit. 49,  20a. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Annual Report of Interstate Commerce Commission for 1923, p. 70; Report for 1924, p. 78; Report for 1925, p. 72. \n\n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Herman J. Galloway, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a North Dakota corporation, in making its tax return of income derived from its operation of oil wells in 1926, claimed a deduction from gross income of a depreciation allowance on account of the capitalized costs of preliminary development and drilling. The Commissioner refused to allow the deduction claimed, ruling that it was for depletion, not depreciation, and was therefore included in the statutory depletion allowance of 27 1\/2 per cent. of the gross income, which the respondent had also deducted. Sections 204(c), 234(a)(8), Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 14, 16, 41, 26 USCA  935(c), 986( a)(8). Having paid the correspondingly increased tax, respondent brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the excess. The court gave judgment for respondent, holding that the development and drilling costs were the proper subjects of a depreciation allowance which should have been made in addition to that for depletion. 59 F.(2d) 853. This Court granted certiorari (\n287 \nU.S. 591\n, 53 S.Ct. 120, 77 L.Ed. --) to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Burnet v. Petroleum Exploration, 61 F.(2d) 273.\n The Revenue Act of 1926, like earlier acts,1 provided generally that 'in the case of ... oil and gas wells,' taxpayers should be allowed, as a deduction from gross income, 'a reasonable allowance for depletion and for \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case'; such allowance 'in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.' Section 234(a)(8). The earlier acts provided that depletion should be allowed on the basis of cost unless the taxpayer was the discoverer of the well upon an unproven tract, in which case the basis was the 'value of the property' at the time of the discovery or within 30 days thereafter. \n2\n See Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, decided January 9, 1933. But the 'discovery value' provision was eliminated from the act of 1926, which is applicable here, and the taxpayer was permitted to calculate depletion on the basis of cost alone, section 204(c), 26 USCA  935(c), or else to deduct an arbitrary allowance, fixed by the statute, without reference to cost or discovery value, at 27 1\/2 per cent. of gross income from the well. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Articles 223 and 225 of Treasury Regulations 69, under the Revenue Act of 1926, were followed by the Commissioner in assessing the present tax. Article 223 purports to permit the taxpayer to choose whether to deduct costs of development and drilling as a development expense in the year in which they occur or else to charge them 'to capital account returnable through depletion.' In the \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n latter event, which is the case here, 'in so far as such expense is represented by physical property, it may be taken into account in determining a reasonable allowance for depreciation,' which, if the arbitrary deduction for depletion were claimed, would constitute an additional allowance. Article 225 limits the depreciation for which an allowance may be made to that of 'physical property, such as machinery, tools, equipment, pipes,' etc. We do not doubt that the effect of this language is to require the taxpayer to look to the depletion allowance, in this case 27 1\/2 per cent. of gross income, for a return of the costs of developing and drilling the well, which are involved here.\n Respondent challenges the validity of the regulations thus applied as in conflict with section 234(a)(8), 26 USCA  986(a)(8), which allows the deduction of a reasonable allowance 'for depreciation of improvements' in addition to the deduction for depletion. It is urged that the drill hole is an 'improvement' of the taxpayer's oil land, and that no logical distinction in accounting practice can be made between the cost of this improvement and the cost of buildings and machinery placed on the property for the operation of the well, for which depreciation should admittedly be allowed.\n The government argues that the well itself is not tangible physical property which wears out with use so as properly to be the subject of depreciation, and that in any event the regulations are based upon the practices of the oil industry, and are within the requirements of section 234(a)(8) that a reasonable allowance for depletion and depreciation of improvements be made in all cases under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Treasury Department.\n We do not stop to inquire whether, under correct accounting practice, an anticipated loss of a part of the capitalized cost of developing and drilling an oil well because of decreased utility of the well would be described or treated differently than wear and tear of the machinery \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n used in production, or whether an allowance for the former serves a purpose logically distinguishable from one for the latter. For the issue before us, whether the statute requires the former to be treated as depletion, is resolved by the history of the legislation and the administrative practice under it.\n The Revenue Act of 1916 permitted the deduction of a reasonable allowance for the 'exhaustion, wear and tear of property' used in a business or trade and in the case of oil and gas wells 'a reasonable allowance for actual reduction in flow and production.' Section 12(b) Second (39 Stat. 767). The regulations authorized the deduction of an annual allowance for 'depreciation,' and, in the case of oil and gas wells, for 'depletion' (Treasury Regulations 33, arts. 159, 160, 162, 170), but ruled that no annual deduction for 'obsolescence' was authorized by the statute in any case; such a loss it was provided might only be deducted in the year when it became complete by abandonment of the property as no longer useful. See articles 162, 178, 179 of Treasury Regulations 33; Gambrinus Brewery Co. v. Anderson, \n282 \nU.S. 638, 643\n, 51 S.Ct. 260. In defining these terms, therefore, the Department was apparently faced with the practical consequence that no annual deduction could be made in anticipation of those losses which it regarded as attributable to obsolescence, while such a deduction might be made for those which it attributed to depreciation or depletion. Depreciation was defined generally to include the wear and tear and exhaustion of property by use, and obsolescence, the loss in value of property due to the fact that because of changing conditions it has ceased to be useful.\n Plainly, under these definitions the loss in value of the drill hole for an oil well, because of the approaching exhaustion of the oil in the ground, was not to be treated as depreciation. Article 170 of Regulations 33 neces \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n sarily ruled that it was not to be treated as obsolescence by declaring that the purpose of the statutory provision relative to oil wells was to return, through the aggregate of annual depletion deductions, the taxpayer's capital investment in the oil, including 'the cost of development (other than the cost of physical property incident to such development).' Article 170 thus contemplated that an annual deduction should be made for costs of development by including them in the cost of the oil in the ground for which a depletion allowance was authorized by section 12(b), Second, 'for actual reduction in flow and production.'\n While the Revenue Acts which followed that of 1916 provided that taxpayers generally might deduct 'a reasonable allowance for obsolescence' in addition to that 'for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business,'4 in each of them the section expressly applicable to oil and gas wells,5 omitted the word obsolescence and provided, in terms, only for the deduction of an allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements. Whatever doubts this omission may have suggested as to the propriety of an allowance for obsolescence in the case of oil and gas wells, raising the same problem as that under the act of 1916, the question whether an allowance should be made for development and drilling costs was set at rest, where cost was the basis of depletion and depreciation of improvements, by the express language of the acts of 1918 and 1921, that the cost basis should include 'costs of development not otherwise deducted.' But the questions remained whether the allowance was to be treated as for depreciation or depletion, and, more important, whether any allowance could be made for development costs when the basis of depletion \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n was discovery value rather than cost. \n6\n In answering these questions, the Department adhered to and made explicit the position taken by it under the 1916 act that development costs other than the cost of physical property incident to the development must be returned through the depletion allowance, but the regulations also provided expressly that the cost of 'physical property such as machinery, tools, equipment, pipes, etc.,' should be returned by an annual allowance for depreciation. Articles 223, 225 of Treasury Regulations 45 under the Revenue Act of 1918. The distinction thus taken was continued in the regulations under the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926,7 although beginning with that of 1924 the express declaration of the statute, already noted, that the cost basis for depletion and depreciation of improvements should include costs of development was eliminated, leaving the broad provision that a reasonable allowance should in all cases be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary.\n Doubts arising because of the silence of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and later years as to whether costs of development and drilling were to be included in depletion when based on discovery value were resolved by the regulations already noted and by the addition of another. Article 220(a)(3) of Treasury Regulations 45 provided that 'the 'property' which may be valued after discovery is the 'well.' For the purposes of these sections the 'well' is the drill hole, the surface necessary for the \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n drilling and operation of the well, the oil or gas content of the particular sand, zone or reservoir ... in which the discovery was made by the drilling, and from which the production is drawn.' By including the drill hole in the property to be valued for depletion under section 234(a)( 9), this article necessarily carried forward the distinction taken under the 1916 act between drilling costs, subject to depletion allowance, and costs of machinery, tools, and equipment, subject to allowance for depreciation. Section 234(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1921 and section 204( c) of the Revenue Act of 1924 continued the provisions of the 1918 act, and this regulation remained unchanged. \n8\n It was eliminated under the 1926 act, being no longer necessary, as the statute omitted the 'discovery value' provision and substituted the arbitrary percentage allowance for depletion. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Thus the acts of 1918, 1921, and 1924 were consistently construed by the regulations to permit a depletion, but not a depreciation allowance for the costs of development work and drilling, which were treated for this purpose either as a part of the cost or an addition to the discovery value of the oil in the ground. The administrative construction must be deemed to have received legislative approval by the re-enactment of the statutory provision, without material change. Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, decided December 5, 1932; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115.\n Respondent argues that whatever effect may be attributed to earlier re-enactments, that of 1926, which is applicable here, is without force because section 204 of that act abandoned discovery value as the basis of depletion and permitted the taxpayer to abandon cost and substitute a fixed allowance of 27 1\/2 per cent. of gross income from the well. We think the contention unfounded, and that, on \n\n[288 U.S. 459, 467]\n\u00a0\n the contrary, what was included in the reasonable allowance for depletion by the established construction of the earlier acts gave significant content to the word as used in the act of 1926. There is no ground for supposing that Congress, by providing a new method for computing the allowance for depletion, intended to break with the past and narrow the function of that allowance. The reasonable inference is that it did not, and that depletion includes under the 1926 act precisely what it included under the earlier acts. The regulations under the 1926 act so ruled, as has been shown, by continuing the provisions of earlier regulations under which costs of development and drilling were returnable by the depletion allowance and not by an additional allowance for depreciation. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the Board of Tax Appeals in construing the 1924 and 1926 acts has held that capitalized drilling costs are subject to a depreciation rather than a depletion allowance. Jergins Trust v. Commissioner, 22 B.T.A. 551; Ziegler v. Commissioner, 23 B.T.A. 1091; P-M- K Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, 24 B.T.A. 360. But these cases were all decided after the enactment of the 1926 act and did not consider the administrative and legislative history, which we think decisive.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 234(a)(9), Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1077); section 234( a)(9), Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 254); section 234(a)(8), Revenue Act of 1924, 26 USCA  986(a)(8). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 234(a)(9), Revenue Act of 1918; section 234(a)(3), Revenue Act of 1921; section 204(c), Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  935 note). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sec. 204.

Harry Covington, and John Marshall, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Seth W. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relators, petitioners here, filed their petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers to authorize the construction of a wharf in the Potomac river within the District of Columbia adjacent to their land on the Virginia shore, the construction being forbidden by section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151, 33 U. S.C.  403 (33 USCA  403), 'except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War.' The Judgment of the Supreme Court denying the writ was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals. 61 App.D.C. 360, 63 F.(2d) 137. This Court granted certiorari. \n288 \nU.S. 598\n, 53 S.Ct. 507, 77 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioners claim title through a grant to their predecessors in interest of a plot of upland lying in the \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n state of Virginia, which extended at the time of the grant to the Potomac river. The upland has been enlarged by the recession of the river toward the north, and it is the contention of the petitioners that the enlargement is due to accretion, with the result that their ownership has been extended beyond the shore line of the river, as it existed at the time of the grant, to the present high-water line, a claim which is put in issue by the answer. But it is conceded that the bed of the river below high-water mark, where the proposed wharf is to be built, lies within the District of Columbia, and that title to it and sovereignty over it were vested in the United States by cession from the state of Maryland of the area constituting the present District of Columbia. See Maryland Laws, 2 Kilty, Sess. of November 1791, c. 45; Smoot Sand & Gravel Corp. v. Washington Airport, \n283 \nU.S. 348\n, 51 S.Ct. 474; Maryland v.

United States, \n174 \nU.S. 196, 225\n, 19 S.Ct. 649; Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia (1875),  1. Within this area Congress has the plenary power to control navigation which was vested in the United States before the cession and which it exercises generally over navigable waters within the several states. It also acquired by the cession proprietary powers over the lands lying under water, and under article 1,  8, cl. 17, of the Constitution, granting exclusive legislative power over the District, the sovereign power to regulate and control their use for public purposes other than navigation.\n Petitioners have entered into a contract for the sale of their lands, conditioned upon securing permission to build the wharf, which is to be built and used by the purchaser in connection with a plant to be established on the upland for the storage of gasoline. It is stipulated on the record that the proposed wharf, which is to be constructed in conformity to plans approved by the Chief of Engi- \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n neers, will not interfere with navigation. Petitioners assert a right as riparian owners to build and maintain it upon two grounds, first, that by the common-law rule as developed in the United States, the ownership of land bordering on a navigable river carries with it the right to build and maintain below high-water mark a wharf or other structure, not an obstruction to navigation (see Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1\n, 14 S.Ct. 548; United States v. River Rouge Imp. Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 418\n, 46 S.Ct. 144; Norfolk City v. Cooke, 27 Grat. (68 Va.) 430; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Chase, 43 Md. 23) and, second, that by Paragraph 'Seventh' of the Compact of 1785 between Maryland and Virginia, ratified by Virginia March 28, 1785, 12 Hening, Virginia Stat. 50, and by Kilty, Session of November 1785, c. 1, it was Kilty, Session of November 1785, c. 1, it was provided:\n'The citizens of each state respectively shall have full property in the shores of Patowmack River adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharfs and other improvements, so as not to obstruct or injure the navigation of the river. ...'\n\n They insist that as the proposed wharf will not interfere with navigation, and as plans for its construction have been approved by the Chief of Engineers, it is the legal duty of the Secretary of War, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of March 3, 1899, to grant the desired permit. It is conceded by the government that the only basis for the Secretary's refusal to authorize the construction of the wharf is that it would be inimical to the establishment of the proposed George Washington Memorial Parkway authorized by Act of Congress of May 29, 1930, c. 354, 46 Stat. 482.\n By this legislation Congress appropriated $7,500,000 for the construction of a parkway, a part of which is to extend along the Virginia shore of the Potomac river from Mount Vernon to a point above the Great Falls. \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n It authorized the National Capital Park and Planning Commission 'to occupy such land belonging to the United States as may be necessary for the development and protection' of the parkway. Construction of the parkway was authorized as a part of the federal aid highway program, and was made conditional upon the contribution by Maryland or Virginia or others of one- half the cost of the required lands, other than those of the United States. But the Commission was empowered, in its discretion, to advance the full cost of the parkway upon securing undertakings from these states, upon terms prescribed by the statute, to repay one-half of the cost to the federal government. A part of the parkway, the Mount Vernon Memorial highway, extending along the Virginia shore of the river from Mount Vernon to a point within the District of Columbia, a short distance below the land of the petitioners, has been completed.\n Pending this suit, but before its trial, the Park and Planning Commission, by resolutions of September 24-26, 1931, declared that certain lands of the United States, described by metes and bounds, running along the highwater line of 1863 on the Virginia side of the river, as established by United States Coast Survey, and extending to the center line of the channel of the river, are necessary for the development and protection of the parkway. By further resolution, the Commission declared that it took complete and exclusive possession of these lands which include the river bed where it is proposed to build the wharf and the upland claimed by petitioners by accretion. It directed that copies of the resolutions be posted on each parcel, which was done before the hearing in this suit. A description of each was also sent to the Attorney General for the purpose of having suits filed under the Act of April 27, 1912, c. 96, 37 Stat. 93, which authorizes suits by the Attorney General to quiet title to lands adversely held or claimed lying under and adjacent to the Potomac- \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n river within the District of Columbia. The plans of the Commission also contemplate the construction of a highway across petitioners' upland as a means of access to the parkway.\n It is apparent that petitioners are entitled to the relief prayed only if several doubtful questions are resolved in their favor. They are ( 1) whether a mandatory duty is imposed upon the Secretary of War by section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act to authorize the construction of the proposed wharf if he is satisfied that it will not interfere with navigation; (2) whether in fact petitioners have title, by accretion, to the upland adjacent to the river at the point where it is proposed to build the wharf, and thus have the status of riparian owners; ( 3) whether even as riparian owners of land lying within Virginia, petitioners, in the absence of a legislative grant either by Maryland before the cession or by the United States after it, have a common-law right to build a wharf on the adjacent lands of the United States lying in the bed of the river, see Casey's Lessee v. Inloes et al., 1 Gill (Md.) 430, 39 Am.Dec. 658; Browne et al. v. Kennedy, 5 Har. & J. (Md.) 195, 9 Am. Dec. 503; Giraud's Lessee v. Hughes et al., 1 Gill & J.

Hudson County Water Co., 76 N.J. Eq. 543, 76 A. 560, or, if not, (4) whether their predecessors in title acquired such a right under paragraph seventh of the Maryland-Virginia compact, Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12 Pet. 91; Potomac Steamboat Co. v. Upper Potomac Steamboat Co., \n109 \nU.S. 672, 675\n, 3 S.Ct. 445, 4 S.Ct. 15; (5) whether, if such a right were derived from the compact, it was not lost before its exercise by the union in the single ownership of the United States of the land under the river, and on both sides of it, which resulted from the cession by Maryland and Virginia of the area originally embraced in the District of Columbia and continued until the retro- \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n cession in 1846 of the lands on the Virginia side, see Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., supra; Evans v. United States, 31 App.D.C. 544, 550; Herald v. United States, 52 App.D.C. 147, 284 F. 927; and (6) whether the right claimed is not in any case subordinate to the power of the United States in its capacity as proprietor and sovereign, to devote the river bed to a public purpose, as has been done by the action of the Commission, taken under authority of act of Congress authorizing the George Washington Memorial parkway. See Fox River Paper Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, \n274 \nU.S. 651\n, 47 S.Ct. 669; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, 33 S.Ct. 667; Barney v. Keokuk, \n94 U.S. 324\n; Giraud's Lessee v. Hughes, supra; Casey's Lessee v. Inloes, et al., supra; Linthicum v. Coan, 64 Md. 439, 453, 2 A. 826, 54 Am.Rep. 775; classen v. Chesapeake Guano Co., 81 Md. 258, 267, 31 A. 808.\n The government contends that, in view of the nature of these questions, the case is not an appropriate one for mandamus, since ordinarily mandamus against a public officer will not lie unless the right of the petitioner and the duty of the officer, performance of which is to be commanded, are both clear. See United States v. Wilbur, \n283 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 420 S., 51 S.Ct. 502; Interstate Commerce Commission v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 178\n, 53 S.Ct. 106, decided November 21, 1932; United States ex rel. Redfield v. Windom, \n137 \nU.S. 636\n, 11 S.Ct. 197; Bayard v. United States ex rel. White, \n127 \nU.S. 246\n, 8 S.Ct. 1223. It is insisted that both the petitioners' riparian ownership and the right to build the wharf which they claim to have derived from it are doubtful; and in any event that the duty of the Secretary under the statute1 is not plain and certain, since \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n the words forbidding all structures in any navigable river, 'except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War,' are only permissive, not mandatory, and there is no plain implication of a duty on the part of the Secretary to authorize a structure in the Potomac river within the District of Columbia to which there is substantial objection that it infringes the rights or obstructs the public policy of the United States as owner and sovereign of the river bed.\n But we find it unnecessary, in the circumstances of this case, to say what effect should be given to these objections alone, whether considered each separately or together. Although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its allowance is controlled by equitable principles, see Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 38 S.Ct. 99; Arant v. Lane, \n249 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 39 S.Ct. 293; United States ex rel. Redfield v. Windom, supra, \n137 \nU.S. 644\n, 11 S.Ct. 197; cf. Turner v. Fisher, \n222 \nU.S. 204\n, 32 S.Ct. 37; In re Skinner & Eddy Corp., \n265 \nU.S. 86, 95\n, 44 S.Ct. 446; People ex rel. Wood v. Board of Assessors, 137 N.Y. 201, 33 N.E. 145; In re Lindgren, 232 N.Y. 59, 133 N.E. 353; McCarthy v. Street Com'rs of City of Boston, 188 Mass. 338, 74 N.E 659; People v. Olsen, 215 Ill. 620, 74 N.E. 785; and it may be refused for reasons comparable to those which would lead a court of equity, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to withhold its protection of an undoubted legal right. For such reasons we think the relief sought by \n\n[289 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n mandamus should be denied here, even if petitioners' title to the upland adjacent to the river and their right to build the wharf were less doubtful than they are. The government through its duly authorized agency, the Park Commission, has declared that both the bed of the river and the upland adjacent to it shall be devoted to a public purpose for the construction of the parkway, and the plans of the Commission contemplate the taking, by purchase or condemnation, of a part of petitioners' property as a means of access to it. The apparent consequence of authorizing the construction of the whart would be only to increase the expense to the government of constructing the parkway, by the cost of destroying the wharf, and by so much of the cost of the wharf and of the other proposed improvements as may be included in the just compensation to be awarded for their taking. Thus the extraordinary remedy by mandamus, invoked to protect rights to which petitioners are not shown to be clearly entitled, would be burdensome to the government without any substantially equivalent benefit or advantage to the petitioners or their vendee, apart from the incidental and irrelevant consequence that petitioners might secure the performance of their conditional contract.\n The Court, in its discretion, may refuse mandamus to compel the doing of an idle act, Turner v. Fisher, supra, \n222 \nU.S. 209\n, 32 S.Ct. 37; Wilson v. Blake, 169 Cal. 449, 147 P. 129, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 205; or to give a remedy which would work a public injury or embarrassment (see Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, supra; Arant v. Lane, supra; Effingham, Maynard & Co. v. Hamilton, 68 Miss. 523, 10 So. 39; cf. In re Lindgren, 232 N.Y. 66, 133 N.E. 353, supra; McCarthy v. Street Com'rs of City of Boston, supra) just as, in its sound discretion, a court of equity may refuse to enforce or protect legal rights, the exercise of which may be prejudicial to the public interest.

DUBILIER CONDENSER CORP.(1933)\nNo. 316\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr.Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James H. Hughes, Jr., of Wilmington, Del., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three suits were brought in the District Court for Delaware against the respondent as exclusive license under three separate patents issued to Francis W. Dunmore and Percival D. Lowell. The bills recite that the inventions were made while the patentees were employed in the radio laboratories of the Bureau of Standards, and are therefore, in equity, the property of the United States. The prayers are for a declaration that the respondent is a trustee for the government, and, as such, required to assign to the United States all its right, title, and interest in the patents, for an accounting of all moneys received as licensee, and for general relief. The District Court consolidated the cases for trial, and after a hearing dismissed the bills. \n1\n The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the decree. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The courts below concurred in findings which are not challenged and, in summary, are:\n The Bureau of Standards is a subdivision of the Department of Commerce. \n3\n Its functions consist in the custody of standards; the comparison of standards used in scientific investigations, engineering, manufacturing, commerce, and educational institutions with those adopted \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n or recognized by the government; the construction of standards, their multiples or subdivisions; the testing and calibration of standard measuring apparatus; the solution of problems which arise in connection with standards; and the physical properties of materials. In 1915 the Bureau was also charged by Congress with the duty of investigation and standardization of methods and instruments employed in radio communication, for which special appropriations were made. \n4\n In recent years it has been engaged in research and testing work of various kinds for the benefit of private industries, other departments of the government, and the general public. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Bureau is composed of divisions, each charged with a specified field of activity, one of which is the electrical division. These are further subdivided into sections. One section of the electrical division is the radio section. In 1921 and 1922 the employees in the laboratory of this section numbered approximately twenty men doing technical work and some draftsmen and mechanics. The twenty were engaged in testing radio apparatus and methods and in radio research work. They were subdivided into ten groups, each group having a chief. The work of each group was defined in outlines by the chief or alternate chief of the section.\n Dunmore and Lowell were employed in the radio section and engaged in research and testing in the laboratory. In the outlines of laboratory work the subject of 'airplane radio' was assigned to the group of which Dunmore was chief and Lowell a member. The subject of 'radio receiving sets' was assigned to a group of which J. L. Preston was chief, but to which neither Lowell nor Dunmore belonged. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n In May, 1921, the Air Corps of the Army and the Bureau of Standards entered into an arrangement whereby the latter undertook the prosecution of forty-four research projects for the benefit of the Air Corps. To pay the cost of such work, the Corps transferred and allocated to the Bureau the sum of $267,500. Projects Nos. 37 to 42, inclusive, relating to the use of radio in connection with aircraft, were assigned to the radio section and $25,000 was allocated to pay the cost of the work. Project No. 38 was styled 'visual indicator for radio signals,' and suggested the construction of a modification of what was known as an 'Eckhart recorder.' Project No. 42 was styled 'airship bomb control and marine torpedo control.' Both were problems of design merely.\n In the summer of 1921 Dunmore, as chief of the group to which 'airplane radio' problems had been assigned, without further instructions from his superiors, picked out for himself one of these navy problems, that of operating a relay for remote control of bombs on airships and torpedoes in the sea, 'as one of particular interest and having perhaps a rather easy solution, and worked on it.' In September he solved it.\n In the midst of aircraft investigations and numerous routine problems of the section, Dunmore was wrestling in his own mind, impelled thereto solely by his own scientific curiosity, with the subject of substituting house-lighting alternating current for direct battery current in radio apparatus. He obtained a relay for operating a telegraph instrument which was in no way related to the remote control relay devised for aircraft use. The conception of the application of alternating current concerned particularly broadcast reception. This idea was conceived by Dunmore August 3, 1921, and he reduced the invention to practice December 16, 1921. Early in 1922 he advise his superior of his invention and spent addi- \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n tional time in perfecting the details. February 27, 1922, he filed an application for a patent.\n In the fall of 1921 both Dunmore and Lowell were considering the problem of applying alternating current to broadcast receiving sets. This project was not involved in or suggested by the problems with which the radio section was then dealing and was not assigned by any superior as a task to be solved by either of these employees. It was independent of their work and voluntarily assumed.\n While performing their regular tasks they experimented at the laboratory in devising apparatus for operating a radio receiving set by alternating current with the hum incident thereto eliminated. The invention was completed on December 10, 1921. Before its completion no instructions were received from and no conversations relative to the invention were held by these employees with the head of the radio section, or with any superior.\n They also conceived the idea of energizing a dynamic type of loud speaker from an alternating current house-lighting circuit and reduced the invention to practice on January 25, 1922. March 21, 1922, they filed an application for a 'power amplifier.' The conception embodied in this patent was devised by the patentees without suggestion, instruction, or assignment from any superior.\n Dunmore and Lowell were permitted by their chief, after the discoveries had been brought to his attention, to pursue their work in the laboratory and to perfect the devices embodying their inventions. No one advised them prior to the filing of applications for patents that they would be expected to assign the patents to the United States or to grant the government exclusive rights thereunder.\n The respondent concedes that the United States may practice the inventions without payment of royalty, but asserts that all others are excluded, during the life of the \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n patents, from using them without the respondent's consent. The petitioner insists that the circumstances require a declaration either that the government has sole and exclusive property in the inventions or that they have been dedicated to the public so that anyone may use them.\n First. By article 1, section 8, clause 8, of the Constitution, Congress is given power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their respective discoveries. Rev. St.  4886, as amended (U.S. Code, title 35,  31 (35 USCA  31)$, is the last of a series of statutes which since 1793 have implemented the constitutional provision.\n Though often so characterized a patent is not, accurately speaking, a monopoly, for it is not created by the executive authority at the expense and to the prejudice of all the community except the grantee of the patent. Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533. The term 'monopoly' connotes the giving of an exclusive privilege for buying, selling, working, or using a thing which the public freely enjoyed prior to the grant. \n6\n Thus a monopoly takes something from the people. An inventor deprives the public of nothing which it enjoyed before his discovery, but gives something of value to the community by adding to the sum of human knowledge. United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 239\n, 17 S.Ct. 809; Paper Bag Patent Case, \n210 \nU.S. 405, 424\n, 28 S. Ct. 748; Brooks v. Jenkins, 3 McLean, 432, 437, Fed. Cas. No. 1,953; Parker v. Haworth, 4 McLean, 370, 372, Fed. Cas. No. 10,738; Allen v. Hunter, 6 McLean, 303, 305, 306, Fed. Cas. No. 225; Attorney General v. Rumford Chemical Works, 2 Bann. & Ard. 298, 302. He may keep his invention secret and reap its fruits indefinitely. In consideration of its disclosure and the consequent benefit to the community, the patent is granted. An exclusive enjoyment is guaranteed him for \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n seventeen years, but, upon the expiration of that period, the knowledge of the invention inures to the people, who are thus enabled without restriction to practice it and profit by its use. Kendall v. Sinsor, 21 How. 322, 327; United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., supra, page 239 of 167 U.S., 17 S.Ct. 809. To this end the law requires such disclosure to be made in the application for patent that others skilled in the art may understand the invention and how to put it to use. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n A patent is property, and title to it can pass only by assignment. If not yet issued, an agreement to assign when issued, if valid as a contract, will be specifically enforced. The respective rights and obligations of employer and employee, touching an invention conceived by the latter, spring from the contract of employment.\n One employed to make an invention, who succeeds, during his term of service, in accomplishing that task, is bound to assign to his employer any patent obtained. The reason is that he has only produced that which he was employed to invent. His invention is the precise subject of the contract of employment. A term of the agreement necessarily is that what he is paid to produce belongs to his paymaster. Standard Parts Company v. Peck, \n264 \nU.S. 52\n, 44 S.Ct. 239, 32 A.L.R. 1033. On the other hand, if the employment be general, albeit it covers a field of labor and effort in the performance of which the employee conceived the invention for which he obtained a patent, the contract is not so broadly construed as to require an assignment of the patent. Hapgood v. Hewitt, \n119 \nU.S. 226\n, 7 S.Ct. 193; Dalzell v. Dueber Watch Case Mfg. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 315\n, 13 S.Ct. 886, 888. In the latter case it was said:\n'But a manufacturing corporation which has employed a skilled workman, for a stated compensation, to take charge of its works, and to devote his time and services to devising and making improvements in articles \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n there manufactured, is not entitled to a conveyance of patents obtained for inventions made by him while so employed, in the absence of express agreement to that effect.'\n\n The reluctance of courts to imply or infer an agreement by the employee to assign his patent is due to a recognition of the peculiar nature of the act of invention, which consists neither in finding out the laws of nature, nor in fruitful research as to the operation of natural laws, but in discovering how those laws may be utilized or applied for some beneficial purpose, by a process, a device, or a machine. It is the result of an inventive act, the birth of an idea and its reduction to practice; the product of original thought; a concept demonstrated to be true by practical application or embodiment in tangible form. Clark Thread Co. v. Willimantic Linen Co., \n140 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 11 S.Ct. 846; Symington Co. v. National Malleable Castings Co., \n250 \nU.S. 383, 386\n, 39 S.Ct. 542; Pyrene Mfg. Co. v. Boyce (C.C.A.) 292 F. 480, 481.\n Though the mental concept is embodied or realized in a mechanism or a physical or chemical aggregate, the embodiment is not the invention and is not the subject of a patent. This distinction between the idea and its application in practice is the basis of the rule that employment merely to design or to construct or to devise methods of manufacture is not the same as employment to invent. Recognition of the nature of the act of invention also defines the limits of the so-called shop right, which, shortly stated, is that, where a servant, during his hours of employment, working with his master's materials and appliances, conceives and perfects an invention for which he obtains a patent, he must accord his master a nonexclusive right to practice the invention. McClurg v. Kigsland, 1 How, 202; Solomons v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 342\n, 11 S.Ct. 88; Lane & Bodley Co. v. Locke, \n150 \nU.S. 193\n, 14 S.Ct. 78. This is an application of equitable principles. Since the servant uses his master's time, facilities, and materials to attain a \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n concrete result, the latter is in equity entitled to use that which embodies his own property and to duplicate it as often as he may find occasion to employ similar appliances in his business. But the employer in such a case has no equity to demand a conveyance of the invention, which is the original conception of the employee alone, in which the employer had no part. This remains the property of him who conceived it, together with the right conferred by the patent, to exclude all others than the employer from the accruing benefits. These principles are settled as respects private employment.\n Second. Does the character of the service call for different rules as to the relative rights of the United States and its employees?\n The title of a patentee is subject to no superior right of the government. The grant of letters patent is not, as in England, a matter of grace or favor, so that conditions may be annexed at the pleasure of the executive. To the laws passed by the Congress, and to them alone, may we look for guidance as to the extent and the limitations of the respective rights of the inventor and the public. Attorney General v. Rumford Chemical Works, supra, at pages 303, 304 of 2 Bann. & Ard. And this court has held that the Constitution evinces no public policy which requires the holder of a patent to cede the use or benefit of the invention to the United States, even though the discovery concerns matters which can properly be used only by the government; as, for example, munitions of war. James v. Campbell, \n104 U.S. 356\n, 358; Hollister v. Benedict & B. Mfg. Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 67\n, 5 S.Ct. 717.\n No servant of the United States has by statute been disqualified from applying for and receiving a patent for his invention, save officers and employees of the Patent Office during the period for which they hold their appointments. 8 \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n This being so, this court has applied the rules enforced as between private employers and their servants to the relation between the government and its officers and employees.\n United States v. Burns, 12 Wall. 246, 252, was a suit in the Court of Claims by an army officer as assignee of a patent obtained by another such officer for a military tent, to recover royalty under a contract made by the Secretary of War for the use of the tents. The court said, in affirming a judgment for the plaintiff:\n'If an officer in the military service, not specially employed to make experiments with a view to suggest improvements, devises a new and valuable improvement in arms, tents, or any other kind of war material, he is entitled to the benefit of it, and to letters-patent for the improvement from the United States, equally with any other citizen not engaged in such service; and the government cannot, after the patent is issued, make use of the improvement any more than a private individual, without license of the inventor or making compensation to him.'\n\n In United States v. Palmer, \n128 \nU.S. 262\n, 9 S.Ct. 104, 106, Palmer, a lieutenant in the Army, patented certain improvements in infantry accoutrements. An army board recommended their use and the Secretary of War confirmed the recommendation. The United States manufactured and purchased a large number of the articles. Palmer brought suit in the Court of Claims for a sum alleged to be a fair and reasonable royalty. From a judgment for the plaintiff the United States appealed. This court, in affirming, said:\n'It was at one time somewhat doubted whether the government might not be entitled to the use and benefit of every patented invention, by analogy to the English law, which reserves this right to the crown. But that \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n notion no longer exists. It was ignored in the Case of Burns.'\n\n These principles were recognized in later cases involving the relative rights of the government and its employees in instances where the subject-matter of the patent was useful to the public generally. While these did not involve a claim to an assignment of the patent, the court reiterated the views earlier announced.\n In Solomons v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 342, 346\n, 11 S.Ct. 88, 89, it was said:\n'The government has no more power to appropriate a man's property invested in a patent than it has to take his property invested in real estate; nor does the mere fact that an inventor is, at the time of his invention, in the employ of the government transfer to it any title to or interest therein. An employee, performing all the duties assigned to him in his department of service, may exercise his inventive faculties in any direction he chooses, with the assurance that whatever invention he may thus conceive, and perfect is his individual property. There is no difference between the government and any other employer in this respect.'\n\n And in Gill v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 426, 435\n, 16 S.Ct. 322, 326:\n'There is no doubt whatever of the proposition laid down in Solomons' Case, that the mere fact that a person is in the employ of the government does not preclude him from making improvements in the machines with which he is connected, and obtaining patents therefor, as his individual property; and that in such case the government would have no more right to seize upon and appropriate such property than any other proprietor would have. ...'\n\n The distinction between an employment to make an invention and a general employment in the course of \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n which the servant conceives an invention has been recognized by the executive department of the government. A lieutenant in the Navy patented an anchor while he was on duty in the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting, which was charged with the duty of furnishing anchors for the Navy; he was not while attached to the Bureau specially employed to make experiments with a view to suggesting improvements to anchors or assigned the duty of making or improving. The Attorney General advised that, as the invention did not relate to a matter as to which the lieutenant was specially directed to experiment with a view to suggesting improvements, he was entitled to compensation from the government for the use of his invention in addition to his salary or pay as a navy officer. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n A similar ruling was made with respect to an ensign who obtained a patent for improvements in 'B.L.R. ordnance' and who offered to sell the improvements, or the right to use them, to the government. It was held that the Navy might properly make a contract with him to this end. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The United States is entitled, in the same way and to the same extent as a private employer, to shop rights, that is, the free and nonexclusive use of a patent which results from efforts of its employee in his working hours and with material belonging to the government. Solomons v. United States, supra, pages 346, 347 of 137 U.S., 11 S.Ct. 88; McAleer v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 424\n, 14 S.Ct. 160; Gill v. United States, supra.\n The statutes, decisions, and administrative practice negate the existence of a duty binding one in the service of the government different from the obligation of one in private employment. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n Third. When the United States filed its bills, it recognized the law as heretofore declared; realized that it must like any other employer, if it desired an assignment of the respondent's rights, prove a contractual obligation on the part of Lowell and Dunmore to assign the patents to the government. The averments clearly disclose this. The bill in No. 316 is typical. After reciting that the employees were laboratory apprentice and associate physicist and laboratory assistant and associate physicist respectively, and that one of their duties was 'to carry on investigation research and experimentation in such problems relating to radio and wireless as might be assigned to them by their superiors,' it is charged 'in the course of his employment as aforesaid, there was assigned to said Lowell by his superiors in said radio section, for investigation and research, the problem of developing a radio receiving set capable of operation by alternating current. ...'\n Thus the government understood that respondent could be deprived of rights under the patents only by proof that Dunmore and Lowell were employed to devise the inventions. The findings of the courts below show how far the proofs fell short of sustaining these averments.\n The government is consequently driven to the contention that, though the employees were not specifically assigned the task of making the inventions (as in Standard Parts Co. v. Peck, supra), still, as the discoveries were 'within the general field of their research and inventive work' the United States is entitled to an assignment of the patents. The courts below expressly found that Dunmore and Lowell did not agree to exercise their inventive faculties in their work and that invention was not within its scope. In this connection it is to be remembered that the written evidence of their employment does not mention research, much less invention; that never was there \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 194]\n\u00a0\n a word said to either of them, prior to their discoveries, concerning invention or patents or their duties or obligations respecting these matters; that, as shown by the records of the Patent Office, employees of the Bureau of Standards and other departments had while so employed received numerous patents and enjoyed the exclusive rights obtained as against all private persons without let or hindrance from the government. 11 In no proper \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 195]\n\u00a0\n sense may it be said that the contract of employment contemplated invention; everything that Dunmore and Lowell knew negatived the theory that they were employed to invent; they knew, on the contrary, that the past and then present practice was that the employees of the Bureau were allowed to take patents on their inventions and have the benefits thereby conferred save as to use by the \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 196]\n\u00a0\n United States. The circumstances preclude the implication of any agreement to assign their inventions or patents.\n The record affords even less basis for inferring a contract on the part of the inventors to refrain from patenting their discoveries than for finding an agreement to assign them.\n The bills aver that the inventions and patents are held in trust for the United States, and that the court should so declare. It is claimed that, as the work of the Bureau, including all that Dunmore and Lowell did, was in the public interest, these public servants had dedicated the offspring of their brains to the public, and so held their patents in trust for the common weal, represented here in a corporate capacity by the United States. The patentees, we are told, should surrender the patents for cancellation, and the respondent must also give up its rights under the patents.\n The trust cannot be express. Every fact in the case negatives the existence of one. Nor can it arise ex maleficio. The employees' conduct was not fraudulent in any respect. They promptly disclosed their inventions. Their superiors encouraged them to proceed in perfecting and applying the discoveries. Their notebooks and reports disclosed the work they were doing, and there is not a syllable to suggest their use of time or material was clandestine or improper. No word was spoken regarding any claim of title by the government until after applications for patents were filed. And, as we have seen, no such trust has been spelled out of the relation of master and servant, even in the cases where the employee has perfected his invention by the use of his employer's time and materials. The cases recognizing the doctrine of shop rights may be said to fix a trust upon the employee in favor of his master as respects the use of the invention \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 197]\n\u00a0\n by the latter, but they do not affect the title to the patent and the exclusive rights conferred by it against the public.\n The government's position in reality is, and must be, that a public policy, to be declared by a court, forbids one employed by the United States, for scientific research, to obtain a patent for what he invents, though neither the Constitution nor any statute so declares.\n Where shall the courts set the limits of the doctrine? For, confessedly, it must be limited. The field of research is as broad as that of science itself. If the petitioner is entitled to a cancellation of the patents in this case, would it be so entitled, if the employees had done their work at home, in their own time and with their own appliances and materials? What is to be said of an invention evolved as the result of the solution of a problem in a realm apart from that to which the employee is assigned by his official superiors? We have seen that the Bureau has numerous divisions. It is entirely possible that an employee in one division may make an invention falling within the work of some other division. Indeed this case presents that exact situation, for the inventions in question had to do with radio reception, a matter assigned to a group of which Dunmore and Lowell were not members. Did the mere fact of their employment by the Bureau require these employees to cede to the public every device they might conceive?\n Is the doctrine to be applied only where the employment is in a bureau devoted to scientific investigation pro bono publico? Unless it is to be so circumscribed, the statements of this court in United States v. Burns, supra, Solomons v. United States, supra, and Gill v. United States, supra, must be held for naught.\n Again, what are to be defined as bureaus devoted entirely to scientific research? It is common knowledge that many in the Department of Agriculture conduct re- \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 198]\n\u00a0\n searches and investigations, that divisions of the War and Navy Departments do the like, and doubtless there are many other bureaus and sections in various departments of government where employees are set the task of solving problems all of which involve more or less of science. Shall the field of the scientist be distinguished from the art of a skilled mechanic? Is it conceivable that one working on a formula for a drug or an antiseptic in the Department of Agriculture stands in a different class from a machinist in an arsenal? Is the distinction to be that, where the government department is, so to speak, a business department operating a business activity of the government, the employee has the same rights as one in private employment, whereas, if his work be for a bureau interested more particularly in what may be termed scientific research, he is upon notice that whatever he invents in the field of activity of the bureau, broadly defined, belongs to the public and is unpatentable? Illustrations of the difficulties which would attend an attempt to define the policy for which the government contends might be multiplied indefinitely.\n The courts ought not to declare any such policy; its formulation belongs solely to the Congress. Will permission to an employee to enjoy patent rights as against all others than the government tend to the improvement of the public service by attracting a higher class of employees? Is there in fact greater benefit to the people in a dedication to the public of inventions conceived by officers of government than in their exploitation under patents by private industry? Should certain classes of invention be treated in one way and other classes differently? These are not legal questions, which courts are competent to answer. They are practical questions, and the decision as to what will accomplish the greatest good for the inventor, the government, and the public rests \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 199]\n\u00a0\n with the Congress. We should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the Legislature has not expressed.\n Fourth. Moreover, we are of opinion Congress has approved a policy at variance with the petitioner's contentions. This is demonstrated by examination of two statutes, with their legislative history, and the hearings and debates respecting proposed legislation which failed of passage.\n Since 1883 there has been in force an act12 which provides:\n'The Secretary of the Interior (now the Secretary of Commerce, act of February 14, 1903, c. 552,  12, 32 Stat. 830) and the Commissioner of Patents are authorized to grant any officer of the government, except officers and employees of the Patent Office, a patent for any invention of the classes mentioned in section forty eight hundred and eighty six of the Revised Statutes, when such invention is used or to be used in the public service, without the payment of any fee: Provided, That the applicant in his application shall state that the invention described therein, if patented, may be used by the government or any of its officers, or employees in the prosecution of work for the government, or by any other person in the United States, without the payment to him of any royalty thereon, which stipulation shall be included in the patent.'\n\n This law was evidently intended to encourage government employees to obtain patents, by relieving them of the payment of the usual fees. The condition upon which the privilege was accorded is stated at the grant of free use by the government, 'its officers or employees in the prosecution of work for the government, or by any \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 200]\n\u00a0\n other person in the United States.' For some time the effect of the italicized phrase was a matter of doubt.\n In 1910 the Judge Advocate General of the Army rendered an opinion to the effect that one taking a patent pursuant to the act threw his invention 'open to public and private use in the United States.' \n13\n It was later realized that this view made such a patent a contradiction in terms, for it secured no exclusive right to any one. In 1918 the Judge Advocate General gave a well-reasoned opinion14 holding that, if the statute were construed to involve a dedication to the public, the so-called patent would at most amount to a publication or prior reference. He concluded that the intent of the act was that the free use of the invention extended only to the government or those doing work for it. A similar construction was adopted in an opinion of the Attorney General. \n15\n Several federal courts referred to the statute, and in dicta indicated disagreement with the views expressed in these later opinions. \n 16\n\u00a0\n\n The departments of government were anxious to have the situation cleared, and repeatedly requested that the act be amended. Pursuant to the recommendations of the War Department, an amendment was enacted April 30, 1928.17 The proviso was changed to read:\n'Provided, That the applicant in his application shall state that the invention described therein, if patented, \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 201]\n\u00a0\n may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment to him of any royalty thereon, which stipulation shall be included in the patent.' (35 USCA  45.)\n\n The legislative history of the amendment clearly discloses the purpose to save to the employee his right to exclude the public. \n18\n In the report of the Senate Committee on Patents submitted with the amendment, the object of the bill was said to be the protection of the interests of the government, primarily by securing patents on inentions made by officers and employees, presently useful in the interest of the national defense or those which may prove useful in the interest of national defense in the future; and, secondarily, to encourage the patenting of inventions by officers and employees of the government with the view to future protection of the government against suits for infringement of patents. The Committee stated that the bill had the approval of the Commissioner of Patents, and was introduced at the request of the Secretary of War. Appended to the report is a copy of a letter of the Secretary of War addressed to the committees of both Houses stating that the language of the legislation then existing was susceptible of two interpretations contrary to each other. The letter quoted the proviso of the section as it then stood, and continued:\n'It is clear that a literal construction of this proviso would work a dedication to the public of every patent taken out under the act. If the proviso must be construed literally we would have a situation wherein all the patents taken out under the act would be nullified by the \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 202]\n\u00a0\n very terms of the act under which they were granted, for the reason that a patent which does not carry with it the limited monopoly referred to in the Constitution is in reality not a patent at all. The only value that a patent has is the right that it extends to the patentee to exclude all others from making, using, or selling the invention for a certain period of years. A patent that is dedicated to the public is virtually the same as a patent that has expired.'\n\n After referring to the interpretation of the Judge Advocate General and the Attorney General and mentioning that no satisfactory adjudication of the question had been afforded by the courts, the letter went on the state:\n'Because of the ambiguity referred to and and unsettled condition that has arisen therefrom, it has become the policy of the War Department to advise all its personnel who desire to file applications for letters patent, to do so under the general law and pay the required patent-office fee in each case.'\n\n And added:\n'If the proposed legislation is enacted into law, Government officers and employees may unhesitatingly avail themselves of the benefits of the act with full assurance that in so doing their patent is not dedicated to the public by operation of law. The War Department has been favoring legislation along the lines of the proposed bill for the past five or six years.'\n\n When the bill came up for passage in the House, a colloquy occurred which clearly disclosed the purpose of the amendment. \n19\n The intent was that a government \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 203]\n\u00a0\n employee who in the course of his employment conceives an invention should afford the government free use thereof, but should be protected in his right to exclude all others. If Dunmore and Lowell, who tendered the government a nonexclusive license without royalty, and always understood that the government might use their inventions freely, had proceeded under the act of 1883, they would have retained their rights as against all but the United States. This is clear from the executive interpretation of the act. But for greater security they pursued the very course then advised by the law officers of the government. It would be surprising if they thus lost all rights as patentees; especially so since Congress has now confirmed the soundness of the views held by the law officers of the government. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 204]\n\u00a0\n Until the year 1910 the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to award compensation to the owner of a patent for unauthorized use by the United States or its agents. Its power extended only to the trial of claims based upon an express or implied contract for such use. \n20\n In that year Congress enlarged the jurisdiction to embrace the former class of claims. \n21\n In giving consent to be sued, the restriction was imposed that it should not extend to owners of patents obtained by employees of the government while in the service. From this it is inferred that Congress recognized no right in such patentees to exclude the public from practicing the invention. But \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 205]\n\u00a0\n an examination of the legislative record completely refutes the contention.\n The House Committee in reporting the bill, after referring to the law as laid down in the Solomons Case, said: 'The United States in such a case has an implied license to use the patent without compensation, for the reason that the inventor used the time or the money or the material of the United States in perfecting his invention. The use by the United States of such a patented invention without any authority from the owner thereof is a lawful use under existing law, and we have inserted the words 'or lawful right to use the same' in order to make it plain that we do not intend to make any change in existing law in this respect, and do not intend to give the owner of such a patent any claim against the United States for its use.' 22 From this it is clear that Congress had no purpose to declare a policy at variance with the decisions of this court.\n The executive departments have advocated legislation regulating the taking of patents by government employees and the administration by government agencies of the patents so obtained. In 1919 and 1920 a bill sponsored by the Interior Department was introduced. It provided for the voluntary assignment or license by any government employee, to the Federal Trade Commission, of a patent applied for by him, and the licensing of manufacturers by the Commission, the license fees to be paid into the Treasury and such part of them as the President might deem equitable to be turned over to the patentee. \n23\n In the hearings and reports upon this measure stress was laid, not only upon the fact that action by an employee thereunder would be voluntary, but that the inventor would be protected at least to some extent in his private \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 206]\n\u00a0\n right of exclusion. It was recognized that the government could not compel an assignment, was incapable of taking such assignment or administering the patent, and that it had shop rights in a patent perfected by the use of government material and in government working time. Nothing contained in the bill itself or in the hearings or reports indicates any intent to change the existing and well-understood rights of government employees who obtain patents for their inventions made while in the service. The measure failed of passage.\n In 1923 the President sent to the Congress the report of an interdepartmental patents board created by executive order to study the question of patents within the government service and to recommend regulations establishing a policy to be followed in respect thereof. The report adverted to the fact that, in the absence of a contract providing otherwise, a patent taken out by a government employee, and any invention developed by one in the public service, is the sole property of the inventor. The committee recommended strongly against public dedication of such an invention, saying that this in effect voids a patent, and, if this were not so, 'there is little incentive for anyone to take up a patent and spend time, effort, and money ... on its commercial development without at least some measure of protection against others free to take the patent as developed by him and compete in its use. In such a case one of the chief objects of the patent law would be defeated.' \n24\n In full accord is the statement on behalf of the Department of the Interior in a memorandum furnished with respect to the bill introduced in 1919.25\n With respect to a policy of permitting the patentee to take a patent and control it in his own interest (subject, \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 207]\n\u00a0\n of course, to the government's right of use, if any) the committee said:\n'... It must not be lost sight of that in general it is the constitutional right of every patentee to exploit his patent as he may desire, however expedient it may appear to endeavor to modify this right in the interest of the public when the patentee is in the Government service.'26\n\n Concerning a requirement that all patents obtained by government employees be assigned to the United States or its agent, the committee said:\n'... It would, on the one hand, render difficult securing the best sort of technical men for the service and, on the other, would influence technical workers to resign in order to exploit inventions which they might evolve and suppress while still in the service. There has always been more or loss of a tendency for able men in the service to do this, particularly in view of the comparative meagerness of Government salaries; thus the Government has suffered loss among its most capable class of workers.'27\n\n The committee recommended legislation to create an Interdepartmental Patents Board; and further that the law make it part of the express terms of employment, having the effect of a contract, that any patent application made or patent granted for an invention discovered or developed during the period of government service and incident to the line of official duties, which in the judgment of the Board should, in the interest of the national defense, or otherwise in the public interest, be controlled by the government, should upon demand by the Board be assigned by the employee to an agent of the government. The recommended measures were not adopted. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 208]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. Congress has refrained from imposing upon government servants a contract obligation of the sort above described. At least one department has attempted to do so by regulation. \n28\n Since the record in this case discloses that the Bureau of Standards had no such regulation, it is unnecessary to consider whether the various departments have power to impose such a contract upon employees without authorization by act of Congress. The question is more difficult under our form of government than under that of Great Britain, where such departmental regulations seem to settle the matter. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n All of this legislative history emphasizes what we have stated-that the courts are incompetent to answer the difficult question whether the patentee is to be allowed his exclusive right or compelled to dedicate his invention to the public. It is suggested that the election rests with the authoritative officers of the government. Under what power, express or implied, may such officers, by administrative fiat, determine the nature and extent of rights exercised under a charter granted a patentee pursuant to constitutional and legislative provisions? Apart from the fact that express authority is nowhere to be found, the question arises, Who are the authoritative officers whose determination shall bind the United States and the patentee? The government's position comes to this-that the courts may not re-examine the exercise of an authority by some officer, not named, purporting to deprive the patentee of the rights conferred upon him by law. Nothing would be settled by such a holding, except that the determination of the reciprocal rights and obligations of the government and its employee as re- \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 209]\n\u00a0\n spects inventions are to be adjudicated, without review, by an unspecified department head or bureau chief. Hitherto both the executive and the legislative branches of the government have concurred in what we consider the correct view,-that any such declaration of policy must come from Congress and that no power to declare it is vested in administrative officers.\n The decrees are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I think the decrees should be reversed.\n The Court's conclusion that the employment of Dunmore and Lowell did not contemplate that they should exercise inventive faculties in their service to the government, and that both courts below so found, seems to render superfluous much that is said in the opinion. For it has not been contended, and I certainly do not contend that, if such were the fact, there would be any foundation for the claim asserted by the government. But I think the record does not support the Court's conclusion of fact. I am also unable to agree with the reasoning of the opinion, although on my view of the facts it would lead to the reversal of the decree below, which I favor.\n When originally organized1 as a subdivision of the Department of Commerce, the functions of the Bureau of Standards consisted principally of the custody, comparison, construction, testing and calibration of standards and the solution of problems arising in connection with standards. But in the course of its investigation of standards of quality and performance it has gradually expanded into a laboratory for research of the broadest character of the various branches of science and industry and particularly \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 210]\n\u00a0\n in the field of engineering. 2 Work of this nature is carried on for other government departments,3 the general public,4 and private industries. \n5\n It is almost entirely supported by public funds,6 and is maintained in the pub- \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 211]\n\u00a0\n lic interest. In 1915, as the importance of radio to the government and to the public increased, Congress appropriated funds7 to the Bureau 'for investigation and standardization of methods and instruments employed in radio communication.' Similar annual appropriations have been made since, and public funds were allotted by Acts of July 1, 1916, c. 209, 39 Stat. 262, 324, and October 6, 1917, c. 79, 40 Stat. 345, 375, for the construction of a fireproof laboratory building 'to provide additional space to be used for research and testing in radio communication,' as well as 'space and facilities for cooperative research and experimental work in radio communication' by other departments of the government. Thus the conduct of research and scientific investigation in the field of radio has been a duty imposed by law upon the Bureau of Standards since 1915\n\n\n Radio research has been conducted in the radio section of the Electrical Division of the Bureau. In 1921 and 1922, when Dunmore and Lowell made the inventions in controversy, they were employed in this section as members of the scientific staff. They were not, of course, engaged to invent, in the sense in which a carpenter is employed to build a chest, but they were employed to conduct scientific investigations in a laboratory devoted principally to applied rather than pure science, with full knowledge and expectation of all concerned that their investigations might normally lead, as they did, to invention. The Bureau was as much devoted to the advancement of the radio art by invention as by discovery which falls short of it. Hence --invention in the field of radio was a goal intimately related to and embraced within the purposes of the work of the scientific staff. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 212]\n\u00a0\n Both courts below found that Dunmore and Lowell were impelled to make these inventions 'solely by their own scientific curiosity.' They undoubtedly proceeded upon their own initiative beyond the specific problems upon which they were authorized or directed to work by their superiors in the Bureau, who did not actively supervise their work in its inventive stages. But the evidence leaves no doubt that in all they did they were following the established practice of the section. For members of the research staff were expected and encouraged to follow their own scientific impulses in pursuing their researches and discoveries to the point of useful application, whether they involved invention or not, and even though they did not relate to the immediate problem in hand. After the inventions had been conceived, they were disclosed by the inventors to their chief, and they devoted considerable time to perfecting them, with his express approval. All the work was carried on by them in the government laboratory with the use of government materials and facilities, during the hours for which they received a government salary. Its progress was recorded throughout in weekly and monthly reports which they were required to file, as well as in their laboratory notebooks. It seems clear that, in thus exercising their inventive powers in the pursuit of ideas reaching beyond their specific assignments, the inventors were discharging the duties expected of scientists employed in the laboratory; Dunmore, as well as his supervisors, testified that such was their conception of the nature of the work. The conclusion is irresistible that their scientific curiosity was precisely what gave the inventors value as research workers; the government employed it and gave it free rein in performing the broad duty of the Bureau of advancing the radio art by discovery and invention.\n The courts below did not find that there was any agreement between the government and the inventors as to \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 213]\n\u00a0\n their relative rights in the patents, and there was no evidence to support such a finding. They did not find, and upon the facts in evidence and within the range of judicial notice they could not find, that the work done by Dunmore and Lowell leading to the inventions in controversy was not within the scope of their employment. Such a finding was unnecessary to support the decisions below, which proceeded on the theory relied on by the respondent here, that, in the absence of an express contract to assign it, an employer is entitled to the full benefit of the patent granted to an employee, only when it is for a particular invention which the employee was specifically hired or directed to make. The bare references by the court below to the obvious facts that 'research' and 'invention' are not synonymous, and that all research work in the Bureau is not concerned with invention, fall far short of a finding that the work in the Bureau did not contemplate invention at all. Those references were directed to a different end, to the establishment of what is conceded here, that Dunmore and Lowell were not specifically hired or directed to make the inventions, because in doing so they proceeded beyond the assignments given them by their superiors. The court's conception of the law, applied to this ultimate fact, led inevitably to its stated conclusion that the claim of the government is without support in reason or authority, 'unless we should regard a general employment for research work as synonymous with a particular employment (or assignment) for inventive work.'\n The opinion of this Court apparently rejects the distinction between specific employment or assignment and general employment to invent, adopted by the court below and supported by authority, in favor of the broader position urged by the government that, wherever the employee's duties involve the exercise of inventive powers, the employer is entitled to an assignment of the pat- \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 214]\n\u00a0\n ent on any invention made in the scope of the general employment. As I view the facts, I think such a rule, to which this Court has not hitherto given explicit support, would require a decree in favor of the government. It would also require a decree in favor of a private employer, on the ground stated by the court that, as the employee 'has only produced what he is employed to invent,' a specifically enforceable 'term of the agreement necessarily is that what he is paid to produce belongs to his paymaster.' A theory of decision so mechanical is not forced upon us by precedent, and cannot, I think, be supported.\n What the employee agrees to assign to his employer is always a question of fact. It cannot be said that, merely because an employee agrees to invent, he also agrees to assign any patent secured for the invention. Accordingly, if an assignment is ordered in such a case, it is no more to be explained and supported as the specific enforcement of an agreement to transfer property in the patent than is the shop right which equity likewise decrees, where the employment does not contemplate invention. All the varying and conflicting language of the books cannot obscure the reality that, in any case where the rights of the employer to the invention are not fixed by express contract, and no agreement in fact may fairly be implied, equity determines after the event what they shall be. In thus adjudicating in invitum the consequences of the employment relationship, equity must reconcile the conflicting claims of the employee who has evolved the idea and the employer who has paid him for his time and supplied the materials utilized in experimentation and construction. A task so delicate cannot be performed by accepting the formula advanced by the petitioner any more than by adopting that urged by the respondent, though both are not without support in the \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 215]\n\u00a0\n opinions of this Court. Compare Hapgood v. Hewitt, \n119 \nU.S. 226\n, 7 S.Ct. 193; Dalzell v. Dueber Watch Case Mfg. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 315\n, 13 S.Ct. 886; Solomons v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 342, 346\n, 11 S.Ct. 88; Gill v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 426, 435\n, 16 S.Ct. 322; Standard Parts Co. v. Peck, \n264 \nU.S. 52\n, 44 S.Ct. 239, 32 A.L.R. 1033.\n Where the employment does not contemplate the exercise of inventive talent, the policy of the patent laws to stimulate invention by awarding the benefits of the monopoly to the inventor and not to some one else leads to a ready compromise: a shop right gives the employer an adequate share in the unanticipated boon. \n8\n Hapgood v. Hewitt, supra; Lane & Bodley Co. v. Locke, \n150 \nU.S. 193\n, 14 S.Ct. 78; Dalzell v. Dueber Watch Case Mfg. Co., supra; Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Hansen (C.C.A.) 137 F. 403, 2 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1172; Amdyco Corp. v. Urquhart (D.C.) 39 F.(2d) 943, affirmed (C.C.A.) 51 F. (2d) 1072; Ingle v. Landis Tool Co. (C.C.A.) 272 F. 464; see Beecroft & Blackman v. Rooney (D.C.) 268 F. 545, 549.\n But where, as in this case, the employment contemplates invention, the adequacy of such a compromise is more doubtful, not because it contravenes an agreement for an assignment, which may not exist, but because, arguably, as the patent is the fruit of the very work which the employee is hired to do, and for which he is paid, it should no more be withheld from the employer, in equity and good conscience, than the product of any other service which the employee engages to render. This result has been reached where the contract was to devise a means for solving a defined problem, Standard Parts Co. v. Peck, supra, and the decision has been thought to establish the employer's right wherever the employee is hired or assigned to evolve a process or mechanism for meeting a specific need. Magnetic Mfg. Co. v. Dings Magnetic Separator Co. (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 739; Goodyear Tire & Rubber \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 216]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Miller (C.C.A.) 22 F.(2d) 353, 356; Houghton v. United States (C.C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 386. But the court below and others have thought (Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Hansen, supra; Houghton v. United States, supra; Amdyco Corp. v. Urquhart, supra), as the respondent argues, that only in cases where the employment or assignment is thus specific may the employer demand all the benefits of the employee's invention. The basis of such a limitation is not articulate in the cases. There is at least a question whether its application may not be attributed, in some instances, to the readier implication of an actual promise to assign the patent, where the duty is to invent a specific thing (see Pressed Steel Car Co. v. Hansen, supra, 137 F. 415), or, in any case, to the reluctance of equity logically to extend, in this field, the principle that the right to claim the service includes the right to claim its product. The latter alternative may find support in the policy of the patent laws to secure to the inventor the fruits of his inventive genius, in the hardship which may be involved in imposing a duty to assign all inventions, see Dalzell v. Dueber Watch Case Mfg. Co., supra, \n149 \nU.S. 323\n, 13 S.Ct. 886, cf. Aspinwall Mfg. Co. v. Gill (C.C.) 32 F. 697, 700, and in a possible inequality in bargaining power of employer and employee. But compare Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Miller, supra, 22 F.(2d) 355; Hulse v. Bonsack Mach. Co. (C.C.A.) 65 F. 864, 868; see 30 Columbia Law Rev. 1172, 1176-1178. There is no reason for determining now the weight which should be accorded these objections to complete control of the invention by the employer, in cases of ordinary employment for private purposes. Once it is recognized, as it must be, that the function of the Court in every case is to determine whether the employee may, in equity and good conscience, retain the benefits of the patent, it is apparent that the present case turns upon considerations which distinguish it from any which has thus far been decided. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 217]\n\u00a0\n The inventors were not only employed to engage in work which unmistakably required them to exercise their inventive genius as occasion arose; they were a part of a public enterprise. It was devoted to the improvement of the art of radio communication for the benefit of the people of the United States, carried on in a government laboratory, maintained by public funds. Considerations which might favor the employee where the interest of the employer is only in private gain are therefore of slight significance; the policy dominating the research in the Bureau, as the inventors knew, was that of the government to further the interests of the public by advancing the radio art. For the work to be successful, the government must be free to use the results for the benefit of the public in the most effective way. A patent monopoly in individual employees, carrying with it the power to suppress the invention, or at least to exclude others from using it, would destroy this freedom; a shop right in the government would not confer it. For these employees, in the circumstances, to attempt to withhold from the public and from the government the full benefit of the inventions which it has paid them to produce, appears to me so unconscionable and inequitable as to demand the interposition of a court exercising chancery powers. A court which habitually enjoins a mortgagor from acquiring and setting up a tax title adversely to the mortgagee, Middletown Savings Bank v. Bacharach, 46 Conn. 513, 524; Chamberlain v. Forbes, 126 Mich. 86, 85 N.W. 253; Waring v. National Savings & Trust Co., 138 Md. 367, 114 A. 57; see 2 Jones on Mortgages (8th Ed.)  841, should find no difficulty in enjoining these employees and the respondent claiming under them from asserting, under the patent laws, rights which would defeat the very object of their employment. The capacity of equitable doctrine for growth and of courts of equity to mould it to \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 218]\n\u00a0\n new situations was not exhausted with the establishment of the employer's shop right. See Essex Trust Co. v. Enwright, 214 Mass. 507, 102 N.E. 441, 47 L.R.A.(N.S.) 567; Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 164 N.E. 545, 62 A. L.R. 1.\n If, in the application of familiar principles to the situation presented here, we must advance somewhat beyond the decided cases, I see nothing revolutionary in the step. We need not be deterred by fear of the necessity, inescapable in the development of the law, of setting limits to the doctrine we apply, as the need arises. That prospect does not require us to shut our eyes to the obvious consequences of the decree which has been rendered here. The result is repugnant to common notions of justice and to policy as well, and the case must turn upon these considerations if we abandon the illusion that equity is called upon merely to enforce a contract, albeit one that is 'implied.' The case would be more dramatic if the inventions produced at public expense were important to the preservation of human life, or the public health, or the agricultural resources of the country. The principle is the same here, though the inventions are of importance only in the furtherance of human happiness. In enlisting their scientific talent and curiosity in the performance of the public service in which the Bureau was engaged, Dunmore and Lowell necessarily renounced the prospect of deriving from their work commercial rewards incompatible with it. \n9\n Hence there is nothing oppressive or \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 219]\n\u00a0\n unconscionable in requiring them or their licensee to surrender their patents at the instance of the United States, as there probably would be if the inventions had not been made within the scope of their employment or if the employment did not contemplate invention at all.\n The issue raised here is unaffected by legislation. Undoubtedly the power rests with Congress to enact a rule of decision for determining the ownership and control of patents on inventions made by government employees in the course of their employment. But I find no basis for saying that Congress has done so or that it has manifested any affirmative policy for the disposition of cases of this kind, which is at variance with the considerations which are controlling here.\n The Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 851, as amended July 1, 1918, 40 Stat. 704, 705 (35 USCA  68), permitted patentees to sue the government in the Court of Claims for the unauthorized use of their patents. It was in effect an eminent domain statute by which just compensation was secured to the patentee, whose patent had been used by the government. See Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 331\n, 48 S.Ct. 194. This statute excluded government employees from the benefits of the act in order, as the House Committee Report explicitly points out, to leave unaffected the shop rights of the government. See H.R. Report No. 1288, 61st Cong.2d Sess. A statute thus \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 220]\n\u00a0\n aimed at protecting in every case the minimum rights of the government can hardly be taken to deny other and greater rights growing out of the special equity of cases like the resent.\n The Act of April 30, 1928, 45 Stat. 467, 468 (35 USCA  45), amending an earlier statute of 1883 (22 Stat. 625), so as to permit a patent to be issued to a government employee without payment of fees, for any invention which the head of a department or independent bureau certifies 'is used or liable to be used in the public interest,' and which the application specifies may, if patented, 'be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment ... of any royalty,' was passed, it is true, with the general purpose of encouraging government employees to take out patents on their inventions. But this purpose was not, as the opinion of the Court suggests, born of a congressional intent that a government employee who conceives an invention in the course of his employment should be protected in his right to exclude all others but the government from using it. Congress was concerned neither with enlarging nor with narrowing the relative rights of the government and its employees. \n10\n This is apparent from the language of the statute that the patent shall be issued without a fee 'subject to existing law,' as well as from the records of its legislative history. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 178, 221]\n\u00a0\n The purpose of Congress in facilitating the patenting of inventions by government employees was to protect the existing right of the government to use all devices invented in the service, whether or not the patentee was employed to use his inventive powers. Experience had shown that this shop right was jeopardized unless the employee applied for a patent, since without the disclosure incident to the application the government was frequently hampered in its defense of claims by others asserting priority of invention. But doubt which had arisen whether an application for a patent under the Act of 1883 did not operate to dedicate the patent to the public,12 and reluctance to pay the fees otherwise required, had led government employees to neglect to make applications, even when they were entitled to the benefits of the monopoly subject only to the government's right of use. This doubt the amendment removed. It can hardly be contended that, in removing it in order to aid the government in the protection of its shop right, Congress declared a policy that it should have no greater right to control a patent procured either under this special statute or under the general patent laws by fraud or any other type of inequitable conduct. Had such a policy been declared, it is difficult to see on what basis we could award the government a remedy, as it seems to be agreed we would, if Dunmore and Lowell had been specifically employed to make the inventions. There is nothing to indicate that Congress adopted one policy for such a case and a contrary one for this. \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 222]\n\u00a0\n Other legislation proposed, but not enacted,13 requires but a word. Even had Congress expressly rejected a bill purporting to enact into law the rule of decision which I think applicable here, its failure to act could not be accorded the force of law. But no such legislation has been proposed to Congress, and that which was suggested may have been and probably was defeated for reasons unconnected with the issue presented in this case. The legislative record does show, as the opinion of the Court states, that it is a difficult question which has been the subject of consideration at least since the war, whether the public interest is best served by the \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 223]\n\u00a0\n dedication of an invention to the public or by its exploitation with patent protection under license from the government or the inventor. But the difficulty of resolving the question does not justify a decree which does answer it in favor of permitting government employees such as these to exploit their inventions without restriction, rather than one which would require the cancellation of their patents or their assignment to the United States.\n The decrees should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES (dissenting):\n I agree with Mr. Justice STONE'S analysis of the facts showing the nature of the employment of Dunmore and Lowell, and with his conclusions as to the legal effect \n\n[289 U.S. 178, 224]\n\u00a0\n of that employment. As the people of the United States should have the unrestricted benefit of the inventions in such a case, I think that the appropriate remedy would be to cancel the patents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 F.(2d) 306. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 59 F.(2d) 381. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1449; Act of February 14, 1903,  4, 32 Stat. 826. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1044; Act of May 29, 1920, 41 Stat. 684; Act of March 3, 1921, 41 Stat. 1303. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The fees charged cover merely the cost of the service rendered, as provided in the Act of June 30, 1932,  312, 47 Stat. 410 (15 USCA  276). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Webster's New International Dictionary: 'Monopoly.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] U.S. Code, tit. 35,  33 (35 USCA  33). \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Rev.

It is sufficient, however, for present purposes, to call attention to the following instances:\n Dr. Frederick A. Kolster was employed in the radio section, Bureau of Standards, from December, 1912, until about March 1, 1921. He applied for the following patents: No. 1,609,366, for radio apparatus, application dated November 26, 1920. No 1,447,165, for radio method and apparatus, application dated January 30, 1919. No. 1,311,654, for radio method and apparatus, application dated March 25, 1916. No. 1,394,560, for apparatus for transmitting radiant energy, application dated November 24, 1916. The Patent Office records show assignments of these patents to Federal Telegraph Company, San Francisco, Cal., of which Dr. Kolster is now president. He testified that these are all subject to a nonexclusive license in the United States to use and practice the same.\n Burten McCollum was an employee of the Bureau of Standards between 1911 and 1924. On the dates mentioned he filed the following applications for patents, which were issued to him: No. 1,035,373, alternating current induction motor, March 11, 1912. No. 1,156,364, induction motor, February 25, 1915. No. 1,226.091, alternating current induction motor, August 2, 1915. No. 1,724,495, method and apparatus for determining the slope of subsurface rock boundaries, October 24, 1923. No. 1,724,720, method and apparatus for studying subsurface contours, October 12, 1923. The last two inventions were assigned to McCollum Geological Explorations, Inc., a Delaware corporation.\n Herbert B. Brooks, while an employee of the Bureau between 1912 and 1930, filed November 1, 1919, an application on which patent No. 1,357,197, for an electric transformer, was issued.\n William W. Coblentz, an employee of the Bureau of Standards from 1913, and still such at the date of the trial, on the dates mentioned, filed applications on which patents issued as follows: No. 1,418,362, for electrical resistance, September 22, 1920.

Suppose an employee of the Government invents some improvement which is very valuable, is he compelled to give the Government free use of it?\n\n'Mr. Vestal (who reported the bill for the Committee and was in charge of it). If he is employed by the Government and the invention is made while working in his capacity as an agent of the Government. If the head of the bureau certifies this invention will be used by the Government, then the Government, of course, gets it without the payment of any royalty.\n\n'Mr. LaGuardia. The same as a factory rule?\n\n'Mr. Vestal. Yes; but the man who takes out the patent has his commercial rights outside.\n\n'Mr. LaGuardia. Outside of the Government? \n\n'Mr. Vestal. Yes.\n\n'Mr. LaGuardia. But the custom is, and without this bill, the Government has the right to the use of the improvement without payment if it is invented in Government time and in Government work.\n\n'Mr. Vestal. That is correct; and then on top of that, may I say that a number of instances have occurred where an employee of the Government, instead of taking out a patent had some one else take out the patent and the Government has been involved in a number of suits. There is now $600, 000,000 worth of such claims in the Court of Claims.'\n\n It will be noted from the last statement of the gentleman in charge of the bill that Congress was concerned with questions of policy in the adoption of the amendment.

See, also, the Hearings before the same Committee, January 23, 1920, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. (1920), p. 5. The opinion of the Court attributes importance to the fact, seemingly irrelevant, that other employees of the Bureau have in some instances in the past taken out patents on their inventions which, so far as appears, the government has not prevented them from enjoying. The circumstances under which those inventions were made do not appear. But, even if they were the same as those in the present case, there is no basis for contending that, because the government saw fit not to assert its rights in other cases, it has lost them in this. Moreover, there is no necessary inconsistency in the government's position if it concluded in those cases that the public interest would be served best by permitting the employees to exploit their inventions themselves, and adopted a contrary conclusion here. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Throughout the various speculations in committee as to what those rights were, it was generally agreed that they were intended to remain unchanged by the bill. See Hearings before the House Committee on Patents, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., on H.R. 3267 and 11403 (1925); Hearings before the same Committee, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. (1928), especially at pp. 8-13.

Report No. 1596, 68th Cong., 2d Sess.; H.R. Report No. 871, Senate Report No. 765, 70th Cong., 1st Sess.

It passed the Senate on one occasion and the House on another, but failed to become a law.

And see 60 Cong.Rec., 2890, 3229, 3264-3269, 3537. Differences were stressed in the purposes and needs of different agencies of the government. See especially Hearings (1919), supra, pp. 22, 24, 25. The need of commercial incentives to private exploiters as well as the general desirability of such exploitation were admitted, but the dangers were recognized as well. It was thought that the public interest would best be served by the establishment of a single agency for government control, with the power to determine upon some compensation for the inventor.\n After the death of this bill in the Senate, February 21, 1921, the subject was again considered by an Interdepartmental Board established by executive order of President Harding. August 9, 1922. Its report was transmitted to Congress by President Coolidge, in December, 1923. Sen. Doc. No. 83, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. The Board found that there had never been any general governmental policy established with respect to inventions, that whether public dedication, private exploitation, or governmental control and administration is desirable depends largely on the nature of the invention. Accordingly, legislation was recommended establishing a permanent Interdepartmental Patents Board with the power to demand assignments of patents on those inventions thereafter developed in the service which 'in the interest of the national defense, or otherwise in the public interest' should be controlled by the government. No action was taken upon this proposal.\n Since that time the Director of the Bureau of Standards has recommended that a 'uniform, equitable policy of procedure' be defined for the government by legislation. Annual Report for 1925, p. 40. In the Report for 1931 it is said (page 46) that the 'patent policy of this Bureau has always been that patentable devices developed by employees paid out of public funds belong to the public,' and the Report for 1932 adds ( page 40) 'if not so dedicated directly, the vested rights should be held by the Government.' \n\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. FACTORS & FINANCE CO.(1933)\nNo. 141\nArgued: December 8, 1932Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Chas. B.\nRugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n for the United states.\n Mr. J. Gilmer Korner, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The suit is by a taxpayer to recover $19,995.44, with interest, an overpayment of income and profits tax. Here, as in other cases decided at this session, the judgment stands or falls according to our determination of the time within which a notice of a claim for refund is subject to amendment.\n On June 15, 1918, respondent, a corporation, filed an income and profits tax return for the calendar year ending December 31, 1917, and made payment of the tax in accordance therewith. The amount of the payment was $177,338.72. In May, 1920, the Commissioner made an assessment of an additional tax for 1917 in the sum of $267.32, which was paid by the respondent on June 29, 1920. In August, 1920, the Commissioner made another assessment of an additional tax for the same year in the sum of $ 25,327.91. On account of this additional tax, respondent on October 4, 1920, made a payment of $9,388.57, and in the same month filed a claim for the abatement of $15,933.34, the amount of the unpaid balance. In connection with this claim for abatement, the Commissioner made an order on May 6, 1921, for a full examination of the affairs of the taxpayer by an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such an examination was made, and a report by the examiner was filed with his superior.\n In February, 1923, the audit by the Commissioner was still incomplete, and the amount of the assessment not finally determined. The taxpayer was fearful, so it seems, that the time might go by within which claims for overpayments were due under the law. To forestall any \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n default, it lodged with the Commissioner on February 27, 1923, a claim for $ 177,606.04 in terms of sweeping generality. It stated in so doing that there had been at that time no final audit of its return or assessment of the tax, and that the purpose of the notice was to save the taxpayer's rights under the applicable statutes 'and to permit the Commissioner to refund to deponent any excess paid over taxes actually found to be due.' There was no statement in this notice as to the grounds of the claim that the payments were excessive. No such statement was made until July 17, 1925, when there was filed with the Commissioner an amended claim for refund, setting forth grounds in detail. In this amended claim the taxpayer explains the reasons why a special assessment should be made in accordance with section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917 (chapter 63, 40 Stat. 300, 307), permitting that procedure where the amount of the tax cannot otherwise be determined with accuracy or justice. A copy of that section is quoted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n In the interval between February, 1923, and July, 1925, there had been action by the Commissioner upon the claim for abatement which had been filed by the taxpayer in October, 1920. A claim for abatement, unlike a claim for refund, has relation to a tax assessed, but still unpaid. Rock Island A. & L.R.R. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 141\n, 41 S.Ct. 55. The Commissioner declined to abate the whole amount of $15,933.34 withheld by the taxpayer, but did declare an overassessment of $3,293.89, leaving a balance of $12,639.45, with interest, then determined to be due. This balance the taxpayer discharged by payment to the collector in November, 1923\n\n\n The claim for abatement had thus been disposed of, but no action had yet been taken upon the claim for refund. The Commissioner permitted this to slumber, without deciding or considering it, till after the filing of the amendment in July, 1925. Upon receipt of that amendment, or soon afterwards, he proceeded to a consideration of the claim upon the merits. There were hearings and rehearings at which the taxpayer gave evidence in support of its claim that its payments had been excessive and that there was need of a special assessment to arrive at a computation consistent with equity and justice. The Commissioner decided the merits of the controversy in favor of the taxpayer. He held that a case had been made out for a special assessment in accordance with section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917. He held, after computing the tax accordingly, that there had been an overpayment of taxes in the sum of $32,634.89. He held, however, that the notice of claim of February 27, 1923, was defective for failure to state the grounds of the taxpayer's objections; that the notice of July 17, 1925, was without avail as an amendment in respect of overpayments made in 1918 and 1920, since as to these it was too late; that it was good as an original claim for the refund of the overpayment made in November, 1923; \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n and hence that, of the total overpayments of $32,634.89, there should be a refund of $12,639.45, the 1923 installment, with $3,028.24, interest paid thereon, and that, as to the residue of the overpayments, $19,995.44, a refund should be refused. A very different case would be here if the Commissioner had ruled that no adequate reason for a special assessment had been established, and had refused relief upon that ground. We do not say that a justiciable controversy would then have arisen for a court. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 48 S.Ct. 587; United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, 53 S.Ct. 283, decided herewith. What he did was to find that there was need for a special method, that the application of such a method would reduce the tax by a stated sum, but that, because of defects in the form of the claimant's notice, there could be relief only in part. For the amount thus disallowed, the taxpayer brought suit in the Court of Claims, which overruled the action of the Commissioner and gave judgment accordingly. 56 F.(2d) 902, 73 Ct.Cl. 707. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n287 \nU.S. 582\n, 53 S.Ct. 16, 77 L.Ed. --.\n We are holding in United States v. Memphis Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S. Ct. 278, that a general claim for refund, not specifying grounds, is subject to amendment until final rejection irrespective of a limitation running in the interval. We are holding in United States v. Henry Prentiss Co., Inc., \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, 53 S.Ct. 283, that under the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) a claim specifying as the sole ground for relief the necessity for a special assessment by reason of anomalous conditions prevailing in the claimant's business may not be turned by amendment into one for the revision of an assessment by increasing the value of real estate included in invested capital. The present case falls midway, or near to that, between the other two. Here the taxpayer did not specify and ground in the claim first presented, but offered an amendment afterwards setting forth the reasons why the assessment should be special. \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n The case is a close one, giving fair opportunity for argument either way, but we think the better reasons uphold the privilege of amendment.\n\n 1. \nThe conclusion favorable to the privilege has support in the analogies of pleadings in a lawsuit. The claim in its original form is one for money had and received to the use of the respondent after the manner of the common counts in a suit at common law. It does not specify a particular state of facts, as did the claim in the Prentiss Case, abandoning all others. It charges overpayment generally, and thus brings within its range whatever facts reside in the domain of equity and conscience.\n\n 2. \nThe conclusion thus supported by the analogy of pleadings is not inconsistent with the necessities of administrative practice.\n This is not a case where the grounds injected by the amendment have already been abandoned by agreement tacit or express. Such abandonment and agreement there was in the Prentiss Case; the claimant seeking at the beginning the privilege of the special method of assessment and reverting thereafter to another ground of challenge which by implication, if not expressly, it had promised to renounce. This is a case where the claimant has left the grounds of challenge open, and where the Bureau has itself to blame for not insisting at the outset upon a full disclosure of the grievance.\n There are other elements of difference, however, besides the presence or absence of agreement, that divide the Prentiss Case from this one. These other elements of difference are even more important, for the Prentiss ruling would have been the same if agreement had been absent. When the two cases are considered in the light of administrative practice, a distinction is to be noted at the outset between the nature of a special assessment under the Revenue Act of 1918,  327(d), 40 Stat. 1093, and the nature of such an assessment under the Act of 1917, \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n s 210. The application in the Prentiss Case was made under section 327(d) of the Act of 1918, whereby the taxpayer, ignoring a possible challenge of the computation of invested capital, plants itself upon the ground of a variance between the statutory definition and the economic concept, and calls upon the Commissioner to exercise a dispensing power given to him, in circumstances of hardship, by the provisions of the statute. In an application for special relief under section 210 of the Act of 1917, the grounds of challenge are very different if the letter of the section is the measure of relief thereunder. The value of the invested capital under the statutory definition (Revenue Act of 1917,  207) is not put aside in such circumstances as an irrelevant inquiry. On the contrary, it becomes the very essence of the claim by the taxpayer that there must be a recourse to another method. Under section 210 of the Act of 1917, the special method is not permissible unless 'the Secretary of the Treasury is unable in any case satisfactorily to determine the invested capital.' In brief, section 210 of the Act of 1917 is the precursor of section 327(a) of the Act of 1918, and is not at all the analogue of section 327(d). Cf. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 48 S.Ct. 587.\n We are not forgetful of the fact that, by the regulations of the Commissioner and the practice of his Bureau, the distinction between the two acts has been obscured, if not destroyed. Relief has been granted under the Act of 1917 as if its provisions were the same as those of the act adopted later. Treasury Regulations 41, 1918, art. 52. Cf. R. H. Montgomery, Excess Profits Tax Assessment (1920), pp. 242, 243. The validity of the regulations, if applied to proceedings under the Act of 1917, is a question not now before us. The practice, we may say in passing, has not been left unchallenged, but has been criticized in the Report of the Senate Committee for the Investigation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. See \n\n[288 U.S. 89, 96]\n\u00a0\n Report No. 27, pt. I, pp. 214, 215, et seq., 69th Congress, First Session, 1925-26. Certain at all events it is that an appeal to the Commissioner to exercise his jurisdiction under section 210 of the Act of 1917 is not confined to the occasions stated in section 327(d) of the Act of 1918, if indeed it covers them at all. It is at least board enough to give notice that jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with the letter of section 210, upon the ground, that is to say, of the inability of the Commissioner to arrive at a conclusion as to value satisfactory to himself. Under section 327(d) of the Act of 1918, a special assessment is not ordered except on the motion of the taxpayer, setting forth the special reasons why the statutory definition is oppressive, and why another method should be adopted. Under section 210 of the Act of 1917, as under section 327(a) of the Act of 1918, the Commissioner acts of his own motion whenever he is unable to satisfy himself that the valuation will be accurate if there is adherence to the statute.\n This question, if no other, he must have considered and determined when a claim for refund was submitted by the taxpayer without specifying the grounds. United States v. Memphis Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S.Ct. 278. This question, if no other, he must again have considered and determined when he certified to the taxpayer, after the claim had been amended and after submission of the evidence, that section 210 of the Act of 1917 supplied the applicable rule. It is a question that in last analysis is addressed to his own conscience, and, in the absence of any evidence impeaching his conclusion, his certificate of satisfaction or the contrary is binding on the courts.\n The cumulative force of these administrative opportunities and these procedural analogies upholds the claim and the amendment.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 210.

By stipulation it was conceded, as though stated in a bill of particulars, that the Padnsay, at the time of the offense charged, was unloading, being attached to the shore by cables, at a point 250 miles inland from the mouth of the Congo river.\n The District Court, following its earlier decision in United States ex rel. Maro v. Mathues, 21 F(2d) 533, affirmed (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 518, sustained a demurrer to the indictment and discharged the prisoner on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to try the offense charged. 3 F.Supp. 134. The case comes here by direct appeal under the Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1264, 18 U.S.C.  682 (18 USCA  682) and section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C.  345 (28 USCA  345), the court below certifying that its decision was founded upon its construction of section 272 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  451 (18 USCA  451).\n Sections 273 and 275 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  452, 454 (18 USCA  452, 454), define murder and fix its punishment. Section 272,1 upon the construction of which the court below rested its decision, makes punishable offenses defined by other sections of the Criminal Code, among other cases, \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 146]\n\u00a0\n 'when committed within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State on board any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States' or any of its nationals. And by section 41 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  102 (28 USCA  102), venue to try offenses 'committed upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district,' is 'in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first brought.' As the offense charged here was committed on board a vessel lying outside the territorial jurisdiction of a state, see Wynne v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 234\n, 30 S.Ct. 447; United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249, 265\n, 14 S.Ct. 109, and within that of a foreign sovereignty, the court below was without jurisdiction to try and punish the offense unless it was within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States.\n Two questions are presented on this appeal, first, whether the extension of the judicial power of the federal government 'to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,' by article 3,  2, of the Constitution confers on Congress power to define and punish offenses perpetrated by a citizen of the United States on board one of its merchant vessels lying in vavigable waters within the territorial limits of another sovereignty; and, second, whethr Congress has exercised that power by the enactment of section 272 of the Criminal Code under which the indictment was found.\n The court below thought, as appellee argues, that as section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution specifically granted to Congress the power 'to define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations,' and 'to make rules concerning captures on land and water,' that provision must be regarded as a limitation on the general provision of section 2 of article 3, that the judicial power shall extend 'to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction'; that as the specific \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 147]\n\u00a0\n grant of power to punish offenses outside the territorial limits of the United States was thus restricted to offenses occurring on the high seas, the more general grant could not be resorted to as extending either the legislative or judicial power over offenses committed on vessels outside the territorial limits of the United States and not on the high seas.\n Before the adoption of the Constitution, jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime cases was distributed between the Confederation and the individual states. Article 9 of the Articles of Confederation provided that 'the United States in Congress assembled, shall have the sole and exclusive right and power ... of establishing rules for deciding in all cases, what captures on land or water shall be legal, ... appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and establishing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures. ...' So much of the general admiralty and maritime jurisdiction as was not included in this grant of power remained with the states. The powers thus granted were in substance the same as those later conferred on the national government by article 1,  8, of the Federal Constitution. This section was adopted to carry out a resolution of the Convention 'that the national legislature ought to possess the legislative rights vested in Congress by the Confederation.' Its primary purpose and effect was to transfer to the newly organized government the powers in a admiralty matters previously vested in the Confederation. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 137, 148]\n\u00a0\n A proposal independently made and considered in the Convention that 'the admiralty jurisdiction ought to be given wholly to the national government,' resulted in the adoption of article 3,  2, by which the judicial power of the United States was extended to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n This section has been consistently interpreted as adopting for the United States the system of admiralty and maritime law, as it had been developed in the admiralty courts of England and the Colonies, and, by implication, conferring on Congress the power, subject to well recognized limitations not here material,4 to alter, qualify, or \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 149]\n\u00a0\n supplement it as experience or changing conditions may require. Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 386\n, 388 S., 44 S.Ct. 391; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 39\n, 52 S.Ct. 285; see The Oconee (D.C. 280 F. 927; United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 389.\n In view of the history of the two clauses and the manner of their adoption, the grant of power to define and punish piracies and felonies on the high seas cannot be deemed to be a limitation on the powers, either legislative or judicial, conferred on the national government by article 3 ,  2. The two clauses are the result of separate steps independently taken in the Convention, by which the jurisdiction in admiralty, previously divided between the Confederation and the states, was transferred to the national government. It would be a surprising result, and one plainly not anticipated by the framers or justified by principles which ought to govern the interpretation of a Constitution devoted to the redistribution of governmental powers, if part of them were lost in the process of transfer. To construe the one clause as limiting rather than supplementing the other would be to ignore their history, and without effecting any discernible purpose of their enactment, to deny to both the states and the national government powers which were common attributes of sovereignty before the adoption of the Constitution. The result would be to deny to both the power to define and punish crimes of less gravity than felonies committed on vessels of the United States while on the \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 150]\n\u00a0\n high seas, and crimes of every grade committed on them while in foreign territorial waters.\n As we cannot say that the specific grant of power to define and punish felonies on the high seas operated to curtail the legislative or judicial power conferred by article 3,  2, we come to the question principally argued, whether the jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime cases, which it gave, extends to the punishment of crimes committed on vessels of the United States while in foreign waters. As was pointed out by Mr. Justice Story, in the course of an elaborate review of the history of admiralty jurisdiction, in De Lovio v. Boit, 7 Fed.Cas. 418, 438, No. 3, 776, admiralty 'from the highest antiquity, has exercised a very extensive criminal jurisdiction, and punished offences by fine and imprisonment.' \n5\n The English courts have \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 151]\n\u00a0\n consistently held that jurisdiction is not restricted to vessels within the navigable waters of the realm, but follows its ships upon the high seas and into ports and rivers within the territorial jurisdiction of foreign sovereigns. Queen v. Carr & Wilson, 10 Q.B.D. 76; Queen v. Anderson, L.R., 1 Crown Cases Reserved 161; Rex v. Allen, 1 Moody C.C. 494; see Rex v. Jemot, 1 Russell on Crimes, 4th ed. 153.\n The criminal jurisdiction of the United States is wholly statutory, see United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32, but it has never been doubted that the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to the federal government includes the legislative power to define and punish crimes committed upon vessels lying in navigable waters of the United States. From the very organization of the government, and without intermission, Congress has also asserted the power, analogous to that exercised by English courts of admiralty, to punish crimes committed on vessels of the United States while on the high seas or on navigable waters not within the territorial jurisdiction of \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 152]\n\u00a0\n a state. The Act of April 30, 1790, c. 9,  8, 1 Stat. 112, 113 (18 USCA  481 note), provided for the punishment of murder committed 'upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, basin or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State,' and provided for the trial of the offender in the district where he might be apprehended or 'into which he may first be brought.' Section 12 of this Act (18 USCA  498 and note) dealt with manslaughter, but only when committed upon the high seas. It is true that in United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, the prisoner, charged with murder on a warship in Boston Harbor, was discharged, as was one charged with manslaughter committed on a vessel on a Chinese River in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76. But the judgments were based not upon a want of power in Congress to define and punish the crimes charged, but upon the ground that the statute did not apply, in the one case, for the reason that the place of the offense was not out of the jurisdiction of a state, and in the other, because the offense, manslaughter, was not committed on the high seas. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of March 3, 1825, c. 65,  4, 4 Stat. 115, provided for the punishment of any person committing murder 'upon the high seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven, creek, basin or bay, within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state,' and section 22 provided for the punishment of assault with a dangerous \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 153]\n\u00a0\n weapon, committed under similar circumstances. \n7\n The provisions of the latter section, carried into section 5346 of the Revised Statutes (18 USCA  455), were upheld in United States v. Rodgers, supra, as a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress to define and punish offenses occurring in American vessels while within territorial waters of another sovereignty. Rodgers had been convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, committed on a vessel of the United States lying in the Detroit river within the territorial jurisdiction of Canada, and his conviction was sustained by this court. It was assumed that the statute was applicable only with respect to offenses committed on the high seas and waters tributary to them, and the decision turned on whether the Great Lakes were to be deemed 'high seas' within the meaning of the statute. It was held that they were, and the power of Congress to punish offenses committed on an American vessel within the territorial waters of Canada, tributary to the Lakes, was expressly affirmed.\n As the offense charged here appears to have been committed on an American vessel while discharging cargo in port, the jurisdiction is not affected by the fact that she \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 154]\n\u00a0\n was then at a point on the Congo remote from the sea, where it does not affirmatively appear that the water is salt or tidal. On this point also United States v. Rodgers, supra, is controlling, for there the offense committed within a foreign territorial jurisdiction was upon nontidal fresh water. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 137, 155]\n\u00a0\n The appellee insists that even though Congress has power to define and punish crimes on American vessels in foreign waters, it has not done so by the present statute, since the criminal jurisdiction of the United States is based upon the territorial principle and the statute cannot rightly be interpreted to be a departure from that principle. But the language of the statute making it applicable to offenses committed on an American vessel outside the jurisdiction of a state 'within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States; is broad enough to include crimes in the territorial waters of a foreign sovereignty. For Congress, by incorporating in the statute the very language of the constitutional grant of power, has made its exercise of the power coextensive with the grant. Compare The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555.\n It is true that the criminal jurisdiction of the United States is in general based on the territorial principle, and criminal statutes of the United States are not by implication given an extraterritorial effect. United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 43 S.Ct. 39; compare Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421\n, 52 S.Ct. 252. But that principle has never been thought to be applicable to a merchant vessel which, for purposes of the jurisdiction of the courts of the sovereignty whose flag it flies to punish crimes committed upon it, is deemed to be a part of the territory of that sovereignty, and not to lose that character when in navigable \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 156]\n\u00a0\n waters within the territorial limits of another sovereignty. United States v. Rodgers, supra; compare Thomas v. Lane, Fed. Cas. No. 13,902, 2 Sumn. 1; Queen v. Anderson, supra; Queen v. Carr & Wilson, supra; Rex v. Allen, supra; Rex v. Jemot, supra. This qualification of the territorial principle in the case of vessels of the flag was urged by Mr. Webster while Secretary of State, in his letter to Lord Ashburton9 of August 1, 1842, quoted with approval in United States v. \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 157]\n\u00a0\n Rodgers, supra, \n150 \nU.S. 264, 265\n, 14 S.Ct. 109. Subject to the right of the territorial sovereignty to assert jurisdiction over offenses disturbing the peace of the port, it has been supported by writers on international law, and has been recognized by France, Belgium, and other continental countries, as well as by England and the United States. See Moore, International Law Digest, vol. 2, 287, 297; Fiore, International Law Codified, translated by E. M. Borchard, 192, 193; Wheaton, International Law, vol. I, 245; Hall, International Law (8th Ed.) 253-258; Jessup, The Law of Territorial Waters, 144-193.\n In view of the wide recognition of this principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction over crimes committed on merchant vessels and its explicit adoption in United States v. Rodgers, supra, we cannot say that the language of the present statute punishing offenses on United States vessels out of the jurisdiction of a state, 'when committed within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States,' was not intended to give effect to it. If the meaning of the statute were doubtful, the doubt would be resolved by the report on these sections by the Special Joint Committee on the Revision of the Laws, 60th Congress, 1st Sess., Rep. 10, part 1, p. 10, in which it was pointed out that the jurisdiction extends to vessels of the United States when on navigable waters within the limits of a foreign state, and 'all cases arising on board such vessels while on any such waters, are clearly cases within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States.'\n A related but different question, not presented here, may arise when jurisdiction over an offense committed on a foreign vessel is asserted by the sovereignty in whose waters it was lying at the time of its commission, since for some purposes, the jurisdiction may be regarded as concurrent, in that the courts of either sovereignty may try the offense. \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 158]\n\u00a0\n There is not entire agreement among nations or the writers on international law as to which sovereignty should yield to the other when the jurisdiction is asserted by both. See Jessup, the Law of Territorial Waters, 144-193. The position of the United States exemplified in Wildenhus's Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S.Ct. 385, has been that at least in the case of major crimes, affecting the peace and tranquillity of the port, the jurisdiction asserted by the sovereignty of the port must prevail over that of the vessel. In that case the Belgian Consul sought release on habeas corpus of Wildenhus, a seaman, who was held in a New Jersey jail on a charge of homicide committed on a Belgian vessel lying in New Jersey waters, on the ground that Article 11 of the Convention between Belgium and the United States of March 9, 1880, 21 Stat. 781, gave consular officers of the sovereignty of the vessel sole cognizance of offenses on board ship, except those of a nature to disturb the tranquillity and public order on shore and those involving a person not belonging to the crew. The court construed the Convention as inapplicable to the crime of murder and upheld the jurisdiction of the local court as conforming to the principles of international law. It said, page 12 of 120 U.S., 7 S.Ct. 385, 387:\n'And so by comity it came to be generally understood among civilized nations that all matters of discipline, and all things done on board, which affected only the vessel, or those belonging to her, and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquility of the port, should be left by the local government to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged as the laws of that nation, or the interests of its commerce should require. But, if crimes are committed on board of a character to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never, by comity or usage, been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws for their punishment, if the local tribunals see fit to assert their authority.' \n\n[289 U.S. 137, 159]\n\u00a0\n This doctrine does not impinge on that laid down in United States v. Rodgers, supra, that the United States may define and punish offenses committed by its own citizens on its own vessels while within foreign waters where the local sovereign has not asserted its jurisdiction. \n10\n In the absence of any controlling treaty provision, and any assertion of jurisdiction by the territorial sovereign, it is the duty of the courts of the United States to apply to offenses committed by its citizens on vessels flying its flag, its own statutes, interpreted in the light of recognized principles of international law. So applied the indictment here sufficiently charges an offense within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and the judgment below must be\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  272. 'The crimes and offenses defined in this chapter shall be punished as herein prescribed:\n'First. When committed upon the high seas, or on any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, or when committed within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State on board any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, or District thereof. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On July 16, 1787, the Convention agreed nem. con. 'that the national legislature ought to possess the legislative rights vested in Congress by the Confederation.' This proposal was committed to the Committee of Detail in resolution VI, of July 26th. The Committee, on August 6th, in Article VII of their draft, recommended a provision, based on the Articles of Confederation, which, as formulated by the Convention on August 17th, and amended in matters not now material by the Committee on Style, was included in article 1,  8, of the Constitution. See Madison's Diary, International Edition, pp. 260, 333, 340, 341, 415, 416. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On June 5, 1787, Wilson stated to the Convention that he thought the admiralty jurisdiction should be given wholly to the national government. Resolution XVI, which was referred to the Committee on Detail on July 26th, provided that the jurisdiction of the national judiciary 'shall extend to cases arising under laws passed by the general legislature and to such other questions as involve the natural peace and harmony.' Wilson was one of the five members of the Committee on Detail, chosen on July 24th, which reported, August 6th, Article XI, dealing with the jurisdiction of federal courts, and containing in section 3 a provision extending the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 'to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction' which was ultimately incorporated in section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, as finally adopted.

Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 386\n, 387 S., 44 S.Ct. 391, 393, the court said: 'when all is considered, therefore, there is no room to doubt that the power of Congress extends to the entire subject and permits of the exercise of a wide discretion. But there are limitations which have come to be well recognized. One is that there are boundaries to the maritime law and admiralty jurisdiction which inhere in those subjects and cannot be altered by legislation, as by excluding a thing falling clearly within them or including a thing falling clearly without. Another is that the spirit and purpose of the constitutional provision require that the enactments-when not relating to matters whose existence or influence is confined to a more restricted field, as in Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319-shall be co- extensive with and operate uniformly in the whole of the United States. Waring v.

They were often common law judges who sat as commissioners for the trial of crimes within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Holdsworth, History of English Law (3d Ed.) vol. I, 550-552; Hale, Pleas of the Crown, vol. II, 17; Stephen, History of Criminal Law of England, vol. II, 16-23; cf. Brooks, Trial of Captain Kidd, 40, 57. There is evidence that during the seventeenth century the courts of Virginia and Maryland tried felonies and piracies which, in England, would have been within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Commissioners. See Crump, Colonial Admiralty Jurisdiction in the Seventeenth Century, 68. The practice under the statute, 28 Henry VIII, c. 15, was extended to the Colonies in cases of 'piracy, felonies and robberies,' by statute 11 and 12 William III, c. 7. See 2 Stephen, supra, 20. In Virginia, very shortly before the enactment of this statute, an act was passed adopting the provisions of the statute of Henry VIII. 3 Hening, Statutes at Large of Virginia, 176.

Compare Rhode Island: Letters from Governors in America, 1756, P.R.O.: C.O.5.: 17, p. 639 (Ms. copy in Library of Congress), which indicates a trial at Providence for murder on the high seas in a special admiralty court constituted under the statute 11 and 12 William III. Captain Kidd, who was arrested in Boston prior to 1700 for murder and piracy on the high seas, was transported to England for trial before an admiralty court organized pursuant to royal commission (see 14 Howell's State Trials, 123, 147, 191) and this practice may well have continued after the statute of William III. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In United States v. M'Gill, 4 Dall. 426, Fed. Cas. No. 15,676, Mr. Justice Washington, sitting in the Circuit Court in a case where the offense charged was murder committed on a vessel lying in the haven of Cape Francois, held that the statute did not apply where the mortal stroke was given on the vessel, but the death occurred on shore, since the murder was not committed on the high seas or any river, basin, or bay. He doubted whether the offense thus committed was cognizable in admiralty in the absence of statute, but stated he had no doubt of the power of Congress to provide for it. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] By section 5, the provisions of the act of 1825 (4 Stat. 115) were specifically made applicable to any offense 'committed on board of any ship or vessel, belonging to any citizen or citizens of the United States, while lying in a port or place within the jurisdiction of any foreign state or sovereign, by any person belonging to the company of said ship, or any passenger, or any other person belonging to the company of said ship, or any other passenger. ...' This language was not, in terms, incorporated in the Revised Statutes.\n Daniel Webster, Chairman of the House Committee having in charge the bill which became the Act of 1825, pointed out in introducing it that the offenses for which it provided punishment had actually occurred upon our ships, while lying in the harbors of foreign nations and had gone unpunished for want of such legislation. Gall & Seaton's Register of Debates in Congress, vol. 1, cols, 154, 158. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] That the jurisdiction in admiralty 'extends as far as the tide ebbs and flows' was a convenient definition of its limits in the historic controversy over the conflicting claims of jurisdiction of the English courts of common law and admiralty over waters within the realm (see De Lovio v. Boit, 7 Fed.Cas. 418, 428, No. 3,776; compare Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 453; United States v. Commbs, 12 Pet. 72; Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240\n, 11 S.Ct. 559), a conflict which was but an aspect of the struggle for supremacy of the common law and the prerogative courts. Cf. Julius Goebel, Cases and Materials on the Development of Legal Institutions (1931), 225. But it is a very different question whether the traditional jurisdiction of admiralty conferred upon the United States by the Constitution, extends to nontidal waters. In England public navigable waters are tidal, and with respect to them the terms have been used interchangeably. But there is nothing in the nature of maritime transactions or the maritime law, which is concerned with the affairs of vessels and those who sail, own, use, or injure them, which need limit its application to tidal waters. See Benedict on Admiralty (5th Ed.)  39, 43. This was recognized and acted upon by the Vice-Admiralty Courts in the Colonies. See Waring v. Clarke, supra, 5 How. 454, 455, 456. In Queen v. Anderson, L.R. 1 Crown Cases Reserved 161, Mr. Justice Blackburn, in upholding the admiralty jurisdiction over manslaughter committed on a British ship forty- five miles up the River Garronne, said, p. 169, that 'the jurisdiction of the Admiralty extends over vessels, not only when they are on the open sea, but also when in places where great ships do generally go.' And in Rex v. Allen, 1 Moody C.C. 494, the judges of England upheld the admiralty jurisdiction of the crime of larceny committed on a British vessel on a Chinese river, twenty or thirty miles from the sea, although it did not appear that the water was tidal. Following the decision in The Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, that there was constitutional power in Congress to extend the admiralty jurisdiction to nontidal waters of the United States navigable in fact, civil jurisdiction of admiralty over a collision occurring in the nontidal waters of the Detroit river within the territorial jurisdiction of Canada, was sustained in the Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, and a like jurisdiction over a crime defined and punished by Act of Congress was sustained in United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249\n, 14 S.Ct. 109. See, also, Jackson v. The Magnolia, 20 How. 296; The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; and In re Garnett, \n141 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 18 S., 11 S.Ct. 840, 844, where Mr. Justice Bradley said that 'we have no hesitation in saying that the Savannah river, from its mouth to the highest point to which it is navigable, is subject to the maritime law, and the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 'It is natural to consider the vessels of a nation as parts of its territory, though at sea, as the State retains its jurisdiction over them; and, according to the commonly received custom, this jurisdiction is preserved over the vessels even in parts of the sea subject to a foreign dominion. This is the doctrine of the law of nations, clearly laid down by writers of received authority, and entirely conformable, as it is supported, with the practice of modern nations. If a murder be committed on board of an American vessel by one of the crew upon another or upon a passenger, or by a passenger on one of the crew or another passenger, while such vessel is lying in a port within the jurisdiction of a foreign State of sovereignty, the offense is cognizable and punishable by the proper court of the United States in the same manner as if such offense had been committed on board the vessel on the high seas. The law of England is supposed to be the same. It is true that the jurisdiction of a nation over a vessel belonging to it, while lying in the port of another, is not necessarily wholly exclusive. We do not so consider or so assert it. For any unlawful acts done by her while thus lying in port, and for all contracts entered into while there, by her master or owners, she and they must, doubtless, be answerable to the laws of the place. Nor, if her master or crew, while on board in such port, break the peace of the community by the commission of crimes, can exemption be claimed for them. But, nevertheless, the law of nations, as I have stated it, and the statutes of governments founded on that law, as I have referred to them, show that enlightened nations, in modern times, do clearly hold that the jurisdiction and laws of a nation accompany her ships not only over the high seas, but into ports and harbors, or wheresoever else they may be water-borne, for the general purpose of governing and regulating the rights, duties, and obligations of those on board thereof, and that, to the extent of the exercise of this jurisdiction, they are considered as parts of the territory of the nation herself.' 6 Webster's Works, 306, 307. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] That the doctrines are not in conflict was pointed out by Webster in his letter to Lord Ashburton, quoted, supra, note 9.

HENRY PRENTISS & CO.(1933)\nNo. 234\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell, Atty. Gen., and Chas. B.Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[288 U.S. 73, 77]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph F. Murray, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[288 U.S. 73, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent (the plaintiff in the court below) brought suit against the United States in a District Court to recover overpayments of income and excess profits taxes for the years 1918 and 1920. The overpayments had come about, so it was claimed, from the undervaluation by the Commissioner of the respondent's invested capital, with a consequent exaggeration of the profits to be taxed. Two items or classes of property were the subject of the con- \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 80]\n\u00a0\n troversy. In each year there has been an omission to include the full value of the real estate; indeed the parties have stipulated that the value of the real estate was greater by the sum of $46,371.08 than the sum allowed in the assessment. In each year also there had been an omission to include the value of intangible property, and particularly good will. The District Court held that there could be no relief in respect of either item for the year 1918 because the claim for refund filed with the Commissioner did not comply with the statute and the Treasury Regulations. In respect of both items, real estate and intangibles, relief was granted to the taxpayer to the extent of overpayments for the year 1920. The result was a judgment in favor of the respondent for $7,975.21. 46 F.(2d) 159. Cross-appeals followed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Upon the taxpayer's appeal, the decision was that the defective refund claim for 1918 and been made good by amendment, and that the tax for that year, as well as for 1920, had been overpaid as to the real estate. Upon the government's appeal, the decision was that the item of intangibles should have been excluded for both years. 57 F.(2d) 676. A writ of certiorari, designed to bring up the ruling as to the amendment of the claim for 1918, was granted by this court on the petition of the government. \n287 \nU.S. 585\n, 53 S.Ct. 22, 77 L.Ed. --. No petition for a writ was submitted by the taxpayer.\n On June 16, 1919, respondent filed its income and excess profits tax return for the year 1918, showing a total tax of $535,144.20, which it paid. On December 28, 1920, it paid for the year 1918 an additional tax of $ 119,191.19, as the result of an additional assessment, receiving back, however, $9,559.19 on the completion of the audit. Within the time prescribed by law, there was filed with the Commissioner, on March 14, 1924, a claim for refund. In this claim, the respondent demanded the repayment of $200,000. It stated, in substance, as the ground for this demand, \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 81]\n\u00a0\n that, owing to abnormal conditions affecting its invested capital and income, there could be no fair computation of the tax by the appraisal of the cash value of its property is accordance with section 326 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1091, 1092, 1093), and that it should have the benefit of a special assessment under sections 327 and 328.\n Section 327 of the act provides in subdivision (d) that the tax shall be determined in accordance with section 328 'where upon application by the corporation the Commissioner finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without benefit of this section would, owing to abnormal conditions affecting the capital or income of the corporation, work upon the corporation an exceptional hardship evidenced by gross disproportion between the tax computed without benefit of this section and the tax computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328.'\n Section 328 provides in effect that, in cases covered thereby, the tax shall be computed without reference to the value of the invested capital, and shall be determined by the ratio which the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business bears to their average net income.\n The respondent's claim for refund, with the specification of the erroneous denial of a special assessment as the statement of its grievance, was filed, as we have seen, in March, 1924. On May 14 of that year, the respondent received from the Commissioner a letter acknowledging the filing and notifying the claimant of the procedure to be followed. 'No consideration,' it was there written, 'may be given under the provisions of sections 327 and 328 until statutory net income and invested capital are definitely determined. It is therefore necessary that you acquiesce in the net income and invested capital as shown in the revenue agent's report of March 25, 1920, for the \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 82]\n\u00a0\n year 1918, or submit exceptions, if any, which you may take thereto. If exceptions are taken they should be presented in the form of an appeal prepared in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Decision 3492, a copy of which is enclosed.'\n The respondent does not assert that in response to this notice it took any appeal or filed any exceptions complaining of the assessment of capital or income. If any such document were in existence, it would have been equivalent to an amendment of the claim, and no doubt would be in evidence. What the respondent chose to do was obviously to acquiesce in the report that the cash value of the capital had been fairly ascertained, and to take its stand on the position that under sections 327 and 328 its tax should be determined without reference to such value and in accordance with other methods both exceptional and discretionary. Accordingly the Commissioner proceeded to a consideration of the claim that error had been committed in failing to give the taxpayer the benefit of a special method of assessment. On July 16, 1925, the respondent was advised by written notice that there was no evidence of abnormal conditions sufficient to call for a departure from the usual forms of computation. The notice, signed by an acting deputy commissioner, closes with these words: 'In accordance with the above conclusions, your claim will be rejected.' To this is added a statement that the collection for the taxpayer's district will be officially notified of the rejection at the expiration of thirty days.\n Notwithstanding this notice, the Bureau of Internal Revenue kept the proceeding open. Writing to the respondent on February 23, 1926, the Solicitor of the Bureau stated that his office has before it for consideration the application for a special assessment of the taxes for 1918, and that 'before a final decision is reached' the taxpayer 'will be granted an opportunity to be heard \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 83]\n\u00a0\n orally.' If such a hearing is not desired, 'the decision in the matter will be based upon the record as it now stands.' In answer to that invitation the respondent requested an oral hearing, which it received, and also filed on April 8, 1926, a statement under oath, which, by concession, was equivalent in form to an amended proof of claim. In this statement the respondent put before the Commissioner the evidence both as to the undervaluation of the real estate and as to the exclusion of intangibles. \n1\n The Commissioner rejected the claim on September 3, 1926, by signing the rejection schedule.\n We are holding in United States v. Memphis Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S. Ct. 278, decided herewith, that a general claim for refund, though irregular in form under the Treasury Regulations, may be amended after the period of limitation by specifying the grounds, if the amendment is made before final rejection. A statement, without explanation, to the effect that overpayments have been made in an aggregate amount is broad enough to cover and and all grounds for reassessment and return. This at all events is true where the basis of the grievance is that the tax has been erroneously computed even by the normal method, that there has been a deviation, in other words, from the statutory rule. Such is not the claim in controversy here. Here the taxpayer by its claim as originally presented abandoned the position that there had been any error of fact or law in the assessment of the tax according to the normal method, and planted itself on the position that the special method would be fairer. We are to say whether the ground thus deserted may be recovered by amendment. \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 84]\n\u00a0\n The act of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in granting or refusing a special assessment under section 327(d) of the Act of 1918 is discretionary and administrative, not subject to be challenged in any court, at least in the absence of fraud or other irregularities. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 48 S.Ct. 587. Discretionary and administrative also is the review of his determination by the Board of Tax Appeals. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, supra. If this amendment is permissible, a request for the exercise of a discretionary jurisdiction, will have been turned after the running of the statute (Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136,  252, 42 Stat. 227, 268; Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,  1011, 26 USCA  149 and note; 43 Stat. 253, 342; Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  284, 1113(a), 44 Stat. 9, 66, 116, 26 USCA  1065 and note and  156), into a claim of error of law or fact, and hence into a controversy within the jurisdiction of a court. What at the beginning was nonjusticiable, with exceptions few and narrow ( Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, supra, \n277 \nU.S. 562\n, 48 S.Ct. 587), will have become justiciable at the end.\n An amendment so far-reaching, a metamorphosis so complete, may well be thought to destroy the identity of the claim or cause of action if the analogies of pleading in a lawsuit are to govern our decision. A declaration according to the common court for money had and received may be good though it does not tell us how the money was received or the use established. United States v. Memphis Oil Co., supra. This does not mean that a pleader who abandons the common count and states the particular facts out of which his grievance has arisen retains unfettered freedom to change the statement at his pleasure. All will then depend on the degree and kind of the departure. A cause of action alleging as a grievance that there has been a deviation from a rule of law or the breach of a legal duty in the collection of a tax is far apart from an appeal to an administrative officer to abandon the normal rule or method and substitute another; the substi- \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 85]\n\u00a0\n tution being dependent upon administrative discretion. Overpayments there may have been in each case, yet in senses widely different. But the analogies of pleadings are not decisive of the controversy before us, wherever they may point and however helpful they may be. To make our conclusion sound, we must keep in mind also the necessities and realities of administrative practice. A demand for a special assessment in accordance with section 327(d) of the statute of 1918 is not a challenge to any act of the Commissioner in the valuation of invested capital. On the contrary, the valuation of invested capital is irrelevant if the special method is accepted. The very basis of the application for the use of such a method is the presence of abnormal conditions whereby an unfair and disproportionate burden will be laid upon the taxpayer if invested capital is to be reckoned according to the statutory definition (sections 325, 326) and the profits of the taxpayer subjected to a tax accordingly. Let the new method be adopted, and the value of the invested capital ceases to be a factor in the process. The taxpayer, it is true, may complain even then that there is a variance between such capital when restricted to the elements covered by the statute and invested capital when viewed as an economic concept, and that, by reason of special conditions, there should be an addition of other elements commonly excluded. See, e.g., J. H. Guild Co. v. Commissioner, 11 B.T.A. 914, 921. Indeed, that is the very reason why a special assessment becomes necessary. The fact remains, however, that the grievance does not grow out of a failure of the assessors to value the invested capital truly according to the statute. It has no relation, for example, to an assessment of tangible property, such as land or buildings, at less than the cash value. The grievance that will support an application for a special method of assessment under subdivision (d) of section 327 assumes adherence to the statute, and counts upon extraordinary conditions as justi- \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 86]\n\u00a0\n fying a claim that the statute is oppressive. If the special method is accepted, the income of the taxpayer is considered without reference to capital as commonly determined, and the tax becomes proportionate to that of other representative corporations engaged in a like business.\n A claim or cause of action will be ill-defined for the purpose of an administrative remedy if the definition gives no heed to the understanding or conduct of administrative officers. We are to ask ourselves how a request for a special method of assessment might be expected to be viewed or acted on by those required to consider it. The presentation of such a claim, unlike the presentation of a claim of error in fact or law, does not suggest the need for a new and general audit of assets and liabilities. 2 The two proceedings, alike in form and in consequences, are essentially diverse. By the very terms of the statute, section 327(d), the special assessment is the outcome of a special application; it is made on motion of the taxpayer. A revision for error of fact or law, on the other hand, may be made by the Commissioner on his own motion, and indeed is commonly so made, for it is incidental to his general duty to audit the accounts. Upon an application for special relief, under subdivision (d), there are no compensating adjustments favorable to the government that will move an examiner to reconsider the value of the tangibles, and make it either less or greater. Lewis v. Reynolds, \n284 \nU.S. 281\n, 52 S.Ct. 145. He will conceive of the invested capital as deposited in a separate compartment which there is no need for him to open. Upon a claim of deviation from the statute, the taxable balance for the \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 87]\n\u00a0\n year will be subject to reaudit as if the tax were laid anew. The grievances differ so essentially that the assertion of the one must be felt to be unrelated to any complaint as to the other.\n The conclusion derived from the analogies of pleadings in a lawsuit is thus seen to be confirmed by the probabilities, if not the certainties, of administrative practice. If this is not enough, however, there is confirmation from other sources. In the pages of this record we find convincing evidence that by the understanding of the parties the claim for a special assessment was to exclude any claim for the revision of the value of the capital, and that no such claim would be pressed, at all events while the claim for a new method of assessment was alive and undetermined. We have seen that in May, 1924, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue gave notice to the taxpayer that there could be no consideration of the prayer for relief under sections 327 and 328 of the applicable statute 'until statutory net income and invested capital are definitely determined.' The taxpayer was accordingly informed in conformity, it seems, with the usual practice of the Department, that it would be necessary to do one or other of two things: To appeal from the report as to invested capital and income in accordance with a prescribed form, or to acquiesce in it. Cf. Commissioner v. Ohio Falls Dye & F. Works (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 660; Norton Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 664. The notice would tend to show, though assent to its requirements were lacking, that in the judgment of the men intrusted with the administration of the act, the two subjects of inquiry are diverse and independent. Coupled with the assent of the taxpayer, its significance is heightened. There is no suggestion that the taxpayer, when faced with this alternative, resorted to an appeal. In these circumstances its conduct in proceeding with its application for a special assessment was a tacit assent to the condition imposed by the Commissioner and \n\n[288 U.S. 73, 88]\n\u00a0\n an abandonment of any objection that capital and income had been erroneously valued if valuation was to be ascertained according to the normal method. We have seen that an application for a special assessment involves an appeal by the taxpayer to the Commissioner's discretion. The application being of that order, a condition may reasonably be imposed that the inquiry shall be postponed until other and unrelated objections have been either determined or abandoned. There is room for argument that the taxpayer, having won the privilege of a hearing on those terms, is estopped from retracting its assent and resuming the abandoned ground. Sturm v. Boker, \n150 \nU.S. 312, 333\n, 334 S., 14 S.Ct. 99; Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 689\n, 15 S.Ct. 555. At least its assent is equivalent to an agreement that the claim for a special assessment shall be deemed to be a distinct one from that for a revision of the values. Retraction, if ever possible, must be held to be too late when the statute of limitations has interposed a bar.\n The respondent complains of the ruling of the Court of Appeals whereby the value of intangibles was excluded from the invested capital for the year 1920 and the judgment of the District Court modified accordingly. The argument is that this court has jurisdiction in the exercise of its discretion to review those parts of the judgment adverse to the respondent, though no writ of certiorari was granted except to the petitioner, the government, nor was any other even asked for. We are not required at this time either to affirm or to deny the existence of the power that the argument imputes to us. If the power exists, the respondent has not persuaded us that our discretion should be moved to use it.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed to the extent of the petitioner's objections thereto, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certain forms of intangibles, for example, good will, are excluded in general from the definition of invested capital, but there are special conditions in which there is a duty to include them.

Barton, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, the plaintiff in the court below, brought suit against the United States in the Court of Claims to recover overpayments of income taxes for the years 1922 and 1923. The government opposed recovery upon the ground that the claims filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the refund of the tax were too general and indefinite to comply with the provisions of the statutes and regulations, and that amendment came too late. The Court of Claims gave judgment in favor of the taxpayer. 59 F.( 2d) 276. A writ of certiorari (\n287 \nU.S. 585\n, 53 S.Ct. 87, 77 L.Ed. --) brings the case here.\n The central question in the controversy can be stated in a sentence: May a claim for a tax refund which has been seasonably filed, but which fails to state the grounds upon which the refund is demanded, be amended by specifying the grounds at any time before the claim in its original form has been finally rejected, though it be after the time when a wholly new claim would be barred by limitation?\n The respondent made and filed its income tax returns for 1922 and 1923 in accordance with the statute. It paid the last installment of the earlier tax on December 7, 1923, and the last installment of the later one on December 6, 1924. Claims for refund of overpayments were filed in June, 1927, within the time prescribed by law.\n In the refund claim for 1922 there was a statement of the amount of the tax paid $25,626.25), a statement of the correct amount due ($24,296. 56), a statement that there had been overpaid in error $1,329.69, and a request for refund of that amount with interest as provided by law, or such greater amount as might be legally refundable. Attached to the claim was the following summary \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n of the method of computation: Net income, $194,372.46; 12 1\/2 per cent., $ 24,296.56; previously paid, $25,626.25; overpaid, $1,329.69. There was no other specification of supporting facts or reasons.\n In the refund claim for 1923, the claimant followed the same form that was used for 1922, but with appropriate changes of the figures. The overpayment was stated to be $1,813.39, and there was a request for the return of that amount or of any greater amount due.\n Upon receipt of these claims, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in order to pass upon the merits, made an investigation and an audit of the claimant's books and records for 1922 and 1923 through a duly appointed agent. The agent reported to the Commissioner that there had been overassessments for both years; the excess being fixed at $1,660.70 for 1922 and $4,835.76 for 1923. Thereupon a deputy commissioner notified the taxpayer in writing under date of October 13, 1928, that its refund claims had been considered, that the taxes had been readjusted in accordance with the new audit, and that the overassessments for the two years would be made the subject of certificates of overassessment, which would be transmitted in due course through the office of the appropriate collector. Nothing further was said or done as to the matter till January 26, 1929, when the same deputy commissioner who had signed the notice last mentioned transmitted to the taxpayer another notice that the claims were defective in form in that they failed to satisfy the requirements of the Treasury Regulations. After quoting the pertinent provisions, he stated: 'Since the information on file with the claims does not meet the requirements' of the regulations, 'and the claims do not indicate (i.e., apart from the investigations of the Revenue Agent) that the taxes have been illegally assessed, they will be rejected. The rejection will officially appear in a schedule to be approved by the Commissioner.' Thereupon the claim- \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n ant, protesting that an amendment was unnecessary, filed a new claim with the Commissioner on April 2, 1929, in which the facts were set forth in detail. The Commissioner gave final notice of rejection on October 23, 1929, placing his ruling on the ground that the claims as first presented were defective and irregular. In this suit by the taxpayer, the Court of Claims has given judgment for the moneys overpaid.\n Statutes make it necessary that claims for the refunding or crediting of any internal revenue tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected shall be presented to the Commissioner within a prescribed period of time and prohibit allowance of the claims if these conditions are not satisfied. Revenue Act of 1926,  284(b), 26 USCA  1065(b). Statutes also provide that no suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of such a tax 'until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof.' Revenue Act of 1921,  1318, as amended by Act of March 4, 1923, c. 276 (26 USCA  156). During the period of these transactions, there had been promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1921 and was continuously in force a Treasury regulation which provides as follows: 'Claims by the taxpayer for the refunding of taxes and penalties erroneously or illegally collected shall be made on Form 843. In this case the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. All the facts relied upon in support of the claim should be clearly set forth under oath.' Treasury Regulations 62, art. 1036.1\n The claim for refund filed with the Commissioner in June, 1927, was not subject to rejection on the score of \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n the time of its submission. As to this the parties are agreed. Indefinite and general it was, and hence, until amended or supplemented, an inadequate compliance with the Treasury requirement that the facts relied upon in support of a claim are to be stated under oath. Beyond doubt it might have been rejected as irregular while its form was uncorrected. This is far from saying that there was the presentation of a new claim and not the perfecting of an old one when the gaps were filled thereafter. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Both the government and the taxpayer invoke analogies suggested by pleadings in a lawsuit. The general rule is said to be that an amendment of a pleading will take effect by relation and thus relieve against the bar of an intervening limitation if the identity of the cause of action is still substantially the same, but that the limitation will prevail if under the guise of an amendment there is the substitution of a new cause of action in place of another wholly different. Baltimore & O.S.W.R. Co. v. Carroll, \n280 \nU.S. 491\n, 50 S.Ct. 182; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Renn, \n241 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 36 S.Ct. 567; Harriss v. Tams, 258 N.Y. 229, 242, 179 N.E. 476. The analogy is helpful; yet it will confuse, instead of helping, if we do not insist at the beginning upon a definition of our terms or at least a recognition of their shifting meanings. A 'cause of action' \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 68]\n\u00a0\n may mean one thing for one purpose and something different for another. \n3\n It may mean one thing when the question is whether it is good upon demurrer, and something different when there is a question of the amendment of a pleading or of the application of the principle of res judicata. Cf. Chicago R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Schendel, \n270 \nU.S. 611, 617\n, 46 S.Ct. 420, 53 A.L.R. 1265; Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316, 321\n, 47 S.Ct. 600. At times and in certain contexts, it is identified with the infringement of a right or the violation of a duty. 4 At other times and in other contexts, it is a concept of the law of remedies, the identity of the cause being then dependent on that of the form of action or the writ. \n5\n Another aspect reveals it as something separate from writs and remedies, the group of operative facts out of which a grievance has developed. \n6\n This court has not committed itself to the view that the phrase is susceptible of any single definition that will be independent of the context or of the relation to be governed. None the less, it has fixed the limits of amendment with increasing liberality. A change of the legal theory of the action, 'a departure from law to law,' has at times been offered as a test. Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Wyler, \n158 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 15 S.Ct. 877, 881. Later decisions have made it clear that this test is no longer accepted as one of general validity. Thus, in Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 \nU.S. 570\n, 33 S.Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134, plaintiff suing in her individual capacity under a Kansas statute for her son's death was allowed to amend to sue as administratrix under the \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 69]\n\u00a0\n Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) after the statute of limitations would have barred another action. In New York Central Railroad Co. v. Kinney, \n260 \nU.S. 340\n, 43 S.Ct. 122, there was in substance the same ruling. In Friederichsen v. Renard, \n247 \nU.S. 207\n, 38 S. Ct. 450, a cause of action by a defrauded buyer to set aside a contract was turned into a cause of action to recover damages for deceit. 'Of couse an argument can be made on the other side, but when a defendant has had notice from the beginning that the plaintiff sets up and is trying to enforce a claim against it because of specified conduct, the reasons for the statute of limitations do not exist, and we are of opinion that a liberal rule should be applied.' New York Central Railroad Co. v. Kinney, supra, page 346 of 260 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 122, 123.7\n With this background of analogy, we reach the specific problem that calls for answer here. The respondent filed a claim for taxes overpaid, a claim for money had and received to his use by the agents of the government. The identity of the cause of action may be said in one aspect to depend upon the mere fact of overpayment, the existence of a net balance owing to the taxpayer after the ascertainment of all items of debit and of credit. In another aspect it may be said to depend upon the identity of the items illegally exacted, and hence upon the particular grounds that determine illegality. Choice between these meanings must avoid a doctrinaire adherence to abstract definitions. It must keep in view the realities of administrative practice, for its effect will be to regulate the conduct of administrative officers. Definitions and analogies borrowed from pleadings in a lawsuit will have their place and recognition, but in due subordination to differences of end and aim. Viewing the problem thus, we must say whether a statement by the taxpayer of supporting facts \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 70]\n\u00a0\n and reasons is to be assimilated to a bill of particulars explanatory of a claim, or is something so essential that there can be no claim without it.\n Our decision in Lewis v. Reynolds, \n284 \nU.S. 281\n, 52 S.Ct. 145, 146, goes far to point the answer. The court there ruled that, upon a claim for the refund of a tax because of the disallowance of a particular deduction, the Commissioner might sustain the result by the disallowance of another deduction, and this though the time had gone by within which he would have been at liberty, if a claim had not been filed, to make a new assessment. The court applied the analogy of a common-law action for money had and received. 'The ultimate question presented for decision, upon a claim for refund, is whether the taxpayer has overpaid his tax. This involves a redetermination of the entire tax liability.' No matter though the claim for refund be specific and limited, the Commissioner is at liberty to audit the return afresh and to strike a new balance as the facts may then appear. Commonly, though, it seems, not always, a general audit will be necessary or will be at least a wise precaution, whether the claim is broad or narrow, if the government is to have the benefit of any compensating adjustments. \n8\n There is little doubt that this conception of duty and of prudence has had recognition and emphasis in administrative practice.\n The practice is portrayed in action in the pages of this record. We are there informed in a striking way of the actual procedure where a notice, general in its terms, is not rejected at the beginning for irregularity of form, but is considered on the merits. At once upon the filing of the claim for refund, there was an order for the complete examination of the business of the taxpayer, to the end \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 71]\n\u00a0\n that the net amount of its tax liability might be reported to the Bureau. Every claim put forward in its amended notice has been investigated, every fact alleged in its behalf has been verified and found. The files of the Bureau contain the report of an examiner informing his superior that the tax has been overpaid, and the files of the taxpayer contain an official notice that the overassessment is recognized and that justice will be done. Of a sudden, at the end, the discovery is made that the inquiry is mere futility because the notice starting it in motion has departed in form from the requirements of a rule.\n In the light thus supplied by the practice of the Bureau and the analogy of pleadings, the way is cleared for a conclusion. The line of division must be kept a sharp one between the function of a statute requiring the presentation of a claim within a given period of time, and the function of a regulation making provision as to form. The function of the statute, like that of limitations generally, is to give protection against stale demands. The function of the regulation is to facilitate research. The Commissioner has the remedy in his own hands if the claim as presented is so indefinite as to cause embarrassment to him or to others in his Bureau. He may disallow the claim promptly for a departure from the rule. If, however, he holds it without action until the form has been corrected, and still more clearly if he hears it, and hears it on the merits, what is before him is not a double claim, but a claim single and indivisible, the new indissolubly welded into the structure of the old.\n The cases in this court are not at all at variance with the conclusion now arrived at, though they leave the problem open. Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228\n, 48 S.Ct. 45, holds that it is within the power of the Commissioner to waive the objection that the supporting facts or reasons have not been stated in the claim. United States v. Felt & Tarrant \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 72]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n283 \nU.S. 269\n, 51 S.Ct. 376, holds that a defective claim for refund will not supply a basis for a suit against the government when there has been neither waiver by the Commissioner nor amendment by the taxpayer. Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258\n, 51 S.Ct. 395, holds that a letter from the taxpayer, accompanied by a form of waiver requested by the Bureau, will be the equivalent of a notice of claim if the Commissioner has so treated it.\n The cases in the lower federal courts may not be wholly harmonious as to the extent to which amendments are allowable after the running of the statute, but there is general agreement that the applicable analogy is to be found in the rules governing the amendment of a pleading. McKesson & Robbins, Inc. v. Edwards (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 147; Art Metal Construction Co. v. United States (C.C.A.) 47 F.(2d) 558; Lancaster Cotton Mills v. United States (Ct. Cl.) 59 F.(2d) 270; Lehigh & Wilkes Barre Coal Co. v. United States (D.C.) 38 F.(2d) 637. Cf. The Peruna Co., 11 B.T.A. 1180, 1189; Marian Shainwald Sevier, 14 B.T.A. 709, 716.\n One other question, less general in its significance, is yet to be considered. An argument is made that at the time of this amendment the claim had been finally rejected and the proceeding thereby ended. If so, it was too late. McKesson & Robbins v. Edwards, supra; Solomon v. United States (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 150. When correction is thus postponed, there is no longer anything to amend, any more than in a lawsuit after the complaint has been dismissed. We think the matter was still in fieri. True the deputy commissioner had given notice to the taxpayer that the claims would be rejected, and that the rejection would be officially announced in a schedule to be approved thereafter. No reason is apparent why at any time before such approval the Commissioner or his deputy was not at liberty to recall the first announcement, and dispose of the case otherwise. Michel v. United States (C.C.A.) \n\n[288 U.S. 62, 73]\n\u00a0\n 37 F.(2d) 38, reversed, but on other grounds, \n282 \nU.S. 656\n, 51 S.Ct. 284. We are not now considering what the practice ought to be if there were need to open the proceeding for the submission of other evidence extrinsic to the claims themselves. Neither in the record nor in the argument do we find a suggestion of that need. Long before the amendment the Commissioner had ascertained the facts and had even notified the taxpayer of the justice of its claims and of the ruling of the Bureau that adjustments would be made accordingly. The dismissal of the claims, when finally announced, was for defects of form only. The defects had been corrected, and the dismissal may not stand.\n We find it unnecessary to determine whether the conduct of the Commissioner in investigating the claims upon their merits and reporting to the claimant the result of his inquiry was a waiver of defects of form which would call for the return of overpayments though no amendment had been offered.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A later regulation, different in form, is applicable to claims filed on or after May 1, 1929. Treasury Decision 4265, Cumulative Bulletin VIII-1, p. 110. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Official statistics indicate that 'eight-five 20\/100 per cent of all the overassessments are attributable to clerical or bookkeeping adjustments or to causes beyond the control of either the Treasury or the taxpayer, that is to adjustments after the payment of taxes based upon causes which could not fairly be considered prior to the payment.'

These statistics, covering adjustments of taxes under the act of 1928, give support to the conclusion that in determining the application of a statute of limitations the word 'claim' should be interpreted with reasonable liberality. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The uncertainties of the phrase have been well developed by Dean Clark with full citation of the decisions in his treatise on Code Pleading, pp. 75-87, 501-508. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Clark, Code Pleading, p. 81, and cases there cited; Pomeroy, Code Remedies (4th Ed.)  347. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Clark, supra, p. 502, and cases there cited. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Clark, supra, pp. 83, 84, 505, and cases there cited. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Other cases are collected by Clark, supra, pp. 504, 505. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Compare Report of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, 1928, pursuant to section 1203 of the Revenue Act of 1926, vol.

MURDOCK(1933)\nNo. 88\nArgued: November 6, 1933Decided: December 11, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 389, 390]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Harold J. Bandy, of Granite City, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here for the second time.\n The respondent was indicted for refusal to give testimony and supply information as to deductions claimed in his 1927 and 1928 income tax returns for moneys paid to others. By a special plea he averred that he ought not to be prosecuted under the indictment because, if he had answered the questions put to him, he would have given information tending to incriminate him, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The United States demurred on the grounds that the plea failed to show that the information demanded would have incriminated or subjected the defendant to prosecution under federal law, and that the defendant waived his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. The demurrer was overruled. Upon appeal this court reversed the judgment for the reason that at the hearing before the federal revenue agent the defendant had not invoked the protection of the Fifth Amendment against possible prosecution under federal legislation but solely under state laws. The cause was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n, 52 S.Ct. 63, 82 A.L.R. 1376\n\n\n The petitioner pleaded not guilty, was put upon trial, and convicted. He appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment,1 and the case was brought here by writ of certiorari. \n2\n The question presented is whether the trial court correctly instructed the jury as to what constitutes a violation of the sections of the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928 upon which the indictment was based.\n Section 256 of the Revenue Act of 1926 and section 148 of the Revenue Act of 1928, in identical words, require all \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n persons making payment to another to make a true and accurate return to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under such regulations as he shall prescribe, setting forth the amount paid and the name and address of the recipient. \n3\n Section 1104 of the Revenue Act of 1926 and section 618 of the Revenue Act of 1928 authorize the Commissioner, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or of making a return where none has been made, through officers or employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, to examine books, papers, records, and memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return, and to compel the attendance of the taxpayer or any one having knowledge of the premises, and to take testimony with reference to the matter directed by law to be included in the return, with power to administer oaths to the persons to be interrogated. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Section 1114(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 declares:5\n'Any person required under this title to pay any tax, or required by law or regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, for the purposes of the computation, assessment, or collection of any tax imposed by this title, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.'\n\n Section 146(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 is identical with the quoted section of the 1926 act. \n6\n The indictment \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n in two counts charged violation of the provisions of the two sections last mentioned.\n Upon the trial the government proved the respondent had been duly summoned to appear before a revenue agent for examination; questions had been put to him; he refused to answer, stating he feared self- incrimination; and upon further inquiry disclosed that his fear was based upon possible prosecutions under state statutes. The government also offered evidence that on a prior occasion at a meeting with certain revenue agents the respondent had refused to disclose the name of the payee of the sums deducted by him in his returns for 1927 and 1928. To this counsel for the respondent objected, on the ground that it was irrelevant to the issue, which was the respondent's refusal to answer when summoned, sworn, and interrogated. The prosecuting attorney replied that the willfulness of the respondent's refusal to answer was in issue, and that the proposed evidence bore upon that matter. The court overruled the objection and admitted the testimony. The respondent offered no evidence. In the course of his charge the trial judge said:\n'So far as the facts are concerned in this case, Gentlemen of the Jury, I want to instruct you that whatever the Court may say as to the facts, is only the Court's view. You are at liberty to entirely disregard it. The Court feels from the evidence in this case, that the Government has sustained the burden cast upon it by the law and has proved that this defendant is guilty in manner and form as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.'\n\n The respondent's request for an instruction in the following words was refused:\n'If you believe that the reasons stated by the defendant in his refusal to answer questions were given in good faith and based upon his actual belief, you should consider that in determining whether or not his refusal to answer the questions was wilful.' \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n In the circumstances we think the trial judge erred in stating the opinion that the respondent was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A federal judge may analyze the evidence, comment upon it, and express his views with regard to the testimony of witnesses. He may advise the jury in respect of the facts, but the decision of issues of fact must be fairly left to the jury. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263; Quercia v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 466\n, 53 S. Ct. 698. Although the power of the judge to express an opinion as to the guilt of the defendant exists, it should be exercised cautiously and only in exceptional cases. Such an expression of opinion was held not to warrant a reversal where, upon the undisputed and admitted facts, the defendant's voluntary conduct amounted to the commission of the crime defined by the statute. Horning v. District of Columbia, \n254 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 53. The present, however, is not such a case, unless the word 'willfully,' used in the sections upon which the indictment was founded, means no more than voluntarily.\n\n The word often denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. But, when used in a criminal statute, it generally means an act done with a bad purpose (Felton v. United States, \n96 U.S. 699\n; Potter v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 438\n, 15 S.Ct. 144; Spurr v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 728\n, 19 S.Ct. 812); without justifiable excuse (Felton v. United States, supra; Williams v. People, 26 Colo. 272, 57 P. 701; People v. Jewell, 138 Mich. 620, 101 N.W. 835; St. Louis Iron Mountain & S. Ry. Co. v. Batesville & W. Tel. Co., 80 Ark. 499, 97 S.W. 660; Clay v. State, 52 Tex. Cr. R. 555, 107 S.W. 1129); stubbornly, obstinately, perversely ( Wales v. Miner, 89 Ind. 118, 127; Lynch v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 109 S.E. 427; Claus v. Chicago Gt. W. Ry. Co., 136 Iowa, 7, 111 N.W. 15; State v. Harwell, 129 N.C. 550, 40 S.E. 48). The word is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for believing it is lawful (Roby v. Newton, 121 Ga. 679, 49 \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n S.E. 694, 68 L.R.A. 601), or conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act (United States v. Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co. (D.C.) 223 F. 207, 210; State v. Savre, 129 Iowa, 122, 105 N.W. 387, 3 L.R.A.(N.S.) 455, 113 Am.St.Rep. 452; State v. Morgan, 136 N.C. 628, 48 S. E. 670).\n This court has held that, where directions as to the method of conducting a business are embodied in a revenue act to prevent loss of taxes, and the act declares a willful failure to observe the directions a penal offense, an evil motive is a constituent element of the crime. In Felton v. United States, supra, the court considered a statute which required distillers to maintain certain apparatus to prevent the abstraction of spirits during the process of distillation, and declared that, if any distiller should 'knowingly and wilfully' omit, neglect, or refuse to do anything required by law in conducting his business, he should be liable to a penalty. It appeared that in defendant's plant defective appliances caused an overflow and wastage of low wines, and to save these it became necessary, in disregard of the method prescribed by the act, to catch the spirits and pour them into vats. This was done despite instructions to the contrary by the government officers who were consulted as to what procedure should be followed. It was admitted that the action was innocent in purpose, saved loss of the product to the owner and taxes to the United States. In an action for the statutory penalty, the conduct of the distiller was held not to be willful within the meaning of the law.\n Aid in arriving at the meaning of the word 'willfully' may be afforded by the context in which it is used (United States v. Sioux City Stock Yards Co. (C.C.) 162 F. 556, 562), and we think in the present instance the other omissions which the statute denounces in the same sentence only if willful, aid in ascertaining the meaning as respects the offense here charged. The revenue acts command the citizen, where required by law or regulations, to pay the \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n tax, to make a return, to keep records, and to supply information for computation, assessment, or collection of the tax. He whose conduct is defined as criminal is one who 'willfully' fails to pay the tax, to make a return, to keep the required records, or to supply the needed information. Congress did not intend that a person, by reason of a bona fide misunderstanding as to his liability for the tax, as to his duty to make a return, or as to the adequacy of the records he maintained, should become a criminal by his mere failure to measure up to the prescribed standard of conduct. And the requirement that the omission in these instances must be willful, to be criminal, is persuasive that the same element is essential to the offense of failing to supply information.\n It follows that the respondent was entitled to the charge he requested with respect to his good faith and actual belief. Not until this court pronounced judgment in United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n, 52 S. Ct. 63, 82 A.L.R. 1376, had it been definitely settled that one under examination in a federal tribunal could not refuse to answer on account of probable incrimination under state law. The question was involved but not decided in Ballmann v. Fagin, \n200 \nU.S. 186, 195\n, 26 S.Ct. 212, and specifically reserved in Vajtauer v. Commr. of Immigration, \n273 \nU.S. 103, 113\n, 47 S.Ct. 302. The trial court could not therefore properly tell the jury the defendant's assertion of the privilege was so unreasonable and ill founded as to exhibit bad faith and establish willful wrongdoing. This was the effect of the instructions given. We think the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly upheld the respondent's right to have the question of absence of evil motive submitted to the jury, and we are of opinion that the requested instruction was apt for the purpose.\n The government relies on Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, 49 S.Ct. 268. That case, however, construed an altogether \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n different statutory provision. Sinclair was indicted for refusal to answer a question pertinent to a matter under investigation by a committee of the Senate. The act upon which the indictment was based declared: 'Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress, to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. ...'7 Two distinct offenses are described in the disjunctive, and in only one of them is willfulness an element. Sinclair, having been summoned, attended the hearing. He was therefore guilty of no willful default in obeying a summons. He refused to answer certain questions, not because his answers might incriminate him, for he asserted they would not, but on the ground the questions were not pertinent or relevant to the matters then under inquiry. The applicable statute did not make a bad purpose or evil intent an element of the misdemeanor of refusing to answer, but conditioned guilt or innocence solely upon the relevancy of the question propounded. Sinclair was either right or wrong in his refusal to answer, and, if wrong, he took the risk of becoming liable to the prescribed penalty. Here we are concerned with a statute which denounces a willful failure to do various things thought to be requisite to a proper administration of the income tax law, and the government in the trial below, we think correctly, assumed that it carried the burden of showing more than a mere voluntary failure to supply information, with intent, in good faith to exercise a privilege granted the witness by the Constitution. The respondent's refusal to answer was intentional and without legal justification, but \n\n[290 U.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n the jury might nevertheless find that it was not prompted by bad faith or evil intent, which the statute makes an element of the offense.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 62 F.(2d) 926. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n290 \nU.S. 606\n, 54 S.Ct. 51, 78 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] U.S.C. tit. 26,  1023, 2148 (26 USCA  1023, 2148). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] U.S.C., tit. 26,  1247 (26 USCA  1247); 26 USCA  1247 and note. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 44 Stat. 116; U.S.C., tit. 26,  1265 (26 USCA  1265). \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Except that it substitutes the word 'title' for the word 'act,' 45 Stat. 835; U.S.C. tit. 26,  2146(a), 26 USCA  2146(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] U.S.C., tit. 2,  192 (2 USCA  192). \n\n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. Wylie M. Barrow, of Baton Rouge, La., and Gaston L. Porterie, of Marksville, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220 (28 USCA  47, 47a), Judicial Code,  238 ( 28 USCA  345), from a final decree of a District Court, of three judges, for Eastern Louisiana, which made permanent an interlocutory decree staying an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The order directed the removal of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce resulting from intrastate rates maintained by rail carriers \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n in Louisiana, by prescribing an increase in intrastate rates on specified commodities, in amounts equal to increases in interstate rates on the same commodities, established by appellant carriers under the authority of an earlier order of the Commission in the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931, 178 I. C.C. 539; 179 I.C.C. 215.\n In the Fifteen Per Cent Case the Commission, acting under section 15a( 2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  15a(2), after an extensive hearing, granted permission to the carriers of the country to add a surcharge to established rates in amounts varying with different commodities but not exceeding in any case 10 per cent. of the basic rate. Thereupon the railroads of the country, including those operating in Louisiana, added the permitted surcharges to their interstate rates and most states authorized like increases in their intrastate rates. Others failed to increase the intrastate rates, and the state of Louisiana by its Public Service Commission refused to allow the increase on some thirty- seven commodities and on all less than carload lots. The carriers filed petitions invoking the exercise of the power of the Commission under section 13(3) and (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by Transportation Act 1920,  416, 41 Stat. 484 (49 USCA  13(3, 4) to remove undue discrimination by those intrastate rates against interstate commerce. This proceeding, after an extended investigation and hearings by the Commission, resulted in the order challenged here. Increase in Intrastate Rates, 186 I.C.C. 615. It requires the carriers to charge, upon specified commodities and all less than carload lots in intrastate commerce in Louisiana, 'rates which shall be not lower than the rates now in force and applicable to the interstate transportation of said traffic within the State of Louisiana, plus the surcharge authorized by the findings in the Fifteen Per Cent Case ... on corresponding interstate traffic, so long as such surcharges are maintained. ...'\n In setting aside the order, the court below rested its decision upon the inadequacy of the Commission's find- \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n ings. It thought that as the Commission, in the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931, did not find that the several interstate rates resulting from the authorized surcharges would each be just and reasonable, there was no basis for raising the intrastate rates under section 13(3) and (4) (49 USCA  13(3, 4), see Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; cf. Georgia Pub. Serv. Commission v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765\n, 51 S.Ct. 619;, and that the order could not be supported as a revenue measure because there were no findings that the increased rates would produce an increase in carrier income. It is also argued here that the order assailed is invalid because the Commission, in its earlier order, did not require the carriers to increase their rates interstate, but only permitted them to do so at their option.\n\n 1. \nThe Transportation Act of 1920, by  422, 41 Stat. 488, added  15a(2) to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15a(2),1 for the first time laid on the Commission the affirmative duty to establish rates for interstate rail carriers '... so that carriers as a whole (or as a whole in each of such rate groups of territories as the commission may from time to time designate) will, under honest, efficient and economical management and reasonable expenditures for maintenance of way, structures and equipment, earn an aggregate annual net railway operating income equal, \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n as nearly as may be, to a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation. ...' See Wisconsin Railway Comm. v. C., B. & Q.R.R., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 43 S.Ct. 270. Associated provisions calculated to preserve carrier income in the interests of an efficient transportation service were those empowering the Commission to permit pooling of traffic and earnings, section 407 of the Transportation Act amending section 5 Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  5 ), and to fix minimum, as well as maximum rates, section 418 of Transportation Act amending section 15(1) Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15(1), to preclude the absorption of traffic of weaker competitors by cutthroat competition. See New England Divisions Case, supra, page 190 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 270.\n Under earlier acts the Commission had been given power to remove unjust discrimination in rates or service between shippers or localities, section 2 Act of February 4, 1887, 24 Stat. 379, 880; section 3 Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 380), and rates in interstate commerce were required to be reasonable 'in the sense of furnishing an adequate compensation for the particular service rendered and the abolition of rebates.' Wisconsin Railway Comm. v. C., B. & Q.R.R., supra, page 585 of 257 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 232, 236, 22 A.L.R. 1086; section 1 Act of 1887; section 4 Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 589; section 15 Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 384). Under these acts the Commission had the power to order the carriers to desist from discrimination against interstate shippers by intrastate rates, Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833, but until the Transportation Act it was without authority to prescribe intrastate rates.\n By section 416 of the Transportation Act, adding section 13(4) to Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  13(4), directly involved here, the Commission was given power to remove unjust discrimination by intrastate rates against interstate commerce, by prescribing minimum intrastate rates. 2 This court has consist- \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n ently held that this section is to be construed in the light of section 15a(2) and as supplementing it, so that the forbidden discrimination against interstate commerce by intrastate rates includes those cases in which disparity of the latter rates operates to thwart the broad purpose of section 15a to maintain an efficient transportation system by enabling the carriers to earn a fair return. So construed, section 13(4) confers on the Commission the power to raise intrastate rates so that the intrastate traffic may produce its fair share of the earnings required to meet maintenance and operating costs and to yield a fair return on the value of property devoted to the transportation service, both interstate and intrastate. Wisconsin Railway Commission v. C., B. & Q.R.R., supra, pages 586, 587, 588, 589, 590 of 257 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 42 S.Ct. 239; Florida v. United States, supra, page 211 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 119; Louisiana v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 125, 131\n, 52 S.Ct. 74; see Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318\n, 43 S.Ct. 583.\n As pointed out in the reports of the Commission in this case and others (see Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I.C.C. 220; New York Passenger Fares, 59 I.C.C. 290), section 15a, by its terms, commands the Commission, in providing the required revenue by increasing rates, to deal with the carriers of the nation as a whole or in broad classes, and as this court recognized in the New England Divisions Case, supra, pages 197, 198 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 270, this requirement would be nullified and the administrative arm of the Commission paralyzed, if \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 76]\n\u00a0\n instead of adjudicating upon the rates in a large territory on evidence deemed typical of the whole rate structure, it were obliged to consider the reasonableness of each individual rate before carrying into effect the necessary increased schedule.\n It cannot be supposed that Congress, in placing this duty on the Commission, intended, in the absence of some express provision compelling it, that the Commission should follow a procedure which would preclude its acting effectively, if at all. That such was not its intention appears from the words of the statute. It does not, in terms, command the Commission to find that each rate prescribed under section 15a is just and reasonable, as prerequisite to a general increase in rates. It provides only that the action of the Commission in raising rates so that they may yield a fair return is to be 'in the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates,' with the qualification, in the proviso to the granted authority to increase rates, 'that the commission shall have reasonable latitude to modify or adjust any particular rate which it may find to be unjust or unreasonable. ...' When read in the light of the subject-matter to which the section is to be applied, the production of increased revenue by a nation-wide or group increase of rates, it is apparent that these provisions cannot rightly be construed to require the Commission as a condition of any action by it to find the reasonableness of each individual rate. If the Commission were required to do that, there would be no occasion for the granted latitude to modify those rates found to be unjust or unreasonable.\n The natural construction of the section, one consistent with its language, and making possible its practical operation, is that which has uniformly been given to it by the Commission. Section 15a(2) does not relieve the Commission from the responsibility of seeing to it that the rates as increased are to be reasonable. But in perform- \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n ing the duty broadly to increase carrier revenue, it is enough if the Commission, in the first instance, makes such inquiry and investigation as would enable it to say that the prescribed increases when applied to members of the group will generally not exceed a reasonable maximum. The extent of this inquiry and the detail of investigation cannot be marked by this court with certainty. The size of the group dealt with, the nature of the traffic, the urgency of the relief demanded, these and other factors should condition the Commission's procedure in each case. But with proper procedure, the ultimate finding that the rates as generally applied are reasonable, supported by evidence and accompanied by suitable reservation of the rights of all interested parties to secure modification of any particular rate which, when challenged, is found to be unjust or unreasonable, complies with the statute. The requirement that increase of rates by Commission action is to be in the exercise of its power to prescribe reasonable rates is thus observed but in conformity to the administrative necessities which the proviso contemplates.\n In the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931, the Commission, after a careful survey, found itself faced with an acute emergency calling for prompt action to give temporary financial relief to the transportation system. The Commission's report amply discloses that the reasonableness of the rates as generally applied was a controlling consideration in fixing the varying amounts of the surcharges and in selecting the particular items to bear them. This is manifested in its conclusion that 'the freight articles selected by us in this connection were those for the transportation of which we believed the rates could be somewhat increased without causing the traffic to be transferred to other agencies of transportation and without bringing about an undue disturbance in business conditions or transgressing the bounds of maximum reasonable \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 78]\n\u00a0\n rates.' It was necessary, under the circumstances, that the increases take effect without suspension, but this was done subject to the proviso that 'the resulting rates will in all respects be subject to investigation and determination as to the lawfulness of particular rates or schedules of rates, as provided by the act.' The Commission's action complied with section 15a, see New England Divisions Case, supra, page 197 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 270.\n In proceeding under section 13(3) and (4) to make the order, challenged here, the Commission made no express finding that the increased intrastate rates would be reasonable, but incorporated the findings bearing on the reasonableness of the increased interstate rates made in the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931. Although section 13(4) does not in terms require the Commission to find that the intrastate rates which it prescribes are reasonable, it is not questioned that the section confers no authority on the Commission to require intrastate rates to be raised above a reasonable level, see Georgia Pub. Serv. Commission v. United States, supra, page 770 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 619; Florida v. United States, supra, and the appellees insist that the order is defective because, in conforming the intrastate rates to the reasonable level of interstate rates, the Commission did not find specifically that in each case the rate as increased would be just and reasonable. But we think that the relationship of the section to section 15a(2), already described, is such that the standard of reasonableness prescribed by the latter is that necessarily set up for section 13(4) which supplements it. The considerations already detailed which define that standard for section 15a necessarily define it for section 13(3) and (4), which creates a duty in 'dovetail' relationship to that imposed on the Commission by section 15a. Wisconsin R.R. Commission v. C.B. & Q.R.R., supra, page 586 of 257 U. S., 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086. The administrative difficulties which would preclude performance of the duty imposed by section 15a if the Commission were required to find that each individual rate prescribed is just and reasonable, \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 79]\n\u00a0\n would similarly prevent compliance with that under section 13(4). Since neither can be performed effectively without performance of the other, the standard of reasonableness to which the Commission must conform is necessarily the same under both, and that implies that under section 13(4), as under section 15a(2), reasonable latitude must be given for modification of particular rates found to be unreasonable.\n The case of the Louisiana rates was not alone before the Commission, and it should not be treated as though it were. A number of other states, contesting, in the aggregate, a wide range of rates, were heard at the same time. Had the Commission been required to go into the circumstances of each item with particularity the purpose of its original order would have been defeated. It sufficed that the Commission found that Louisiana showed nothing in the circumstances of its agriculture and industry or its traffic conditions so different from the rest of the country as to lead to the conclusion that the intrastate rates, raised to the reasonable general interstate level, would not themselves be reasonable; and that it saved the rights of interested parties to test the reasonableness of any individual rate.\n A question different from that before us was presented in Florida v. United States, supra. There the discrimination was essentially one of undue prejudice against shippers, confined by the evidence to rates prevailing in northern Florida. It involved only one railroad and one commodity. It was not the general revenue proceeding authorized by section 15a. The court was careful to point out that the Commission had undertaken to establish a state-wide level of intrastate rates without any findings with respect to the corresponding interstate traffic which would tend to support the conclusion that a state-wide alteration of intrastate rates was necessary to protect the interstate commerce involved. \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 80]\n\u00a0\n 2. The objection that the finding of unjust discrimination by the intrastate rates against interstate commerce is unsupported by any finding that the increased rates would produce increased revenue is rested upon the statement, separated from its context in the Commission's report, 'we conclude that no positive finding in regard to the revenue outcome of the increases can be justified.' It is manifest that any finding of undue prejudice to interstate commerce, based upon the failure of prevailing intrastate rates to contribute their fair share to the support of a national transportation system, must necessarily rest upon a prediction that an increase of the intrastate rates will result in an increase of revenue, a prediction involving, esspecially since 1930, many elements of uncertainty. There are no formal requirements for the findings to be made by the Commission in this type of case, see Manufacturers' R.R. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 467, 490\n, 38 S.Ct. 383, and while the particular form in which they were cast here is not to be commended, the report, read as a whole, sufficiently expresses the conclusion of the Commission, based upon supporting data, including estimates of experienced railroad traffic men, to which the report refers, that the probability of increased revenue was sufficiently great to make the increase of rates a reasonable exercise of sound managerial judgment. This, we think, meets the requirements of the statute.\n In the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931, the Commission had said: 'The plan outlined in the appendix we estimate will produce between one hundred million and one hundred twenty-five million dollars increased revenue on the basis of present traffic if applied to both State and interstate.' And in the proceeding resulting in the present order it said: 'We find that in view of the surcharges which have become effective interstate, in the freight rates on the classes and commodities here in question, under our findings in Fifteen Per Cent Case, \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 81]\n\u00a0\n 1931, supra, respondents' intrastate rates in Louisiana on the same classes and commodities, to which no corresponding surcharges have been added, have resulted and will result in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce, except in the case of intrastate rates on sugar cane.' This finding could only mean, when applied to the question in hand, that the intrastate traffic was not bearing its fair share of the burden of maintaining a national transportation system, by contributing such increased revenue as would result from an increase in rates. This the Commission proceeded to point out in detail when it said further: 'It is estimated that, based on the traffic of 1931, the application of the surcharges on the excepted commodities would produce additional annual revenue' in substantial amounts named with respect to each of the carriers participating in the traffic, and continued, saying: 'Railroad traffic men expressed the opinion that, notwithstanding possible diversion of traffic to other transportation agencies, the addition of the surcharge to the intrastate rates would produce an increase in revenue.' And as bearing upon the estimated revenue increase the Commission said: 'There is nothing of record which warrants the conclusion that the situation as to fertilizer, cotton seed, cotton seed products, fresh vegetables, or sweet potatoes is different in Louisiana from what it is in other parts of the country, or in surrounding states where surcharges are now being assessed. Similar allegations with respect to the possible effect of truck competition and as to the ability of various commodities to stand any increase, were made in Ex parte 103 (The Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931) and were considered in reaching our conclusions. Nor is there anything to show that the movement of sweet potatoes will be adversely affected by the application of a surcharge thereon without a similar charge on other potatoes.'\n Like findings were held sufficient to support similar orders, which had been entered in this same proceeding, \n\n[290 U.S. 70, 82]\n\u00a0\n when attacked before district courts of three judges in Montana and Kentucky. State of Montana v. United States, 2 F.Supp. 448; Commonwealth of Kentucky v. United States, 3 F.Supp. 778. Nor do they differ in any material way from those in Wisconsin Passenger Fares, 59 I.C.C. 391, 393, which were deemed adequately to support the finding of undue prejudice in Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. C., B. & Q.R.R., supra, page 580 of 257 U. S., 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086. See, also, Georgia Pub. Service Commission v. United States, supra; Alabama v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 776\n, 51 S.Ct. 623; Louisiana Public Service Commission v. Texas & New Orleans R.R., \n284 \nU.S. 125\n, 54 S.Ct. 74.\n\n 3. \nThe fact that the order of the Commission for the increase of interstate rates was permissive only does not affect the validity of its order prescribing minimum intrastate rates. The interstate rates after the addition of the authorized surcharges were lawful rates in interstate commerce, which was discriminated against by the failure to make corresponding increases in intrastate rates. This discrimination the Commission removed in the manner authorized by section 13(4), by prescribing minimum intrastate rates at the same level as the interstate rates. The order precluded any unauthorized interference with state regulatory power by providing that it should be effective only so long as the surcharges upon interstate rates should be maintained by the carriers.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 15a. ...

Moulton, of Portland, Or., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is the owner of the steamship City of Vancouver. December 1, 1929, she was at Westport, Or., in navigable waters of the Columbia taking on a cargo of lumber. Respondent's intestate was employed by contracting stevedores who were loading her. While upon the deck of the ship helping in that work he was struck by a falling sling load of lumber and mortally injured. He was taken ashore where he died an hour later. Respondent was appointed his administratrix and, electing under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,  33 (33 U.S.C.  933 ( 33 USCA  933)) to assert her claim against a third party, filed a libel in admiralty in the district court of Oregon against the ship, claiming on behalf of his estate damages in the sum of $10,000. The libel alleged in substance that interstate's death was caused by reason of petitioner's negligence in respect of the ship's winch which was being used to hoist the lumber. \n\n[288 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner excepted to the libel, asserting that the cause of action arose on land and not upon the water and that therefore the case is not within the admiralty jurisdiction. The district court so held and dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 60 F.(2d) 793.\n The Oregon statute creating a cause of action for death by wrongful act provides: 'When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the personal representatives of the former may maintain an action at law therefor against the latter, if the former might have maintained an action, had he lived, against the latter, for an injury done by the same act or omission.' Oregon Code 1930,  5-703. And the Oregon Boat Lien Law declares that every boat or vessel shall be subject to a lien 'for damages or injuries (done) by such boat or vessel resulting in the death of any person.' Section 51-601. Admiralty courts have jurisdiction to enforce such liens. The Corsair, \n145 \nU.S. 335, 347\n, 12 S. Ct. 949; The Anglo-Patagonian (C.C.A.) 235 F. 92, 94.\n The libel alleges no cause of action that accrued to the deceased. The only cause of action here involved is that created by the Oregon statute and it did not arise until the intestate died. The sole question is whether the happening of the fatal event upon navigable waters gave the admiralty court jurisdiction notwithstanding death occurred on land. The right to recover for death depends upon the law of the place of the act or omission that caused it and not upon that of the place where death occurred. Van Doren v. Pennsylvania R. Co.

Where a longshoreman working upon the land assisting in the unloading of a ship was struck by a sling \n\n[288 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n of cargo and knocked into the water where he died, this court held that the state compensation act and not the maritime law governed. Smith & Son v. Taylor, \n276 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S.Ct. 228. Defendant conceded that the state law would apply if the deceased had been killed on the land. But it argued that, as no claim was made for injuries there sustained and that as the suit was solely for death, the case was exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. We said (page 182 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 228, 229): 'But this is a partial view that cannot be sustained. The blow by the sling was what gave rise to the cause of action. It was given and took effect while deceased was upon the land. It was the sole, immediate and proximate cause of his death.' Mutatis mutandis, what was there said is applicable here.\n The substance and consummation of the occurrence which resulted in intestate's death and so gave rise to respondent's cause of action took place on the deck of the ship lying in navigable waters. The damages allowed by the Oregon statute are those resulting solely from the death. The foundation of the right to recover is a wrongful act or omission taking effect aboard the ship and resulting in death upon the land.

NEW HAMPSHIRE(1933)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: May 29, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 593, 595]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., of New York City, James P. Tuttle, of Manchester, N.H., and J. A. Matthews, of Newark, N.J., for the State of New Hampshire.\n Messrs. Warren R. Austin, of Burlington, Vt., and John G. Sargent, of Ludlow, Vt., for the State of Vermont.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an original suit, brought by the state of Vermont December 8, 1915, for the determination of the boundary line between that state and the state of New Hampshire. By the amended bill of complaint Vermont alleged that the boundary is 'the thread of the channel' of the Connecticut River for its entire course, except for that part from the northerly limits of the town of Vernon, Vt., south to the Massachusetts line where it 'is the west bank of Connecticut River at low-water mark.' In the original bill of complaint there was an alternative \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 596]\n\u00a0\n claim that, if this court should be of the opinion that the boundary is not the thread, but is 'the west bank of the Connecticut River,' then, 'such line is the westerly edge of the waters of the Connecticut River at its average and mean stage during the entire year without reference to the extraordinary freshets or extreme droughts.' New Hampshire, by its amended answer, asserts that the boundary is 'at the top or westerly margin of the westerly bank of the Connecticut River and the east branch thereof.'\n Vermont's claim of a boundary at the thread of the channel was based upon the following propositions: Township grants made by the Governor of the province of New Hampshire, by royal authority, between 1741 and 1764, on the west side of the Connecticut River in the territory now Vermont, were bounded by the river, which was nontidal, and carried title to its thread by virtue of the common law of England; an order of the King-in- Council of July 20, 1764, fixing the boundary between the provinces of New York and New Hampshire at the 'western banks of the River Connecticut,' thus including the territory now Vermont in the province of New York, was nullified by the successful revolution of the inhabitants of the New Hampshire grants; hence the eastern boundary of the revolutionary state of Vermont was the same as the eastern limits of the township grants, namely, the thread of the river; Vermont was admitted to the Union as a sovereign independent state with her boundaries those established by her revolution. Her eastern boundary was therefore the thread of the Connecticut River.\n The special master sustained all these contentions except the last one. With respect to it he found that Vermont had, by resolution of her Legislature of February 22, 1782, relinquished any claim to jurisdiction east of the west side of the river, at low-water mark, in conform- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 597]\n\u00a0\n ity to a Congressional resolution of August 20, 21, 1781, prescribing terms upon which Congress would consider the admission of Vermont to the Union. In addition to the findings already indicated, the special master also concluded that the order of the King-in-Council of July 20, 1764, even if not rendered ineffective by the revolution of Vermont, was not intended to recognize any rights of New Hampshire west of the west side of the river at low water; that Vermont's claim of a boundary at the thread of the river would be defeated by her acquiescence in New Hampshire's exercise of dominion over the waters of the river even if it had not been relinquished by acceptance of the resolutions of Congress of August, 1781, and finally that, by practical construction of the two states by long usage and acquiescence, the boundary of Vermont was fixed at the low-water mark on the west side of the river.\n Accordingly the special master found that:\n'The eastern boundary of the State of Vermont upon her admission to the Union was that stated in the resolutions of Congress of August 20, and 21, 1781, and in the resolution of the Vermont legislature of February 22, 1782, and this I find to be the low-water mark on the west side of the Connecticut River.'\n\n The line of low-water mark thus specified was further defined as 'the point to which the river recedes at its lowest stage without reference to extreme droughts,' and no exception has been taken to this definition.\n Vermont's claim of a boundary to the thread of the channel is no longer before us as New Hampshire alone has filed exceptions to the report of the special master. Those exceptions narrow the issue to the single question whether the boundary line is at low-water mark on the west side of the river as the master found or at the top or westerly margin of the bank as contended by New Hampshire; in other words, whether New Hampshire acquired and retained jurisdicti n of a narrow ribbon of land \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n of varying width on the west side of the Connecticut River, extending along the entire eastern boundary of Vermont, which at some stages of the river is submerged and at others left uncovered by the water. In support of this contention New Hampshire relies on the order of the King-in- Council of 1764, which it is argued established the eastern boundary of Vermont at the west bank of the Connecticut River, not at low-water mark, but at the top of the bank or the line upon it where vegetation ceases.\n The Order-in-Council must be considered in the light of the colonial history out of which it grew, which is elaborately reviewed in the special master's report. The royal province of New Hampshire was established on September 18, 1679, by commission of Charles II, establishing the president and council of that province. On July 3, 1741, Benning Went- worth was appointed Governor by George II. His commission, like that later issued to him by George III in 1760, defined the western boundary of the province only by the provision that its south line and its north line should extend westward 'till it meets with our other governments.' The government on the west of New Hampshire was the province of New York, originating in the grant of June 29, 1674, by Charles II to his brother James, Duke of York, which included 'all the lands from the west side of Connecticut river to the east side of Delaware Bay.' This grant merged in the crown when James, Duke of York, became King James II in 1685\n\n\n Despite the language of the New York grant fixing its eastern boundary as the west side of the Connecticut River, that province did not assert jurisdiction as far east as the Connecticut River at any point south of the New Hampshire line. The western boundary of the province of Connecticut was fixed about 1684 with the acquiescence of New York as a line, approximately north and south, twenty miles east of the Hudson River, and before 1750, \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 599]\n\u00a0\n Massachusetts had settled westerly to about the same line and New York had made no attempt to disturb those settlements.\n Governor Wentworth, construing his commission as extending the province of New Hampshire westwardly at least to this line east of the Hudson River, acting under authority of a royal commission, made, from about 1752 to 1764, numerous grants of townships in the territory west of the Connecticut River, now a part of Vermont. Each of these grants comprised a territory six miles square and conferred on the inhabitants authority to organize town governments. Twenty-three of the towns were adjacent to the Connecticut River, and with the exception of Vernon, which extended across the river at the southeastern corner of the present state of Vermont, the boundary line of these townships was described expressly or by implication as extending to or beginning at a tree or other designated monument standing on the westerly side or the west bank of the river and extending 'thence up the river' or 'thence down the river.' At the time of these grants the river was extensively used by the inhabitants on both sides for hunting and fishing.\n The special master, upon an exhaustive examination of the evidence and the law, concluded that these boundaries were on the river and, with the exception of the town of Vernon, carried the boundary of the townships to the thread of the river. Although this conclusion is challenged by the exceptions filed in behalf of New Hampshire, it is not denied that the boundary in the description of the New Hampshire township grants carried at least to the river.\n In 1749, before the township grants before us were made, a controversy had arisen between the Royal Governors of New Hampshire and New York over their respective authority to make grants in the territory between the Hudson and Connecticut Rivers. Although sus- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n pended during the French and Indian wars, the conflict was renewed at the end of 1763 and in 1764 was submitted to the King-in-Council for determination. New York a serted that, under the grant to the Duke of York, that province included 'all the lands from the west side of Connecticut River.' New Hampshire claimed that its boundary extended to the line approximately twenty miles east of the Hudson corresponding roughly to a prolongation northerly of the westerly boundaries of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The controversy was referred to the Lords of Trade, who made their report of July 10, 1764. Their recommendation was approved by the order of the King-in-Council, on July 20, 1764, which fixed the boundary in the following language:\n'His Majesty, ... doth accordingly, hereby order and declare the western banks of the River Connecticut, from where it enters the Province of the Massachusetts Bay, as far north as the forty-fifth degree of northern latitude, to be the boundary line between the said two Provinces of New Hampshire and New York.'\n\n As it is conceded that the King-in-Council had authority to fix the boundary between the two royal provinces, the meaning and effect of the order of 1764 must first be considered. The special master concluded that the purpose and effect of the order were to leave undisturbed the boundary of New York as established by the grant to the Duke of York of all the lands from the west side of the Connecticut River; that the boundary fixed was therefore at the river and not at some point upon its bank. We think this conclusion correct.\n New Hampshire contends that the designation of the 'western banks' of the river as the boundary established a 'bank' boundary above low-water mark as distinguished from one upon the river which admittedly would carry at least to low water. But the language of the order was adopted to express a judgment upon conflicting \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 601]\n\u00a0\n claims, each clearly defined, neither of which involved the question whether the line was to be drawn at low water or at some point above. New York, relying on the Duke of York's grant, contended that its jurisdiction extended to the Connecticut River and not, as New Hampshire argued, to the line about twenty miles east of the Hudson, continuing that which marked the boundary of Massachusetts and Connecticut. In the entire history of the controversy there appears to have been no suggestion that the jurisdiction of New York would not extend to the Connecticut River if it were found to extend east of the western boundary of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Thus the written statement of January 20, 1764, presenting the claims of New York to the Lords of Trade stated that 'this Province is bounded eastward by Connecticut River' and the Lords of Trade in their report informed the Crown that 'Your Majesty's Lieutenant Governor of New York contends that ... 'the Province of New York does, both by the words and construction of the grant to the Duke of York, extend eastward as far as Connecticut River.\" This was the claim in favor of which the Lords of Trade decided. \n1\n True, they recom- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 602]\n\u00a0\n mended that 'the western banks of the River Connecticut from where it enters the Province of the Massachusetts Bay as far north as the forty- fifth degree of northern latitude should be declared to be the boundary line between the two Provinces.' But the evidence is conclusive that there was no thought that the designation of the banks as the boundary would have a different effect than the designation of the river itself. A communication from the Lords of Trade to Lieutenant Governor Colden of New York with respect to the boundary dispute, July 13, 1764, three days after their report to the crown, advised him that, 'as the reasons you assign for making Connecticut River the boundary line between the two provinces appear to us to have great weight, we have adopted and recommended that proposition.' In adopting the reference to the banks of the river contained in the recommendation of the Lords of Trade the Order-in-Council did not give it any different meaning. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 593, 603]\n\u00a0\n Subsequent events attest the validity of this conclusion. After the receipt of the order by the Governors of New Hampshire and New York, and the publication of its terms, it was interpreted by three Governors of New York, Moore, the Earl of Dunmore, and Tryon,3 to establish the river as the eastern boundary of the province and, except for a petition of New Hampshire to the crown in 1771 for a rescission of the order, the royal governments of both provinces recognized its validity up to the time of the revolution. In reporting to the crown December 3, 1772, upon New Hampshire's petition for rescission, the Lords of Trade recommended adherence to 'those principles of true policy and sound wisdom which appear to have dictated the proposition of making the River Connecticut the boundary between the two colonies.' And the response of the Governor of New Hampshire to a questionnaire sent out by the Lords of Trade in 1774 recited that 'the River Connecticut from Hinsdale runs through this Province, and is its boundary to the 45 of north latitude. ...'\n As we have sai , New Hampshire admits that a boundary on the river or including lands west of the river would normally carry at least to low- water mark. Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374; Thomas v. Hatch, 3 Summ. 170, Fed. Cas. No. 13, 899; see Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606, 627\n, 43 S.Ct. 221; Massachusetts v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 65, 93\n, 46 S.Ct. 357. But she contends, relying upon the rule said to have been laid down in Howard v. Ingersoll, 13 How. 381, 413, and followed \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 604]\n\u00a0\n in Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, that the designation of the banks of the river as the boundary rather than the river itself necessarily implies that the line is higher upon the bank than low-water mark, stated in brief and argument to be the place where vegetation ceases.\n Obviously the meaning of the words of the order could not be established by a rule of law declared long after its promulgation; and nothing in the decisions relied upon by New Hampshire admonishes us to disregard that meaning when, as here, it is clearly established. In the Ingersoll Case the court held that lands ceded by Georgia to the United States, situated 'west of a line beginning on the western bank of the Chattahoochee River' and 'running ... along the western bank thereof' were bounded by a line governed by the 'permanent fast land bank' and not by low-water mark. The court emphasized the fact that uncertainty which might be created by the use of the word 'bank' alone, as in the order before us, was removed by the additional phrase running 'along the bank' which was thought to have a popular significance excluding 'the idea that a line was to be traced at the edge of the water as that may be at one or another time or at low water, or the lowest low water.' Pages 415, 417 of 13 How.. See, also, Alabama v. Georgia, 23 How. 505. Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, held that a treaty, interpreted to designate a boundary 'along the south bank' of the Red River (\n260 \nU.S. 624, 626\n, 43 S.Ct. 221, 222), fixed the line at a point on and along the bank rather than at low-water mark. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 593, 605]\n\u00a0\n At most the decision may be thought to establish a rule of interpretation which must govern in the absence of affirmative evidence that the language used was intended to have a different meaning, for the court was careful to say that the conclusion reached 'has full confirmation in available historical data respecting the negotiations which attended the framing and signing of the treaty.' Page 632, of 260 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 221, 225. Here it is apparent on the face of the documents that the language of the order was not used with the intention of fixing a line upon the bank above low- water mark; and the history of the controversy clearly establishes that the intention of the order was to confirm and not to change the boundary as fixed by the grant to the Duke of York of 'all the lands on the west side of Connecticut River.'\n We cannot disregard this history without disregarding decisions of this court, which establish either expressly or by example that in the interpretation of a treaty or grant between two states for the settlement of boundary dispute the nature and history of the controversy must be considered. Massachusetts v. New York,  pra; Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 411. Upon considerations of this nature we held in Massachusetts v. New York, supra, that the words 'shore' and 'lake,' used in the Treaty of Hartford of 1786 in defining the boundary of New York and Massachusetts, were synonymous, and the boundary upon the shore was fixed at low-water mark on Lake Ontario.\n Moreover, in the present case, it must be remembered that the Governors of New Hampshire and New York were contesting each other's authority to grant land west of the Connecticut River and jurisdiction over the lands already granted there. It would be difficult to conclude that in settling that dispute it was intended to deny to New York or the grantees lawful access to the river at any of its usual seasonal states; and, inasmuch as there are no public rights in the shores of nontidal waters, \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 606]\n\u00a0\n the abutting owner, on the view insisted upon by New Hampshire, could not cross the bank to the water without trespass. Compare Massachusetts v. New York, supra, page 93 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 357, 362. Like a treaty or grant fixing the boundary between states, the Order-in-Council is to be construed 'with a view to public convenience, and the avoidance of controversy.' Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, supra, page 383 of 5 Wheat.. As was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, supra, page 380 of 5 Wheat.:\n'Even when a state retains its dominion over a river which constitutes the boundary between itself and another state, it would be extremely inconvenient, to extend its dominion over the land on the other side, which was left bare by the receding of the water. And this inconvenience is not less, where the rising and falling is annual, than where it is diurnal. Wherever the river is a boundary between states, it is the main, the permanent river, which constitutes that boundary; and the mind will find itself embarrassed with insurmountable difficulty, in attempting to draw any other line than the low-water mark.'\n\n It is true that a different rule has been applied in the case of grants bounded by tidal waters, which carry only to high-water mark. Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1\n, 14 S.Ct. 548; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 577\n, 30 S.Ct. 630; Smoot Sand & Gravel Corporation v. Washington Airport, \n283 \nU.S. 350\n, 51 S.Ct. 474. But as was pointed out in Massachusetts v. New York, supra, page 93 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 357, 362, such grants, since they carry to tidal water, and since the public has rights in the foreshore, do not deny access to the sea, and even grants of this class may, by construction, be deemed to carry to low-water mark where the surrounding circumstances show that such was the boundary intended.\n Our conclusion as to the meaning and effect of the Order-in-Council of 1764 would be decisive of the boundary of Vermont upon her admission to the Union were it not for the history of Vermont as a revolutionary govern- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 607]\n\u00a0\n ment and the consequent uncertainty whether she was admitted under the second clause of article 4,  3, of the Constitution as a new state formed out of the territory of New York, with her boundary accordingly determined by that of New York, or whether she was admitted under the first clause of article 4,  3, as an independent revolutionary state with self- constituted boundaries.\n The special master found that attempts by the New York authorities after 1764 to interfere with the possession of the holders of the New Hampshire grants made prior to the Order-in-Council led to protest and forcible resistance which assumed the proportions of a revolutionary movement. This movement culminated in 1777 in the Declaration of Independence by the towns comprising the New Hampshire grants on both sides of the Green Mountains, which proclaimed that the jurisdiction granted by the crown 'to New York government over the people of the New Hampshire Grants is totally dissolved,' and that a free and independent government is set up w thin the territory now Vermont, bounded 'east on Connecticut River ... as far as the New Hampshire Grants extends.' From that time until the admission of Vermont into the Union in 1791 an independent government was maintained with defined geographical limits extending on the east to the Connecticut River. In view of these facts the special master concluded that the Order-in-Council was nullified by successful revolution and Vermont was admitted as an independent state with self-constituted boundaries. But he also found, as we have said, that Vermont's claims of jurisdiction to the thread of the river were restricted to the low-water mark on the western side by resolutions of Congress of August 20, 21, 1781, and their acceptance by resolution of the Vermont Legislature, February 22, 1782. In addition, he found that Vermont was not recognized as an independent state by Congress either under \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 608]\n\u00a0\n the Articles of Confederation or under the Constitution, but that her independence was recognized by New Hampshire in 1777, by Massachusetts in 1781, and by New York in 1790. The latter finding is contested by New Hampshire as is his conclusion of law that, even if Vermont was not recognized as an independent state prior to her admission to the Union, her status as a revolutionary state may be determined by this court where necessary to the settlement of a boundary dispute between two states.\n Under the circumstances of the present case the questions raised by these conclusions of the special master and the contentions of New Hampshire with respect to them need not be decided. For New York, by Commissioners acting under a resolution of her Legislature of March 6, 1790, gave formal consent to the admission of Vermont into the Union, and, if Vermont was admitted as a state carved out of the territory of New York, her boundaries on the east were those of New York, as fixed by the Order- in-Council. If admitted as a free and independent state her boundaries were those fixed by her own declaration of independence as limited by her acceptance of the conditions of the congressional resolution of August 20, 21, 1781. That boundary we conclude was also one carrying to the river and to low-water mark.\n Following Vermont's declaration of independence, and until her admission to statehood in 1791, she, from time to time, sent representatives to Congress seeking admission to the Union and published to the world numerous appeals, vindications, and arguments to develop public opinion in favor of her admission. During that period New York, at times, made formal assertion of jurisdiction over the territory now Vermont. A committee report to the New Hampshire Legislature of April 2, 1779, adopted by the Legislature June 24, recommended that New Hampshire make claim to the whole of the New Hampshire \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 609]\n\u00a0\n grants, with the qualification that, if the Continental Congress should recognize Vermont as an independent state, New Hampshire would acquiesce and until Congress settled the dispute would exercise jurisdiction 'as far west as the western banks of Connecticut River and no further.' Vermont, on her part, attempted to annex towns in New Hampshire on the east side of the river.\n After various efforts to enlist the interest of the Continental Congress in a settlement of the controversy, the Vermont Legislature of June 22, 1781, adopted a report of a committee recommending the appointment of delegates to propose to Congress and receive from it terms for a union with the United States. The matter was also brought to the attention of Congress by a letter from the President of New Hampshire of June 30, 1781.\n On July 31, a committee of Congress to which the matter had been referred recommended that Congress guarantee to New York and New Hampshire their respective territory lying outside the New Hampshire grants 'in case the said states shall relinquish their respective claims to said districts called the New Hampshire Grants or the State of Vermont, bounded east by Connecticut river ... formerly granted by the Governor of New Hampshire,' a recommendation which was renewed in a further report of August 2. Congress by resolution of August 7, reciting that New Hampshire and New York have submitted to it the decision of the disputes between them and 'the people inhabiting the New Hampshire Grants on the West side of Connecticut River called the State of Vermont, concerning their respective claims of jurisdiction over the said territory,' and that the parties 'have been heard thereon,' declared that, in case Congress should recognize the independence of the people of Vermont, it would 'consider all the lands belonging to New Hampshire and New York respectively without the limits of Vermont aforesaid, as coming within the mutual \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 610]\n\u00a0\n guaranty of territory contained in the Articles of Confederation.' And, in pursuance of the same resolution, Congress, on August 8, appointed a committee of five to confer with persons representing the New Hampshire grants 'on the west side of Connecticut River,' with respect to their claim to be an independent state and the terms upon which they should be admitted to the Union, in case Congress should recognize their independence. On August 18, Vermont's representatives proposed that Vermont be recognized as an independent state with a boundary extending eastward 'to the west bank of the Connecticut River; thence up the river as it tends to the 45th degree of north latitude.' The same day, answering written interrogatories of the committee of Congress, they stated that the boundaries of Vermont specified in their proposal were the same as those contained in the resolution of Congress of August 7th, in which the New Hampshire grants were described as being 'on the west side of Connecticut River.'\n The congressional resolutions of August 20, 21, on which the special master relied, provided, in final form, 'that it be an indispensable preliminary to the recognition of the independence of the people inhabiting the territory called Vermont, and their admission into the federal union, that they explicitly relinquish all demands of lands or jurisdiction on the east side of the west bank of Connecticut River. ...' On February 19, 1782, the Vermont Assembly, in Committee of the Whole, after considering the resolutions of Congress of August 7, 20, and 21, 1781, recommended that the Assembly of the state 'pass resolutions, declaring their acquiescence in, and accession to, the determination made by Congress of the said boundary lines, between the states of New Hampshire and New York, respectively, and this state, as they are, in said resolutions, defined and described, and also, expressly relinquishing all claim to and jurisdiction of, and \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 611]\n\u00a0\n over, the said districts of territory without said boundary lines.' On February 22, 1782, the Legislature, after reciting the quoted recommendation of the Committee of the Whole, resolved that it be complied with, and 'that the west bank of Connecticut River' and a specified boundary on the New York side of the state 'shall be considered as the east and west boundaries of this state'; any claim to jurisdiction over all territory 'without said boundary lines' was formally relinquished. On April 17, 1782, a committee of Congress to which the matter had been submitted reported that the congressional resolutions of the 20th and 21st of August had been fully complied with, and recommended that the territory of Vermont, as defined in these resolutions, be recognized and admitted to the Union, as a free and independent state.\n But action by Congress was postponed and no further progress was made towards the admission of Vermont until July 16, 1789, when the New York Legislature passed an act, reaffirmed March 6, 1790, authorizing the appointment of commissioners with power to declare upon such terms as they might think proper, the consent of New York to her admission. Vermont in turn appointed commissioners to treat with the representatives of New York. Their negotiations resulted in agreem nt between the two states as to the eastern boundary of New York and payment by Vermont of New York of the sum of $30,000 for the relinquishment of all claims of sovereignty by New York, and for the confirmation of the New Hampshire township grants. In 1791 the matter of admission was again presented to Congress by commissioners selected for the purpose under resolution of the Vermont Legislature of January 20, 1791, and the admission of Vermont followed by Act of Congress of February 18, 1791.\n The acceptance by the Vermont Legislature on February 22, 1782, of the resolutions of Congress of August 20, 21, 1781, requiring the relinquishment by the inhabitants \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 612]\n\u00a0\n of Vermont of 'all demands of lands or jurisdiction on the east side of the west bank of Connecticut River,' operated to relinquish any claim on the part of Vermont to jurisdiction to the thread of the river in the territory of the New Hampshire grants as defined by their declaration of independence. We think it also operated to confirm the eastern boundary of Vermont as a boundary extending to the river as it had been fixed by the Order-in-Council of 1764. It is true that the resolution of acceptance of the Vermont Legislature named 'the west bank of Connecticut River' as the boundary, but it cannot be supposed that it was intended by this language to relinquish any greater jurisdiction than Congress required Vermont to surrender-that 'on the east side of the west bank.' And the terms of the congressional resolution cannot be interpreted without regard to the previous negotiations including the proposal of the Vermont representatives of 1781 designating the west bank as the boundary and their statement of the same date that the boundary intended was the same as that contained in the Congressional resolution of August 7th in which the New Hampshire grants were described as being 'on the west side' of the river. When the negotiations are considered as a whole, the conclusion is irresistible that the sole controversy with respect to the boundary line was whether Vermont had extended her boundary eastward beyond the line at the river established less than a generation earlier5 by the Order-in- Council of 1764. Congress required the relinquishment of any claims to such an extension, but we cannot say that it required more without ignoring the language of the negotiations as well as the history of the Order-in-Council, already detailed. Moreover, the con- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 613]\n\u00a0\n siderations of practical convenience which fortify the conclusion that the boundary fixed by the order carried to the river lead to the like conclusion that the boundary intended by the resolutions of Congress and of the Vermont Legislature to be that of Vermont upon her admission into the Union was a boundary on the river carrying to normal low-water mark.\n New Hampshire does not appear to have assented formally to the resolutions of Congress of August 20, 21, 1781, but she was represented by agents before the Congressional committee on whose reports of July 31 and August 2 the resolution was, in part, based. Both they and the New Hampshire representatives in Congress were familiar with the terms of the resolutions and could not have been unaware of the fact that, in all the formal representations made to Congress in behalf of Vermont and in the various reports and resolutions of committees and the resolutions of Congress itself, the eastern boundary of Vermont was described interchangeably as the west side of the Connecticut River or as not extending east of the west banks of the river. Although these were public acts of notoriety, New Hampshire does not appear ever to have made any objection to these definitions of the boundary line.\n The conclusion we have reached as to the correct construction of the Order-in-Council of 1764 and the resolution of Congress under which Vermont was admitted to statehood finds support in the practical construction given by both states to the boundary, thus defined, in the long-continued failure of New Hampshire to assert any dominion over the west bank of the river, and in her long acquiescence in the dominion asserted there by Vermont. See Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 295, 308\n, 46 S.Ct. 290; Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 \nU.S. 479, 509\n, 511 S., 10 S.Ct. 1051; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 30 S.Ct. 268; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639. Vermont, it is true, made several \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 614]\n\u00a0\n attempts to revive its ancient claim to dominion over the river to its thread, by invitations to New Hampshire to join in the appointment of commissioners to settle the boundary. Resolution of Vermont Legislature of November 6, 1792, as amended October 20, 1794; Resolution of October 25, 1830; Resolution of November 6, 1830. None of these efforts, except the last, appears to have provoked any formal action in behalf of New Hampshire, but in response to the resolution of November 6, 1830, the New Hampshire Legislature adopted a resolution of July 1, 1831, declining to appoint commissioners as requested, and declaring that no doubt had hitherto been entertained or suggested in relation to the boundary, and that 'the River Connecticut for the whole extent of the line between the two states' was 'conceded to be within the limits and exclusive jurisdiction of the State of New Hampshire.' No jurisdiction over the west bank was asserted.\n A large amount of evidence, thought to have some bearing on the practical construction given to the boundary by the two states, has been introduced in the present suit. Most of it, when examined in detail, is of such slight weight and so inconclusive as to make unnecessary any extensive review of it here. Of some, but by no means controlling, significance, are instances of action by towns in New Hampshire recognizing low-water mark on the west bank as the boundary of the towns and of the state,6 and numerous deeds or other formal documents introduced in evidence affecting titles in each of the towns on the west bank of the river by which the property conveyed was extended to the river or included the privilege \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 615]\n\u00a0\n of the use of the water. In the absence of evidence of like character showing the assertion of title or jurisdiction in new Hampshire above the low-water line, these facts have some persuasive force in showing that inhabitants along the questioned boundary considered that it extended along the river at low-water mark. See Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, supra, page 384 of 5 Wheat..\n Voluminous evidence was given with respect to the history of taxation by the two states of property along the contested boundary line. New Hampshire taxed thirty bridges and several dams, all structures extending across the river, but the tax records give no clear indication of any purpose or intention to tax property above low-water mark on the west bank or to do more than tax so much of it as was within the state, without reference to any defined boundary. Vermont taxed five of the bridges in varying years, the property taxed being the 'abutment' to the bridge on the Vermont side, or the 'end of the bridge with abutment,' in several instances a fractional part of a bridge and, in one, the 'end of bridge abutment to low water mark.' Only in this last instance does it definitely appear that the property taxed extended to low water, although it seems probable that the abutment or the fractional part of the bridges taxed may in some other cases have extended to that point.\n Of persuasive force is the fact found by t e special master that New Hampshire appears never to have asserted definitely any right to tax land or structures located on the west side of the river before 1909 or 1912. From 1909 to 1927, New Hampshire taxed structures on the west side of the river belonging to the Connecticut River Power Company at Vernon, the property of which appears also to have been taxed by Vermont from 1916 to 1927. While it may be inferred that the property taxed by both states included structures on the west bank of the river between the high and low- water marks, the special master did \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 616]\n\u00a0\n not so find and the fact does not clearly appear. In 1912 the New Hampshire taxing authorities taxed seven corporations, three partnerships, and persons unknown having structures located on the Vermont bank of the river near Bellows Falls, at a valuation in excess of $1,000,000. The same property appears to have been taxed by Vermont, the record of taxation of some of it belonging to the Bellows Falls Canal Company, going back to a date as early as 1820. It is conceded that the property taxed included structures extending on the bank below the line of vegetation. The special master's finding that it was this 'unprecedented' taxation by New Hampshire which precipitated the present suit is unchallenged. The fact that in the period of over a century following Vermont's admission to statehood this is the first well-authenticated instance of an effort on the part of the New Hampshire authorities to tax property located on the west bank of the river is of substantial weight in indicating acquiescence by New Hampshire in the boundary line restricting her jurisdiction to the river at the low-water mark.\n An important practical confirmation of this boundary line was the location in 1897 of the monument fixing the southeast corner of Vermont and the southwest corner of New Hampshire by commissioners of the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, pursuant to agreement between the three states of October 26, 1894. By the agreement it was stipulated that: 'The southwest corner of the State of New Hampshire and the southeast corner of the State of Vermont on the northerly line of Massachusetts is at a point on the west bank of the Con- \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 617]\n\u00a0\n necticut River, about two hundred and sixty-five feet northerly of the mouth of Little Meadow Brook, so called, near South Vernon Railroad Station, and directly east of a point designated on the maps of said engineers as 'Belding'; and that a substantial monument be erected as near to said corner on the westerly bank of the Connecticut River as is practicable, having reference to its stability.' It is shown by the evidence that the point designated as 'Belding,' or sometimes as 'Belden,' was at a marker located on the line between Massachusetts and Vermont at the top of the west bank of the river. The point designated as the corner by the agreement between the states was therefore east of the top of the bank.\n The monument was placed in position under the supervision of the commissioners in 1897. Its location was approved in identical language by the Legislature of Vermont on November 15, 1900 (Laws Vt. 1900, No. 137), and by the Legislature of New Hampshire on March 22, 1901 (Laws N.H. 1901, c. 115), as follows: 'The southwest corner of New Hampshire and southeast corner of Vermont are marked by a copper bolt in the apex of a granite block set upon a stone pier and sunk in the shore of the western bank of the Connecticut river, and its location designated by a large polished granite monument, five hundred and eighty-two feet distant on the western bank of the river above high-water mark.' The special master found, upon voluminous testimony, that the granite block marking the boundary was set at the low-water mark. Its location was described by the person who erected it, who testified that it was placed in position at a point marked by the Commissioners and in accordance with specifications furnished to the witness by them calling for its erection 'at low water line between Vermont and New Hampshire.' The monument was buried 8 feet deep with the apex level with the surface of the sand so as to avoid ice and other things 'running down the river.' It was set at an opportune time when the river was 'very low'; at that time, it was 8 feet east of the shore line, and about 10 or 12 feet west of the water line. This testimony is neither contradicted nor impeached. It is corroborated by a second witness and by surrounding circumstances, as well as by evidence that the monument is submerged by the water at higher stages of \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 618]\n\u00a0\n the river. The monument is shown by other testimony to be 17 feet below and 36.5 feet east of the Belding marker referred to in the agreement between the states for establishing the corner. This marker, as already mentioned, is shown to be located at the top of the bank. It is so located in New Hampshire's amended answer of October 6, 1930, which alleges that the boundary 'from the ancient 'Belden' bound, so called, on the west bank of the Connecticut River ... is at said top or westerly margin of said ( westerly) bank.'\n The evidence fully supports the conclusion that the monument was intended to be located at low-water mark and was in fact placed below the shore line at a point near the water's edge when the river was 'very low.'\n After the monument had been located, the commissioners of New Hampshire filed their report to the Governor of the state. The report is undated, but refers 'to the action of the commissions and the boundary line and state corner established by them' as having 'received the legislative sanction of the three states.' In this report the following statement appears:\n'The position of the southwest corner of New Hampshire having been agreed upon, as before stated, the commissioners of New Hampshire and Vermont, after careful deliberation and consultation with experts competent to advise in such matters, proceeded to mark the same in this manner. The corner is situate on the west bank of the Connecticut River, at the line where vegetation ceases, and it was difficult to place a suitable monument, that should always be visible, at this precise point, owing to the great variations in the level of the river at different seasons of the year, without incurring a large and useless expense.'\n\n New Hampshire places reliance on this language and a statement in the report of the Vermont commissioners of July 26, 1900, that the monument was placed 'at a \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 619]\n\u00a0\n point where the vegetation ceases to grow' as showing that the monument was erroneously located.\n In the entire history of the boundary between these two states, this appears to be the first occasion when any reference to the boundary as being 'the line where vegetation ceases' is to be found in any official document. Aside from the location of the monument at such a point being inconsistent with the statement in the New Hampshire report itself that it was difficult, owing to variation in the level of the river, to place a suitable monument there, where it would be visible, this pronouncement of the commissioners is plainly insufficient to impeach the formal declaration of the Legislatures of both states that the monument had been 'sunk in the shore of the western bank of the Connecticut River' or the conclusion of the special master that it had been placed at the point chosen and intended by the commissioners, and that that point was at the low-water line.\n It is significant, also, that no definite and certain location of the boundary has ever been continuously claimed by New Hampshire either by her public acts or by her pleadings in this suit. Her claim as originally stated in her answer that the boundary was at high-water mark was changed by amendments to a line at the top of the west bank. In brief and argument here, the contention is that the line is to be fixed at the point where vegetation ceases.\n We think that the practical construction of the boundary by the acts of the two states and of their inhabitants ten  to support our interpretation of the Order-in-Council of 1764, and of the resolutions of Congress and of the Vermont Legislature, preceding the admission of Vermont to the Union. We conclude that the true boundary is at the low- water mark on the western side of the Connecticut River, as the special master has found. We adopt his definition of low-water mark, which is not challenged here, \n\n[289 U.S. 593, 620]\n\u00a0\n as the line drawn at the point to which the river recedes at its lowest stage without reference to extreme droughts. The costs will be divided between the parties in accordance with the general rule in cases of this kind. Michigan v. Wisconsin, supra, page 319 of 270 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 290, 298; North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 583\n, 44 S.Ct. 208. The parties, or either of them, if so advised, may, within thirty days, submit the form of decree to carry this opinion into effect, failing which the court will prepare and enter the decree.\n It is so ordered.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the report of the Lords of Trade of 1764 the arguments said to have been advanced by the Governor of New York in support of his boundary claim are, in addition to the language of the Duke of York's grant, that 'the River Connecticut is in all respects the most certain and proper boundary; that it will be more convenient that the lands to the Westward of that river should be included in New York, because Hudson's River being navigable by Vessells of considerable Burthen to Albany, the Trade of that part of the Country will probably center there, to which place the Transportation or Carriage will be much easier, than to the Ports of New Hampshire, and where the Inhabitants are likely to meet with a better Market for their produce; that as the Quit Rent in New Hampshire is but one shilling the hundred Acres, and that of New York, two shillings and six pense, the revenue to your Majesty, if the Lands are settled under New York, will be greater than if granted under New Hampshire; and that there is another Circumstance of great weight at this Juncture, and operating in favor of this proposition, which is, that a great number of reduced Officers have located their Claims to Lands under Your Majesty's Proclamation in this part of the Country, and were willing to take out Grants for the same under the Province of New York, but absolutely decline any application to the Government of New Hampshire.' The Lords of Trade advised that these 'arguments urged by the Lieutenant Governor of New York in support of his proposition, appear to us to have great weight, if not absolutely to decide upon the Question; and the only probable inconvenience, that is stated to arise from making the River Connecticut the boundary line between the two Provinces, is the effect which the limitation of New Hampshire, to narrower Limits than is contended for, may have to disable them from making such a provision for its establishment as may be necessary to support it as a separate Government; But as we humbly apprehend, that the great extent of this Province to the Northward leaves sufficient room for much further improvement and Settlement, this objection does not appear to us to be of sufficient weight to counterbalance the convenience and advantage that seems to attend the other proposition. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare the Proclamation of Lieutenant Governor Colden of New York of December 28, 1763, declaring 'that the province of New York is bounded to the eastward by the River Connecticut,' and commanding 'all judges, justices and other civil officers within the same, to continue to exercise jurisdiction in their respective functions as far as to the banks of Connecticut River, the undoubted eastern limits of that part of the province of New York, notwithstanding any contrariety of jurisdiction claimed by the Government of New Hampshire.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See letters of Governor Moore to the Earl of Shelbourne, June 9, 1767, the Earl of Dunmore to the Earl of Hillsborough, July 20, 1764, Governor Tryon to the Rev. Mr. Dewey, May 19, 1772. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Upon the argument of the present case it was conceded that the flow of the Connecticut River, always of substantial volume, is confined by precipitous banks extending to or near the water at all normal stages of the river, except for relatively small stretches where the banks are low and overflowed at high water. It does not appear that there are flats of any substantial area lying between the precipitous banks and the water at its lowest stage or that the river has shifted its bed to any material extent at any time. In all these respects the physical characteristics of the Connecticut River differ from those of the Red River, described in Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, 634, 635 of 260 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 221, 225, 226. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Order-in-Council was specifically referred to in the resolution of Congress of August 7, as having 'superseded the pretensions of New Hampshire in favor of New York' and having been 'assented to on the part of the former.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Authorization of the town of Stratford, N.H., October 1, 1893, for laying out a highway between Stratford and Bloomfield, Vt.; contract of April 24, 1896, between Lyme, N.H., and Thetford, Vt., for the erection of a bridge across the river between the two towns. \n\n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVOEHL v. INDEMNITY INS. CO. OF NORTH AMERICA(1933)\nNo. 315\nArgued: January 13, 1933Decided: February 6, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 162, 163]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Israel J. Mendelson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. G. Bowdoin Craighill, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[288 U.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the Act of Congress of May 17, 1928 (45 Stat. 600, D.C. Code, tit. 19,  11, 12), the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C.,  901-950 (33 USCA  901-950)) are made applicable to employees, as stated, in the District of Columbia. Petitioner, Karl F. Voehl, an employee of the National Electrical Supply Company, which was engaged in business in the District, filed a claim for compensation for an injury sustained through an automobile accident while he was on his way to his employer's place of business on Sunday, April 6, 1930, for the purpose, according to his contention, of performing the duties assigned to him. The employer was notified, and hearing was had before the Deputy Commissioner. Respondent, the insurance carrier of the employer, contested the claim. Admitting that the relationship of employer and employee existed on the date of the injury and that the employer was subject to the Compensation Act, respondent defended upon the ground that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of the employment. The Deputy Commissioner received the evidence offered, which included the testimony of the employer's manager with respect to the petitioner's duties, and made a compensation order setting forth detailed findings of fact supporting the claim and awarding compensation.\n Respondent then filed a bill of complaint in the Supreme Court of the District to obtain an injunction restraining the enforcement of the compensation order, and annexed to the bill, as a part thereof, the full record of \n\n[288 U.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n the proceedings and evidence before the Deputy Commissioner. Respondent charged that the compensation order, findings, and award were not in accordance with law, and were not supported by the evidence. Petitioner was permitted to intervene. Motion by the Deputy Commissioner to dismiss the bill of complaint was granted, and decree was entered accordingly. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District, taking a different view of the evidence, reversed the decree (Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Hoage, 61 App.D.C. 173, 58 F.(2d) 1074), and the case comes here on certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 592\n, 53 S.Ct. 122, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The relation of master and servant admittedly existed. The business of the employer, carried on within the District, and the nature of the petitioner's employment, were such that both were subject to the Compensation Act. D.C. Code, tit. 19,  11, 12. By the express provisions of the act, the Deputy Commissioner was authorized to entertain the claim of the employee and 'to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.' 33 U.S.C.  919(a), 33 USCA  919(a). The proceedings of the Deputy Commissioner conformed to the statute. The precise issue, whether the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment, turned on the general nature and scope of the employee's duties, the particular instructions he had received, and the practice which obtained as to work in extra hours or on Sundays, and the purpose of the journey in which he was injured. We think that there can be no doubt of the power of the Congress to invest the Deputy Commissioner, as it has invested him, with authority to determine these questions after proper hearing and upon sufficient evidence. And when the Deputy Commissioner, following the course prescribed by the statute, makes such a determination, his findings of fact, supported by evidence, must be deemed to be conclusive. Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 46\n, 47 S., 52 S.Ct. 285; L'Hote v. Crowell, \n286 \nU.S. 528\n, 52 S.Ct. 499\n\n\n The Deputy Commissioner found that petitioner was injured while on his way to the employer's warehouse for \n\n[288 U.S. 162, 167]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of clearing it of de bris in accordance with his duties, and that when so engaged on Sunday the terms of his employment covered the period of service from the time he left his home until his return; his compensation for this service being at an agreed rate per hour for the entire time, with an allowance for his transportation. We think that these findings were supported by the proof. From the testimony of the employer's manager who had supervision of petitioner's work, it appeared that petitioner, being employed in the 'refrigeration division' of the supply company, had charge of the maintenance and operation of the company's warehouse and of the maintenance of service on refrigerators in customers' homes. He was the 'head of the products division.' With other matters, it was his duty to see that the buildings and stock were kept in proper order, and that there was compliance with the fire rules. He had strict instructions with respect to the disposition of de bris and its prompt removal. Voehl was a trusted employee who had been with the company for sixteen years, and the company relied upon him to attend to whatever was necessary in the line of his work without specific or detailed instructions. His regular hours at the company's building were from 7:30 a. m. to 5:30 p.m. The manager testified that, in addition to these hours, Voehl was 'on duty all of the time, on our call. That is to say, he was a very willing employee and we kept him purposely for taking care of emergencies and seeing that all details were cleaned up properly.' By reason of the 24-hour service which the company maintained, Voehl was always subject to the calls of customers, responding either personally or through one of the service men under his direction. He had access to the warehouse at all times. Voehl used his own automobile, and when he was at work for the company outside of 'office hours' and on Sundays he was paid a mileage rate of five cents a mile for the use of his car, and at the rate of 75 cents per \n\n[288 U.S. 162, 168]\n\u00a0\n hour from the time he left his home until his return. As the one in charge of the warehouse and service, Voehl submitted weekly a memorandum of the overtime of the employees under him and his own. The company had found him to be honest in his statements and his overtime account was never questioned.\n Respondent's contention was that Voehl was going to the warehouse for a purpose of his own, to obtain ashes to place in front of his house; being accompanied by his brother-in-law to assist him in their removal. The evidence showed that the company did not object to the employees taking ashes; but their removal was not part of Voehl's work. Voehl's statement was that the purpose of his Sunday trip was to remove an unusual accumulation of trash, which it was his duty to remove, and that under his orders it was necessary for him to do this on Sunday in order that the building might be in proper condition on the following morning. He said that he often had 'to come down on Sundays to finish cleaning up,' that the menager inspected the warehouse 'every Monday morning to see that it was free of all trash,' and that he (Voehl) did his utmost 'to have the building clean for inspection.' While his brother-in-law testified as to the intention to take the ashes, he also said that Voehl 'went there specifically to straighten up the warehouse and bring the ashes back home when he came back.' Voehl's statement as to the necessity of his trip on the particular Sunday, in the course of his duties, finds corroboration in the testimony of the manager. The latter said that Voehl had authority to go to the plant on the Sunday in question and that he could have made a charge for his service on that day and for his mileage. While the manager did not himself know the condition of the plant on the day of the accident, or the day before, he did know that there had been an unusual amount of unpacking of refrigerators during the \n\n[288 U.S. 162, 169]\n\u00a0\n three days before the accident, and that such work was 'always attended by a large accumulation of trash and litter which must be cleared up.' He said that 'two or three days prior to the accident' he had called Voehl's attention 'to the necessity of keeping it better cleared up'; he knew that the warehouse at that time 'was in a badly littered condition.' The manager also had information as to Voehl's work on previous Sundays and, on respondent's request, furnished a statement of what the manager described as an 'exactly parallel instance' for which Voehl had been paid, and he believed that if the records of the busy season from April to August were available, they would show other similar instances.\n Upon this evidence and the findings of the Deputy Commissioner, the compensation order did not violate any principle of law. The general rule is that injuries sustained by employees when going to or returning from their regular place of work are not deemed to arise out of and in the course of their employment. \n1\n Ordinarily the hazards they encounter in such journeys are not incident to the employer's business. But this general rule is subject to exceptions which depend upon the nature and circumstances of the particular employment. 'No exact formula can be laid down which will automatically solve every case.' Cudahy Packing Company v. Parramore, \n263 \nU.S. 418, 424\n, 44 S.Ct. 153, 30 A.L.R. 532. See, also, Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, \n276 \nU.S. 154, 158\n, 48 S.Ct. 221, 66 A.L.R. 1402. While service on regular hours at a stated place generally begins at that place, there is always room for agreement by which the service may be taken to begin earlier or elsewhere. Service in extra hours or on special \n\n[288 U.S. 162, 170]\n\u00a0\n errands has an element of distinction which the employer may recognize by agreeing that such service shall commence when the employee leaves his home on the duty assigned to him and shall continue until his return. And agreement to that effect may be either express or be shown by the course of business. In such case the hazards of the journey may properly be regarded as hazards of the service, and hence within the purview of the Compensation Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the Supreme Court of the District is affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Podgorski v.

The officers and directors of the several corporations are the same, and the operations of the entire group are under a common control, so that, in substance, the business of all is carried on as though they constituted a single entity. Their lines are interconnected, and the electrical energy distributed by them is drawn from common sources. Appellant owns and operates an interconnected system in a territory comprising thirteen counties of the state, and sells and distributes electric current to approximately fifty cities and towns therein, including the inhabitants of the city of Martinsville, and also to a large number of industrial plants and customers outside the limits of such cities and towns. Appellant's system consists in the main of general transmission and transformation properties, and local distributing plants. Among other local plants it owns one in the city of Martinsville, which was built by former owners to supply that city and its inhabitants. In the hands of the original owners, this was a separate and complete plant, generating electrical energy as well as distributing it.\n Nearly all the electric current distributed by appellant is 'purchased' by it from one of the other affiliated corporations which has had in operation since 1924 an extensive and modern generating plant known as the 'Dresser Plant.' The combined needs of the affiliated corporations have so increased that for the year ending May 31, 1930, the total current used greatly exceeded that supplied by the Dresser Plant; and, in order to meet the increased demand, the affiliated system was connected with other large generating plants in Indiana and Ohio. In furtherance of the general plans of the affiliated group, appellant some years ago purchased the local electric plant at Martinsville and similar plants in many other \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n cities and towns within the thirteen counties above referred to.\n The Martinsville plant now is operated by appellant under an indeterminate permit from the state in virtue of the provisions of the state Public Utility Act. Burns' Ann. Ind. Stat. 1926,  12672 et seq. The current is fed into this plant from outside sources, principally from the Dresser Plant. Section 57 of the Public Utility Act (supra, section 12728) authorizes, among others, any municipal organization or any ten persons directly interested to make complaint to the Public Service Commission challenging any rates, tolls, etc., as unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory. Under that provision, on March 16, 1927, seventeen citizens of Martinsville, patrons of appellant, filed with the Public Service Commission of Indiana a petition seeking a reduction in electric rates, in which petition the city of Martinsville subsequently joined. At that time, and prior thereto, appellant had on file with the commission a schedule of rates applicable only in that city. After hearings, the commission made an order, effective as of February 1, 1929, reducing the rates for electric service to be charged and collected by appellant in Martinsville.\n Appellant, being dissatisfied with these rates and asserting that they were confiscatory, brought suit in the federal District Court for the Southern District of Indiana to enjoin the commission and others from enforcing the order. The city of Martinsville intervened and filed an answer in support of the rates. The court issued a temporary injunction and referred the case to a special master to hear and report the evidence to the court, together with his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The master heard the case and made a report of the evidence and of his findings of fact and conclusions thereon, to which appellant filed a large number of exceptions. The District Court, consisting of three judges ( section 266 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28,  380 (28 USCA  380)), approved the report of \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n the master and also made findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723), and thereupon delivered an opinion and entered a decree dissolving the temporary injunction, directing appellant to refund to its customers all amounts collected from them in excess of those which it would have collected under the schedule of rates complained of, and dismissing the bill for want of equity. 1 F.Supp. 106.\n Rate Base. The court below held that under the provisions of the state statute and in the light of the facts, not the entire property and system of appellant, but the city of Martinsville alone, should be treated as the unit for the purpose of determining the schedule of rates to be charged therein. The commission, as well as the master, had reached the same conclusion. Upon that basis, in fixing the value of the property used and useful for supplying electric current to the city, the court determined the value of the local property, to which it added that proportionate part of the value of the system property which it found to be fairly attributable to the Martinsville service.\n Appellant's chief contention is that its entire operating property should be taken as a unit in fixing the rate base, and that the action of the court in failing to do so deprived it of its property without due process of law.\n The Martinsville plant, prior to its acquisition by appellant, had produced within itself the whole of the electric current which its owners sold and distributed. That it then was a distinct unit for the purpose of fixing rates, if and when necessary, is, of course, clear. If the former owners had simply abandoned the use of the local generating appliances and purchased electric current from outside sources, the plant, for all purposes of rate making and regulation, would have remained a distinct and separate unit. It was this unit which appellant acquired; and, if appellant had continued to operate it as it then was \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 496]\n\u00a0\n being operated, that is to say, as a generating, as well as a distributing, plant for the entire electric current supplied to the city, the value of the plant with appropriate allowances for expenses, etc., would have continued to be the lawful rate base. But that method of operation was abandoned; and the question is whether, because the local plant now is interconnected with appellant's general distributing system and the electric current is drawn from outside sources, the city still may be treated as a separate unit for rate-making purposes.\n The answer primarily depends upon the meaning and application of the state Public Utility Act. The Supreme Court of Indiana thus far has not dealt with the question; but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, construing an act of that state essentially the same as the Indiana act, has determined that the Wisconsin commission was 'required to treat the municipality as a unit and to base its rate upon the cost to the utility of serving the individual municipality rather than the average cost of serving many distinct and scattered municipalities.' Eau Claire v. Wisconsin-Minnesota L. & P. Co., 178 Wis. 207, 220, 189 N.W. 476, 481. This result was deduced by the Wisconsin court (page 217 et seq., of 178 Wis., 189 N.W. 476, 480), not from any express provision of the statute, but from a consideration of many correlated statutory provisions and in the light of 'the history of commercial, economic, and political development.' That court pointed out that, when the Public Utility Act was enacted, each municipality was charged with the duty of furnishing public utility service and endowed with power to perform that duty; that each municipality had, and dealt with, an individual public utility; that there was no great development of power by a single utility serving numerous municipalities scattered far and wide; and hence that present day developments could not have been within the contemplation of \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 497]\n\u00a0\n the Legislature because they did not exist. The court stressed the fact that, notwithstanding the subsequent large developments of power which had come about since the passage of the utility law, there had been no modification of that law, which, in the light of conditions then existing, must have 'regarded the municipality as the entity on the one hand and the utility as the entity on the other, for the purpose of establishing just and reasonable rates and service.' Upon these considerations and others, the court reached the conclusion above stated.\n Since the Indiana act was patterned after the Wisconsin act with a like history and attended by similar circumstances, the court below felt warranted in following the decision of the Wisconsin court; and with that view we see no reason to disagree. Whether the method afforded by the state statute thus construed is in accordance with sound policy is a question with which we are not concerned. See Wabash, etc., Railway Co. v. Illinois, \n118 \nU.S. 557, 577\n, 7 S.Ct. 4; The Minnesota Rate Case, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 416\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas. 1916A, 18. The only question we are called upon to consider is whether, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the method is constitutional.\n Normally, the unit for rate-making purposes, we may assume, would be the entire interconnected operating property of a utility used and useful for the convenience of the public in the territory served, without regard to particular groups of consumers or local subdivisions. But conditions may be such as to require or permit the fixing of a smaller unit. Compare United Gas Co. v. R.R. Comm'n, \n278 \nU.S. 300\n, 49 S.Ct. 150; United Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, \n278 \nU.S. 322\n, 49 S.Ct. 157; The Minnesota Rate Case, supra, at pages 434-436 of 230 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 729; Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 U.S. 133\n, 148, et seq., 51 S.Ct. 65; Houston v. Southwestern Tel. Co., \n259 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 42 S.Ct. 486.\n The three cases last cited recognize that, where the business of a carrier or utility is both interstate and intra- \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 498]\n\u00a0\n state, the state rates for intrastate transportation or business must be determined by a separate consideration of the value of the property employed in the intrastate business. It is true that there such a separation is made necessary because a different government exercises the rate-making power in each of the two fields of regulation, and that situation is wanting here. Nevertheless, the cases furnish a helpful illustration in support of the application of a similar rule in the case now under review. Compare United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C.) 13 F. (2d) 510, 522; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission (D.C .) 14 F.(2d) 209, 223; Idaho Power Co. v. Thompson (D.C.) 19 F.(2d) 547, 571; and see International Ry. Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.) 1 F.Supp. 623, 626.\n In addition to what already has been said, it should be noted that appellant not only furnishes electric current to the fifty separate and unrelated towns and cities, in none of which the plant is used or useful for the rendition of service to any other town or city, but appellant also carries over its lines and delivers to others of the affiliated companies, as intercorporate transactions, varying portions of the entire current borne by its lines for subsequent distribution by the affiliated companies to their customers, including many towns and cities within their respective territories. This intermingling of the business and distributing activities of the several companies results in such elements of uncertainty in respect of the proper evaluation of appellant's participation therein that, standing alone, it would go far in the direction of justifying the rejection of the contention that the due process clause requires that appellant's entire distributing system should be included in the basic unit. In the light of all the facts and circumstances, we hold that an adjustment of rates for the municipality here served by appellant in accordance with the method adopted below is consonant with state law and immune from constitutional attack. \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 499]\n\u00a0\n Valuation and Expense Allowances. Appellant further contends that, assuming this method to be free from constitutional objection, the valuation put upon the property is so low as to result in confiscation. To meet this objection it is only necessary that there shall be brought into the rate base the value of all property of appellant which is in fact used and useful for supplying the electric current to the city. Manifestly, the local plants in other towns and cities bear no such relation to the Martinsville plant. As already shown, these various plants are separate and distinct from one another, and they were properly left out of the calculation. See Hardin-Wyandot Lighting Co. v. P.U. Comm., 118 Ohio St. 592, 601, 162 N.E. 262. The property values fixed by the commission and those fixed by the master and approved by the court differ to some degree, but not so materially as to affect the result. Upon the basis adopted, that is, first to value the local property and then add that proportionate part of the value of the general distributing system found to be fairly attributable to the Martinsville service, the figures finally arrived at by the master and the court were $102,947 for the local plant, and $101, 191 for the proportionate value of the other property, or a total of $204, 138. In arriving at the second figure, a proportionate part of the total value of the general system was allocated to Martinsville 'on the basis of the ratio of actual sales of Kw. H. to Martinsville and its consumers to the total sales of Kw. H. by plaintiff during the year 1929, that being the last calendar year before the date of the hearing.' This ratio was arrived at and supported by a variety of calculations, the results differing slightly, and upon these various calculations the court fixed 3. 3 per cent. as the fair ratio of the value to be allocated to Martinsville.\n We deem it unnecessary to repeat the details which led to the court's conclusion. The findings of the court and \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 500]\n\u00a0\n of the master are full and convincing, and give evidence of careful and thorough consideration. The deductions from the evidence and the calculations are of necessity more or less approximate (Utah Power & L. Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 190\n, 52 S.Ct. 548), but we find nothing in the record which casts a substantial doubt upon their essential fairness.\n Complaint is made that in determining the value of the Martinsville property no allowance was made for cost of financing. As the court below, however, pointed out, there was no evidence that such cost was incurred, or that it necessarily would be incurred in the event of reconstruction. This is also in accordance with the findings of the master. We see no reason to interfere. See Vincennes Water Supply Co. v. Public Service Commission (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 5, 9.\n The commission, the master, and the court below all rejected as exorbitant the claim of appellant for an allowance of $60,000 rate case expenses, and allowed the sum of $4,000 to be amortized as an operating charge over a period of ten years. This action, it is contended, was arbitrary and without basis in the evidence. While there is evidence in the record that appellant expended the amount claimed, there is further evidence justifying the conclusion that a large part of the expenditure was made for the additional purpose of securing data relating to a merger proceeding with which the Martinsville rates are in no way connected. There is also evidence that the appraisal covered the local property in the other municipalities, which, as we have seen, are without relation to the Martinsville distribution. From a consideration of all the evidence, it seems clear that the refusal to allow, as against the Martinsville plant, the entire $60,000, was well founded. That being so, it became necessary to fix that part of the sum reasonably chargeable as an expense of the Martinsville rate case. The commission and the master, who heard the evidence and were familiar with all the details, \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 501]\n\u00a0\n reached the same conclusion as to the amount. While it may be true that even upon the view taken a larger sum than $4,000 might well have been allowed, we find nothing sufficiently definite in the record to require us so to determine, or to call for a disturbance of the amount fixed.\n Rate of Return. The court below found that a rate of return of 7 per cent. was adequate. The evidence is conflicting. Witnesses for appellees estimated that 7 per cent. was sufficient. The testimony for appellant was to the effect that to take care of bonds, debt discounts, borrowed money, and stock dividends a return of 7 per cent. was sufficient; but that, in order to accumulate a surplus and make it easier to finance the company, the rate of return should be not less than 8 per cent. Appellant's balance sheets show that on January 1, 1929, it had an accumulated surplus of $1, 074,739.71, and, at the end of that year, a surplus of $1,257,884.64, as compared with a total stock and funded debt liability of about $4,500,000. The record, as already stated, also shows that appellant is a subsidiary of the Central Indiana Power Company by which it is owned and financed; its securities having been taken directly by that company without any intervening agency. The power company also owns and finances the other affiliated corporations in the same way. It is reasonable to conclude that appellant is in a more favorable financial condition than if it were a disconnected enterprise.\n It is true, as appellant points out, that in United Railways v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 251\n, 252 S., 50 S.Ct. 123, 126, this court held that a rate of return for a street railway of less than 7.44 per cent. was confiscatory, saying that sound business management required that, after paying all expenses of operation, etc., 'there should still remain something to be passed to the surplus account'; and that a rate of return which did not admit of that being done was not sufficient to enable a utility to maintain its credit and raise money \n\n[287 U.S. 488, 502]\n\u00a0\n for the proper discharge of its public duties. Many cases were cited tending to show that a return of 7 1\/2 per cent. or even 8 per cent. might be necessary, but it was said (pages 249, 250 of 280 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 123, 125) that no rule could be laid down which would apply uniformly to all sorts of utilities. 'What may be a fair return for one may be inadequate for another, depending upon circumstances, locality, and risk.' A street railway company, compelled to meet the growing competition of private automobiles, public omnibuses, and other motor carriers, well might sustain such losses of revenue because of the decreased number of passengers carried, as to require a larger rate of return than would be required by an electric utility company like appellant, which not only enjoys a practical monopoly in the field where its services are rendered, but whose financial structure, it fairly may be assumed, is greatly strengthened by its affiliations and by the interested support of the parent company to which it belongs. On the whole we are unable to conclude that a 7 per cent. rate of return, under the facts here disclosed, is so low as to be confiscatory. See Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, at pages 160-161 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 65.\n Moreover it appears, as the master and the lower court found, that, if the rates complained of had been in force during the period beginning January 1, 1929, and ending May 31, 1930, the return would have been much in excess of 7 per cent. on the value fixed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWASHINGTON v. SUPERIOR COURT(1933)\nNo. 663\nArgued: April 19, 1933Decided: May 8, 1933\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. \n\n[289 U.S. 361, 362]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank E. Holman and Elmer E. Todd, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. Parker W. Kimball, of Spokane, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final decree of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington (169 Wash. 688, 15 P.(2d) 660) refusing a writ of prohibition to prevent the further prosecution of an action pending in the Superior Court of Spokane County.\n Bond & Goodwin & Tucker, a Delaware corporation, qualified in 1926 to do business in the state of Washington pursuant to the applicable statute. 1 One Duncan Shaw, of Seattle, was appointed resident agent for the acceptance of service of process, as the law required. In 1929 the company withdrew from the state, ceased to transact business there, and filed formal notice of withdrawal with the Secretary of State. The corporation was dissolved in accordance with the laws of Delaware, but the appointment of Shaw as statutory agent was never revoked. In 1929 he removed to California. In 1932 one Monroe commenced a civil action in the Superior Court, naming Bond & Goodwin & Tucker as one of the defendants, and instructed the sheriff to serve the summons and complaint upon the Secretary of State. The return and proof of service show that this was done by handing the papers to an assistant secretary. Neither the summons and complaint nor any copy of them, nor any notice touching the same, were forwarded to Bond & Goodwin & Tucker by the Secretary of State or any one else. No other form of service was made. \n\n[289 U.S. 361, 363]\n\u00a0\n The appellant appeared specially and moved to quash the service. The motion was overruled. Thereupon application was made to the Supreme Court of the state for a writ of prohibition. The present appeal is from the judgment refusing the writ.\n The appellant urges that the statute denies the due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The first contention rests upon the fact that substituted service upon the Secretary of State is validated without any requirement that he shall give the defendant notice of the pendency of the action; the second is bottomed upon the circumstance that a different procedure requiring the secretary of State to send notice to defendant's is prescribed as respects suits against domestic corporations having no office within the state, and foreign insurance companies.\n The statute requires a foreign corporation to appoint and register a resident agent empowered to accept service of process in any action or suit pertaining to the property, business or transactions of such corporation within the state. The agent may be changed by filing with the Secretary of State a new appointment. The portion of the act which gives rise to the present controversy is: '... in the event such foreign corporation shall withdraw from this state and cease to transact business therein it shall continue to keep and maintain such agent within this state upon whom service of process, pleadings and papers may be made, until the statute of limitations shall have run against anyone bringing an action against said corporation, which accrued prior to its withdrawal from this state. In case said corporation shall revoke the authority of its designated agent after its withdrawal from this state and prior to the time when the statutes of limitations would have run against causes of action accruing against it, then in that event service of process, pleadings and papers in such actions may be made upon the secre- \n\n[289 U.S. 361, 364]\n\u00a0\n tary of state of the state of Washington, and the same shall be held as due and sufficient service upon such corporation.'\n We are told that when the appellant appointed Shaw and registered him as its agent to accept service, it had complied with all conditions requisite to its lawful transaction of business within the state; that the provision for another sort of substituted service in the event of Shaw's removal from the state, or the revocation of his appointment without registration of another agent, is permissible only if it requires notice to the defendant; that by qualifying as a foreign corporation appellant did not consent to the arbitrary and unconstitutional condition that it might be cast in judgment without notice of suit. We think, however, that the position is unsound.\n The state need not have admitted the corporation to do business within its borders. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 407. Admission might be conditioned upon the requirement of substituted service upon a person to be designated either by the corporation, St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 \nU.S. 350, 356\n, 1 S.Ct. 354, or by the state itself, Mutual Reserve Ass'n v. Phelps, \n190 \nU.S. 147, 158\n, 23 S.Ct. 707, or might, as here, be upon the terms that if the corporation had failed to appoint or maintain an agent service should be made upon a state officer. American Railway Express Co. v. Royster Co., \n273 \nU.S. 274, 280\n, 47 S.Ct. 355. The provision that the liability thus to be served should continue after withdrawal from the state afforded a lawful and constitutional protection of persons who had there transacted business with the appellant. American Railway Express Co. v. Kentucky, \n273 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 47 S.Ct. 353.\n It has repeatedly been said that qualification of a foreign corporation in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry into the state constitutes an assent on its \n\n[289 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n part to all the reasonable conditions imposed. Lafayette Insurance Company v. French, supra, page 408 of 18 How.; St. Clair v. Cox, supra, page 356 of 106 U.S., 1 S.Ct. 354; Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Spratley, \n172 \nU.S. 602, 614\n, 19 S.Ct. 308; Old Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v. McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8, 22\n, 27 S.Ct. 236; Commercial Mutual Accident Co. v. Davis, \n213 \nU.S. 245, 254\n, 29 S. Ct. 445. It is true that the corporation's entry may not be conditioned upon surrender of constitutional rights, as was attempted in the cases on which the appellant relies. Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S.Ct. 188, 21 A.L.R. 186; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426\n, 46 S.Ct. 331; Frost Trucking Co. v.

And for this reason a state may not exact arbitrary and unreasonable terms respecting suits against foreign corporations as the price of admission. Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490\n, 47 S.Ct. 678. But the statute here challenged has no such operation. It goes no further than to require that the corporation may be made to answer just claims asserted against it according to law. By appointing a new agent when Shaw ceased to be a resident of the state the appellant could have assured itself of notice of any action. The statute informed the company that if it elected not to appoint a successor to Shaw the Secretary of State would by law become its agent for the purpose of service. The burden lay upon the appellant to make such arrangement for notice as was thought desirable. There is no denial of due process in the omission to require the corporation's agent to give it such notice.\n The power of the state altogether to exclude the corporation, and the consequent ability to condition its entrance into the state, distinguishes this case from those involving substituted service upon individuals, Flexner v. Farson, \n248 \nU.S. 289\n, 39 S.Ct. 97; Wuchter v. Pizzutti, \n276 \nU.S. 13\n, 48 S.Ct. 259, 57 A.L.R. 1230, whose entrance into a state may render them amenable to action there, only if the statute providing for substituted \n\n[289 U.S. 361, 366]\n\u00a0\n service incorporates reasonable provision for giving the defendant notice of the initiation of litigation. Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S.Ct. 632. The fact that appellant qualified to do business in the state and complied with the registration statute also distinguishes cases of attempted service on a state official pursuant to a statute with which the defendant corporation had never complied, and where at the time of suit it had removed from the state and was transacting no business there. Old Wayne Mutual Life Ass'n v. McDonough, supra; Consolidated Flour Mills Co. v. Muegge, 127 Okl. 295, 260 P. 745; Id., \n278 \nU.S. 559\n, 49 S.Ct. 17.\n Appellant suggests that it was denied due process because the act demands service upon the Secretary of State, whereas the summons and complaint were handed to an assistant secretary. The state court has held the service sufficient since the assistant secretary in contemplation of law was the secretary. This construction of the statute raises no federal question.\n Complaint is made because other legislation validates substituted service on domestic corporations having no office in Washington, and on foreign insurance companies registered to do business therein, only if the Secretary of State sends notice to the defendant (Rem. Comp. Stat. Wash.  227, 7044). It is said that a failure to make similar provision with respect to other foreign corporations deprives the appellant of the equal protection of the laws. The contention is without merit. The legislature was entitled to classify corporations in this respect, and a mere difference in the method of prescribing how substituted service should be accomplished works no unjust or unequal treatment of the appellant. Compare National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71\n, 43 S.Ct. 32.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3854, Remington's Compiled Statutes 1922. \n\n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELCH v.

L. Welch Company, a Minnesota corporation, engaged in the grain business. The company was adjudged an involuntary bankrupt, and had a discharge from its debts. Thereafter the petitioner made a contract with the Kellogg Company to purchase grain for it on a commission. In order to re-establish his relations with customers whom he had known when acting for the Welch Company and to solidify his credit and standing, he decided to pay the debts of the Welch business so far as he was able. In fulfillment of that resolve, he made payments of substantial amounts during five successive years. In 1924, the commissions \n\n[290 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n were $18,028.20, the payments $3,975.97; in 1925, the commissions $31,377. 07, the payments $11,968.20; in 1926, the commissions $20,925.25, the payments $12,815.72; in 1927, the commissions $22,119.61, the payments $7, 379.72; and in 1928, the commissions $26,177.56, the payments $11,068.25. The Commissioner ruled that these payments were not deductible from income as ordinary and necessary expenses, but were rather in the nature of capital expenditures, an outlay for the development of reputation and good will. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the action of the Commissioner ( 25 B.T.A. 117), and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 63 F.(2d) 976. The case is here on certiorari.\n'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions ... all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.' Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 269,  214, 26 U.S.C.  955, 26 USCA  955(a)(1); Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 26,  214, 26 U.S.C. App.  955, 26 USCA  955(a)(1); Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 799,  23( a), 26 USCA  2023(a); cf. Treasury Regulations 65, Arts. 101, 292, under the Revenue Act of 1924, and similar regulations under the acts of 1926 and 1928\n\n\n\n We may assume that the payments to creditors of the Welch Company were necessary for the development of the petitioner's business, at least in the sense that they were appropriate and helpful. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. He certainly thought they were, and we should be slow to override his judgment. But the problem is not solved when the payments are characterized as necessary. Many necessary payments are charges upon capital. There is need to determine whether they are both necessary and ordinary. Now, what is ordinary, though there must always be a strain of constancy within it, is none the less a variable affected by time and place \n\n[290 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n and circumstance. Ordinary in this context does not mean that the payments must be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will have to make them often. A lawsuit affecting the safety of a business may happen once in a lifetime. The counsel fees may be so heavy that repetition is unlikely. None the less, the expense is an ordinary one because we know from experience that payments for such a purpose, whether the amount is large or small, are the common and accepted means of defense against attack. Cf. Kornhauser v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 145\n, 48 S.Ct. 219. The situation is unique in the life of the individual affected, but not in the life of the group, the community, of which he is a part. At such times there are norms of conduct that help to stabilize our judgment, and make it certain and objective. The instance is not erratic, but is brought within a known type.\n The line of demarcation is now visible between the case that is here and the one supposed for illustration. We try to classify this act as ordinary or the opposite, and the norms of conduct fail us. No longer can we have recourse to any fund of business experience, to any known business practice. Men do at times pay the debts of others without legal obligation or the lighter obligation imposed by the usages of trade or by neighborly amendities, but they do not do so ordinarily, not even though the result might be to heighten their reputation for generosity and opulence. Indeed, if language is to be read in its natural and common meaning (Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 52 S.Ct. 211; Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, \n286 \nU.S. 319, 327\n, 52 S.Ct. 568), we should have to say that payment in such circumstances, instead of being ordinary is in a high degree extraordinary. There is nothing ordinary in the stimulus evoking it, and none in the response. Here, indeed, as so often in other branches of the law, the decisive distinctions are those of degree and not of kind. \n\n[290 U.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n One struggles in vain for any verbal formula that will supply a ready touchstone. The standard set up by the statute is not a rule of law; it is rather a way of life. Life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the riddle.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue resorted to that standard in assessing the petitioner's income, and found that the payments in controversy came closer to capital outlays than to ordinary and necessary expenses in the operation of a business. His ruling has the support of a presumption of correctness, and the petitioner has the burden of proving it to be wrong. Wickwire v. Reinecke, \n275 \nU.S. 101\n, 48 S.Ct. 43; Jones v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 38 F. (2d) 550, 552. Unless we can say from facts within our knowledge that these are ordinary and necessary expenses according to the ways of conduct and the forms of speech prevailing in the business world, the tax must be confirmed. But nothing told us by this record or within the sphere of our judicial notice permits us to give that extension to what is ordinary and necessary. Indeed, to do so would open the door to many bizarre analogies. One man has a family name that is clouded by thefts committed by an ancestor. To add to this own standing he repays the stolen money, wiping off, it may be, his income for the year. The payments figure in his tax return as ordinary expenses. Another man conceives the notion that he will be able to practice his vocation with greater ease and profit if he has an opportunity to enrich his culture. Forthwith the price of his education becomes an expense of the business, reducing the income subject to taxation. There is little difference between these expenses and those in controversy here. Reputation and learning are akin to capital assets, like the good will of an old partnership. Cf. Colony Coal & Coke Corp. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 52 F.(2d) 923. For many, they are the only tools with which to hew a path- \n\n[290 U.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n way to success. The money spent in acquiring them is well and wisely spent. It is not an ordinary expense of the operation of a business.\n Many cases in the federal courts deal with phases of the problem presented in the case at bar. To attempt to harmonize them would be a futile task. They involve the appreciation of particular situations, at times with border-line conclusions. Typical illustrations are cited in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The decree should be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ordinary expenses: Commissioner v. People's Pittsburgh Trust Co. (C.

UNITED STATES(1933)\nNo. 335\nArgued: December 6, 1932Decided: January 16, 1933\n\n\n\n Mr. Seth W.\nRichardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edgar Watkins, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent. \n\n[288 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of February 13, 1929, c. 182, 45 Stat. 1166, provides: 'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any claimant who has heretofore filed with the Secretary of the Interior within the time and manner provided by existing law a claim under said Acts generally known as the War Minerals Acts (Fortieth) Statutes, page 1272, and its amendments) may within one year from the date of the passage and approval hereof petition the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to review the final decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon any question of law which has arisen or which may hereafter arise in the adjustment, liquidation, and payment of his claim under said Acts, but the decision of the Secretary of the Interior on all questions of fact shall be conclusive and not subject to review by any court.'\n Proceeding under the quoted provision, respondent corporation presented a petition to the Supreme Court-February 18, 1929-which alleged that while endeavoring to develop supplies of pyrites it suffered allowable losses through expenditures for salaries of executive officers, for taxes, for legal services, also by depreciation of property taken over upon request of the Department and that the Secretary had erroneously decided as matter of law that it was not entitled to reimbursement therefor. The prayer asked review and determination of points of law upon which the Secretary's decision turned and a writ of mandamus directing him to take jurisdiction and allow whatever he might ascertain upon the facts to be just and equitable.\n March 15, 1929, the Secretary made a commendably frank response to the rule to show cause. He admitted \n\n[288 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n disallowance of the specified items 'as shown by copies of the various decisions of the Secretary of the Interior and recommendations of the War Minerals Relief Commissioners marked, respectively, Exhibits A, B, C, D and E, attached to the response,' which 'are hereby referred to and made a part hereof.' And he further said: 'Under the act of February 13, 1929, Public No. 728, 70th Congress, this court is vested with jurisdiction to review such questions of law as may have been decided in the disposition of petitioner's said claim by the Secretary of the Interior, and respondent makes no objection to, but on the other hand invites, a review of such questions. The petition for review presents the sole question for which petitioner prays a review herein, and it is assumed that he court will confine its review to the single question raised.' On the same day a demurrer to the response was interposed.\n September 24, 1929, by permission of the court, the Secretary withdrew the original response and presented a substituted answer. The order permitting this appears in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[288 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n The writings designated 'Exhibits A, B, C, D and E,' by the original response were attached to the substituted answer. They show departmental action relative to the matter in controversy, June 5, 1919, August 8, 1919, October 15, 1919, September 22, 1922, and September 28, 1922. Nothing affirmatively points to other important action.\n Exhibit 'D'-'Memorandum' by Assistant Commissioner Briar-recommends rejection of all the contested items and states the reasons therefor. Secretary Fall-Exhibit E (September 28, 1922)-accepted this recommendation and made the suggested award.\n The item based on purchase price of equipment and machinery was rejected because 'to allow for its purchase would be in fact to allow for the purchase of property.' The Secretary's decision rested upon an erroneous conclusion as to a point of law which arose in the adjustment of respondent's claim. His view of the law thus announced, and long held by the Department, met disapproval in Wilbur v. Vindicator, etc. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 231\n, 52 S.Ct. 113. The respondent was and is entitled to an adjustment of this and other items as the Secretary 'shall determine to be just and equitable' under the law as here construed.\n Payments for salaries to the officers, who were also respondent's sole stockholders, were disallowed upon the view that, as matter of law, recovery on account of them would amount to forbidden profits to owners. Whether the sole stockholders of a corporation, acting as officers and managers, should be allowed anything by way of salary or compensation depends on the peculiar facts of each case. There is no positive legal inhibition; it is not matter of law. \n\n[288 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n The Briar report does not state why the item for legal services was disallowed-whether because of some undisclosed facts or upon some theory of the law. The latter appears the more probable. Certainly, it cannot be said that any rule of law inhibited payment necessary or proper for legal services.\n Here petitioner presents no objection to the ruling below concerning taxes.\n Counsel for respondent correctly states the issue presented to the trial court: 'Are the losses suffered for expenditures for the items involved here within the provisions of the Act of October 5, 1918, as amended and supplemented by the Act of March 2, 1919?' And, 'with the issue as stated, the only showing required is that a claim for such losses was made and that such claim was disallowed because of the belief of the petitioner that the law did not permit such allowance.'\n The record discloses that the Secretary's action was based upon improper construction and application of the law. The matter must go back for final adjustment upon consideration of the facts.\n We have not overlooked the argument submitted for petitioner that the five exhibits above referred to were not parts of the substituted and amended answers. Nor the assertions in these answers that the items in question were rejected upon consideration of the facts. The exhibits show what was really done and the reasons therefor. Conflicting general statements in the answers must yield. And it seems proper to add that if these answers had been more carefully prepared, with purpose to disclose to the court all relevant facts and circumstances, unnecessary difficulties would have been avoided.\n The final judgment of the Supreme Court recites that the cause came on to be heard 'upon petition as amended and answer thereto as amended together with Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E to said answer, and the demurrer,' \n\n[288 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n etc. The exhibits were correctly treated as parts of the amended answer. But a requirement that the parties recast the pleadings would have been proper and helpful.\n The petition here for certiorari does not mention the conflicting view in respect of the exhibits or deal with them as parts of the record. It failed adequately to advise us concerning the real situation. But to avoid possible misunderstanding, it has seemed best to retain jurisdiction rather than to dismiss the writ because improvidently granted.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals ( 59 F.(2d) 887) authorized a writ of mandamus directing that the Secretary of the Interior should treat the disputed items in the respondent's claim as permissible as matter of law and to proceed with their final adjustment upon consideration of all the facts. We approve this action and affirm the judgment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'In accordance with the stipulation of counsel for the respective parties in this case, dated September 2, 1929, and duly filed herein, it is this 24th day of September, 1929, adjudged and ordered:\n'1.

MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE(1933)\nNo. 513\nArgued: February 13, 1933Decided: March 13, 1933\n\n\n\n\n[289 U.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. L. Rawls and George Weems Williams, both of Baltimore, Md . (Mr. William L. Marbury, Jr., of Baltimore, Md., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lawrence B. Fenneman and R. E. Lee Marshall, both of Baltimore, Md. (Mr. Hector J. Ciotti, Asst. City Sol., of Baltimore, Md., on the brief), for respondents Mayor, etc., of Baltimore.\n Mr. Roscoe C. Rowe, of Annapolis, Md., for respondents Mayor, etc., of Annapolis.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy in these cases hinges upon the validity of a statute of Maryland, adopted by the General Assembly in June, 1931, whereby the property of a particular railroad was made exempt from taxation. Acts of 1931, c. 497.\n For an understanding of the merits there is need that the statute be quoted in full: \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n 'An Act to exempt the railroad property of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad Company, or so much thereof as may be used for railroad purposes by said company, its receiver, successors and assigns, from all State taxes and charges, including contributions to the cost of construction of railroad crossings made or to be made under the authority of the State Roads Commission, and from all county and city taxes and charges in the nature of a tax for the years during which the property is so used, but not exceeding two years beginning January 1, 1931\n\n\n'Whereas, The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad Company did not in the year 1930 earn its operating charges, and it is of the utmost importance for the welfare of the State and particularly the communities served by said railroad, that the operation of said railroad be continued, and\n\n'Whereas, It is in the judgment of the General Assembly of Maryland a wise and sound public policy to encourage the continued operation of said railroad by the exemption herein provided:\n\n'Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That the railroad property of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad Company, or so much thereof as may be used for railroad purposes by said company, its receiver, successors and assigns, be exempt from all State taxes and charges, including contributions to the cost of construction of railroad crossings made or to be made under the authority of the State Roads Commission, and from all county and city taxes and charges in the nature of a tax for the years during which the property is so used, but not exceeding two years beginning January 1, 1931.\n\n'Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That this Act shall take effect June 1, 1931.' \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n At the passage of this act, the Washington, Baltimore & Annapolis Electric Railroad Company was in the hands of a receiver, appointed in January, 1931, by the Federal District Court. For ten years preceding the receivership the gross receipts from its business had progressively declined. In 1930 the total revenues derived from the operation of its line were $1,347,967.03, and the operating expenses $1,191,897.32. These expenses were exclusive of taxes and fixed charges, such as interest on its debts. There was a funded debt of more than nine million dollars and an unsecured debt of nearly a million. In 1930, 3,247,534 passengers had traveled on the road, which supplied the only rail service to Annapolis, the capital of the state. Large public interests were involved in keeping the service going.\n\n The mayor and city council of Baltimore, and the mayor, counselor, and aldermen of the city of Annapolis, municipal corporations, challenged the validity of the exemption, and filed proofs of claim with the receiver for taxes overdue. The claim of the city of Baltimore was for real property taxes on the terminals and rights of way, for personal property taxes on the cars, and for franchise taxes or charges under a municipal ordinance. The claim of the city of Annapolis was for taxes on real property and for local taxes or charges owing for the franchise. The District Court upheld the validity of the statute, and disallowed the claims. Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit the orders were reversed upon the ground that the statute was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and under several provisions of the Constitution of the state. 61 F.(2d) 374. Writs of certiorari were granted by this court. \n287 \nU.S. 594\n, 53 S.Ct. 222, 77 L. Ed. --. The writ in No. 513 brings up the claim filed with the receiver by the City of Baltimore; the writ in No. 514 brings up the claim of the City of Annapolis. \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n 1. There is error in the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the statute of Maryland creating this exemption is a denial to the respondents of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n A municipal corporation, created by a state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges or immunities under the Federal Constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.

Corporation, \n280 \nU.S. 145, 156\n, 50 S.Ct. 71.\n\n 2. \nThere is error in the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the statute is invalid under the Constitution of Maryland.\n Several provisions of that Constitution are invoked by the respondents. They will be considered in succession.\n\n\n (a)\n The statute is not repugnant to article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, wherein it is provided: 'That the levying of taxes by the poll is grievous and oppressive and ought to be prohibited; that paupers ought not to be assessed for the support of the Government; that the General Assembly shall, by uniform rules, provide for separate assessment of land and classification and subclassifications of improvements on land and personal property, as it may deem proper; and all taxes thereafter provided to be levied by the State for the support of the general State Government, and by the counties and by the City of Baltimore for their respective purposes, shall be uniform as to land within the taxing district, and uniform within the class or sub-class of improvements on land and personal property which the respecting taxing powers \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n may have directed to be subjected to the tax levy; yet fines, duties or taxes may properly and justly be imposed, or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community.'\n The courts of Maryland hold that the rule of uniformity established by these provisions does not forbid the creation of reasonable exemptions in furtherance of the public good. Baltimore v. B. & O.R.R. Co., 6 Gill, 288, 48 Am.Dec. 531; State v. B. & O.R.R. Co., 48 Md. 49; State v. B. & O. R.R. Co., 127 Md. 434, 96 A. 636; State v. N.C.R.R. Co., 44 Md. 131; State v.

East Tennessee, V. & G.R.R. Co., \n130 \nU.S. 637, 641\n, 9 S.Ct. 640. It does not even prohibit an exemption in favor of an individual as distinguished from one for the benefit of the members of a class. All that it exacts in respect of the narrower exemption is the presence of a relation, fairly discernible, between the good of the individual and the good of the community. There must be something more than an arbitrary preference of one among many. Baltimore City v. Starr Church, 106 Md. 281, 287, 288, 67 A. 261.\n Furtherance of the public good is written over the face of this statute from beginning to end as its animating motive. 'It is of the utmost importance for the welfare of the State and particularly the communities served by said railroad, that the operation of said railroad be continued.' 'It is in the judgment of the General Assembly' that 'to encourage the continued operation' of the road by the grant of an exemption will be to give heed to the promptings of 'a wise and sound public policy.' The \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n exemption is to be confined to that part of the property of the company, which is used for railroad purposes, is to continue only so long as the property is so used, and is to expire in any event at the end of the two years beginning in January, 1931. It is not the function of a court to determine whether the public policy that finds expression in legislation of this order is well or ill conceived. Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 609\n, 23 S.Ct. 168; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267\n, 24 S.Ct. 638; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 389 S., 52 S.Ct. 581. The judicial function is exhausted with the discovery that the relation between means and end is not wholly vain and fanciful, an illusory pretense. Within the field where men of reason may reasonably differ, the Legislature must have its way. Otis v. Parker, supra. Nor in marking out that field will a court be forgetful of presumptions that help to fix the boundaries. 'As underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute.' O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 132. There has been no departure from that principle in the judgments of the highest court of Maryland. Wampler v. LeCompte, 159 Md. 222, 150 A. 455; Id., \n282 \nU.S. 172, 175\n, 51 S.Ct. 92.\n We are told that the signs of an arbitrary preference are written on the statute because the exemption is confined to this particular insolvent when it might have been extended to all other insolvents engaged in a like business. There is nothing to show that any Maryland railroad other than this one was in the hands of a receiver. The assailants of the statute have the burden of proving everything essential to their case. Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n235 \nU.S. 23, 25\n, 35 S.Ct. 2; Wampler v. LeCompte, supra. But the result will be no different if other insolvents be assumed. The public policy that made it wise in the judgment of \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n the Legislature to help this particular railroad and keep its business going may have failed altogether in respect of any other railroad, solvent or insolvent. Here was a line carrying millions of passengers, and supplying the only railroad service between the capital of the state and its most populous city. The rescue of such a road might be dictated by the public interest when a road in some other territory might wisely be abandoned to its fate.\n We are told that the statute is not to be distinguished in principle from the one considered by the highest court of Maryland in the case of the Starr Church, and there condemned as arbitrary. City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, 106 Md. 281, 67 A. 261. But we think the distinctions are many and obvious. A religious corporation, the Starr Church, had received a gift of wharf property which it leased for profit. The General Assembly passed an act exempting the wharf from taxes so long as it continued in the ownership of the church. The exemption for other churches was confined to a place of worship and a parsonage. The statute did not say that the new exemption was designed to promote the comfort or well-being of the community at large. For all that appeared no such interests were involved. The statute said no more than this, that the exemption would be 'a great relief and benefit to said religious body,' which was singled out for privileges denied to any other. This preference for one, with no profession of a purpose to advance the common weal and with nothing in the situation to indicate that such a purpose would be served, is the evil that the court denounced.\n We are told that the many cases upholding an exemption to a railroad at the time of its formation have no bearing upon this exemption which was granted later on. A charter, so it is argued, is a contract, or becomes one when accepted. There is thus a quid pro quo. A privilege conferred thereafter is nothing more than a gratuity, \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n and hence an arbitrary preference irrespective of its motive. But this is to misread the cases and misconceive the rationale back of them. The charter exemption to a railroad does not gain validity from the circumstance that a charter is a contract. If the exemption is a valid one, the contract may mean that there will be no power of revocation, though exemptions not contractual are terminable at will. Gordon v. Appeal Tax Court, 3 How.(U.S.) 133. Even this difference will be absent if there is a reservation by the state of the power to repeal or change. Northern Central Ry. Co. v. Maryland, \n187 \nU.S. 258\n, 23 S.Ct. 62, affirming State of Maryland v. Northern Central Ry. Co., 90 Md. 447, 45 A. 465. Revocable or irrevocable, the contract will not give validity to what would otherwise be void. Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 254\n, 21 S.Ct. 73; Duluth & I.R.R.R. Co. v. St. Louis County, \n179 \nU.S. 302\n, 21 S.Ct. 124; and cf. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 14 Ann.Cas. 560; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 \nU.S. 372, 375\n, 376 S., 39 S.Ct. 117, 9 A.L.R. 1420. To see that this is so we have only to inquire what the consequence would be if a charter exemption were to be given to a mere private corporation, conducted for profit solely like any other business enterprise. Charter or no charter, the exemption would not stand. City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, supra.\n The policy that sustains an exemption in order to keep a crippled railroad going is precisely the same as the one that sustains an exemption to set it going at the start. In the one case as in the other, the state maintains the highways upon which its people are dependent for their economic and social life. Cole v. La Grange, \n113 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 5 S.Ct. 416. It is idle to say that a railroad, when once it has been organized, is under a duty to go on, and hence that its distress is not important for any one except itself. Science has wrought her wonders, but the time is not yet here when trains will run under the impulsion of duty \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 45]\n\u00a0\n without more. There is room, indeed, for question whether even the duty is so absolute as the respondents' argument assumes. Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R.R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 44 S.Ct. 247. Certain it is, in any event, that operation may end with the consent of the public service commission when the earnings are inadequate. Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (Bagby's Ed.) 1929 supplement, art. 23,  380; Benson v. Public Service Commission, 141 Md. 398, 118 A. 852. Nor is there need to show a probability of utter cessation or abandonment. Service is likely to be inefficient and even dangerous if operation is continued in the face of an increasing deficit. The state has an interest in seeing to it that railroads shall be run, but an interest also in how they shall be run.\n The General Assembly, weighing these and other considerations, has found them adequate to justify a temporary exemption from the burdens of taxation. Nothing in the Constitution of Maryland or in the decisions of her courts enables us to say that there has been a clear abuse of power. We may not nullify for doubt alone. There must be something near to certainty. We do not reach it here.\n\n\n (b)\n The statute is not repugnant to article 3,  33, of the Maryland Constitution, wherein it is said that 'the General Assembly shall pass no special law for any case for which provision has been made by an existing general law.'\n The highest court of Maryland has considered this provision, and defined its meaning and effect. The Police Pension Cases, 131 Md. 315, 101 A. 786; City of Baltimore v. United Railways & Electric Co., 126 Md. 39, 94 A. 378; City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, supra; Littleton v. City of Hagerstown, 150 Md. 163, 132 A. 773; O'Brian Co. v. County Commissioners of Baltimore County, 51 Md. 15; Hodges v. Baltimore Union Pass Ry. Co., 58 Md. 603. There has been need, now and again, to \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 46]\n\u00a0\n develop close distinctions. Our endeavor in what follows is to extract the essence of the decisions and to give effect to it as law.\n Time with its tides brings new conditions which must be cared for by new laws. Sometimes the new conditions affect the members of a class. If so, the correcting statute must apply to all alike. Sometimes the new conditions affect one only or a few. If so, the correcting statute may be as narrow as the mischief. The Constitution does not prohibit special laws inflexibly and always. It permits them when there are special evils with which existing general laws are incompetent to cope. The special public purpose will then sustain the special form. City of Baltimore v. United Railways Co., supra. The problem in last analysis is one of legislative policy, with a wide margin of discretion conceded to the lawmakers. Only in cases of plain abuse will there be revision by the courts. City of Baltimore v. United Railways Co., supra, at page 52 of 126 Md., 94 A. 378. If the evil to be corrected can be seen to be merely fanciful, the injustice or the wrong illusory, the courts may intervene and strike the special statute down. City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, supra. If special circumstances have developed, and circumstances of such a nature as to call for a new rule, the special act will stand. The Police Pension Cases, supra.\n The distinction is neatly pointed by comparing two decisions. In City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, supra, the court condemned a special act as a merely arbitrary departure from the rule of uniform taxation. Declaration of Rights, art. 15. It held at the same time that the act was void under another section of the Constitution (article 3,  33) because no evil had arisen, no circumstances had developed, to give even colorable grounds of reason for the adoption of a special rule. The Police Pension Cases, supra, show the picture from a different angle. There were general laws upon the statute books providing for the grant of pensions to members of the police force, not \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 47]\n\u00a0\n including matrons. A matron was dismissed for physical disability after many years of service. The Legislature, impressed by the hardship of her position, passed a special act for her relief. The court took the view that here was a special case not provided for or considered in an existing general law, and so upheld what had been done. See, also, O'Brian & Co. v. County Commissioners of Baltimore County; Hodges v. Baltimore Union Pass Ry. Co., applying a like rule.\n\n\n (c)\n The statute is not repugnant to article 11A, the home rule article, of the Maryland Constitution: 'Sec. 4. From and after the adoption of a charter under the provisions of this Article by the City of Baltimore or any County of this State, no public local law shall be enacted by the General Assembly for said City or County on any subject covered by express powers granted as above provided. Any law so drawn as to apply to two or more of the geographical subdivisions of this State shall not be deemed a Local Law, within the meaning of this Act. The term 'geographical sub-division' herein used shall be taken to mean the City of Baltimore or any of the Counties of this State.'\n The act of exemption is so drawn as to apply to two or more geographical subdivisions of the state, i.e., to Baltimore and Annapolis. It is thus within the powers expressly reserved to the General Assembly.\n\n 3. \nThere is error in the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the franchise payments due to the two cities under municipal ordinances wherein the payments are characterized as 'taxes' are not 'charges in the nature of a tax' within the meaning of the statute.\n They were plainly so intended.\n\n 4. \nWe have assumed, without deciding, that the respondents, though without standing to invoke the protection of the Federal Constitution, will be heard to complain of a violation of the Constitution of the state. \n\n[289 U.S. 36, 48]\n\u00a0\n Their standing for that purpose, at least in the state courts, is a question of state practice (Columbus & Greenville Ry. Co. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96, 99\n, 51 S.Ct. 392; Braxton County Court v. W. Va., \n208 \nU.S. 192, 197\n, 198 S., 28 S.Ct. 275; Stewart v. Kansas City, \n239 \nU.S. 14, 16\n, 36 S.Ct. 15), as to which the federal courts do not exercise an independent judgment.\n The Maryland decisions proceed on the assumption that municipal corporations assailing a statute of exemption or other special legislation have an interest in the controversy which entities them to be heard (City of Baltimore v. Starr Church, supra; City of Baltimore v. Allegany County Com'rs, 99 Md. 1, 57 A. 632), though the reports do not show that their interest was questioned.\n In the absence of any argument to the contrary in behalf of the petitioner, we make the same assumption here.\n The judgments are reversed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff is, and since November 11, 1929, has been, a judge of the Court of Claims of the United States. Since his entry upon the duties of his office, and until June 30, 1932, he received a salary at the rate of $ 12,500 per annum, as fixed by the Act of December 13, 1926, c. 6,  1, 44 Stat. 919 (28 USCA  241). Since that date he has been paid at the rate of $ 10,000 per annum under a ruling of the Comptroller General of the United States. Compare O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516\n, 53 S.Ct. 740, 77 L.Ed. --, decided this day. \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n The Legislative Appropriation Act of June 30, 1932 (chapter 314, 47 Stat. 382, 402) in part provides:\n'Sec. 107. (a) During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933-...\n\n'(5) the salaries and retired pay of all judges (except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office), if such salaries or retired pay are at a rate exceeding $10,000 per annum, shall be at the rate of $10,000 per annum.' 5 USCA  673 note.\n\n The Comptroller General, as the basis for his ruling, took the view that the Court of Claims is a 'legislative' court, and not a 'constitutional' court created under article 3,  1, of the Constitution, which provides:\n'The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.'\n\n On February 8, 1933, this suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount of the difference between the statutory rate of $12,500, and the smaller amount p id under the ruling of the Comptroller General. The suit was brought by plaintiff in the court of which he is a member, because, as it is averred, no other court or remedy was open to him. Plaintiff's petition rests upon the contention that the Court of Claims is a constitutional court, created in virtue of the power of Congress to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court, whose judges 'shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n during their Continuance in Office.' The government demurred to the petition, upon the ground that the judges of the Court of Claims are not judges of an 'inferior court' within the meaning of that constitutional provision. The Court of Claims, without passing upon the demurrer, certified to this court the following questions, upon which it desires instructions, under section 3(a) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 939 (28 USCA  288(a):\n'I. Does Section 1, Article III, of the Constitution of the United States apply to the Court of Claims and forbid a reduction of the compensation of the Judges thereof during their continuance in office?\n\n'II. Does the provision of Section 2, Article III, of the Constitution, wherein it is stated that 'The Judicial Power shall extend ... to controversies to which the United States shall be a party', apply to the Court of Claims, and does this provision authorize the creation and establishment of that Court?\n\n'III. Can the compensation of a Judge of the Court of Claims be lawfully diminished during his continuance in office?'\n\n In the O'Donoghue Case, supra, we have discussed in some detail the purposes which led the framers of the Constitution to incorporate in that instrument the provisions in respect of the permanent tenure of office and the undiminishable character of the compensation of the judges; and have pointed out that the judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia plainly come within the spirit and reason of the compensation provision, and must be held to fall within its intent, unless that conclusion is precluded by other considerations. Much of what is there said may also be said in respect of the Court of Claims. It is a court of great importance, dealing with claims against the United States, which, in the aggregate, amount to a vast sum every year. The questions which it considers call for \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n the exercise of a high order of intelligence, learning, and ability. The preservation of its independence is a matter of public concern. The sole function of the court being to decide between the government and private suitors, a condition, on the part of the judges, of entire dependence upon the legislative pleasure for the tenure of their offices and for a continuance of adequate compensation during their service in office, to say the least, is not desirable.\n But these considerations, though obvious enough, are not sufficient, standing alone, to support a conclusion that the Court of Claims comes within the reach of the judicial article in respect of tenure of office and compensation. The integrity of such a conclusion must rest, not upon its desirability, but upon its conformity with the provisions of the Constitution.\n For reasons which are set out in the O'Donoghue opinion, the courts of the territories are legislative courts, while the superior courts of the District of Columbia are constitutional courts. The Court of Claims differs so essentially from both that its status, in respect of the question under consideration, must be determined from an entirely different point of view.\n That court was first established by the Act of February 24, 1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612, entitled, 'An Act to establish a Court for the Investigation of Claims against the United States.' It was to consist of three judges, to hold their offices during good behavior. The act provided that the court should hear and determine certain claims against he government of the United States, and also all claims which might be referred to the court by either House of Congress. The court was to keep a record of its proceedings in each case and make a report to Congress for the action of that body. By the Act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, 12 Stat. 765, the court was for the first time authorized to render final judgments, from which an appeal was allowed in certain cases. Section 14 of that act ( 12 Stat. 768) provided: \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n 'That no money shall be paid out of the treasury for any claim passed upon by the court of claims till after an appropriation therefor shall be estimated for by the Secretary of the Treasury.'\n Because of that provision, it was held in Gordon v. United States, 2 Wall. 561, that under the Constitution no appellate jurisdiction could be exercised by this court. The reasons for that conclusion are stated in an undelivered opinion written by Chief Justice Taney, and, with approval, published for the first time in \n117 U.S. 698\n, 699. It was there stated that, in view of section 14, the power of the Court of Claims and of this court was merely to certify their opinion to the Secretary of the Treasury; and whether the claim was paid in accordance with the opinion depended not on the decision of either court, but upon the future action of the Secretary and of Congress. So far as the Court of Claims is concerned, it was said there is no objection to these provisions, since Congress undoubtedly may establish tribunals to examine testimony and decide in the first instance upon the validity and justice of any claim against the United States, subject to the supervision and control of Congress or the head of an executive department. Such authority was likened to that of an auditor or comptroller, and the circumstance that the tribunal was called a court and its decisions called judgments could not alter its character or enlarge its power. But in respect of this court different principles were said to apply, since this court is created by the Constitution and represents one of the three great divisions of power in the government, 'to each of which the Constitution has assigned its appropriate duties and powers, and made each independent of the other in performing its appropriate functions. The power conferred on this court is exclusively judicial, and it cannot be required or authorized to exercise any other.' The conclusion, therefore, was that Congress could neither \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 564]\n\u00a0\n confer nor impose on this court the authority or duty of hearing or determining an appeal from such a tribunal, nor authorize or require this court to express an opinion on a case where its judicial power could not be exercised and where its judgment would not be final and conclusive upon the rights of the parties.\n These observations, without adverting to others which have been disavowed, have since met with the uniform approval of this court.\n The decision of the Gordon Case in 2 Wallace was announced on March 10, 1865. At the next session of Congress section 14 was repealed. Chapter 19, 14 Stat. 9. Since that time it never has been doubted that Congress may authorize an appeal to this court from a final judgment or decree of the Court of Claims, United States v. Jones, \n119 \nU.S. 477, 478\n, 479 S., 7 S. Ct. 283; In re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 13 S.Ct. 577; Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, \n272 U.S. 533\n, 536 et seq., 47 S.Ct. 186, or that the judgment of this court rendered on such appeal constitutes a final determination of the matter. United States v. O'Grady, 22 Wall. 641, 647. It is equally certain that the judgments of the Court of Claims, where no appeal is taken, under existing laws are absolutely final and conclusive of the rights of the parties unless a new trial be granted by that court as provided by law. Id. Indeed, as appears from the cases already cited and others, such finality and conclusiveness must be assumed as a necessary prerequisite to the exercise o appellate jurisdiction by this court.\n In 1887 Congress gathered together the preceding acts in respect of suits against the government in what is called the Tucker Act. Chapter 359, 24 Stat. 505. By that act the Court of Claims was given jurisdiction to hear and determine, among other matters, all claims upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, 'in respect of which claims \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 565]\n\u00a0\n the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable.' Section 1. By section 2 of the act, as amended and supplemented by section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, concurrent jurisdiction was conferred upon the federal District Courts in all matters as to which the Court of Claims had jurisdiction, where the amount involved did not exceed $10,000. U.S. Code, title 28,  41(20), 28 USCA  41(20).\n By these provisions it is made plain that the Court of Claims, originally nothing more than an administrative or advisory body, was converted into a court, in fact as well as in name, and given jurisdiction over controversies which were susceptible of judicial cognizance. It is only in that view that the appellate jurisdiction of this court in respect of the judgments of that court could be sustained, or concurrent jurisdiction appropriately be conferred upon the federal District Courts. The Court of Claims, therefore, undoubtedly, in entertaining and deciding these controversies, exercises judicial power, but the question still remains-and is the vital question-whether it is the judicial power defined by article 3 of the Constitution.\n That judicial power apart from that article may be conferred by Congress upon legislative courts, as well as upon constitutional courts, is plainly apparent from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in American Insurance Company et al. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 546, dealing with the territorial courts. 'The jurisdiction,' he said, 'with which they are invested, is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States.' That is to say (1) that the courts of the territories (and, of course, other legislative courts) are invested with judicial power, but (2) that this power is not conferred by the third article of the Constitution, but by Congress in the execution of other provisions of that \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 566]\n\u00a0\n instrument. The validity of this view is borne out by the fact that the appellate jurisdiction of this court over judgments and decrees of the legislative courts has been upheld and freely exercised under acts of Congress from a very early period, a practice which can be sustained, as already suggested, only upon the theory that the legislative courts possess and exercise judicial power-as distinguished from legislative, executive, or administrative power-although not conferred in virtue of the third article of the Constitution.\n The authority to naturalize aliens has been vested in the courts from the beginning of the government; and it cannot be doubted that in discharging this function the courts exercise judicial power. But the courts of the states, with the acquiescence of all the departments of the federal government, have also exercised the same jurisdiction during this long period of time, and their authority to do so must be regarded as conclusively established. Levin v. United States (C.C.A.) 128 F. 826, 830, 831. In that case, Judge Sanborn, in a very carefully drawn opinion, pointed out that Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power granted by section 1 and defined by section 2 of the third article of the Constitution in courts not ordained and established by itself;* that the judicial power there granted and defined necessarily extended only to the tr al of the classes of cases named in section 2; but that these sections neither expressly nor impliedly prohibited Congress from conferring judicial power upon other courts. 'Thus,' he says, 'the authority granted \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 567]\n\u00a0\n to territorial courts to hear and determine controversies arising in the territories of the United States is judicial power. But it is not a part of that judicial power granted by section 1, and defined by section 2, of article 3 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, under the constitutional grant to Congress of power to 'make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory ... belonging to the United States' (article 4 ,  3), that body may create territorial courts not contemplated or authorized by article 3 of the Constitution, and may confer upon them plenary judicial power, because the establishment of such courts and the bestowal of such authority constitute appropriate means by which to exercise the congressional power to make needful rules respecting the territory belonging to the United States. ... The grant by the Congress of the United States of the judicial power to admit aliens to citizenship, and to hear and decide the various questions which do not arise in the cases specified in article 3 of the Constitution, but which a proper exercise of the powers granted by that instrument to the executive or to the legislative department of the Government requires to be judicially decided, was neither expressly nor impliedly prohibited by that article. The congressional power to make such a grant, and to vest judicial authority in state courts and officers, in such cases, exists by virtue of the established rule that the grant of a power to accomplish an object is a grant of the authority to select and use the appropriate means to attain it.'\n If the power exercised by legislative courts is not judicial power, what is it? Certainly it is not legislative, or executive, or administrative power, or any imaginable combination thereof.\n With the foregoing principles in mind we come, then, to a consideration of the crucial question here involved, Is the judicial power exercised by the Court of Claims \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 568]\n\u00a0\n vested in virtue of the third article of the Constitution so as to bring its judges within the protection of that article as to tenure of office and compensation?\n It must be conceded at the threshold that this court in several cases has expressed, more or less irrelevantly, its opinion in the affirmative. Thus, in United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 145, after reference to the legislation with respect of the Court of Claims, the view is expressed that such court was thus constituted one of those inferior courts which Congress authorizes. In United States v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n98 U.S. 569\n, 603, it was said that under the authority of article 3 Congress had created the District Courts, the Circuit Courts, and the Court of Claims, and vested each of them with a defined portion of the judicial power found in the Constitution. In Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 386\n, 22 S.Ct. 650, 655, the court, after directing attention to the fact that the United States could not be sued without its consent, said that with its consent it might be sued, in which event the judicial power of the United States extended to such a controversy, and added: 'Indeed, the whole jurisdiction of the court of claims rests upon this proposition.' See, also, Kansas v. United States, \n04 \nU.S. 331, 342\n, 27 S.Ct. 388; United States v. Louisiana, \n123 \nU.S. 32, 35\n, 8 S.Ct. 17.\n None of these cases involved the question now under consideration, and the expressions referred to were clearly obiter dicta, which, as said by Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 'may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision.'\n On the other hand, this court, in Ex parte Bakelite Corp'n, \n279 \nU.S. 438\n, 49 S.Ct. 411, 414, in a fully considered opinion holding that the Court of Customs Appeals was a legislative court, definitely took the opposite view. The status of the Court of Claims is there discussed at length, and the conclusion reached that it likewise is a legislative court. 'It \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 569]\n\u00a0\n was created, and has been maintained,' we there said, 'as a special tribunal to examine and determine claims for money against the United States. This is a function which belongs primarily to Congress as an incident of its power to pay the debts of the United States. But the function is one which Congress has a discretion either to exercise directly or to delegate to other agencies.' The opinion then points out that the Court of Claims is, and always has been, as Congress declared at the outset, 'a court for the investigation of claims against the United States'; that none of the matters made cognizable by the court inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination, but, on the contrary, 'all the matters which are susceptible of legislative or executive determination and can have no other save under and in conformity with permissive legislation by Congress.' It is noted as significant that the act constituting the court dispenses with trial by jury, a provision which was distinctly upheld in spite of the Seventh Amendment in McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n. With respect to the status of the court, the opinion concludes (pages 454, 455 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 411, 414):\n'While what has been said of the creation and special function of the court definitely reflects its status as a legislative court, there is propriety in mentioning the fact that Congress always has treated it as having that status. From the outset Congress has required it to give merely advisory decisions on many matters. Under the act creating it all of its decisions were to be of that nature. Afterwards some were to have effect as binding judgments, but others were still to be merely advisory. This is true at the present time. A duty to give decisions which are advisory only, and so without force as judicial judgments, may be laid on a legislative court, but not on a constitutional court established under article 3.\n\n'In Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, Append., and again in In re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222\n, 13 S.Ct. 577, this Court plainly was of \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 570]\n\u00a0\n opinion that the Court of Claims is a legislative court specially created to consider claims for money against the United States, and on that basis distinctly recognized that Congress may require it to give advisory decisions. And in United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 144-145, this court described it as having all the functions of a court, but being, as respects its organization and existence, undoubtedly and completely under the control of Congress.\n\n'In the present case the court below regarded the recent decision in Miles v. Graham, \n268 \nU.S. 501\n, 45 S.Ct. 601, as disapproving what was said in the cases just cited, and holding that the Court of Claims is a constitutional rather than a legislative court. But in this Miles v. Graham was taken too broadly. The opinion therein contains no mention of the cases supposed to have been disapproved; nor does it show that this Court's attention was drawn to the question whether that court is a statutory court or a constitutional court. In fact, as appears from the briefs, that question was not mooted. Such as w re mooted were considered and determined in the opinion. Certainly the decision is not to be taken in this case as disturbing the earlier rulings or attributing to the Court of Claims a changed status. Webster v. Fall, \n266 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 45 S.Ct. 148.\n\n'That court was said to be a constitutional court in United States v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n98 \nU.S. 569, 602\n, 603 S.; but this statement was purely an obiter dictum, because the question whether the Court of Claims is a constitutional court or a legislative court was in no way involved. And any weight the dictum, as such, might have is more than overcome by what has been said on the question in other cases where there was need for considering it.'\n\n It is true that the foregoing views expressed in the Bakelite Case were likewise not strictly necessary to the \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 571]\n\u00a0\n decision; but, unlike previous and contrary expressions of opinion on the same subject, they are elucidated and fortified by reasoning and illustration, and, moreover, are the result of a careful review of the entire matter. It is also true that in the O'Donoghue Case, supra, we have rejected the dictum in the Bakelite Case as to the status of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, but a reference to the discussion in the O'Donoghue Case will make apparent the difference in force between the dictum there involved and the one here involved. In addition to this, whatever may be said in respect of the obiter character of the opinion as to the Court of Claims, the status of the Court of Customs Appeals, as a purely legislative court, was definitely adjudged. And neither by brief nor in argument here is any serious attempt made to differentiate, in respect of the question now being considered, between the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs Appeals; and we have been unable to discover any ground for such a differentiation.\n Further reflection tends only to confirm the views expressed in the Bakelite opinion as to the status of the Court of Customs Appeals, and we feel bound to reaffirm and apply them. And, giving these views due effect here, we see no escape from the conclusion that, if the Court of Customs Appeals is a legislative court, so also is the Court of Claims. We might well rest the present case upon that determination; but must not do so without considering another view of the question, which seems to find support in some expressions of this court, namely, that, when the United States consents to be sued, the judicial power of article 3 at once attaches to the court upon which jurisdiction is conferred in virtue of the clause which in comprehensive terms extends the judicial power to 'Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.' \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 572]\n\u00a0\n In Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra, at pages 384, 386 of 185 U.S., 22 S. Ct. 650, 654, it was said:\n'This is a controversy to which the United States may be regarded as a party. It is one therefore to which the judicial power of the United States extends. It is, of course, under that clause, a matter of indifference whether the United States is a party plaintiff or defendant. It could not fairly be adjudged that the judicial power of the United States extends to those cases in which the United States is a party plaintiff, and does not extend to those cases in which it is a party defendant. ...\n\n'While the United States as a government may not be sued without its consent, yet with its consent it may be sued, and the judicial power of the United States extends to such a controversy.'\n\n See, also, Kansas v. United States, supra, at page 342 of 204 U.S., 27 S.Ct. 388.\n This conception of the application of the judicial article of the Constitution, which at first glance seems plausible, will be found upon examination and consideration to be entirely fallacious.\n We first direct attention to the carefully chosen words of section 2, cl. 1, art. 3. By that clause the judicial power is extended to all cases in law and equity arising u der the Constitution, etc.; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; and to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Then the comprehensive word 'all' is dropped, and the enumeration continues in terms to apply to controversies (but not to 'all') to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states, etc. The use of the word 'all' in some cases, and its omission in others, cannot be regarded as accidental, under the rule stated in an early case, Holmes v. Jennison et al., 14 Pet. 540, 570-571, 614, 618 Appx., and ever since fully accepted, that: 'In expounding the \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 573]\n\u00a0\n constitution of the United States, every word must have its due force, and appropriate meaning; for it is evident from the whole instrument, that no word was unnecessarily used, or needlessly added. The many discussions which have taken place upon the construction of the constitution, have proved the correctness of this proposition; and shown the high talent, the caution, and the foresight of the illustrious men who framed it. Every word appears to have been weighed with the utmost deliberation, and its force and effect to have been fully understood.' See, also, Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 151\n, 47 S.Ct. 21.\n The significance of the use of the word 'all' in some instances and its omission in others is commented upon by Mr. Justice Story in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 333-336, and it is there suggested that the word 'all,' which is used in the earlier part of section 2 of the judicial article, was dropped in the latter ex industria, and that from this difference of phraseology, perhaps, a difference of constitutional intention may with propriety be inferred. See, also, 2 Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.) p. 458,  1674 et seq.\n We are here immediately concerned only with that provision of article 3 which extends the judicial power to 'Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.' Literally, this includes such controversies, whether the United States be party plaintiff or defendant; but in the light of the rule, then well settled and understood, that the sovereign power is immune from suit, the conclusion is inadmissible that the framers of the Constitution intended to include suits or actions brought against the United States. And here the omission to qualify 'controversies' by the word 'all,' as in some other instances, becomes peculiarly suggestive.\n The Judiciary Act of 1789 (1Stat. 73) has always been regarded as practically contemporaneous with the Constitution, and, as \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 574]\n\u00a0\n such, of great value in expounding the meaning of the judicial article of that instrument. Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, supra, at pages 351-352 of 1 Wheat.; Cohens v. Virginia, supra, at page 420 of 6 Wheat.; Bors v. Preston, \n111 U.S. 252\n, 256-257, 4 S.Ct. 407; Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 297\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370. Section 11 of that act, chapter 20, 1 Stat. 73, 78, confers jurisdiction on the Circuit Courts, under specified conditions, of suits 'where ... the United States are plaintiffs, or petitioners. ...' And in Cohens v. Virginia, supra, at pages 411-412 of 6 Wheat., Chief Justice Marshall said: 'The universally received opinion is, that no suit can be commenced or prosecuted against the United States; that the judiciary act does not authorize such suits.'\n The judicial clause also extends the judicial power (again omitting the word 'all') to controversies 'between a State and citizens of another State.' The question as to whether this authorized a suit against a state by a citizen of another state was considered in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419. Opinions were delivered seriatim, four justices, then constituting a majority, agreeing that such a suit could be maintained. Justice Iredell dissented in a vigorous opinion. He pointed out that prior to the adoption of th Constitution a sovereign state, without its consent, was not amenable to suit at the hands of an individual, and concluded that this rule had not been abrogated by the constitutional provision, in spite of the generality of its language. The immediate response to this decision was the submission and adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which provides:\n'The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.'\n\n In terms this amendment includes only citizens or subjects of another or of a foreign state, not citizens of the \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 575]\n\u00a0\n state called to account. And in December, 1884, a suit was brought in a federal Circuit Court against the State of Louisiana by a citizen of that state to recover the amount of certain unpaid coupons annexed to an issue of state bonds. Hans v. State of Louisiana (C.C.) 24 F. 55. The Circuit Court dismissed the suit upon the ground that the state could not be sued without its consent. The case then came to this court on error, and the judgment was affirmed. Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S.Ct. 504. The precise question considered and determined was, Does the judicial power of the United States extend to a case arising under the Constitution or laws thereof, brought against a state by one of its own citizens? Mr. Justice Bradley delivered the opinion of the court. Plaintiff in error contended that, being a citizen of Louisiana, the Eleventh Amendment presented no obstacle to his suit, since that amendment prohibits suits against a state only when brought by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of a foreign state. This court, conceding that the amendment so reads, said that, if there were no other reason or ground for abating the suit, it might be maintainable, with the anomalous result that a state might be sued in the federal courts by its own citizens, though it could not be sued for a like cause of action by citizens or subjects of another or foreign state. But, it said, such a result would be no less startling and unexpected than was the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, which in effect had been overruled by the Eleventh Amendment; and the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Iredell, which was characterized as able, was distinctly approved. As opposed to the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, attention also was called to the utterances of Hamilton and others, pending the adoption of the Constitution, to the precise contrary. Hamilton repudiated the suggestion that the citizens of one state would be enabled, under the original draft of \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 576]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution, to prosecute suits against another state in the federal courts. He said (page 13 of 134 U.S., 10 S.Ct. 504, 506):\n'It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amendable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the states, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. ... The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretension to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.'\n\n The words of Madison and of Marshall in the Virginia Convention were quoted, the former to the effect that the only operation which the provision of the judicial clause then under discussion could have was that, 'if a state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen (of another state), it must be brought before the federal court'; and those of Marshall: 'I hope that no gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court. ... It is not rational to suppose that the sovereig power should be dragged before a court. The intent is to enable states to recover claims of individuals residing in other states . ... I see a difficulty in making a state defendant which does not prevent its being plaintiff.' This court then declared (page 14 of 134 U.S ., 10 S.Ct. 504, 506), that 'looking at the subject as Hamilton did, and as Mr. Justice Iredell did, in the light of history and experience and the established order of things, the views of the latter were clearly right?; and that the views expressed by them applied as well to the then pending case as to that of Chisholm v. Georgia. Refusing to adhere to the mere letter of the Eleventh Amendment, the court said that to do so would be to strain \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 577]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution to a construction never imagined or dreamed of, and then added: 'The truth is, that the cognizance of suits and actions unknown to the law, and forbidden by the law, (that is to say, as applied to the present case, of suits against the United States) was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States.'\n This language applies with equal force to suits against a state and those brought against the United States. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is fully discussed in Hans v. Louisiana, and in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Iredell in Chisholm v. Georgia. We need not repeat that discussion here. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the court in Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 \nU.S. 349, 353\n, 27 S.Ct. 526, 527, tersely said: 'A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception of obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.' It is enough to say that in the light of the settled and unvarying rule upon that subject it is not reasonably possible to assume that it was within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution that the words, 'Controversies to which the United States shall be a party,' should include controversies to which the United States shall be a party defendant. That clause must be construed, in accordance with the practical construction put upon it by the first Judiciary Act, as though it read, 'controversies to which the United States shall be a party plaintiff or petitioner;' and, thus read, controversies to which the United States may be statute be made a party defendant, at least as a general rule, lie wholly outside the scope of the judicial power vested by article 3 in the constitutional courts. See United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621, 645\n, 646 S., 12 S.Ct. 488.\n The view, therefore, that, when congressional consent has been given to the maintenance of suits against the \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 578]\n\u00a0\n United States, it ipso facto becomes a matter of indifference whether the United States is a party plaintiff or defendant, because the judicial power as defined in article 3 immediately and automatically extends to such suits, must be rejected. It cannot be reconciled with the settled principle that, where a controversy is of such a character as to require the exercise of the judicial power defined by article 3, jurisdiction thereof can be conferred only on courts established in virtue of that article, and that Congress is without power to vest that judicial power in any other judicial tribunal, or, of course, in an executive officer, or administrative or executive board, since, to repeat the language of Chief Justice Marshall in American Insurance Company et al. v. Canter, supra, 'they are incapable of receiving it.'\n The rule is stated in Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brock, 447, 20 Fed. Cas. pages 242, 254, No. 11,558, by Chief Justice Marshall, sitting on the circuit. That case involved the legality of an arrest by virtue of a distress warrant issued from the Treasury Department, under an act of Congress which provided for the issuing of such a warrant by the agent of the Treasury against all military and naval officers, etc., ch rged with the disbursement of the public moneys, who should fail to pay and settle their accounts with the Treasury Department. Under the act the Treasury Department had settled the account and ascertained the sum due to the government. The act was attacked as unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the first section of the third article of the Constitution. As preliminary to the determination of the question, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'If this ascertainment of the sum due to the government, and this issuing of process to levy the sum so ascertained to be due, be the exercise of any part of the judicial power of the United States, the law which directs it, is plainly a violation of the first section of the third article of the constitution, which declares, that 'the judicial power \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 579]\n\u00a0\n of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as congress shall from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour.' The judicial power extends to 'controversies to which the United States shall be a party.' The persons who are directed by the act of congress to ascertain the debt due from a delinquent receiver of public money, and to issue process to compel the payment of that debt, do not compose a court ordained and established by congress, nor do they hold offices during good behaviour. Their offices are held at the pleasure of the president of the United States. They are, consequently, incapable of exercising any portion of the judicial power, and the act which attempts to confer it, is absolutely void.'\n\n In Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284, it was declared to be beyond the power of Congress either to 'withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty'; or, on the other hand, to 'bring under the judicial power a matter which, from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination. At the same time there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.' See, also, United States v. Duell, \n172 \nU.S. 576, 582\n, 589 S., 19 S.Ct. 286.\n Since all matters made cognizable by the Court of Claims are equally susceptible of legislative or executive determination, Bakelite Case, supra, pages 452, 458 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 411, they are, of course, matters in respect of which there is no constitutional right to a judicial remedy, United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S.Ct. 464; and the authority to inquire \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 580]\n\u00a0\n into and decide them may constitutionally be conferred on a nonjudicial officer or body. In United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 48, this court, referring to an act of Congress (passed in pursuance of a treaty), directing that judges of the territorial courts of Florida should examine and adjudge certain claims against the United States for losses suffered as the result of military operations, with power of review reserved to the Secretary of the Treasury, held that the power conferred, although judicial in nature, was nothing more than the power ordinarily given by law to a commissioner appointed to adjust claims under a treaty. 'A power of this description,' it was said, 'may constitutionally be conferred on a Secretary as well as on a commissioner. But (it) is not judicial in either case, in the sense in which judicial power is granted by the Constitution to the courts of the United States.'\n The view under discussion-that, Congress having consented that the United States may be sued, the judicial power defined in article 3 at once attaches to the court authorized to hear and determin the suits-must then be rejected, for the further reason, or, perhaps, what comes to the same reason differently stated, that it cannot be reconciled with the limitation fundamentally implicit in the constitutional separation of the powers, namely, that a power definitely assigned by the Constitution to one department can neither be surrendered nor delegated by that department, nor vested by statute in another department or agency. Compare Springer v. Philippine Islands, \n277 \nU.S. 189, 201\n, 202 S., 48 S.Ct. 480. And since Congress, whenever it thinks proper, undoubtedly may, without infringing the Constitution, confer upon an executive officer or administrative board, or an existing or specially constituted court, or retain for itself, the power to hear and determine controversies respecting claims against the United States, it follows indubitably that such power, in whatever guise or by whatever agency exercised, is no \n\n[289 U.S. 553, 581]\n\u00a0\n part of the judicial power vested in the constitutional courts by the third article. That is to say, a power which may be devolved, at the will of Congress, upon any of the three departments, plainly is not within the doctrine of the separation and independent exercise of governmental powers contemplated by the tripartite distribution of such powers. Compare Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n, 190-191.\n We find nothing which militates against the foregoing views in the requirement that the Court of Claims, in cases properly brought before it in respect of property expropriated in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, must award just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, or in the provision of the Tucker Act (U.S. Code, title 28,  252) requiring the court in cases brought against the government also to consider and decide set-offs and other claims made by the government against the petitioner and award judgment accordingly. In the former case the requirement is one imposed by the Constitution and equally applicable whether jurisdiction be exercised by a legislative court or a constitutional court; and the latter is simply a provision which the claimant must accept as a condition upon which he may avail himself of the privilege of suing the government in the special court organized for that purpose. McElrath v. United States, supra at page 440 of 102 U.S..\n From whatever point of view the question be regarded, the conclusion is inevitable that the Court of Claims receives no authority and its judges no rights from the judicial article of the Constitution, but that the court derives its being and its powers and the judges their rights from the acts of Congress passed in pursuance of other and distinct constitutional provisions. The questions propounded will be answered accordingly.\n Question No. 1, No.\n Question No. 2, No.\n Question No. 3, Yes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The lack of authority in Congress to devolve any part of the judicial power defined by article 3 upon courts other than those created by itself must not be confused with its authority to vest jurisdiction in respect of some cases in courts whose judicial power is otherwise derived. Compare Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 U.S. 275\n, 278-280, 17 S.Ct. 326; Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 U.S. 130\n, 136, et seq.; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 55, et seq., 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44. \n\n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYARBOROUGH v. YARBOROUGH(1933)\nNo. 14\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1933\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Stephen Nettles, of Greenville, S.C., and R. E. Whiting, of Columbia, S.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas M. Lyles, of Spartanburg, S.C., for respondent. \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On August 10, 1930, Sadie Yarborough, then sixteen years of age, was living with her maternal grandfather, R. D. Blowers, at Spartansburg, S.C. Suing by him as guardian ad litem, she brought this action in a court of that state to require her father, W. A. Yarborough, a resident of Atlanta, Ga., to make provision for her education and maintenance. She alleged 'that she is now ready for college and is without funds and, unless the defendant makes provision for her, will be denied the necessities of life and an education, and will be dependent upon the charity of others.' \n1\n Jurisdiction was obtained by attachment of defendant's property. Later he was served personally within South Carolina.\n In bar of the action, W. A. Yarborough set up, among other defences, a judgment entered in 1929 by the superior court of Fulton county, Ga., in a suit for divorce brought by him against Sadie's mother. He alleged that by the judgment the amount thereafter to be paid by him for Sadie's education and maintenance had been determined; that the sum so fixed had been paid; and that the judgment had been fully satisfied by him. He claimed that in Georgia the judgment was conclusive of the matter here in controversy; that, having been satisfied, it relieved him, under the Georgia law, of all obligation to provide for the education and maintenance of their minor child; and that the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution (art. 4,  1) required the South Carolina court to give to that judgment the same effect in this proceeding which it has, and would have, in Georgia. The trial court denied the claim; ordered W. A. Yarborough to pay to the grandfather, as trustee, $50 monthly for Sadie's education and support; and to pay \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n $300 as fees of her counsel. It directed that the property held under the attachment be transferred to R. D. Blowers, trustee, as security for the performance of the order. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. A petition for rehearing was denied, with opinion. 168 S.C. 46, 166 S.E. 877. This Court granted certiorari. \n289 \nU.S. 718\n, 53 S. Ct. 688\n\n\n For some time prior to June, 1927, W. A. Yarborough, his wife, and their daughter Sadie had lived together at Atlanta, Ga., where he then was, and ever since has been, domiciled. In that month Sadie's mother left Atlanta for Hendersonville, N.C., where she remained during the summer. Sadie joined her there, after a short stay at a camp. In September, 1927, while they were at Hendersonville, W. A. Yarborough brought, in the superior court for Fulton county, at Atlanta, suit against his wife for a total divorce on the ground of mental and physical cruelty. Mrs. Yarborough filed an answer and also a cross-suit in which she prayed a total divorce, the custody of the child, and 'that provision for permanent alimony be made for the support of the respondent and the minor child above mentioned (Sadie), and for the education of said minor child.' An order, several times modified, awarded to the wife the custody of Sadie, and as temporary alimony sums 'for the support and maintenance of herself and her minor daughter Sadie.' Hearings were held from time to time at Atlanta. At some of these, Sadie (and also her grandfather) was personally present. But she was not formally made a party to the litigation; she was not served with process; and no guardian ad litem was appointed for her therein.\n'Two concurring verdicts favoring a total divorce to plaintiff having been rendered,'2 a decree of total divorce, \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n with the right in each to remarry, was entered on June 7, 1929; the wife was ordered to pay the costs; and jurisdiction of the case 'was retained for the purpose of further enforcement of the orders of the court theretofore passed.' \n3\n Among such orders was the provision for the maintenance and education of Sadie here relied upon as res judicata. It was entered on January 17, 1929 (after the rendition of the first verdict), and provided:\n\n'Parties, plaintiff and defendant, having personally and in writing, consented hereto, and their respective counsel of record having likewise in writing consented hereto.\n\n'It is considered, ordered and adjudged that the following settlement be hereby made the order of the Court, the same being in full settlement of temporary and pemranent alimony in said case, and in full settlement of all other demands of every nature whatsoever between the parties.'\n\n Then followed, after describing certain mortgages:\n'It is considered, ordered and adjudged that said mortgages be, and they are hereby transferred, sold and assigned by the plaintiff, W. A. Yarborough to the defendant, Mrs. Susie B. Yarborough to the extent of One Thousand, Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,750.00), and the plaintiff, W. A. Yarborough, does hereby transfer, sell and assign said mortgages to R. D. Blowers, of Spartansburg, South Carolina, as Trustee for Sadie Yarborough, minor daughter of plaintiff and defendant, to the extent \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n of One Thousand, Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,750.00). ... The amount to be thus received by R. D. Blowers as Trustee for Sadie Yarborough, minor daughter of plaintiff and defendant, shall be expended by him in his discretion for the benefit of the minor child, including her education, support, maintenance, medical attention and other necessary items of expenditure.\n\n'Upon compliance with this order by the plaintiff, he shall be relieved of all payments of alimony and counsel fees, in said case, except that the payment due under the prior order of Court of the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for the month of January, 1929, (to Mrs. Yarborough for the support of hereself and Sadie) shall be by him paid, in addition to the other amounts hereinbefore named. ...\n\n'The provisions of the order of the Court heretofore entered fixing the times and the places when plaintiff, W. A. Yarborough, shall have the right to visit and have with him, out of the presence of the defendant, the said Sadie Yarborough, minor daughter of plaintiff and defendant, are hereby continued in force.'\n\n W. A. Yarborough complied fully with this order.\n By the law of Georgia, it is the duty of the father to provide for the maintenance and education of his child until maturity. \n4\n Willful abandonment of a minor child, leaving it in a dependent condition, is a misdemeanor. \n5\n The mere loss of custody by the father does not relieve him of his obligation to provide for maintenance and education, even where the custody passes to the mother pursuant to a decree of divorce. \n6\n If the father fails to make such provision, any person (including a divorced wife) \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n who furnishes necessaries of life to his minor child may recover from him therefor, unless precluded by the terms of the decree in the divorce suit or otherwise. \n7\n In case of total divorce, the court is authorized to make, by its decree, final or permanent provision for the maintenance and education of children during minority, and thus fix the extent of the father's obligation. \n8\n But, even if the decree for total divorce fails to include a provision for the support of minor children, they cannot maintain in their own names, or by guardian ad litem, or by next friend, an independent suit for an allowance for education and maintenance. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n First. It was contended below in the trial court, and there held, that the provision of the decree of the Georgia court directing the payment to R. D. Blowers, trustee, of \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n $1,750 to be 'expended by him in his discretion for the benefit of the minor child, including her education, support, maintenance, medical attention and other necessary items of expenditure,' was not intended to relieve the father from all further liability to support Sadie. This contention appears to have been abandoned. It is clear that Mrs. Yarborough, her husband, and the court intended that this provision should absolve Sadie's father from further obligation to support her. That the term 'permanent alimony' as used in the decree of the Georgia court means a final provision for the minor child is shown by both the legislation of the state and the decisions of its highest court. \n10\n The refusal of the South Carolina court to give the judgment effect as against Sadie is now sought to be justified on other grounds.\n Second. It is contended that the order or decree providing for Sadie's permanent support is not res judicata because it did not conform to the provisions of the Georgia law. The argument is that the controlling statute required such an order to be entered after the second or final verdict; and that, since the order was entered before the second verdict and was not mentioned in it, the order was unauthorized and is void. The Georgia decisions have settled that a consent decree or order fixing permanent alimony for a minor child, at whatever stage of the divorce proceedings it may have been entered, has the same effect as if based upon, and specifically mentioned in, the second verdict of a jury;11 and that such an order, \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n like any other judgment, becomes unalterable after the expiration of the term. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Third. It is contended that the Georgia decree is not binding upon Sadie, because she was not a formal party to the suit, was not served with process, and no guardian ad litem was appointed for her therein. In Georgia, as elsewhere, a property right of a minor can ordinarily be affected by legal proceedings only if these requirements are complied with. 13 But the obligation imposed by the Georgia law upon the father to support his minor child does not vest in the child a property right. This is shown by the fact, among other things, that the minor cannot maintain in his own name, or by guardian ad litem or by next friend, a suit against his father to enforce the obligation. \n14\n The provision which the Georgia law makes of permanent alimony for the child during minority is a legal incident of the divorce proceeding. As that suit embraces within its scope the disposition and care of minor children, jurisdiction over the parents confers eo ipso jurisdiction over the minor's custody and support. Hence, by the Georgia law, a consent (or other) decree in a divorce suit fixing permanent alimony for a minor child is binding upon it, although the child was not served with process, was not made a formal party to the suit, and no guardian ad litem was appointed therein. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. It is contended that the order for permanent alimony is not binding upon Sadie because she was not a resident of Georgia at the time it was entered. Being a minor, Sadie's domicile was Georgia, that of her father; 16 and her domicile continued to be in Georgia until entry of the judgment in question. She was not capable by her own act of changing her domicile. 17 Neither the temporary residence in North Carolina at the time the divorce suit was begun,18 nor her removal with her mother to South Carolina before entry of the judgment, effected a change of Sadie's domicile. \n19\n It is true that under the Georgia Code a minor may acquire a domicile apart from the father if he has 'voluntarily relinquished his parental authority.' But the mere fact that the parents were living separately at the time the suit for divorce was brought and that Sadie was with her mother does not establish such relinquishment. \n20\n Compare Anderson v. Watt, \n138 \nU.S. 694, 706\n, 11 S.Ct. 449. The character and extent of the father's obligation, and the status of the minor, are determined ordinarily, not by the place of the minor's residence, but by the law of the father's domicile. \n21\n Moreover, this is not a case where the scope of the jurisdiction acquired by the Georgia court rests upon the effectiveness of service by publication upon a nonresident. Mrs. Yarborough filed a cross-bill, as well as an answer; and in the cross-bill prayed 'that provision for permanent alimony be made for the' support and education of Sadie. Thus \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n the court acquired complete jurisdiction of the marriage status and, as an incident, power to finally determine the extent of her father's obligation to support his minor child. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. The fact that Sadie has become a resident of South Carolina does not impair the finality of the judgment. South Carolina thereby acquired the jurisdiction to determine her status and the incidents of that status. Upon residents of that state it could impose duties for her benefit. Doubtless, it might have imposed upon her grandfather who was resident there a duty to support Sadie. But the mere fact of Sadie's residence in South Carolina does not give that state the power to impose such a duty upon the father who is not a resident and who long has been domiciled in Georgia. \n23\n He has fulfilled the duty which he owes her by the law of his domicile and the judgment of its court. Upon that judgment he is entitled to rely. \n24\n It was settled by Sistare v. Sistare, \n218 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 682, 28 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061, that the full faith and credit clause applies to an unalterable decree of alimony for a divorced wife. The clause \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 213]\n\u00a0\n applies, likewise, to an unalterable decree of alimony for a minor child. 25 We need not consider whether South Carolina would have power to require the father, if he were domiciled there, to make further provision for the support, maintenance, or education of his daughter.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The divorce decree of the Georgia court purported to adjudicate finally, both for the present and for the future, the right of a minor child of the marriage to support and maintenance, by directing her father to make a lump sum payment for that purpose. More than two years later, after the minor had become a domiciled resident of South Carolina, and after the sum paid had been exhausted, a court of that state, on the basis of her need as then shown, has rendered a judgment directing further payments for her support out of property of the father in South Carolina, in addition to that already commanded by the Georgia judgment.\n For present purposes we may take it that the Georgia decree, as the statutes and decisions of the state declare, is unalterable and, as pronounced, is effective to govern the rights of the parties in Georgia. But there is nothing the decree itself or in the history of the proceedings which led to it to suggest that it was rendered with any purpose or intent to regulate or control the relationship of parent and child, or the duties which flow from it, in places outside the state of Georgia where they might later come to reside. It would hardly be thought that Georgia, by judgment of its courts more than by its statutes, would attempt to regulate the relationship of parents and child domiciled outside the state at the very time the decree \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 214]\n\u00a0\n was rendered, and, in the face of constitutional doubts which arise here, it is far from clear that its decree is to be interpreted as attempting to do more than to regulate that relationship while the infant continued to be domiciled within the state. But, if we are to read the decree as though it contained a clause, in terms, restricting the power of any other state in which the minor might come to reside, to make provision for her support, then, in the absence of some law of Congress requiring it, I am not persuaded that the full faith and credit clause gives sanction to such control by one state of the internal affairs of another. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Congress has said that the public records and the judicial proceedings of each state are to be given such faith and credit in other states as is accorded to them in the state 'from which they are taken.' R. S.  905, 906, 28 USCA  687, 688. But this broad language has never been applied without limitations. See M'Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312. Between the prohibition of the due process clause, acting upon the courts of the state from which such proceedings may be taken, and the mandate of the full faith and credit clause, acting upon the state to which they may be taken, there is an area which federal authority has not occupied. As this Court has often recognized, there are many judgments which need not be given the same force and effect abroad which they \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 215]\n\u00a0\n have at home, and there are some, though valid in the state where rendered, to which the full faith and credit clause gives no force elsewhere. In the assertion of rights, defined by a judgment of one state, within the territory of another there is often an inescapable conflict of interest of the two states, and there comes a point beyond which the imposition of the will of one state beyond its own borders involves a forbidden infringement of some legitimate domestic interest of the other. That point may vary with the circumstances of the case, and, in the absence of provisions more specific than the general terms of the congressional enactment,2 this Court must determine for itself the extent to which one state may qualify3 or deny4 rights claimed under proceedings or records of other states. \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 216]\n\u00a0\n More than once this Court has approved the doctrine that a state need give no effect to judgments for conviction of crime or for penalties procured in a sister state. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 675\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335\n, 23 S.Ct. 558. See also, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 330, 337.5 And the intervention of a sister state's judgment will not overcome a local policy against allowing to foreign corporations the use of local courts in settling foreign disputes. Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., \n191 \nU.S. 373\n, 24 S.Ct. 92.6 Compare Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the World, Loyal Order of Moose, \n252 \nU.S. 411\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 10 A.L.R. 716.7 The state of matrimonial domicile may preserve to its own resident his rights in the marriage status where another state has sought to terminate it, without acquiring jurisdiction of his person, Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1, even though terminated within the other state. Cf. Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S.Ct. 723. 8 The full faith and credit clause does not require one state, at the behest of the courts of another, to surrender its powers to decide what criminal \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 217]\n\u00a0\n penalties it shall impose, to circumscribe, within limits, the classes of disputes to which its courts must give ear,9 or to protect its residents from undue interference with the marriage relationship.\n A statute, record, or judgment of one state establishing the right of an illegitimate or adopted child to inherit from his putative parent may be given extrastate effect for many purposes, but it does not establish his right to inherit land in another state. See Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718; Olmstead v. Olmstead, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S. Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1292. Parties who have, in one state, litigated the proper construction of a will disposing of realty are not, by the judgment there, concluded in another state where the testator's realty is located. Cf. Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 \nU.S. 186\n, 20 S.Ct. 873. Nor will a divorce decree seeking to apportion the rights of the parties to realty be conclusive with respect to land outside the state. Fall v. Eastin, \n215 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 3, 23 L.R.A.( N.S.) 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853. The interest of a state in controlling all the legal incidents of real property located within its boundaries is deemed so complete and so vital to the exercise of its sovereign powers of government within its own territory as to exclude any control over them by the statutes or judgments of other states.\n It would be going further than this Court has been willing to go in any decision to say that the power of a state to pass judgment upon the sanity of its own citizen could be foreclosed by an earlier judgment of the court of some other state dealing with the same subject-matter. Cf. Gasquet v. Fenner, \n247 \nU.S. 16\n, 38 S.Ct. 416.\n Similarly it has been almost uniformly recognized that a divorce decree which by its terms or by operation of law forbids remarriage of one or both of the parties can \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 218]\n\u00a0\n have no effect outside the state which rendered it. \n10\n Jurisdictional requirements being satisfied, the decree is effective to end the marriage for all states, but enforcement of its prohibition against remarriage in anothed state, even though the parties do not take up their residence there, would infringe upon the interest which every state has to maintain the stability of a union entered into according to the laws of the place of celebration. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 202, 219]\n\u00a0\n Whatever view may be held of the particular restrictions upon the operation of the full faith and credit clause in these cases, the validity of the principle upon which they rest has never been denied. Its validity is likewise recognized in those cases where this Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment denies to a state the power of unduly extending its authority beyond its own borders, by the mere expedient of rendering a judgment against one of whose person or property it has acquired jurisdiction. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, \n234 \nU.S. 149\n, 34 S.Ct. 879; Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701. Just as due process of law will not permit a state, by its judgment, to inflict parties 'with a perpetual contractual paralysis' which will prevent them from altering outside the state their contracts or ordinary business relations entered into within it, New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, supra, \n234 \nU.S. 149\n, 34 S.Ct. 879, so full faith and credit does not command that the obligations attached to a status, because once appropriately imposed by one state, shall be forever placed beyond the control of every other state, without regard to the interest in it and the power of control which the other may later acquire. See Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, 286 \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 220]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 145, 157, note 7, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696. Whatever difference there may be between holding that a judgment is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it is 'extra-territorial,' and in holding that it is not entitled to full faith and credit, although it does not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, is one of degree, or of a difference in circumstances which may prevent the operation of the latter provision of the Constitution. The Georgia judgment with which we are now concerned does not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, for Georgia had 'jurisdiction' of the parties and subject-matter at the time its judgment was rendered. The possibility of conflict of the Georgia judgment with the interest of South Carolina first arose when the minor transferred her domicile to South Carolina, long after the Georgia judgment was given.\n The question presented here is whether the support and maintenance of a minor child, domiciled in South Carolina, is so peculiarly a subject of domestic concern that Georgia law cannot impair South Carolina's authority. The subject-matter of the judgment in each state is the duty which government may impose on a parent to support a minor child. The maintenance and support of children domiciled within a state, like their education and custody, is a subject in which government itself is deemed to have a peculiar interest and concern. Their tender years, their inability to provide for themselves, the importance to the state that its future citizens should be clothed, nourished, and suitably educated, are considerations which lead all civilized countries to assume some control over the maintenance of minors. \n12\n The states very \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 221]\n\u00a0\n generally make some provision from their own resources for the maintenance and support of orphans or destitute children, but, in order that children may not become public charges, the duty of maintenance is one imposed primarily upon the parents, according to the needs of the child and their ability to meet those needs. This is usually accomplished by suit brought directly by some public officer,13 by the child by guardian or next friend, or by the mother, against the father for maintenance and support. \n14\n The measure of the duty is the need of the child and the ability of the parent to meet those needs at the very time when performance of the duty is invoked. Hence it is no answer in such a suit that at some earlier time provision was made for the child, which is no longer available or \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 222]\n\u00a0\n suitable because of his greater needs, or because of the increased financial ability of the parent to provide for them,15 or that the child may be maintained from other sources. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n In view of the universality of these principles, it comes as a surprise that any state, merely because it has made some provision for the support of a child, should, either by statute or judicial decree, so tie its own hand as to foreclose all future inquiry into the duty of maintenance however affected by changed conditions. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 202, 223]\n\u00a0\n Even though the Constitution does not deny to Georgia the power to indulge in such a policy for itself,18 it by no means follows that it gives to Georgia the privilege of prescribing that policy for other states in which the child comes to live. \n19\n South Carolina has adopted a different policy. It imposes on the father or his property located within the state the duty to support his minor child domiciled there. It enforces the duty by criminal prosecution, 20 \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 224]\n\u00a0\n and also permits suit by the minor child maintained by guardian ad litem. The measure of the duty is the present need of the child and the ability of the parent to provide for it. In this case the suit was begun by attachment of the father's property in South Carolina and by personal service of process upon him there. The court found that the lump sum paid for support of the child under the Georgia decree had been expended; that she was justifiably residing with her mother in South Carolina rather than with her father in Georgia; that she was then without financial resources, and that, considering her station in life and the circumstances of her father, anallowance for the future of $50 a month for her education, maintenance, and support would be fair and just, and this amount was ordered to be paid for that purpose from the attached property.\n The opinion of this Court leaves it uncertain whether it is thought that the Constitution commands that the duty of support prescribed by Georgia, the domicile of the father, shall be dominant over that enjoined by South Carolina, the domicile of the child, in any event, or only after the duty has been defined by a judgment of Georgia. \n21\n It is attested by eminent authority that the Fourteenth Amendment, at least, does not prevent the state of the child's domicile from imposing the duty, Restatement of Conflict of Laws,  498A,22 a view confirmed by the uniform rulings that the father is liable to the criminal process of the state of the child's residence, though before, and at all times during his failure to conform to the duty demanded by that state, he has been domiciled elsewhere. State of \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 225]\n\u00a0\n Kansas v. Wellman, 102 Kan. 503, 170 P. 1052, L.R.A. 1918D, 949, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1006; State of Ohio v. Sanner, 81 Ohio St. 393, 90 N.E. 1007, 26 L. R.A.(N.S.) 1093. The Fourteenth Amendment does not enable a father, by the expedient of choosing a domicile other than the state where the child is rightfully domiciled, to avoid the duty which that state may impose for support of his child. The reason seems plain. The locality of the child's residence must see to his welfare. While it might be more convenient for creditors of the father to look to the law of his residence as fixing all his obligations, it would seem that the compelling interest in the welfare of children, to which performance of the duties of parentage is a necessary incident, outweighs commercial convenience; the more so where, as in this case, the obligation is to be satisfied from the father's property within the state of the child's domicile.\n The conclusion must be the same when the issue is that of the credit to be given the prior Georgia judgment. Whatever may be said of the local interest which was deemed controlling in those cases in which this Court has denied to a state judgment the same force and effect outside the state as is given to it at home, it would not seem open to serious question that every state has an interest in securing the maintenance and support of minor children residing within its own territory so complete and so vital to the performance of its functions as a government that no other state could set limits upon it. Of that interest, South Carolina is the sole mistress within her own territory. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, \n237 \nU.S. 615\n, 35 S.Ct. 718. Even though we might appraise it more lightly than does South Carolina, it is not for us to say that a state is not free, within constitutional limitations, to regard that interest as fully as important and as completely within the realm of state power as the legal incidents of land located within its boundaries, or of a marriage relationship, wherever entered into but of which it is the domicile, \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 226]\n\u00a0\n or its power to pass upon the sanity of its own residents, notwithstanding the earlier pronouncements of the courts of other states.\n The case of Sistare v. Sistare, \n218 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 682, 28 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061, seems to have no bearing on the question presented here. There the plaintiff in error procured in the courts of New York a judgment of judicial separation awarding alimony for herself and child at a weekly rate. Leave was given to her by the judgment to apply for such orders as might be necessary for its enforcement or her protection. Her husband failed to pay the alimony, and she brought suit against him in the courts of Connecticut for the pastdue alimony which had accrued under the judgment. Upon an examination of the New York law, this Court concluded that the judgment was final as to all past alimony, and that the effect of it was to create a debt in New York, collectible there by execution, for all past-due installments, and it held that the full faith and credit clause required the Connecticut courts to render a like judgment. The Court was careful to distinguish the case from one where the suit was brought to compel the payment of alimony in the future. See page 16 of 218 U.S., 30 S.Ct. 686. Compare Lynde v. Lynde, \n181 \nU.S. 183, 187\n, 21 S.Ct. 555. The record discloses that neither party to the suit was domiciled in Connecticut. The wife relied on the New York judgment, as did the husband, whose only defenses were based on its effect in New York as not there conferring on her an unqualified right to the alimony. The Court was not asked and did not assume to pass upon the duty of the husband to support the wife or children independently of the New York judgment. No question whether the enforcement of the New York decree in Connecticut would infringe the authority of Connecticut to regulate or control the incidents of a marriage, one or both of the parties to which were then domiciled in the state, was either raised or considered.\n The decision in Sistare v. Sistare lends no support to the contention that South Carolina can be precluded by a \n\n[290 U.S. 202, 227]\n\u00a0\n judgment of another state from providing for the future maintenance and support of a destitute child domiciled within its own borders out of the property of her father also located there. Here the Georgia decree did not end the relationship of parent and child, as a decree of divorce may end the marriage relationship. Had the infant continued to reside in Georgia, and had she sought in the courts of South Carolina to compel the application of property of her father, found there, to her further maintenance and support, full faith and credit to the Georgia decree applied to its own domiciled resident might have required the denial of any relief. Cf. Bates v. Bodie, \n245 \nU.S. 520\n, 38 S.Ct., 182, L.R.A. 1918C, 355; Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n, 33 S.Ct. 129. But, when she became a domiciled resident of South Carolina, a new interest came into being, the interest of the state of South Carolina as a measure of self-preservation to secure the adequate protection and maintenance of helpless members of its own community and its prospective citizens. That interest was distinct from any which Georgia could conclusively regulate or control by its judgment, even though rendered while the child was domiciled in Georgia. The present decision extends the operation of the full faith and credit clause beyond its proper function of affording protection to the domestic interests of Georgia, and makes it an instrument for encroachment by Georgia upon the domestic concerns of South Carolina.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There was no suggestion that plaintiff would be destitute or become a public charge. Indeed, her grandfather testified that he was able and willing to provide $125 a month for her education and maintenance (the amount sought by plaintiff), if her father was unable to do so. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 2944 of the Georgia Civil Code 1910 provides: 'Divorces may be granted by the superior court, and shall be of two kinds-Total, or from bed and board.

But the point is doubtful. See Walder v. Walder, 159 La. 231, 105 So. 300; Graham v. Graham, 38 Colo. 453, 88 P. 852, 8 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1270, 12 Ann.Cas. 137. The reasoning of the opinion of the Court-that, since Georgia does not give the child a cause of action, it has no property right and need not have been represented-would lead to the conclusion that what was decided in Georgia was something quite different from that which was in litigation and decided in South Carolina; that the child's suit is upon a right afforded only by the law of South Carolina; and that the Georgia suit, giving no similar right but only a right to the mother, could have no effect upon the present litigation. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The mandatory force of the full faith and credit clause as defined by this Court may be, in some degree not yet fully defined, expanded or contracted by Congress. Much of the confusion and procedural deficiencies which the constitutional provision alone has not avoided may be remedied by legislation. Cook, Powers of Congress under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, 28 Yale Law Journal, 421; Corwin, The 'Full Faith and Credit' Clause, 81 University of Pennsylvania Law Rev. 371. Cf. 33 Columbia Law Rev. 854, 866. The constitutional provision giving Congress power to prescribe the effect to be given to acts, records, and proceedings would have been quite unnecessary had it not been intended that Congress should have a latitude broader than that given the courts by the full faith and credit clause alone. It was remarked on the floor of the Constitutional Convention that, without the extension of power in the Legislature, the provision 'would amount to nothing more than what now takes place among all Independent Nations.' Hunt and Scott, Madison's Reports of the Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503. The play which has been afforded for the recognition of local public policy in cases where there is called in question only a statute of another state, as to the effect of which Congress has not legislated, compared with the more restricted scope for local policy where there is a judicial proceeding, as to which Congress has legislated, suggests the congressional power. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] M'Elmoyle v.

Cook, 256 Ill. 460, 100 N.E. 222, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 365, unless the party had changed his domicile before remarrying, Pierce v. Pierce, 58 Wash. 622, 109 P. 45. Thus the divorce proceedings, on the one hand, and the marriage record, on the other, are denied full credit. See Beale, Laughlin, Guthrie and Sandomire, Marriage and the Domicil, 44 Harvard Law Rev. 501; 16 Minnesota Law Rev. 172. The present case is not distinguished by arguing that in the divorce situation it is a question of faith and credit to be given to a statute, and not to judicial proceedings. Goodwin v. Goodwin, 158 App.Div. 171, 173, 142 N.Y.S. 1102. While it is usually a statute that prescribes the disability which is to attach to the divorce, it is the judicial proceedings themselves which are in question as much as in the present case, where the judgment for support is unalterable within the state by virtue of the Georgia statute. Without denying the validity of a marriage in another state, the privileges flowing from marriage may be subject to the local law. State v. Bell, 7 Baxt. (66 Tenn.) 9, 32 Am.Rep. 549 ( husband and wife of different races may be prohibited from cohabiting within state though lawfully married elsewhere); Restatement of Conflicts of Law,  181. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Further examples might be referred to. The policy of the state in which the foreign judgment is set up fixes the periods of limitations, and the priority which foreign judgment creditors may have. M'Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312; Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107, 112\n, 10 S.Ct. 269. A state may, under some circumstances, deny the authority of foreign officers to deal with things within its territory, see Great Western Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561, 576\n, 25 S.Ct. 770, even though the officer's action took place in the foreign state, Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 \nU.S. 186, 194\n, 20 S.Ct. 873; Hoyt v. Sprague, \n103 U.S. 613\n, 631. The limitation upon the doctrine of such cases which this Court has imposed in holding that certain statutory successors to corporations in a foreign state shall have the privilege of maintaining suit, Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 526\n, 27 S.Ct. 755, illustrates the appropriate function of this Court in balancing the interests of local and foreign sovereign. The extrastate force given to a voluntary assignment in receivership, as compared with the more restricted effect of an assignment which is commanded by court order, further demonstrates the nature of the full faith and credit mandate. See Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107, 129\n, 10 S.Ct. 269; Catlin v. Wilcox Silver-Plate Co., 123 Ind. 477, 482, 24 N.E. 250, 8 L.R.A. 62, 18 Am.St.Rep. 338; Zacher v. Fidelity Trust & Safety-Vault Co. (C.C.A.) 106 F. 593; Laughlin, Extraterritorial Powers of Receivers, 45 Harvard Law Rev. 429, 461 ff. The problems in relation to the extrastate consequences of the dissolution of a corporation are becoming important. Compare Clark, Receiver, v. Williard et al., Trustees (Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co.)

They are usually young; in Maryland over 60 per cent. are under ten years of age when divorce occurs. Divorces are often not contested, and the intervention of a disinterested judge is frequently nominal. Allowances for children in the divorce court are typically small. Marshall and May, The Divorce Court, 31, 79, 80, 82, 226-231, 323. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Frequently a criminal statute provides as an alternative penalty for nonsupport of a child that the guilty party post a bond or otherwise provide for the future support of the child. Such a statute exists in South Carolina. Section 1123, South Crolina Code 1932. Cf. Mason's 1927 Minn. St.  10136. The state's special interest in securing the father's liability is emphasized, not only by the frequency of penal measures, but also by the fact that in some places a statute is necessary before any suit can be maintained against the father.

Likewise notable is the extensive repudiation of the view that the duty to support is correlative with the right to custody and services. See Jacobs, Cases on Domestic Relations, 772. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] The duty of support is also enforced through entertaining suits by third parties to recover for necessaries furnished. However, conflicting policies make this an unsatisfactory method, for the courts seek to discourage wrongful action on the part of wives or minors in leaving their homes, and have consequently gone to some lengths in refusing to impose liability on the father, unless he has been at fault in breaking up the home.

A tendency may be discerned to give conclusive force to the determinations of the state wherein the child resides, as long as that residence continues, but that upon change of residence the questions will be open in the state to which the change is made.

Laws N.Y. 1929, vol. 1, c. 54, p. 82, Vehicle and Traffic Law,  59.\n Masci, a citizen and resident of New York, brought this action in a court of New Jersey against Young, a citizen and resident of the latter state, to enforce liability under the above statute. The case was tried before a jury. It appeared that Young lent his automobile to Michael Balbino for a day without restriction upon its use, the contract of bailment and delivery of the car being made in New Jersey; that Balbino took the car to New York; and that while driving there negligently he struck Masci. There was evidence to justify a finding that the car was taken to New York with Young's permission, express or implied. Young moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the bailment was made in New Jersey; that he was not in New York at the time of the accident; that Balbino was not his agent or engaged on business for him; and that to apply the law of New York and so make the defendant responsible for something done by Balbino in New York would deprive the defendant of his property and his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The presiding judge declined to direct the verdict; ruled that, if negligence was proved, the law of New York was controlling on the question of liability; and charged that the defendant was responsible if the operator 'was driving this automobile at the time of the accident with the permission of the defendant, either express or implied.' The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of that state. 109 N.J. Law, 453, 162 A. 623.\n Young appealed to this Court on the ground, among others, that the statute as applied violates the due process \n\n[289 U.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He does not challenge its constitutionality on the broad ground that an owner cannot be made liable for the driver's negligence unless the relation of master and servant exists. The contrary had been held in New York in respect to this statute. Downing v. New York, 219 App.Div. 444, 446, 220 N.Y.S. 76, affirmed 245 N. Y. 597, 157 N.E. 873; Dawley v. McKibbin, 245 N.Y. 557, 157 N.E. 856. And in Van Oster v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 465, 467\n, 47 S.Ct. 133, 134, 47 A.L.R. 1044, where it was held that the due process clause does not prevent a state from forfeiting property of an innocent owner for the unauthorized act of one to whom he has intrusted it, the Court states that it is not 'uncommon, for the law to visit upon the owner of property the unpleasant consequences of the unauthorized action of one to whom he has intrusted it'; and refers to the legislation of New York 'imposing liability on owners of vehicles for the negligent operation by those intrusted with their use, regardless of a master-servant relation.' Compare Pizitz Co. v. Yeldell, \n274 U.S. 112\n, 115-116, 47 S.Ct. 509, 51 A.L.R. 1376. Statutes of like character have been sustained also by the highest courts of other states. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Nor does Young question the state's power to regulate the use of motor vehicles of nonresidents on its highways. Compare Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S.Ct. 30. He challenges the \n\n[289 U.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n statute only as applied to a nonresident owner who made the bailment outside the state of New York and who was not within it at the time of the accident. The contention is that subjection of the owner to liability under the New York law deprives him of immunity from liability to third parties which he had acquired in New Jersey by virtue of the contract of bailment made there; and that thus the statute deprive him of his liberty to contract and his property without due process of law. If such a contract can be found in the case at bar, the statute does not purport to affect it. The statute neither forbids the making nor alters the terms of any contract. Compare Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701. It does not purport to affect rights as between owner and bailee. Moreover, the contract of bailment could not have conferred upon the owner immunity from liability to third persons for the driver's negligence. Liability for a tort depends upon the law of the place of the injury; and (apart from the effect of the full faith and credit clause, which is not here involved) agreements made elsewhere cannot curtail the power of a state to impose responsibility for injuries within its borders. Compare Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 154\n, 52 S. 1918F, 288; Grier v. Woodside, 200 N.C. 759, 158 question is the power of New York to make the absent owner liable personally for the injury inflicted within the state by his machine.\n When Young gave permission to drive his car to New York, he subjected himself to the legal consequences imposed by that state upon Balbino's negligent driving as fully as if he had stood in the relation of master to servant. A person who sets in motion in one state the means by which injury is inflicted in another may, consistently with the due process clause, be made liable for that injury whether the means employed be a responsible agent or an irresponsible instrument. The cases are many \n\n[289 U.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n in which a person acting outside the state may be held responsible according to the law of the state for injurious consequences within it. Thus liability is commonly imposed under such circumstances for homicide, Commonwealth v. Macloon, 101 Mass. 1, 100 Am.Dec. 89; for maintenance of a nuisance, State v. Lord, 16 N.H. 357, 359; for blasting operations, Cameron v. Vandergriff, 53 Ark. 381, 386, 13 S.W. 1092; and for negligent manufacture, MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050, L. R.A. 1916F, 696, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 440.\n The power of the state to protect itself and its inhabitants is not limited by the scope of the doctrine of principal and agent. The inadequacy of that doctrine to cope with the menacing problem of practical responsibility for motor accidents has been widely felt in cases where the injurious consequences are the immediate result of an intervening negligent act of another. Some courts have held, in actions against the owner for injuries resulting from the driver's negligence, that a presumption of the employment relationship arises from the fact of ownership;2 or that, if the relationship is proved, a presumption arises that the accident occurred within the scope of the employment. \n3\n Many courts have extended responsibility, without the aid of legislation, by imposing liability upon the owner for injuries resulting from the negligent operation of the car by a member of his family. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[289 U.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n In some states, including New York, the problem was left to the Legislature. See Van Blaricom v. Dodgson, 220 N.Y. 111, 117, 115 N.E. 443, L.R.A. 1917F, 363. Its statute makes mere permission to use the car the basis of liability in case of negligent injury. We have no occasion to decide where the line is to be drawn generally between conduct which may validly subject an absent party to the laws of a state and that which may not. No good reason is suggested why, where there is permission to take the automobile into a state for use upon its highways, personal liability should not be imposed upon the owner in case of injury inflicted there by the driver's negligence, regardless of the fact that the owner is a citizen and resident of another state. Compare Thomas v. Matthiessen, \n232 U.S. 221\n, 234-235, 34 S.Ct. 312.5\n The claim is made that the statute as applied violates the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because in New Jersey, under a contract of bailment made within the state, other citizens are protected from liabil- \n\n[289 U.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n ity for the negligence of the bailee. Obviously there is no denial of equal protection, since all who permit their cars to be driven in New York are treated alike. A claim is also made that the statute as applied violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution, because it impairs the obligation of the contract of bailment made in New Jersey. As it does not appear that any claim under the contract clause was made below, we need not consider the answers to this contention.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Levy v.
