States Supreme Court\nAETNA INS. CO. v. HYDE(1928)\nNo. 112\nArgued: December 2, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 440, 441]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, Robert J. Folonie, of Chicago, Ill., William S. Hogsett, of Kansas City, Mo., Ashley Cockrill, of Little Rock, Ark., and John S. Leahy, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Messrs. John T. Barker and Floyd E. Jacobs, both of Kansas City, Mo., and North T. Gentry, of Jefferson City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 9, 1922, respondent, acting under section 6283, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1919, made findings of fact and an order directing a reduction of 10 per cent. in the rates charged by stock companies for fire, lightning, hail, and windstorm insurance. The petitioners, 156 companies, were all the stock fire insurance companies engaged in that business in Missouri. November 10, 1922, they brought this suit under section 6284, praying that the order be reviewed and set aside. The complaint challenges the methods employed by respondent to make the calculations provided for, and alleges that the findings and order are unreasonable, confiscatory, and in contravention of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Issue was joined \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n and a trial was had. The circuit court, confirming the report of a referee appointed to hear the evidence and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law, found the order unreasonable and confiscatory and entered a decree setting it aside. The Supreme Court reversed and dismissed the case. 285 S. W. 65. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 681\n, 47 S. Ct. 113.\n Respondent insists that the case presents no federal question. In order to determine whether that contention has merit, it is necessary to examine the statutory provisions under which the respondent made the findings and order complained of, the grounds on which petitioners seek to have them set aside, and the decision of the Supreme Court.\n Section 6283, as it was at the time the order was made,1 provided:\n That the superintendent of insurance 'is hereby empowered to investigate the necessity for a reduction of rates, and if, upon such investigation, it appears that the result of the earnings in this state of the stock fire insurance companies for five years next preceding such investigation shows there has been an aggregate profit therein in excess of what is reasonable, he shall order such reduction of rates as shall be necessary to limit the aggregate collections by insurance companies in this state to not more than a reasonable profit. ...'\n Section 6284, as it stood when this suit was commenced, provided:\n'The orders and directions of the superintendent of insurance, together with his findings or determinations of facts upon which such order or determination is founded, shall be reviewable by a proper action in the courts, and upon such review the entire matter shall be treated and determined de novo. ...'\n\n This section was amended before the trial Laws 1923, p. 235. The \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 443]\n\u00a0\n following was added:\n'The court shall have authority to sustain, set aside or modify the orders and directions under review.'\n\n The complaint alleges that the rates were not excessive before the reduction; that each company has local agency plants in Missouri ranging in value from $10,000 in case of small companies having but few agencies to $50,000 for larger companies having many, and that the good will of the agencies of each is of great value; that in Missouri normal expenses of each are from 35 to 45 per cent. of earned premiums and the yearly aggregate of all expenses is approximately 42 per cent. of all earned premiums, but that in the five-year period ending with 1921 total expenses amounted to about 44 per cent. of all premiums earned for insurance written in that period; that, in accordance with Missouri law, each company maintains a sum equal to its unearned premiums; that each should also have a surplus over its capital stock of 3 per cent. of its premiums on fire insurance policies in each year to meet the hazards of conflagration2 and of 10 per cent. of other premiums against the risk of other catastrophes, and that each company is entitled to earn annually an underwriting profit of at least 5 per cent. of the earned premiums; that such profit for any period is the amount of premiums earned, less losses and expenses incurred; that in the five-year period ending with 1921 the combined experience of all companies on all classes of insurance in Missouri was: Losses incurred, 64.9 per cent. of earned premiums; expenses incurred, 44.4 per cent., making a total of 109.3 per cent.-without any allowance for a fund to meet conflagration and catastrophe hazards, or for profits to the companies. \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n And the complaint shows that prior to the order here in question and on January 5, 1922, the superintendent made an order reducing rates 15 per cent. The companies sued him to enjoin its enforcement. The parties entered into a stipulation reciting that he had revoked the order and agreeing that the case be dismissed. And it was stated therein that the superintendent, not earlier than March 15, 1922, might call a hearing to investigate the necessity for a reduction of rates; that at such hearing the experience of the companies in Missouri for 1921 should be offered in evidence and considered by the superintendent, together with such other evidence as might be offered; that at the conclusion of the hearings the superintendent would make certain findings of fact and announce his determination. And the stipulation contained the following:\n'That, if ... an order reducing the rates ... be made, ... the said insurance companies, if dissatisfied, ... will proceed to secure a review thereof by the trial de novo in the circuit court of Cole county, Missouri. ... That in such matter the question of the constitutionality of sections 6283 and 6284 ... shall not be raised, nor shall the legality of the hearing above provided for be questioned.'\n\n And the complaint alleges that there was a hearing at which the companies performed their part of the agreement, but that the superintendent failed to make the findings specified in the stipulation. The order (set forth in the bill) stated that the companies refused to supply necessary data to enable the superintendent to make such findings, and that his investigation was based on sworn reports filed by the companies during the five-year period. The findings contained in the order are that, in respect of the business in Missouri, the companies in that period collected net premiums amounting to $81,067,318, interest on capital and surplus prorated to that state $2,801.660, \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 445]\n\u00a0\n and interest on unearned premium reserves $2,418,596, making a total of $ 86,287,574; that they paid losses of $45,066,124; that expenses amounted to $32,534,617, leaving $8,686,833 profits, and that expenses were excessive by not less than $5,000,000. The order declared that the rates then in force produced excessive and unreasonable profits, and that a reduction of 10 per cent. in the existing rates would result in profits that are reasonable, and it directed that rates so reduced take effect November 15, 1922\n\n\n The complaint avers that, if section 6283 be construed to authorize the superintendent of insurance to take into account interest on earnings, capital stock, surplus, and unearned premium reserves, or to make his determination of profit or loss on the basis of premiums received and losses and expenses paid, as distinguished from premiums earned and losses and expenses incurred, or if it be held to authorize the superintendent to regulate the expenses of the companies, or the inspection of their risks, or the amount of insurance they may write, then the section would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it charges that the methods and calculations employed and the findings of fact made by the superintendent are erroneous, unreasonable, and unjust, that the prescribed rates are unreasonable, inadequate, and confiscatory, and that the enforcement of the order would operate to deprive the petitioners, and each of them, of their property without due process of law.\n By his answer, the superintendent denies the allegations of fact and challenges the grounds on which petitioners contend that the findings and order are repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court considered the evidence and held that the order reducing rates was justified. It did not pass upon petitioners' contentions that their rights, safe- \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 446]\n\u00a0\n guarded by the Fourteenth Amendment, had been or would be infringed by the state law or by the superintendent's findings and order.\n It will be observed that here the controversy concerns the basis on which the findings were to be made, and that petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the statute, if construed, as they contend it should be, to require the superintendent to make his determinations on the basis of premiums earned and losses and expenses incurred. Unlike the general power to prescribe insurance premiums, conferred by the Kansas statute upheld in German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, the Missouri statute before us narrowly limits the authority of the superintendent of insurance. He is not authorized to determine whether, when applied to the Missouri business of the several companies, or of any of them, the existing or prescribed rates had been or would be just and reasonable. Section 6283 requires consideration en masse of the 'result of the earnings' of all the companies, and, upon finding an excessive 'aggregate profit,' it becomes the duty of the superintendent to limit the 'aggregate collections' to not more than a reasonable profit. The reduced rates are applicable to the business of all companies alike, and without regard to the amount of the past or prospective profits or losses of any of them; and the attack is by joint action of all the companies. It is not claimed by or on behalf of any company that, when applied to its business, the reduced rates are or would be too low to permit the company to make a reasonable profit, or to have just compensation for its contracts of insurance.\n No company receiving just compensation is entitled to have higher rates merely because of the plight of its less fortunate competitors. Companies whose constitutional rights are not infringed may not better their position by urging the cause of others. Supervisors v. Stanley, 105 \n\n[275 U.S. 440, 447]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 305, 311; Heald v. District of Columbia, \n259 \nU.S. 144, 123\n, 42 S. Ct. 434. As a practical matter of business, it is impossible in the long run for some companies to collect higher premiums than those charged by others in the same territory. Rates sufficient to yield adequate returns to some may be confiscatory when applied to the business of others. But the latter have no constitutional right to prevent their enforcement against the former. The Fourteenth Amendment does not protect against competition. Moreover, 'aggregate collections' sufficient to yield a reasonable profit for all do not necessarily give to each just compensation for the contracts of insurance written by it. It has never been and cannot reasonably be held that state- made rates violate the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the aggregate collections are not sufficient to yield a reasonable profit or just compensation to all companies that happen to be engaged in the affected business.\n The complaint was framed to secure judicial review (section 6284) of the determination of the respondent. The ground of attack was that the aggregate profits were not excessive, and that the aggregate collections permitted under the reduced rates were too low. Allegations asserting in general language that the findings, order, and reduced rates are confiscatory and repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment are not sufficient. In order to invoke the constitutional protection, the facts relied on to restrain the enforcement of rates prescribed under the sanction of state law must be specifically set forth, and from them it must clearly appear that the rates would necessarily deny to the plaintiff just compensation and deprive it of its property without due process of law.

Galveston, \n262 \nU.S. 443, 446\n, 43 S. Ct. 606. Neither of the sections authorized a determination of the reasonableness of rates when applied to the business of any company. The complaint did not allege any facts to show that the reduced rates were confiscatory as to any company. The court was not called upon to determine whether the order would operate to deprive any company of its property without due process of law. It treated the suit as one to obtain the review provided for by section 6284.\n The petitioners are competitors and each carries on business for itself. While they may be joint action pursue the remedy given by section 6284, it does not follow that the Constitution safeguards aggregate profits sufficient to constitute just compensation for all the companies. The complaint fails to show any joint interest or right in or to the business covered by the rates or the protection sought to be invoked; and it fails to show that the business in Missouri of each is so well and economically organized and carried on that petitioners are entitled, as of right protected by the Constitution, to have premiums amounting in the aggregate enough to yield a reasonable return or profit to all the companies. Assuming that, upon any state of facts, the petitioners would be entitled jointly to have such protection, and as to that no opinion is expressed, it is enough to say that the facts brought forward in this case are not sufficient to raise the question whether the state law or the superintendent's finding of facts or his order is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. No federal question is presented.\n Writ dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section has since been amended.

Chickering, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. G. C. Faulkner, and H. W. Hutton, both of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While standing on the land in Alaska respondent Peterson endeavored to push into navigable water a standed boat, 26 feet long, theretofore used by him and another for taking fish, and while so engaged sustained bodily injuries. The fishing season had ended, the nets had been removed, and the boat, partly in the water, was resting on the sand. The immediate purpose was to float it to the dock nearby in order that it might be lifted thereon and stored for the winter, according to the ordinary practice.\n Petitioner is a California corporation engaged in the business of taking flsh in Alaska and canning them at its factory located in that territory. Peterson resided in California. Within that state he entered into a contract with the association whereby he agreed to go to Alaska as a seaman on its bark Star of Iceland, and after arriving at the cannery to go ashore and act there as directed-'anything I was told to do.' Among other things, he made nets, fixed up the small boats always kept there, took them out, and served as a flsherman on one of them.\n The Industrial Accident Commission of California, purporting to act under the laws of that state, made an award against the petitioner and in favor of Peterson, and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court. The judgment is \n\n[276 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n challenged here upon the sole ground that when injured he was doing maritime work under a maritime contract, and that the rights and liabilities of the parties must be determined by applying the general rules of maritime law, and not otherwise.

Cas. 1917E, 900, and similar cases, are relied upon.\n Whether in any possible view the circumstances disclose a cause within the admiralty jurisdiction, we need not stop to determine. Even if an affirmative answer be assumed, the petitioner must fail. Peterson was not employed merely to work on the bark or the fishing boat. He also undertook to perform services as directed on land in connection with the canning operations. When injured, certainly he was not engaged in any work so directly connected with navigation and commerce that to permit the rights of the parties to be controlled by the local law would interfere with the essential uniformity of the general maritime law. The work was really local in character. The doctrine announced in Grant-Smith Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008, and Miller's Ind. Underwriters v.

UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 404\nArgued: April 11, 1928Decided: May 21, 1928\n\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Morison R. Waite, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Homer T. Dick and Elmer A. Smith, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. M. G. Roberts, of St. Louis, Mo., for West Side Lines.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants,1 for convenience called the east side lines, brought this suit to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect of charges for transporting certain westbound through traffic from the lines east of the Mississippi at East St. Louis to the lines \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n west of the river at St. Louis. The Commission and the carriers on whose complaint the order was made intervened. The District Court, consisting of three judges (U. S. C. tit. 28,  47 (28 USCA  47)), dismissed the case for want of equity.\n The order was made by the Commission after hearing on the complaint of four west side lines. They alleged that the practice of the east side lines requiring them to bear the expenses of transporting westbound through traffic across the river is unjust, unreasonable and illegal. They made no complaint as to the east-bound traffic, but they sought to be relieved from such charges on all the westbound through business and prayed reparation on account of such costs borne in the two years preceding the complaint. The Commission filed a report which was made a part of the order. 113 I. C. C. 681. It held-its chairman and two other members dissenting-that the matter in controversy is a 'practice' within the meaning of the act. It found:\n'That for the future the practice of the east side lines in requiring the west side lines to bear the transfer charges on westbound freight traffic moving through St. Louis and East St. Louis on combination rates which are the same on St. Louis as on East St. Louis will be unjust and unreasonable, and that the just and reasonable practice with respect to such traffic will be for the east side lines to bear or absorb all such transfer charges.'\n\n The Commission was not convinced that the acceptance by the west side lines of divisions of joint rates did not constitute an acquiescence, tantamount to an agreement on their part to pay a transfer charge on through traffic moved on such rates. But it commended to the carriers a careful study of the divisions of joint rates on west-bound traffic with a view to readjustment if necessary to conform to the just and reasonable practice in respect of interchange approved by the report. Reparation was denied. \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n The order2 requires no change of divisions of revenues derived from traffic moving on joint rates. It covers only such of the west-bound traffic as moves on combination through rates. It shifts from the west side lines to the carriers east of the river the burden of transferring that freight from east to west across the river. No change is ordered in the method of handling the traffic. No lack of facilities for the through routes, section 1(3), (4), 49 USCA  1(3), (4); Comp. St. 8563(3), (4), or for making the transfers, secton 3(3), 49 USCA  3(3), Comp. St.  8565(3), was shown or found.\n The appellants contend that the controversy involved rates and divisions and not a 'practice' within the meaning of the act, and that the evidence before the Commission was not sufficient to support a finding that it is or will be unjust or unreasonable to require the west side lines to bear such transfer charges or to warrant the order. \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 296]\n\u00a0\n The traffic at this crossing is very large. The railroad lines of the east side carriers terminate on the east bank, those of the appellee carriers on the west bank, and some carriers have lines on both sides. All, or practically all, of the traffic is handled for interchange between lines east and lines west by the Terminal Railroad Association and its subsidiaries. They are jointly owned or controlled by appellant and appellee lines. The arrangements for their use contemplate equal treatment of all carriers served by them. The proprietary companies have trackage rights over the lines of the association between St. Louis and East St. Louis, but ordinarily dinarily they do not use them. The average haul for transfer across the river is about 10 miles. The cost is higher than that attending transportation for like distances under ordinary circumstances.\n The transfer charges complained of were assumed by appellee lines in order to enable them to compete with other railroads west of the Mississippi river. At first there was a separate rate or charge for the haul across the river. But in 1877, the Chicago & Alton Railroad Company built a line from the west across the Mississippi at Louisiana, Mo., to a junction with its north and south line east of the river. That extension enabled it to open a route from the west to East St. Louis and there interchange with the east side lines. This competition for the haul between East St. Louis and the territory west of St. Louis compelled the four appellee lines to bear the cost of transferring across the river all through traffic in both directions. The commission's report shows that now five of the eight lines on the west side that serve St. Louis also reach East St. Louis, and that three of them handle freight traffic to points west of the river without taking it through St. Louis. This is competition that must be met-if they would participate in the business-by the west side lines that reach East St. Louis only by means \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 297]\n\u00a0\n of the facilities and services of the association and its subsidiaries. Since the Alton opened its route to the west, the appellee lines have maintained the same rates from and to East St. Louis as from and to St. Louis. And, about 1908, upon the insistence of the business interests of St. Louis, the lines east of the river published and have since maintained, with some exceptions that need not be specified, the same rates from and to St. Louis as from and to East St. Louis. This was done by reducing the rates to and from St. Louis and by advancing most of the rates to and from East St. Louis. The decrease in revenue resulting from the reductions was much greater than the increase arising from the advances.\n In 1905 the United States brought suit against the Terminal Railroad Association, carriers involved in this controversy and others in the district court for the eastern district of Missouri to prevent violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15). A final decree in favor of the United States was entered in 1917 in accordance with the directions of this court. \n224 \nU.S. 383\n, 32 S. Ct. 507; Id., \n236 \nU.S. 194\n, 35 S. Ct. 408. On petition filed in that case by the appellee lines some years after the final decree, the District Court, February 8, 1923, adjudged that in contempt of its decree the association, its subsidiaries and proprietary companies had continuously compelled the appellee lines to pay transfer charges for interchange between them and the east side lines on through traffic in both directions. It directed the east side lines to cease such violations and to pay for the use of the west side lines the total amount of the charges paid by the latter for the transfer of westbound through freight from March 2, 1914, to the date of the order. The east side lines and other companies so adjudged in contempt appealed; and, on October 13, 1924, this court held that the original decree did not regulate rates, prescribe divisions of joint rates or fix liability for the transfer charges; that contempt proceedings did not lie to de- \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 298]\n\u00a0\n termine the controversy between the east side lines and the west side lines or to require the former to make the payments ordered. Terminal Railroad Ass'n v. United States, \n266 U.S. 17\n, 29, et seq., 45 S. Ct. 5.\n The Commission's report states that the question before it was 'whether the east side lines or the west side lines should bear the expense incident to the transfer across the Mississippi river from East St. Louis, Ill., to St. Louis, Mo., of practically all carload and less-than- carload through freight originating east of the St. Louis-East St. Louis district and destined west thereof.' And the thing ordered by the Commission is the absorption by the east side lines of the transfer charges on west-bound through traffic. It directed them to do exactly what the District Court required them to do except that the latter's decree related to the past and the order of the Commission relates to the future. The matters in controversy in both proceedings were purely financial. There was no question concerning furnishing of facilities or the handling of traffic.\n The larger part of the through traffic interchanged through the East St. Louis-St. Louis gateway moves on joint rates; and, for the purpose of divisions among participating carriers, these rates are deemed to 'break' at East St. Louis. Each is made up of an amount to cover the part of the haul east of East St. Louis and an amount to cover the movement between that place and points west of St. Louis. The first amount goes to the lines east and the other, less the transfer charge, goes to carriers west of the river. Through traffic not covered by joint rates moves on through rates made up of combinations of local rates or local and proportional rates to and from East St. Louis. Where the combination on St. Louis is the same as on East St. Louis, the lines east of the river, by appropriate tariff provisions, section 6(1), 49 USCA  6(1), Comp. St.  8569(1), make their St. Louis-East St. Louis rates apply only to and from \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 299]\n\u00a0\n East St. Louis. There are some exceptions, but they need not be set forth here. So all the revenues yielded by such rates, without deduction on account of charges for transfer, are retained by the carriers in the territory east of the river. But the Commission's order requires the rates, so by tariff provisions limited to East St. Louis, to be extended to St. Louis. This operates to deduct the cost of transfer from their revenue. In effect it is to require the cancellation of such tariff provisions, and to authorize a corresponding change in the tariffs of the appellee lines. It results that the controversy before the Commission involved divisions or apportionments of revenues derived from through traffic.\n In holding that the matter in controversy is a 'practice' within the meaning of the act, the Commission relied on section 1(6) and (11), 49 USCA  1(6), (11), Comp. St.  8563(6), (11), and section 15(1), 49 USCA  15(1), Comp. St.  8583(1). Paagraph (6) makes it the duty of carriers to establish just and reasonable regulations and practices affecting classifications, rates or tariffs. Paragraph (11) requires them to furnish an adequate car service and to establish just and reasonable rules, regulations and practices, and declares to be unlawful every unjust and unreasonable rule, regulation and practice in respect of car service. The phrase 'car service' is defined by paragraph (10), 49 USCA  1(10), Comp. St.  8563(10), to include the exchange, interchange and return of locomotives, cars and other vehicles and also the supply of trains used by any carrier. Paragraph (1) of section 15 provides that whenever the Commission shall be of opinion that any individual or joint rate or classification, regulation or practice is or will be unjust or unreasonable, the Commission may prescribe just and reasonable rates, classifications, regulations or practices.\n The word 'practice,' considered generally and without regard to context, is not capable of useful construction. If broadly used, it would cover everything carriers are accustomed to do. Its meaning varies so widely and de- \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 300]\n\u00a0\n pends so much upon the connection in which it is used that Congress will be deemed to have intended to confine its application to acts or things belonging to the same general class as those meant by the words associated with it. United States v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., \n242 \nU.S. 208, 229\n, 37 S. Ct. 95. When regard is had to that rule and the restrictions required to give the word a reasonable construction, it seems quite clear that 'practice' as used in the provisions relied on by the Commission, does not include or refer to the method or basis used by the connecting carriers for their divisions of rates or revenues. And this is so whether the revenues are derived from joint rates or from combination through rates.\n But even if the matter in controversy were a 'practice' within the meaning of the act, the Commission would not be authorized to set it aside without evidence that it is unjust or unreasonable. Paragraph (6) of section 15, 49 USCA  15(6), Comp. St.  8583(6), empowers the Commission to prescribe divisions of joint rates, but there must be evidence adequate to justify action. Brimstone Railroad & Canal Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 104\n, 48 S. Ct. 282; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S. Ct. 565; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. That rule may not be avoided by a broad construction of the word 'practice.' The record here contains all the evidence that was submitted to the Commission. Its report shows that 'the propriety of divisions was not the subject of inquiry and investigation.' The appellee lines adopted the policy of absorbing the transfer charges in order to meet competition of the Alton and have since continued to divide joint rates and apply their St. Louis- East St. Louis rates in combination on that basis. There is a strong presumption that the general level of their rates has been adjusted to include reasonable compensation for the services covered by them. The Commission found that appellee lines have long acquiesced \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 301]\n\u00a0\n in the division of revenue derived from traffic moving on joint rates. They have not, by tariff provisions or otherwise, attempted to limit to St. Louis their St. Louis-East St. Louis rates when used in combination to move through traffic. The Alton and other like competitions of appellee lines bear the cost of the transfer across the river. The order makes no change as to them. But it takes the corresponding consts off appellee lines and puts that burden on the east side lines. The latter are required to absorb the transfer cost only when the traffic moves over the appellee lines.\n The Commission appears to have relied on evidence tending to show that, usually when interchange is effected by means of an intermediate carrier, the delivering carrier bears the cost of switching. But such a practice does not tend to prove that it is unjust or unreasonable for the appellee lines, in order to meet competition of other west side lines, to bear the cost of transfer in both directions, or that the east side lines may not justly and reasonably limit their rates to East St. Louis when used in combination on through traffic at that gateway and so put appellee lines on equal footing with their competitors. The same considerations apply in determining the reasonableness of the apportionment of revenues derived from combination rates as govern the divisions of joint rates. The merits of the changes made by the order cannot be determined without a consideration of facts substantially similar to those specified in paragraph (6) of section 15 relating to the division of joint rates. The case was not presented by complainants or considered by the Commission on that basis. There was no evidence to show the amount of revenue required to pay operating expenses, taxes and a fair return on the property of appellee lines or that their rates were not adjusted or were not sufficient to cover the transfer charges in question. There was nothing to sup- \n\n[277 U.S. 291, 302]\n\u00a0\n port a finding that it is or will be unjust or unreasonable for the appellee lines to bear the cost of transfer of the west-bound through traffic.

To show how the questions arise and the circumstances bearing on their solution the case will be stated with some detail.\n The suit was brought January 30, 1915, to obtain an injunction against the infringement of letters patent and to recover profits made out of the infringement. The answer put in issue the plaintiff's title, the validity of the letters patent, and the infringement. A hearing, at which evidence, both oral and documentary, was received, resulted, February 20, 1917, in an interlocutory decree whereby the issues were resolved in the plaintiff's favor and the cause was referred to a master, with directions to ascertain the profits, to take evidence to that end and to report his findings 'together with all evidence' taken before him. See 240 F. 749. The decree recited that the evidence underlying it was 'filed' in the cause.\n The defendant neither did nor could appeal from the interlocutory decree, for it did not grant an injunction; the letters patent having expired shortly before it was entered. To have it reviewed, the defendant must await the \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 375]\n\u00a0\n final decree and appeal from that, which would bring under review the entire proceedings, if challenged in the assignments of error.\n Up to and including the entry of the interlocutory decree, the proceedings were had while Judge Humphrey was holding the District Court. He died June 14, 1918, while the master was proceeding with the accounting, and the subsequent proceedings in that court were had before Judge FitzHenry.\n January 6, 1921, the master filed his report finding that the defendant's profits from the infringement were $650,044.83, and recommending that the plaintiff recover that sum. When filing the report, the master also turned in the evidence taken before him, but omitted to say so in the report. He should have attached to the evidence a certificate stating that it was the evidence, and all the evidence, taken before him, but he failed to attach any certificate. The clerk, although receiving the evidence as turned in by the master, omitted to put a filing indoresment thereon.\n Both parties files exceptions to the report; the exceptions purporting to be based on the evidence and treating it as duly reported. A hearing on the exceptions resulted, April 30, 1924, in a final decree overruling the exceptions, confirming the report, and awarding the plaintiff the sum reported by the master, with interest and costs. In a memorandum opinion explaining the rulings, the court indicated that the evidence taken by the master was before it and was extensively examined.\n July 1, 1924, the defendant sought and the District Judge allowed an appeal from the final decree to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both that decree and the interlocutory decree were challenged in the assignments of error-each as being without support in and contrary to the evidence underlying it. \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 376]\n\u00a0\n At the appellant's instance the time for filing a transcript of the record in the Court of Appeals was enlarged a year by successive orders of the District Judge. During that period the appllant, on its own responsibility, prepared, printed, and lodged with the clerk for certification a proposed transcript. This transcript was in nine volumes, about 5,000 pages, and consisted mostly of evidence set forth without any approval or authentication by the court or judge, and without appreciable attempt at condensation or narration, save as some exhibits may have been omitted.\n April 24, 1925, after lodging the proposed transcript with the clerk and delivering a printed copy thereof to the appellee, the appellant filed with the clerk and served on the appellee a praecipe designating what should be included in the certified transcript-the designation conforming to what the appellant had embodied in the transcript proposed. The praecipe described the evidence to be included as 'printed pages 24 to 1215, inclusive,' which were the pages of the proposed transcript purporting to set forth the evidence underlying the interlocutory decree, and certain other 'printed pages,' which were the pages of that transcript purporting to contain the evidence taken before the master and accompanying his report. The appellee made no objection to the praecipe, to the designation of the evidence, or to the form in which the same was set forth at the pages indicated; nor did it file a praecipe for anything more. Accordingly the clerk, on June 24, 1925, attached to the proposed transcript his certificate stating that it was true, complete, and prepared in accordance with the praecipe.\n July 3, 1925, the appellant filed the certified transcript in the Court of Appeals, but omitted to file therewith the requisite copies These were supplied four months later. \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 377]\n\u00a0\n November 3, 1925, the appellant requested the Circuit Court of Appeals to divide the argument on the appeal by first hearing and deciding the questions arising on the interlocutory decree and, if it was sustained, then hearing and deciding the questions arising on the final decree. The appellee objected to this, and in that connection suggested (a) that all evidence appearing in the transcript be stricken therefrom, because not stated in simple and condensed form, and, where consisting of the testimony of witnesses, not stated in narrative form, but set forth in full in the original form, contrary to rule 75b of the Equity Rules; and ( b) that the evidence received at the hearing which resulted in the interlocutory decree be stricken from the transcript, for the further reason that it was not approved or authenticated by the court or judge as required by that rule. November 9, 1925, the request to divide the argument was denied, and consideration of the suggestions that the evidence be stricken from the transcript was postponed until the hearing on the merits.\n January 29, 1926, at the appellant's instance, the Circuit Court of Appeals remitted the transcript to the District Court to enable it to 'amend its certificate of evidence,' and to make 'such further amendment, correction, or amplification as the District Judge may, upon his attention being brought to the matter, see fit to make respecting the certification of the record.' In this order the Circuit Court of Appeals expressly retained jurisdiction of the appeal, directed that the transcript, when corrected, be returned to that court, and reserved all questions respecting the validity and effect of the correction until the hearing on the merits.\n March 29, 1926, the appellant presented to the District Court a motion asking it to 'append its certificate of evidence' to the remitted transcript, and further to amend, correct, or amplify the certification of the record \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 378]\n\u00a0\n as it might deem proper. The appellee had due notice of this motion, appeared specially for the sole purpose of challenging the court's power to grant the motion, and declined to take any further part in that proceeding. The court called and examined some of its officers respecting the identity of the evidence received and filed at the time of the hearing before Judge Humphrey which resulted in the interlocutory decree, and found from such examination that that evidence was truly and completely set forth in the transcript. The court further found that specified exhibits were put in evidence before the master and reported by him, and, supposing that they were not included in the original transcript, it ordered that they be embodied in a supplemental transcript. Neither party made any effort at that time to have the evidence condensed or the testimony put in narrative form. On the contrary, it appears from the court's order that the appellant requested, and the court directed, that 'all the testimony in this cause be reproduced in the exact words of the witnesses, and not in narrative form.' The order further said:\n'And pages 24 to 4872, inclusive, of the transcript of record heretofore certified by the clerk of this court on June 29, 1925, amended and supplemented as herein directed, are hereby approved as a true, complete, and properly prepared statement of the evidence.'\n\n There was no other approval or authentication by the court or judge.\n April 13, 1926, the original transcript was returned to the Circuit Court of Appeals, accompanied by a supplemental transcript, designated volume 10, setting forth the later proceedings in the District Court and the exhibits, which it directed to be included as part of the evidence taken and reported by the master.\n October 6, 1926, the cause was heard on the merits in the Circuit Court of Appeals. At this hearing the appellee renewed its prior suggestions that the evidence be stricken \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 379]\n\u00a0\n from the transcript, because not brought into the record conformably to rule 75b of the Equity Rules, and also insisted that the situation had not been changed by the later proceeding in the District Court, because (a) that court was at the time without any power to act in the matter; and (b) if having power, had not conformed its action to the requirements of that rule.\n December 13, 1926, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the evidence had not been brought into the record in accordance with rule 75b, and for that reason declined to examine the evidence and affirmed the decree of the District Court. 16 F.(2d) 751. The appellant promptly sought a rehearing on the ground, among others, that, if rule 75b applied and had not been followed, the circumstances were such that the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, should not have affirmed the decree, but should have remitted the transcript to the District Court, so that compliance with the rule might be had. A rehearing was denied, and on the appellant's petition a writ of certiorari was granted by this court, to the end that it might consider and determine the procedural questions involved.\n To avoid possible confusion in the further reference to the parties, they will be designated as they were in the Circuit Court of Appeals-the petitioner as appellant, and the respondent as appellee.\n In the federal courts evidence received in a suit in equity usually has been regarded as becoming a part of the record only where made so by some act of the court or judge. In the beginning either of two acts sufficed for the purpose. One was to make an appropriate recital in the decree. The other was to state the evidence or its substance in a separate writing, which was to be filed and deemed a part of the record. Both courses were sanctioned by a provision in the first practice statute. \n1\n That \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 380]\n\u00a0\n provision remained in force only a short period, but the practice continued to be recognized. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In 1912 the matter was dealt with in the Equity Rules, which rest largely on statutes3 investing this court with power 'generally to regulate the whole practice to be used in suits in equity' in the District Courts. Rule 75b (226 U. S., appendix, 23) provides:\n'(b) The evidence to be included in the record shall not be set forth in full, but shall be stated in simple and condensed form, all parts not essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal being omitted and the testimony of witnesses being stated only in narrative form, save that if either party desires it, and the court or judge so directs, any part of the testimony shall be reproduced in the exact words of the witness. The duty of so condensing and stating the evidence shall rest primarily on the appellant, who shall prepare his statement thereof and lodge the same in the clerk's office for the examination of the other parties at or before the time of filing his praecipe under paragraph (a) of this rule. He shall also notify the other parties or their solicitors of such lodgment and shall name a time and place when he will ask the court or judge to approve the statement, the time so named to be at least ten days after such notice. At the expiration of the time named or such further time as the court or judge may allow, the statement, together with any objections made or amendments proposed by any party, shall be presented to the court or the judge, and if the statement be true, complete and properly prepared, it shall be approved by the court or judge, and if it be not true, complete or properly prepared, it shall be made \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 381]\n\u00a0\n so under the direction of the court or judge and shall then be approved. When approved, it shall be filed in the clerk's office and become a part of the record for the purposes of the appeal.'\n\n The appellant contends that this rule can have no application where the appeal is to a Circuit Court of Appeals, first, because the Equity Rules rest on statutes which provide for regulating the practice in the District Courts, not that in the Circuit Courts of Appeals; and, secondly, because another statute has special and exclusive application where the appeal is to a Circuit Court of Appeals. We think the contention must fail for reasons which will be stated.\n It is true that the Equity Rules are based largely on statutes which authorize this court to regulate the practice in suits in equity in 'the District Courts.' But plainly rule 75b is within that authorization. It prescribes the form and manner in which the evidence in suits in equity in those courts may be made a part of the record therein. The prior practice had varied, and experience had shown there was need for uniformity and simplicity. The rule was adopted to meet that need. That it is intended, like the prior practice, to pave the way for an appellate review extending to the evidence, does not make it any the less a regulation of proceedings which are had in the District Courts. Its status, therefore, is not different from that of rule 71, which requires that decrees be put in direct and simple form and be free from any recital of the pleadings, evidence, etc.\n The statute which is cited as having special and exclusive application was enacted February 13, 1911 (36 Stat. 901, c. 47), and is now sections 865 and 866, title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  865, 866; Comp. St.  1656, 1657). It relates to the manner of making up and printing the transcript of the record, in every kind of action or suit, where review is sought in a Circuit Court of Appeals. The provision particularly cited speaks first of the printing and then says that the transcript shall include among \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 382]\n\u00a0\n other things, 'such part or abstract of the proofs as the rules of such Circuit Court of Appeals may require, and in such form as the Supreme Court of the United States shall by rule prescribe.' Section 1 (28 USCA  865; Comp. St.  1656). The provision is loosely phrased, but its meaning is fairly plain. What it says about including proofs doubtless refers to evidence which has become a part of the record in the District Court through a settled bill of exceptions where the case is at law,4 or through an approved statement where the case is in equity. Nothing in the provision evinces a purpose to dispense with either mode of authenticating and preserving the evidence as a part of the record. The concluding clause, 'in such form as the Supreme Court of the United States shall by rule prescribe,' obviously reserves to this court some power of regulation and is not lightly to be put aside. The appellant treats it as relating merely to the form in which the printing is to be done. But the context makes for a broader application. The direction for the printing and that for making up the transcript are both in a single sentence which ends with that clause. Taken in its natural sense the clause qualifies both directions. We think that is the sense intended and that the clause makes it rather plain that there was no purpose to withdraw from this court the power of regulation on which rule 75b depends. The appellant cites our decision in Rainey v. Grace & Co., \n231 \nU.S. 703\n, 34 S. Ct. 242, as if it were to the contrary. But this is a mistaken view. The question presented there related to the printing of the transcript and to the fees to be charged in that connection. Nothing was decided or said respecting the question presented here.\n The appellant next, assuming the rule applies, contends that it was complied with. We perceive no tenable basis for this contention. \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 383]\n\u00a0\n Up to the certification of the original transcript nothing required by the rule had been done. In that situation the evidence should not have been included.\n After the transcript was remitted to the District Court with a view to action under the rule, that court entered an order (a) directing, at the appellant's request, that 'all the testimony' be stated 'in the exact words of the witnesses'; and (b) approving the particular pages of the transcript where the evidence, oral and documentary, was set forth-4,849 pages in all-'as a true, complete and properly prepared statement of the evidence.' This order is the asserted basis of the contention that the rule was complied with. But it does not support the contention. It proceeds on the erroneous assumption that, where either party so requests, the court may dispense entirely with the condensation and narration of the testimony of witnesses, and direct that it be stated in full in their words. The rule says that the evidence 'shall not be set forth in full,' but shall be stated 'in simple and condensed form,' that all that is not essential shall be omitted, and that the testimony of witnesses shall be stated 'only in narrative form, save that, if either party desires it, and the court or judge so directs, any part of the testimony shall be reproduced in the exact words of the witness.' Manifestly the excepting clause is intended to have only a limited operation, and to be applied in the course of the required condensation and narration, as special occasion therefor arises. Its purpose is to provide for the exact reproduction of such parts of the testimony as need to be examined in that form to be rightly appreciated. As to other parts of the evidence, it neither qualifies nor relaxes the direction for condensation and narration. Buckeye Cotton Oil Co. v. Ragland (C. C. A.) 11 F.(2d) 231, 232.\n The transcript shows that in fact no part of the evidence was condensed or put in narrative form, and also that as to nearly all of the testimony there was no occasion for \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 384]\n\u00a0\n reproducing it in the words of the witnesses. Had the rule been complied with, the evidence would have been reduced in volume two-thirds or more; and had this work been done at the outset the charge for printing would have been proportionally less-probably more than enough to offset the cost of compliance. One object of the rule is to eliminate immaterial and redundant matter, and to effect such a condensation and statement of what remains as will simplify and facilitate the task of counsel in presenting, and of the court in determining, questions turning on the evidence. Here the requirement looking to the attainment of that object was wholly neglected.\n The appellant invokes the statute which directs that technical errors and defects not affecting the substantial rights of the parties be disregarded. 5 But the error here is not merely abstract or formal. It consists of a total failure to observe an important regulation in a matter of substance. Nor is it harmless. It makes the case difficult of presentation by counsel, and materially augments the task of examination and decision by the court. Repetition of it in other cases would soon congest the dockets of the appellate courts. To condone such an error is not, we think, within the purpose of the statute.\n The next question is whether there were circumstances which should have impelled the Circuit Court of Appeals, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to remit the transcript to the District Court again, so that full compliance might be had with the rule. The pertinent circumstances and not in controversy, save as the parties interpret them differently.\n As a remission which necessarily must be futile would not be proper, we shall notice at the outset three matters \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 385]\n\u00a0\n which the appellee insists would prevent a remission from being effective. The first is that jurisdiction of the cause passed from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals when the appeal was perfected. From this it is argued that the District Court would be without power to take any action in the cause during the pendency of the appeal. We recognize the principle intended to be invoked, but think it does not go so far. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by remitting the transcript for compliance with the equity rule, would be in effect directing action in aid of its appellate jurisdiction; and the District Court, in conforming to the direction, would be recognizing, rather than encroaching, on that jurisdiction. The second matter is that the term of the District Court at which the decree was entered expired shortly thereafter without any reservation of further time for settling a statement of the evidence. This, it is said, put an end to the District Court's power to act under the equity rule. We think otherwise. Power to act under that rule is not confined to the term at which the decree is rendered, nor to a period allowed during that term. Such a restriction was not recognized in the early practice and is not expressed in the rule. Other rules, such as 69 and 72, show that where a restriction of that nature is intended it is expressed. This interpretation of the rule has been adopted by the Circuit Court of Appeals, so far as they have spoken on the subject. \n6\n The third matter is that by reason of the death of Judge Humphrey, who presided at the interlocutory hearing, the master's failure to attach a certificate to the evidence taken before him, and the clerk's failure to place a filing indorsement thereon, the usual and favored means of identifying the evidence are not avail \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 386]\n\u00a0\n able. We think what is said in the forepart of this opinion shows that other adequate means of identification are at hand. The District Court experience no difficulty in this regard when it made the order of approval under the first remission.\n We come then to the circumstances bearing on the question of discretion. The rule was promulgated in 1912. The requirement respecting condensation and narration was not drawn from the earlier practice, but was new. Its enforcement was slowly approached. For a time transgression was indulgently overlooked. Then this court and some of the Circuit Courts of Appeals, having called special attention to the requirement, began to give effect to it. \n7\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit continued to be uniformly indulgent until it came to decide this case. There may have been some scolding before, but not in the court's opinions. It was a common practice in that circuit for the judges, circuit as well as district, to direct that all the testimony be reproduced in the words of the witnesses. In so directing in this case the District Court followed that practice. Of course the practice was in contravention of the equity rule, and the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in giving effect to the rule by declining to examine the mass of evidence wrongly reproduced. But the court did not stop there. It also affirmed the decree, because of the transgression, and this notwithstanding the transgression was largely due to its own course of action. That was a very severe penalty to impose for action which had the court's implied sanction \n\n[275 U.S. 372, 387]\n\u00a0\n up to that time. The fact is not overlooked that after the original transcript was filed the appellee called attention to the requirement for condensation and narration and asked that the rule be given effect. But regard also is had for the fact that, when the transcript was remitted, the District Court directed the reproduction of the testimony without condensation or narration.\n When the particular situation in the Seventh Circuit is considered, we think it is apparent that the Circuit Court of Appeals passed the bounds of a sound discretion in affirming the decree, because of the transgression, and that, upon proper terms, it should have remitted the transcript to the District Court to the end that a further opportunity might be had to comply with the equity rule. Such a remission should still be made, care being taken to require that the proceedings under the rule be conducted with reasonable dispatch.\n As the rule places the duty of condensing and narrating the evidence primarily on the appellant, and most of the proceedings since the appeal have been attributable to the failure to discharge that duty, the appellant should be required, as one of the terms of the remission, to pay into the Circuit Court of Appeals $5,000 for the benefit of the appellee, by way of reimbursing it for counsel fees and expenses incurred in securing the elimination of the irregular and objectionable statement of the evidence, and also to pay, as one of such terms, the costs in this court and those in the Circuit Court of Appeals up to the time our mandate reaches that court.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals accordingly is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20,  19, 1 Stat. 83. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Conn v.

Stout, both of Bowling Green, Ky., for petitioner. \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. M. Logan, of Frankfort, Ky., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued petitioner and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company in the United States court for the Western District of Kentucky to prevent interference with the carrying out of a contract between the railroad company and the respondent. The District Court entered a decree in favor of respondent. The railroad company declining to join, petitioner alone appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (15 F.(2d) 509), and this court granted a writ of certiorari (\n273 \nU.S. 690\n, 47 S. Ct. 472).\n Respondent is a Tennessee corporation carrying on a transfer business at Bowling Green, Ky. The petitioner is a Kentucky corporation in competition with respondent. The railroad company is a Kentucky corporation. In 1925 it made a contract with respondent whereby it granted the exclusive privilege of going upon its trains, into its depot, and on the surrounding premises to solicit transportation of baggage and passengers. And \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 523]\n\u00a0\n it assigned a plot of ground belonging to if for the use of respondent's taxicabs while awaiting the arrival of trains. In consideration of the privileges granted, respondent agreed to render certain service and to make monthly payments to the railroad company. The term of the contract was fixed at one year to continue for consecutive yearly periods until terminated by either party on 30 days' notice.\n Jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked on the ground that the controversy was one between citizens of different states. The complaint alleges that the railroad company failed to carry out the contract in that it allowed others to enter upon its property to solicit transportation of baggage and passengers and to park on its property vehicles used for that purpose. It alleges that petitioner entered, solicited business and parked its vehicles in the places assigned to respondent, and also on an adjoining street so as to obstruct the operation of respondent's taxicabs. Petitioner's answer alleges that respondent was incorporated in Tennessee for the fraudulent purpose of giving the District Court jurisdiction and to evade the laws of Kentucky. It asserts that the contract is contrary to the public policy and laws of Kentucky as declared by its highest court, and that it is monopolistic in excess of the railroad company's charter power and violates section 214 of the Constitution of the state.\n The record shows that, in September, 1925, respondent was organized in Tennessee by the shareholders of a Kentucky corporation of the same name then carrying on a transfer business at Bowling Green and having a contract with the railroad company like the one here involved; that the business and property of the Kentucky corporation were transferred to respondent, and the former was dissolved. Respondent's incorporators and railroad representatives, preferring to have this controversy deter \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 524]\n\u00a0\n mined in the courts of the United States, arranged to have respondent organized in Tennessee to succeed to the business of the Kentucky corporation and to enter into this contract in order to create a diversity of citizenship. The District Court found there was no fraud upon its jurisdiction, held the contract valid, and found, substantially as alleged in the complaint, that petitioner violated respondent's rights under it. The decree enjoins petitioner from continuing such interference.\n\n 1. \nSection 37 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  80) requires any suit commenced in a District Court to be dismissed, if it shall appear that the suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within its jurisdiction or that the parties have been improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable in such court. The requisite diversity of citizenship exists. And the controversy is real and substantial. The privilege granted is valuable. Petitioner treats the contract as invalid, and claims to be entitled, without the consent of the railroad company, to use railroad property to park its vehicles and solicit business. The railroad company has failed to protect the rights it granted. The motives which induced the creation of respondent to become successor to its Kentucky grantor and take a transfer of its property have no influence on the validity of the transactions which are the subject of the suit. The succession and transfer were actual, not feigned or merely colorable. In these circumstances, courts will not inquire into motives when deciding concerning their jurisdiction. McDonald v. Smalley et al., 1 Pet. 620, 624. It is enough that respondent is the real party in interest. Smith et al. v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198, 216.

East Side Canal Co., \n211 \nU.S. 293\n, 29 S. Ct. 111. The District Court had jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nPetitioner maintains that the contract is not enforceable because in excess of the railroad company's power under its charter, and cites the decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in McConnell v. Pedigo, 92 Ky. 465, 18 S. W. 15. That case involved a grant by the railroad company of the exclusive privilege of standing hacks at the platform of its depot in Glasgow. The court did not refer to any of the terms of the charter. But petitioner states that the railroad company was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of Kentucky, approved March 4, 1850, and purports to quote the section relating to corporate powers:\n'The said Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company ... may make all such regulations, rules and by-laws as are necessary for the government of the corporation, or for effecting the object for which it is created: Provided, that such regulations, rules and by-laws shall not be repugnant to the laws and constitution of said states or the United States. ...'\n\n The opinion does not hold or suggest that the contract was contrary to any provision of the Constitution or statutes of Kentucky or in violation of federal law. The court's conclusion rests on its determination of a question of general law, and not upon a construction of the charter. Moreover, that court has given this charter a much broader construction than that insisted on by petitioner. In Louis- \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 526]\n\u00a0\n ville Property Co. v. Commonwealth, 146 Ky. 827, 143 S. W. 412, 38 L. R. A . (N. S.) 830, it held that:\n'In the maintenance of a place for hotel or restaurant accommodations, and for pleasure, recreation and rest, such as is afforded by a park, neither the letter nor the spirit of the Constitution or statute is violated, but the railroad company acts in the exercise of certain implied powers which it is not prohibited to exercise.'\n\n So far as concerns the railroad company's charter authority to make it, the contract is clearly within the principle of that decision.\n\n 3. \nSection 214 of the Kentucky Constitution provides that no railway company shall make any exclusive or preferential arrangement for the handling of freight 'or for the conduct of any business as a common carrier.' Petitioner invokes the last clause. The railroad company is under no obligation to transport passengers or baggage from its station. McConnell v. Pedigo, supra, 468 (18 S. W. 15). It is not bound to permit those engaged in such transportation to use its property, to solicit patronage, park their vehicles or otherwise to carry on their business. The contract does not relate to the railroad company's business as a common carrier. D. L. & W. R. R. Co. v. Morristown, February 20, 1928, \n276 \nU.S. 182\n, 48 S. Ct. 276.\n\n 4. \nThe Court of Appeals of Kentucky held such contracts invalid in McConnell v. Pedigo, supra, and Palmer Transfer Co. v. Anderson, 131 Ky. 217, 115 S. W. 182, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 756, 133 Am. St. Rep. 237. Invalidity of a similar contract was assumed arguendo in Commonwealth v. Louisville Transfer Co., 181 Ky. 305, 204 S. W. 92. As reasons for its conclusion, that court suggests that the grant of such privileges prevents competition, makes such discrimination as is unreasonable and detrimental to the public and constitutes such a preference over other transfer men as to give grantee a practical monopoly of the business. It has not held them repugnant to any provision of the statutes or Constitution of the state. The question there decided \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 527]\n\u00a0\n is one of general law. Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., \n199 \nU.S. 279, 300\n, 26 S. Ct. 91. This court holds such contracts valid. Donovan Case, supra, 297 (26 S. Ct. 91); Morristown Case, supra. And these decisions show that, without its consent, the property of a railroad company may not be used by taxicabmen or others to solicit or carry on their business, and that it is beyond the power of the state in the public interest to require the railroad company without compensation to allow its property so to be used.\n And state courts quite generally construe the common law as this court has applied it.

St. Rep. 328.\n In harmony with the Kentucky decisions, the highest courts of Indiana and Mississippi hold such contracts invalid. Indianapolis Union R. Co. v. Dohn, 153 Ind. 10, 53 N. E. 937, 45 L. R. A. 427, 74 Am. St. Rep. 274; State v. Reed, 76 Miss. 211, 24 So. 308, 43 L. R. A. 134, 71 Am. St. Rep. 528. The same conclusion is reached in Cravens v. Rodgers, 101 Mo. 247, 14 S. W. 106; Montana Union Ry. Co. v. Langlois, 9 Mont. 419, 24 P. 209, 8 L. R. A. 753, 18 Am. St. Rep. 745; Kalamazoo Hack & Bus Co. \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 528]\n\u00a0\n v. Sootsma, 84 Mich. 194, 47 N. W. 667, 10 L. R. A. 819, 22 Am. St. Rep. 693. But in each of the last three cases the conclusion rests, at least in part, upon a provision of state statute or Constitution.\n Arrangements similar in principle to that before us are sustained in English courts. Perth General Station Committee v. Ross, L. R. App. Cas. ( 1897) 479; In re Beadell, 2 C. B. (N. S.) 509; Barker v. Midland Ry. Co., 18 C. B. 45.\n The cases cited show that the decisions of the Kentucky Court of Appeals holding such arrangements invalid are contrary to the common law as generally understood and applied. And we are of opinion that petitioner here has failed to show any valid ground for disregarding this contract and that its interference cannot be justified. Care is to be observed lest the doctrine that a contract is void as against public policy be unreasonably extended. Detriment to the public interest is not to be presumed in the absence of showing that something improper is done or contemplated. Steele v. Drummond, November 21, 1927, \n275 \nU.S. 199\n, 48 S. Ct. 53. And it is to be remembered, as stated by Sir George Jessel, M. R., in Printing Company v. Sampson, L. R. 19 Eq. 462, 465, that public policy requires that competent persons 'shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts, when entered into fairly and voluntarily, shall be held sacred, and shall be enforced by courts of justice.' The station grounds belong to the railroad company, and it lawfully may put them to any use that does not interfere with its duties as a common carrier. The privilege granted to respondent does not impair the railroad company's service to the public or infringe any right of other taxicabmen to transport passengers to and from the station. While it gives the respondent advantage in getting business, passengers are free to engage any one who may be ready to serve them. The carrying out of such contracts generally makes for good order at railway sta- \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 529]\n\u00a0\n tions, prevents annoyance, serves convenience and promotes safety of passengers. D. L. & W. R. R. Co. v. Morristown, supra. There is here no complaint by or on behalf of passengers; no lack of service, unreasonable exaction or inconvenience of the public is shown. It would be unwarranted and arbitrary to assume that this contract is contrary to public interest. The grant of privileges to respondent creates no duty on the part of the railroad company to give like privileges to others, and therefore there is no illegal discrimination. And, as the state is without power to require any part of the depot ground to be used as a public hack stand without providing just compensation therefor, then a fortiori such property may not be handed over for the use of petitioner without the consent of the owner.\n\n 5. \nThe decree below should be affirmed unless federal courts are bound by Kentucky decisions which are directly opposed to this court's determination of the principles of common law properly to be applied in such cases. Petitioner argues that the Kentucky decisions are persuasive and establish the invalidity of such contracts, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in refusing to follow them. But, as we understand the brief, it does not contend that, by reason of the rule of decision declared by section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (now R. S.  721, U. S. C. tit. 28,  725 (28 USCA  725)), this court is required to adopt the Kentucky decisions. But, granting that this point is before us, it cannot be sustained. The contract gives respondent, subject to termination on short notice, license or privilege to solicit patronage and park its vehicles on railroad property at train time. There is no question concerning title to land. No provision of state statute or Constitution and no ancient or fixed local usage is involved. For the discovery of common-law principles applicable in any case, investigation is not limited to the \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 530]\n\u00a0\n decisions of the courts of the state in which the controversy arises. State and federal courts go to the same sources for evidence of the existing applicable rule. The effort of both is to ascertain that rule. Kentucky has adopted the common law, and her courts recognize that its principles are not local but are included in the body of law constituting the general jurisprudence prevailing wherever the common law is recognized. Hunt v. Warnicke's Heirs Hardin (3 Ky.) 61; Lathrop v. Commercial Bank, 8 Dana, 114, 121, 33 Am. Dec. 481; Ray v. Sweeney, 14 Bush, 1, 9, et seq., 29 Am. Rep. 388; AEtna Insurance Co. v. Commonwealth, 106 Ky. 864, 876, 51 S. W. 624, 45 L. R. A. 355; Nider v. Commonwealth, 140 Ky. 684, 686, 131 S. W. 1024, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 1246. And see 1 Kent's Commentaries (14th Ed.) pp. 451, 602. As respects the rule of decision to be followed by federal courts, distinction has always been made between statutes of a state and the decisions of its courts on questions of general law. The applicable rule sustained by many decisions of this court is that, in determining questions of general law, the federal courts, while inclining to follow the decisions of the courts of the state in which the controversy arises, are free to exercise their own independent judgment. That this case depends on such a question is clearly shown by many decisions of this court. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 19, was an action on a bill of exchange. Mr. Justice Story, writing for the court, fully expounded section 34 of the Judiciary Act. Carpenter v. Insurance Co., 16 Pet. 495, 511, held that the construction of an insurance policy involves questions of general law. Lane v. Vick, 3 How. 464, involved the construction of a will. It was said (page 476):\n'This court do not follow the state courts in the construction of a will or any other instrument, as they do in the construction of statutes.'\n\n Foxcroft v. Mallett, 4 How. 353, 379, held that the decision of a state court construing a deed is not conclusive on this court. Chicago City v. Robbins, 2 Black, 418, 428, declined to follow the determination of the state court as to what \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 531]\n\u00a0\n constitutes negligence. Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497, 506, held that the determination of what constitutes a dedication of land to public use is one of general law. Olcott v. Fond du Lac County, 16 Wall. 678, 689, held that the determination of what is a public purpose to warrant municipal taxation involves a question of general law. New York Cent. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 366, declined to follow the state rule as to liability of common carriers for injury of passengers. Liverpool & G. W. S. Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 443\n, 9 S. Ct. 469, held a question concerning the validity of a contract for carriage of goods is one of general law. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 370\n, 13 S. Ct. 914, so held as to the responsibility of a railroad company to its employees for personal injuries. Beutler v. Grand Trunk Railway, \n224 \nU.S. 85, 88\n, 32 S. Ct. 402, decides who are fellow servants as a question of general law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The lower courts followed the well-established rule, and rightly held the contract valid. The facts shown warrant the injunction granted.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 532]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n This is a suit brought by the respondent, the Brown and Yellow Taxicab and Transfer Company, as plaintiff, to prevent the petitioner, the Black and White Taxicab and Transfer Company, from interfering with the carrying out of a contract between the plaintiff and the other defendant, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company. The plaintiff is a corporation of Tennessee. It had a predecessor of the same name which was a corporation of Kentucky. Knowing that the Courts of Kentucky held contracts of the kind in question invalid and that the Courts of the United States maintained them as valid, a family that owned the Kentucky corporation procured the incorporation of the plaintiff and caused the other to be dissolved after conveying all the corporate property to the plaintiff. The new Tennessee corporation then proceeded to make with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company the contract above mentioned, by which the Railroad Company gave to it exclusive privileges in the station grounds, and two months later the Tennessee corporation brought this suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming a decree of the District Court, granted an injunction and upheld this contract. It expressly recognized that the decisions of the Kentucky Courts held that in Kentucky a railroad company could not grant such rights, but this being a 'question of general law' it went its own way regardless of the Courts of this State. 15 F.(2d) 509.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals had so considerable a tradition behind it in deciding as it did that if I did not regard the case as exceptional I should not feel warranted in presenting my own convictions again after having stated them in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S. Ct. 140. But the question is important and in my opinion the prevailing doctrine has been accepted upon a subtle fallacy \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 533]\n\u00a0\n that never has been analyzed. If I am right the fallacy has resulted in an unconstitutional assumption of powers by the Courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct. Therefore I think it proper to state what I think the fallacy is.-The often repeated proposition of this and the lower Courts is that the parties are entitled to an independent judgment on matters of general law. By that phrase is meant matters that are not governed by any law of the United States or by any statute of the State-matters that in States other than Louisiana are governed in most respects by what is called the common law. It is through this phrase that what I think the fallacy comes in.\n Books written about any branch of the common law treat it as a unit, cite cases from this Court, from the Circuit Courts of Appeal, from the State Courts, from England and the Colonies of England indiscriminately, and citicise them as right or wrong according to the writer's notions of a single theory. It is very hard to resist the impression that there is one august corpus, to understand which clearly is the only task of any Court concerned. If there were such a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute, the Courts of the United States might be right in using their independent judgment as to what it was. But there is no such body of law. The fallacy and illusion that I think exist consist in supposing that there is this outside thing to be found. Law is a word used with different meanings, but law in the sense in which courts speak of it today does not exist without some definite authority behind it. The common law so far as it is enforced in a State, whether called common law or not, is not the common law generally but the law of that State existing by the authority of that State without regard to what it \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 534]\n\u00a0\n may have been in England or anywhere else. It may be adopted by statute in place of another system previously in force. Boquillas Cattle Co. v. Curtis, \n213 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 29 S. Ct. 493. But a general adoption of it does not prevent the State Courts from refusing to follow the English decisions upon a matter where the local conditions are different. Wear v. Kansas, \n245 \nU.S. 154, 156\n, 157 S., 38 S. Ct. 55. It may be changed by statute (Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 378\n, 13 S. Ct. 914), as is done every day. It may be departed from deliberately by judicial decisions, as with regard to water rights, in States where the common law generally prevails. Louisiana is a living proof that it need not be adopted at all. (I do not know whether under the prevailing doctrine we should regard ourselves as authorities upon the general law of Louisiana superior to those trained in the system.) Whether and how far and in what sense a rule shall be adopted whether called common law or Kentucky law is for the State alone to decide.\n If within the limits of the Constitution a State should declare one of the disputed rules of general law by statute there would be no doubt of the duty of all Courts to bow, whatever their private opinions might be. Mason v. U. S., \n260 \nU.S. 545, 555\n, 43 S. Ct. 200; Gulf Refining Co. v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 125, 137\n, 46 S. Ct. 52. I see no reason why it should have less effect when it speaks by its other voice. See Benedict v. Ratner, \n268 \nU.S. 353\n, 45 S. Ct. 566; Sim v. Edenborn, \n242 \nU.S. 131\n, 37 S. Ct. 36. If a State Constitution should declare that on all matters of general law the decisions of the highest Court should establish the law until modified by statute or by a later decision of the same Court, I do not perceive how it would be possible for a Court of the United States to refuse to follow what the State Court decided in that domain. But when the Constitution of a State establishes a Supreme Court it by implication does make that declaration as clearly as if it had said it in express words, so \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 535]\n\u00a0\n far as it is not interfered with by the superior power of the United States. The Supreme Court of a State does something more than make a scientific inquiry into a fact outside of and independent of it. It says with an authority that no one denies except when a citizen of another State is able to invoke an exceptional jurisdiction that thus the law is and shall be. Whether it be said to make or to declare the law, it deals with the law of the State with equal authority however its function may be described.\n Mr. Justice Story in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, evidently under the tacit domination of the fallacy to which I have referred, devotes some energy to showing that section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20 (28 USCA  725), refers only to statutes when it provides that except as excepted the laws of the several States shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in Courts of the United States. An examination of the original document by a most competent hand has shown that Mr. Justice Story probably was wrong if anyone is interested to inquire what the framers of the instrument meant. 37 Harvard Law Review, 49, at pages 81-88. But this question is deeper than that; it is a question of the authority by which certain particular acts, here the grant of exclusive privileges in a railroad station, are governed. In my opinion the authority and only authority is the State, and if that be so, the voice adopted by the State as its own should utter the last word. I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields.\n In view of what I have said it is not necessary for me to give subordinate and narrower reasons for my opinion that the decision below should be reversed. But there are adequate reasons short of what I think should be recognized. This is a question concerning the lawful use of land in Kentucky by a corporation chartered by Ken- \n\n[276 U.S. 518, 536]\n\u00a0\n tucky. The policy of Kentucky with regard to it has been settled in Kentucky more more than thirty-five years. McConnell v. Pedigo (1892) 92 Ky. 465, 18 S. W. 15. Even under the rule that I combat, it has been recognized that a settled line of state decisions was conclusive to establish a rule of property or the public policy of the State. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., \n175 \nU.S. 91, 100\n, 20 S. Ct. 33. I should have supposed that what arrangements could or could not be made for the use of a piece of land was a purely local question, on which, if on any thing, the State should have its own way and the State Courts should be taken to declare what the State wills. See especially George T. Smith Middlings Purifier Co. v. McGroarty, \n136 \nU.S. 237, 241\n, 10 S. Ct. 1017.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see Watson v. Tarpley, 18 How. 517; Mercer County v.

SILBERMAN(1928)\nNo. 190\nArgued: Decided: April 16, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and Farwell Knapp and Lucius F. Robinson, both of Hartford, Conn., for Blodgett.\n Messrs. Abraham L. Gutman and Kenneth Dayton, both of New York City, for Silberman.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Seth T. Cole, of Albany, N. Y., for Tax Commissioner of New York and Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation of Massachusetts, as amici curiae by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases, which are really one, grow out of the operation of a transfer tax by the state of Connecticut. They are brought to this Court, one by certiorari and one by writ of error. The questions presented are whether the tax on the transfer of certain parts of the large estate of Robert B. Hirsch was in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that they were tangible property in New York and not in Connecticut. Hirsch died September 23, 1924, domiciled at Stamford, Conn., leaving a will with two codicils executed in accordance with the laws of both New York and Connecticut. The plaintiffs are the surviving executors of the will. Hirsch left real estate, chattels, cattle, horses and poultry in Connecticut, and also a debt due from a resident of Connecticut and a certificate of stock in a Connecticut corporation, as to all of which there is no dispute about the tax that was imposed. The great bulk of his estate, however, consisted of (1) a large interest, as general partner, appraised at $1,687,245.34, in the partnership of William Openhym & Sons, doing business in New York, and organized under the Limited Partnership Act of that State; (2) certificates of stock in New York, New Jersey and Canada corporations, appraised at $277,864.25; (3) bonds and Treasury \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n certificates of indebtedness of the United States, appraised at $615,121. 17; (4) a small savings bank account in New York; (5) a life insurance policy in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York payable to the estate; and (6) a small amount of bank bills and coin in a deposit box in New York. All the bonds and certificates of stock at the time of the decedent's death, and for a long time prior thereto, had been physically placed and kept in safe deposit boxes in New York City and were never in Connecticut. The partnership assets consisted of real estate in New York and also in Connecticut, merchandise, chattels, credits, and other personal property. The testator bequeathed the larger part of his estate to charitable and educational corporations organized under the laws of New York and existing in that state. The executors offered the will and codicils for probate in New York. They were admitted to probate in the Surrogate's Court in the county of New York, and thereafter the executors proceeded in the settlement of the estate in New York. They have paid from the funds of the estate legacies provided in the will and codicils amounting to $299,297.45. They have also paid the debts, the federal estate tax and the New York transfer or inheritance tax, which amounted to $ 19,166.04. The transfer report in that court exempted the legacies bequeathed to charitable and educational institutions in accord with New York law. The executors have paid to the trustees named in the will and codicils the amount therein mentioned for the benefit of certain persons named. The executors sold the stocks standing in the name of the decedent and made transfer of the same to the purchaser, and the Mutual Life Insurance Company paid to the executors the proceeds of the policy. The National City Bank of New York paid to the executors the amount of a small deposit account therein to the credit of the decedent at the time of his death. \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n On January 8, 1925, the executors presented to the court of probate, for the Stamford district of Connecticut, an exemplified copy of the will and codicils from the record of the proceedings in the Surrogate's Court in New York, and on January 15, 1925, that court received the will and codicils, and accepted a bond for the executors and issued to them letters testamentary, made an order limiting the time for the presentation of claims, directed the filing of an inventory of all the property, including choses in action of the estate of the decedent, and appointed appraisers who made and filed the inventory of all the foregoing items of property belonging to the decedent at the time of his death.\n On September 1, 1925, the executors filed in the probate court for the Stamford district, and with the tax commissioner for Connecticut, a statement under oath covering the property of the estate and the claimed deductions therefrom, all this for the purpose of determining the succession tax, if any, due the state of Connecticut. The tax commissioner thereafter, filed a copy of his computation of the tax with the probate court, to which the executors made objection, but that court, on December 4, 1925, made its order and decree approving the computation of $188,780. 58, and directed the executors to pay this amount to the state treasurer.\n From this order the plaintiff executors took an appeal to the superior court of Fairfield county, and then by stipulation of the parties the case was reserved for the advice and direction of the Supreme Court of Errors as to what judgment, decree or decision should be made or rendered thereon by the superior court.\n The chief questions considered by the Supreme Court of Errors were, first, whether the interest of the decedent in the partnership of Openhym & Sons was subject to a transfer tax in Connecticut, and, second, whether the bonds of the United States and certificates of its indebted- \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n ness were to be deemed tangible property in New York and beyond the taxing jurisdiction of the state of Connecticut. There were other questions of taxable jurisdiction over other items of the estate, but we shall consider these two first.\n The Supreme Court of Errors held, first, that the interest of the decedent in the partnership was a chose in action and intangible, and the transfer thereof was subject to the tax imposed by the law of the decedent's domicile; second, that the bonds and certificates of the United States were tangible property having a situs in New York, and were not within the taxable jurisdiction of Connecticut, but were to be regarded as in the same class of tangibles as the paintings, works of art and furniture considered in the case of Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316, In that case, Pennsylvania, the state of Mr. Frick's domicile, sought to impose a transfer or succession tax on the paintings and other tangible personalty, which had always been in New York City, and it was held that they had an actual situs in New York, and that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, Pennsylvania could impose no transfer or succession tax in respect of them. Applying what it conceived to be the principle of that case to the bonds of the United States and certificates of its indebtedness in this, the Supreme Court of Errors held that their transfer could not be taxed in Connecticut.\n The superior court, following the advice of the Supreme Court of Errors (Silberman, Appeal of (Conn.) 134 A. 778), entered a judgment giving full effect to it. That is the final judgment in the case, and it is the judgment now to be reviewed.\n In No. 191 a writ of error was allowed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors and the presiding judge of the superior court in the state of Connecticut under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, Act of February 13, 1925 (chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937 (28 USCA  344)), to the final and consolidated judgment of the superior court of Con- \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n necticut as the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had, because there was drawn in question therein the validity of chapter 190 of the Public Acts of 1923 of Connecticut, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and especially to the Fourteenth Amendment thereof, in that the statute as construed and applied by the superior court levied a succession tax on the transfer and succession of property and choses in action of the decedent which were within the jurisdiction of New York and not within the jurisdiction of Connecticut, the decedent's domicile.\n In No. 190, the state tax commissioner applied for a writ of certiorari to the same consolidated judgment, and sought a reversal of that judgment in so far as it denied to the state of Connecticut, because of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the power and right created by its statute (chapter 190 of the Public Acts of 1923), to tax the transfer of the United States bonds and certificates of indebtedness and of $287.50 in bank notes and coin, all in a safe deposit box in the city and state of New York, as not within the taxing jurisdiction of Connecticut.\n Had the Supreme Court of Errors put its ruling against the validity of part of the tax on the construction of the state Constitution or statute, we could not review that ruling, because it would have involved only a question of state law, but, so far as the ruling was put on the ground that the state could not impose the tax consistently with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a federal question is presented which we may consider, and, when we have determined the federal questions, the cause will go back to the state court for further proceedings not inconsistent with our views on such federal questions.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n The Connecticut Succession and Transfer Act (chapter 190 of the Public Acts of 1923) says in its section 1:\n'All property and any interest therein owned by a resident of this state at the time of his decease, and all real estate within this state owned by a nonresident of this state at the time of his decease, which shall pass by will or inheritance under the laws of this state; and all gifts of such property by deed, grant, or other conveyance, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of such grantor or donor, shall be subject to the tax herein prescribed.'\n\n This is a tax not upon property but upon the right or privilege of succession to the property of a deceased person as is made clear in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Errors in this and prior cases. Silberman v. Blodgett, 105 Conn. 192, 134 A. 778; Corbin v. Townshend, 92 Conn. 501, 103 A. 647; Hopkins' Appeal, 77 Conn. 644, 60 A. 657; Warner v. Corbin, 91 Conn. 532, 100 A. 354; Gallup's Appeal, 76 Conn. 617, 57 A. 699; Nettleton's Appeal, 76 Conn. 235, 56 A. 565. These cases are all in accord with Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 47\n, 20 S. Ct. 747, 750, in which it was said by this Court that:\n'Taxes of this general character are universally deemed to relate, not to property eo nomine, but to its passage by will or by descent in cases of its intestacy, as distinguished from taxes imposed on property, real or personal as such, because of its ownership and possession. In other words, the public contribution which death duties exact is predicated on the passing of property as the result of death, as distinct from a tax on property disassociated from its transmission or receipt by will, or as the result of intestacy.'\n\n The power of the state of a man's domicile to impose a tax upon the succession to, or the transfer of, his intangible property, even when the evidences of such property are outside of the state at the time of his death has been constantly asserted by the Legislatures of the various \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n states. The Supreme Court of Errors in its opinion in this case says that at the present time the inheritance tax laws of over four-fifths of the states impose a tax similar to that imposed by Connecticut. Frothingham v. Shaw, 175 Mass. 59, 55 N. E. 623, 78 Am. St. Rep. 475; In re Estate of Zook (Mo.) 296 S. W. 778; In re Sherwood's Estate, 122 Wash. 648, 211 P. 734; Mann v. Carter, 74 N. H. 345, 68 A. 130, 15 L. R. A. (N. S.) 150; People v. Union Trust Co., 255 Ill. 168, 99 N. E. 377, L. R. A. 1915D, 450, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 514; In re Lines' Estate, 155 Pa. 378, 26 A. 728; In re Estate of Hodges, 170 Cal. 492, 150 P. 344, L. R. A. 1916A, 837; Commonwealth v. Williams' Executor, 102 Va. 778, 47 S. E. 867, 1 Ann. Cas. 434. The same principle was recognized by this Court in Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456; before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the principle was reaffirmed thereafter in Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S. Ct. 213; Keeney v. New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139; and Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473. In the latter case the question arose as to the power of Wisconsin to impose a tax upon the succession to certain intangible property of one of its citizens, the evidences of which were held by a trust company in Illinois upon a revocable trust at the time of his death, and the power was sustained. Reference to the record in the case shows that the property included shares of stock in Missouri, New Jersey and Illinois corporations; stock in a national bank organized under the National Banking Act; mortgage bonds and debentures issued by New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri, Utah and Kansas corporations; promissory notes of residents of Illinois and Minnesota; insurance policies issued by New York, Canadian and Wisconsin insurance companies; and money on deposit in two Illinois banks. The same principle was affirmed in the Frick Case.\n At common law the maxim 'mobilia sequunter personam' applied. There has been discussion and criticism of the application and enforcement of that maxim, but it is so fixed in the common law of this country and of England, in so far as it relates to intangible property, including choses in action, without regard to whether they are \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n evidenced in writing or otherwise and whether the papers evidencing the same are found in the state of the domicile or elsewhere, and is so fully sustained by cases in this and other courts, that it must be treated as settled in this jurisdiction whether it approve itself to legal philosophic test or not.\n Further, this principle is not to be shaken by the inquiry into the question whether the transfer of such intangibles, like specialties, bonds or promissory notes, is subject to taxation in another jurisdiction. As to that we need not inquire. It is not the issue in this case. For present purposes it suffices that intangible personalty has such a situs at the domicile of its owner that its transfer on his death may be taxed there.\n This brings us to the question whether the partnership interest of the decedent in William Openhym & Sons was a chose in action and intangible personalty. The partnership was a limited partnership organized in New York; the last agreement therefor having been executed in December, 1921. The New York partnership law then in force was chapter 408, Laws of 1919\n\n\n Under section 51 of this law, a partner is a co-owner with his partner of specific partnership property, holding this property as a tenant in partnership. Such tenancy confers certain rights with limitations. A partner has a right equal to that of his partners to possess specific partnership property for partnership purposes, but not otherwise. His right in specific partnership property is not assignable, nor is it subject to attachment or execution upon a personal claim against him; upon his death the right to the specific property vests not in the partner's personal representative but in the surviving partner; his right in specific property is not subject to dower, curtesy, or allowance to widows, heirs or next of kin.\n Section 52 specifically provides:\n'A partner's interest in the partnership is his share of the profits and surplus and the same is personal property.' \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n Under section 73, when any partner dies and the partnership continues, his personal representative may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained and receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the partnership with interest.\n\n Under section 98, c. 640, Laws of 1922, the rights of a general partner in a limited partnership, which was the interest of the decedent here when he died, are identical with those of a general partner in a general partnership. And in regard to a limited partner's interest, section 107 of the law specifically provides:\n'A limited partner's interest in the partnership is personal property.'\n\n It is very plain, therefore, that the interest of the decedent in the partnership of William Openhym & Sons was simply a right to share in what would remain of the partnership assets after its liabilities were satisfied. It was merely an interest in the surplus, a chose in action. It is an intangible, and carries with it a right to an accounting.\n There were among the holdings and property of the partnership buildings and land. Although these statutes were passed after the decision in Darrow v. Calkins, 154 N. Y. 503, 49 N. E. 61, 48 L. R. A. 299, 61 Am. St. Rep. 637, we have no reason for thinking that the partnership law of New York is now any different from what its Court of Appeals said it was in that case (pages 515, 516 (49 N. E. 64)) as follows:\n'It is, however, generally conceded that the question whether partnership real estate shall be deemed absolutely converted into personalty for all purposes, or only converted pro tanto for the purpose of partnership equities, may be controlled by the express or implied agreement of the partners themselves, and that where by such agreement it appears that it was the intention of the partners that the lands should be treated and administered \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n as personalty for all purposes, effect will be given thereto. In respect to real estate purchased for partnership purposes with partnership funds and used in the prosecution of the partnership business, the English rule of 'out and out' conversion may be regarded as properly applied on the ground of intention, even in jurisdictions which have not adopted that rule as applied to partnership real estate acquired under different circumstances and where no specific intention appeared. The investment of partnership funds in lands and chattels for the purpose of a partnership business, the fact that the two species of property are in most cases of this kind, so commingled that they cannot be separated without impairing the value of each, has been deemed to justify the inference that under such circumstances the lands as well as the chattels were intended by the partners to constitute a part of the partnership stock and that both together should take the character of personalty for all purposes, and Judge Denio in Collumb v. Read (24 N. Y. 505), expressed the opinion that to this extent the English rule of conversion prevailed here. That paramount consideration should be given to the intention of the partners when ascertained, is conceded by most of the cases.'\n\n It thus clearly appears that both under the partnership agreement and under the laws of the state of New York the interest of the partner was the right to receive a sum of money equal to his share of the net value of the partnership after a settlement, and this right to his share is a debt owing to him, a chose in action, and an intangible. We concur with the Supreme Court of Errors that as such it was subject to the transfer tax of Connecticut.\n We come then to the second question, whether bonds of the United States and certificates of indebtedness of the United States deposited in a safe deposit box in New York City, and never removed from there, owned by the \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n decedent at the time of his death, were intangibles which come within the rule already stated.\n The argument is that such bonds payable to bearer and transferable from hand to hand have lost their character as choses in action and have taken on the qualities of physical property, and cases are cited to indicate that they can be made the subject of execution and constitute a basis for the jurisdiction of the courts and of taxing officers of the state in which the paper upon which the evidence of the debt or obligation is written is found, although their owner lives and dies in another state.\n The Supreme Court of Errors takes this view, citing Frick v. Pennsylvania, and holds that the transfer of the United States bonds and certificates is taxable only in New York where they are, and only there. The court cites, as sustaining its conclusion that the transfer of the bonds is only taxable in New York, the case of State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300. This case is often cited to the point that Mr. Justice Field takes as indisputable (on page 319) that a state may not tax property that is not within its jurisdiction-a matter recognized in Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 489\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 202\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; and Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 206\n, 5 S. Ct. 826. The effect of some of Mr. Justice Field's language in that case, and the exact point on which the decision there turned, have since been fully discussed by this Court and qualified in Savings & Loan Society v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421, 428\n, 18 S. Ct. 392; New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309, 319\n, 320 S., 20 S. Ct. 110; and Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 23 S. Ct. 277. The tax there held invalid was a tax imposed by a statute of Pennsylvania upon the interest due a nonresident bondholder on bonds issued by a corporation of that state. It is now settled in these later cases that the point decided in the State Tax on \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n Foreign-Held Bonds Case was that the law of Pennsylvania in requiring the railroad company, which issued the bonds, to pay the state tax on them and deduct it from the interest due the nonresident owners, was as to them a law impairing the obligation of contracts under Murray v. Charleston, \n96 U.S. 432\n. The case, therefore, is not authority for the proposition for which the Supreme Court of Errors cites it, to wit: That such bonds are to be completely assimilated to tangible personal property. The other cases cited by the Supreme Court of Errors are New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309, 321\n, 20 S. Ct. 110, and like cases which follow it in which a state, not that of the domicile of the owner, has been held to have the right to tax bonds, promissory notes, and other written evidences of choses in action with which business is there carried on for the owner giving them what is sometimes called 'a business situs,' but such cases have little or no bearing on the power of the state of a decedent's domicile to tax the transfer of his bonds which we are now considering.\n The question here is whether bonds, unlike other choses in action, may have a situs different from the owner's domicile such as will render their transfer taxable in the state of that situs and in only that state. We think bonds are not thus distinguishable from other choses in action. It is not enough to show that the written or printed evidence of ownership may, by the law of the state in which they are physically present, be permitted to be taken in execution or dealt with as reaching that of which they are evidence, even without the presence of the owner. While bonds often are so treated, they are nevertheless in their essence only evidences of debt. The Supreme Court of Errors expressly admits that they are choses in action. Whatever incidental qualities may be added by usage of business or by statutory provision, this characteristic remains, and shows itself by the fact that \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n their destruction physically will not destroy the debt which they represent. They are representative, and not the thing itself.\n The case of Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n, is in point. The case came to this Court from the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, and it involved the taxable status in that state of bonds held by one of its citizens and evidencing a debt owing to him by a citizen of Illinois. The court said (page 498):\n'The question does not seem to us to be very difficult of solution. The creditor, it is conceded, is a permanent resident within the jurisdiction of the state imposing the tax. The debt is property in his hands constituting a portion of his wealth, from which he is under the highest obligation, in common with his fellow-citizens of the same state, to contribute for the support of the government whose protection he enjoys.\n\n'That debt, although a species of intangible property, may, for purposes of taxation, if not for all others, be regarded as situated at the domicile of the creditor. It is none the less property because its amount and maturity are set forth in a bond. That bond, wherever actually held or deposited, is only evidence of the debt, and if destroyed, the debt-the right to demand payment of the money loaned, with the stipulated interest-remains. Nor is the debt, for the purposes of taxation, affected by the fact that it is secured by mortgage upon real estate situated in Illinois. The mortgage is but a security for the debt, and, as held in State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds (supra), the right of the creditor 'to proceed against the property mortgaged, upon a given contingency, to enforce by its sale the payment of his demand, ... has no locality independent of the party in whom it resides. It may undoubtedly be taxed by the state when held by a resident therein,' etc. Cooley on Taxation, 15, 63, 134, 270. The debt, then, having its situs at the creditor's \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n residence, both he and it are, for the purposes of taxation, within the jurisdiction of the state.'\n\n The line which was drawn in the case of Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, was one which was adopted from the decision of this Court in Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493, and other cases cited in the same connection, where it was held that the power of taxation could not extend to tangible chattels having an actual situs outside the jurisdiction, although the owner was within it. It was pointed out that this is not true of debts and choses in action which usually have a taxable situs at the owner's domicile. In the Union Refrigerator Case, this Court said (page 205 (26 S. Ct. 38)):\n'In this class of cases the tendency of modern authorities is to apply the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, and to hold that the property may be taxed at the domicile of the owner as the real situs of the debt, and also, more particularly in the case of mortgages, in the state where the property is retained.'\n\n The Court again said (page 206 (26 S. Ct. 38)):\n'The arguments in favor of the taxation of intangible property at the domicile of the owner have no application to tangible property. The fact that such property is visible, easily found and difficult to conceal, and the tax readily collectible, is so cogent an argument for its taxation at its situs that of late there is a general consensus of opinion that it is taxable in the state where it is permanently located and employed and where it receives its entire protection, irrespective of the domicile of the owner. We have, ourselves, held in a number of cases that such property permanently located in a state other than that of its owner is taxable there. Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n (5 S. Ct. 1091); Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n (6 S. Ct. 475); Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n (11 S. Ct. 876); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 U.S. 530\n (8 S. Ct. 961); Railroad Co. \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5 (21 L. Ed. 787); American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 U.S. 70\n (19 S. Ct. 599); Pittsburg Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 U.S. 577\n (15 S. Ct. 415); Old Dominion Steamship Co. v. Virginia, \n198 U.S. 299\n (25 S. Ct. 686, 3 Ann. Cas. 1100).'\n\n The Court continued (page 206 (26 S. Ct. 39)):\n'There are doubtless cases in the state reports announcing the principle that the ancient maxim of mobilia sequuntur personam still applies to personal property, and that it may be taxed at the domicile of the owner, but upon examination they all or nearly all relate to intangible property, such as stocks, bonds, notes and other choses in action. We are cited to none applying this rule to tangible property, and after a careful examination have not been able to find any wherein the question is squarely presented. ...'\n\n The discussion in the Union Refrigerator Case shows what this Court meant in the Frick Case in holding that personal property in the form of paintings and furniture having an actual situs in one state could not be subjected to a transfer tax in another state, and emphasizes the inference that it did not apply to anything having as its essence an indebtedness or a chose in action and could not apply to property in the form of specialties or bonds or other written evidences of indebtedness whether governmental or otherwise, even though they passed from hand to hand. The analogy between furniture and bonds cannot be complete because bonds are representative only and are not the thing represented. They are at most choses in action and intangibles.\n We think, therefore, that the Supreme Court of Errors in extending the rule of the Frick Case from tangible personal property, like paintings, furniture or cattle, to bonds, is not warranted, and to that extent we must reverse its conclusion in denying to Connecticut the right to tax the transfer of the bonds and Treasury certificates. \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n Of course this reasoning necessarily sustains the different view of that court that the transfer of certificates of stock in corporations of other states than Connecticut was taxable in the latter as the transfer of choses in action.\n Among the other items is a savings bank account in New York which is certainly a chose in action and was properly treated as subject to the same rule. So, too, a life insurance policy payable to the estate was also of that character.\n There was a small amount of cash, $287.48, in bank notes and coin in a safe deposit box in New York which the Supreme Court of Errors held not taxable in Connecticut. As to this, the contention on behalf of Connecticut is that it should be treated as attached to the person of the owner and subject to a transfer tax at the domicile. It is argued that it was not like coin or treasure in bulk, but like loose change, so to speak. To money of this amount usually and easily carried on the person, it is said that the doctrine of mobilia sequuntur personam has peculiar application in the historical derivation of the maxim. But we think that money, so definitely fixed and separated in its actual situs from the person of the owner as this was, is tangible property and cannot be distinguished from the paintings and furniture held in the Frick Case to be taxable only in the jurisdiction where they were.\n The results thus stated lead to our reversing the judgment of the Superior Court of Connecticut, in respect to the tax on the transfer of the bonds and certificates of indebtedness of the United States and to our affirming the judgment in other respects.\n It is further contended by the executors that the proceedings in the Connecticut court and the judgment therein fail to give full faith and credit to the public acts, records and proceedings of the state of New York, and that this is in violation of the Constitution of the \n\n[277 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n United States. We do not think there is anything in this point. There is nothing in the proceedings in the Connecticut court that is inconsistent with those in the New York court. There is nothing to indicate that the New York court decided, assuming it had jurisdiction to decide, that there was no power in the state of Connecticut to impose a tax on the transfer that was taxed in Connecticut. More than that, the proceedings and judgment in New York were not such as would conclude Connecticut even with the aid of the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution. Connecticut was not a party to those proceedings or to that judgment, nor was it in privity with any one who was a party.\n Affirmed in part, and reversed in part. \n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 18, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n No. 15.\n\n\n[278 U.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and Foye M. Murphy, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Farnham, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United states.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel in admiralty brought by the petitioner to recover for damages done to its steam lighter Cornelia by a collision with the United States destroyer Bell. It is brought against the United States by authority of a special Act of May 15, 1922, c. 192, 42 Stat., Part 2, 1590. There has been a trial in which both vessels ultimately were found to have been in fault and it was ordered that the damages should be divided. (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 278. Thereafter the damages were ascertained (D. C.) 16 F.(2d) 643) and the petitioner sought to be allowed interest upon its share. ( There was no crosslibel.) The Circuit Court of Appeals, going on the words of the statute, parallel legislation, and the general understanding with regard to the United States, held that no interest could be allowed. 19 F.( 2d) 744. As there was a conflict of opinion with the Second Circuit dealing with similar language in a special act, New York & Cuba Mail S. S. Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 16 F. (2d) 945, a writ of certiorari was allowed by this Court, \n275 \nU.S. 519\n, 48 S. Ct. 121.\n The material words of the Act are that the District Court 'shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the whole controversy and to enter a judgment or decree for the amount of the legal damages sustained by reason of said collision, if any shall be found to be due either for or against the United States, upon the same principle and measure of liability with costs as in like cases in admiralty between private parties with the same rights of appeal.' On a hasty reading one might be led to believe that Con- \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n gress had put the United States on the footing of a private person in all respects. But we are of opinion that a scrutiny leads to a different result. It is at least possible that the words fixing the extent of the government's liability were carefully chosen, and we are of opinion that they were. We start with the rule that the United States is not liable to interest except where it assumes the liability by contract or by the express words of a statute, or must pay it as part of the just compensation required by the Constitution. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 306 S., 43 S. Ct. 354 (67 L. Ed. 664). Next we notice that when this special act was passed there was a recent general statute on the books, the Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95,  3, 41 Stat. 525, 526 (46 USCA  743), allowing suits in admiralty to be brought in personam against the United States, in which it was set forth specifically that interest was to be allowed upon money judgments and the rate was four per centum not the six per centum that the petitioner expects to get. The later general statute passed as a substitute for special bills like the one before us, allows suits in admiralty for damages done by public vessels but excludes interest in terms. Act of March 3, 1925, c. 428,  2, 43 Stat. 1112 (46 USCA  782).\n We are satisfied by the argument for the Government that the policy thus expressed in the Act of 1925 had been the policy of the United States for years before 1922 and that the many private acts like the present generally have been understood, before and since the act now in question not to carry interest by the often repeated words now before us. This was stated by the Attorney General in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Claims when the Act of 1925 was under consideration (Sen. Report 941, p. 12, 68th Cong., 2d Sess.) and the bill was amended so as to remove all doubt. The Act of March 2, 1901, c. 824, 31 Stat. 1789, believed to be the first of the private acts in the present \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n form, was passed after an amendment striking out an allowance of interest, thus showing that the words now relied upon then were understood not to allow it. The same thing has happened repeatedly with later acts, and when by exception interest has been allowed it has been allowed by express words. Before 1901, since 1871, such cases had been referred to the Court of Claims which was forbidden by statute to allow interest. Rev. Sts.  1091; Code, title 28,  284, (28 USCA  284). It is said that when the meaning of language is plain we are not to resort to evidence in order to raise doubts. That is rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law and does not preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists. If Congress has been accustomed to use a certain phrase with a more limited meaning than might be attributed to it by common practice it would be arbitrary to refuse to consider that fact when we come to interpret a statute. But as we have said the usage of Congress simply shows that it has spoken with careful precision, that its words mark the exact spot at which it stops, and that it distinguishes between the damages caused by the collision and the later loss caused by delay in paying for the first- between damages and 'the allowance of interest on damages' as it is putby Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland, \n118 \nU.S. 507\n, 6 S. Ct. 1174.\n What the Act authorizes the Court to ascertain and allow is the 'amount of the legal damages sustained by reason of said collision.' Of these interest is no part. It might be in case of the detention of money. But this is not a claim for the detention of money, nor can any money be said to have been detained. When a jury finds a man guilty of a tort or a crime it may determine not only the facts but also a standard of conduct that he is presumed to have known and was bound at his peril to follow. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Ct. 780. But legal fiction never reached the height of holding a defendant bound \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 49]\n\u00a0\n to know the estimate that a jury would put upon the damage that he had caused. As the cause of action is the damage not the detention of the money to be paid for it, it could be argued in a respectable Court, as late as 1886, that at common law, even as a matter of discretion, interest could not be allowed. Frazer v. Bigelow Carpet Co., 141 Mass. 126, 4 N. E. 620. And although it commonly is allowed in admiralty still the element of discretion is not wholly absent there. As stated by Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland, \n118 \nU.S. 507\n, 6 S. Ct. 1174, 'the allowance of interest on damages is not an absolute right.' When the Government is concerned there is no obligation until the statute is passed and the foregoing considerations gain new force.\n It has been urged that the United States would claim interest and that as the statute speaks of 'damages ... due either for or against the United States' the claims on the two sides stand alike. But that is not true. The United States did not need the statute, and it has been held that, even in the adjustment of mutual claims between an individual and the Government, while the latter is entitled to interest on its credits it is not liable for interest on the charges against it. United States v. Verdier, \n164 \nU.S. 213, 218\n, 219 S., 17 S. Ct. 42; United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 336\n, 40 S. Ct. 518.\n The mention of costs and the omission of interest against helps the conclusion to which we come. Compare Judicial Code,  152, and the same,  177; U. S. Code, title 28,  258, 284 (28 USCA  258, 284).\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERAND (dissenting).\n In collision cases between private parties, interest, as a general rule, is allowed upon the amount of the loss sustained. That the allowance may be to some extent in the discretion of the court does not affect the question presented here, since the court below denied interest not as \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 50]\n\u00a0\n a matter of discretion but upon the ground that it had no power to allow it against the United States. From an examination of the record, it fairly may be assumed that if the case had been one between private parties interest would have been allowed.\n It is said that when interest is allowed it is no part of the damages. But, very clearly, I think, the settled rule is to the contrary. When the obligation to pay interest arises upon contract, it is recoverable thereon as damages for failure to perform;; 'and when recoversable in tort it is chargeable on general principles as an additional element of damage for the purpose of full indemnity to the injured party.' 1 Sutherland on Damages (4th Ed.)  300, p. 939. In Wilson v. City of Troy, 135 N. Y. 96, 32 N. E. 44, 18 L. R. A. 449, 31 Am. St. Rep. 817, the New York Court of Appeals, holding that in certain actions sounding in tort interest is allowed 'as a part of the damages' as matter of law, said (pages 104, 105 ( 32 N. E. 46)):\n'The reason given for the rule is that interest is as necessary a part of a complete indemnity to the owner of the property as the value itself, and in fixing the damages, is not any more in the discretion of the jury than the value. ... In an early case in this state the principle was recognized that interest might be allowed, by way of damages, upon the sum lost by the plaintiff in consequence of defendant's negligence. Thomas v. Weed, 14 Johns. 255.'\n\n These principles find abundant support in the decisions of this court.\n In The Atlas, \n93 U.S. 302\n, 310 (23 L. Ed. 863), the general rule is laid down that satisfaction for the injury sustained is the true rule of damages, and that by this is meant that the measure of compensation shall be equal to the amount of injury received, to be calculated for the actual loss occasioned by the collision, upon the principle that the sufferer is entitled to complete indemnification for his loss. Complete recompense for the injury is required.\n In The Wanata, \n95 U.S. 600\n, 615 (24 L. Ed. 461), this court, pointing out the essential difference between costs and interest, \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 51]\n\u00a0\n said:\n'Interest is not costs in any sense, and, when allowed, it should be decreed as damages, and be added to the damages awarded in the District Court.'\n\n In United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 10 S. Ct. 920, 922 (34 L. Ed. 336), this court said:\n'Interest, when not stipulated for by contract, or authorized by statute, is allowed by the courts as damages for the detention of money or of property, or of compensation, to which the plaintiff is entitled. ...'\n\n In The Santa Maria, 10 Wheat. 431, 445 (6 L. Ed. 359), Mr. Justice Story, speaking for the court, said:\n'Damages are often given by way of interest, for the illegal seizure and detention of property; and, indeed, in cases of tort, if given at all, interest partakes of the very nature of damages.'\n\n In The Umbria, \n166 \nU.S. 404, 421\n, 17 S. Ct. 610 (41 L. Ed. 1053), this court recognized that the general rule was that in cases of total loss by collision damages are limited to the value of the vessel, with interest thereon, etc.\n See, also, Redfield v. Ystalyfera Iron Co., \n110 \nU.S. 174, 176\n, 3 S. Ct. 570; The Scotland, \n105 U.S. 24\n, 35 (26 L. Ed. 1001).\n It does not seem necessary to cite the numerous decisions of the lower federal and state courts to the same effect. A very good statement is to be found in Balano v. The Illinois (D. C.) 84 F. 697, where it was held that the value of the injury done to the vessel is to be ascertained, and then an amount equal to interest thereon to the time of the trial may be added, not strictly as interest, but as part of the damage compensation. The court said:\n'The sum called interest added to the $5,000 was necessary to make full compensation at this time. It is not strictly interest-which is due only for the withholding of a debt-but the compensation for the permanent injury to the vessel was due as of the time when it was inflicted, and the addition of what is called interest is justly added for withholding it. ... It is quite well settled that in ascertaining the amount of compensation to be \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n paid, it is justificable to find the extent of the injury valued in money, and add a sum equal to interest to make compensation at the time of such finding.'\n\n This is in accordance with the general rule that for the wrongful sinking of a ship the owner is entitled to restitutio in integrum, that is, he entitled 'to put in as good position pecuniarily as if his property had not been destroyed.' Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 155\n, 158 S., 45 S. Ct. 465, 467 (69 L. Ed. 890).\n In the light of the foregoing, I am unable to see any ground for differentiating the rule of damages applicable to the present case from that applicable to eminent domain cases, that is to say, the owner is entitled to the amount that would be just compensation if the ship had been taken by the power of eminent domain. Just compensation means:\n'The full and perfect equivalent of the property taken. ... The owner shall be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken. ... The owner is not limited to the value of the property at the time of the taking; he is entitled to such addition as will produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. Interest at a proper rate is a good measure by which to ascertain the amount so to be added.' Seaboard Air Line By. v. U. S., \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 306 S., 43 S. Ct. 354, 356 (67 L. Ed. 664).\n\n See, also, Liggett & Myers v. U. S., \n274 \nU.S. 215\n, 47 S. Ct. 581\n\n\n In Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 258\n, 45 S. Ct. 73, 78 (69 L. Ed. 265), the rule is stated:\n'Generally, interest is not allowed upon unliquidated damages. Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 653 (20 L. Ed. 860). But when necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include interest or its equivalent as an element of damages.'\n\n It fillows indubitably from these premises that interest is allowable against the United States by the words 'legal damages' ex vi termini. If additional reason for this \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 53]\n\u00a0\n conclusion be needed, it will be found in the definite determination of this court that the obligation of the United States to pay interest may be imposed by the name of damages as well as by the name of interest. Angarica v. Bayard, \n127 \nU.S. 251, 260\n, 8 S. Ct. 1156, 1161 (32 L. Ed. 159 ), where it is said that one of the recognized exceptions to the rule that the United States is not liable to pay interest is:\n'Where interest is given expressly by an act by Congress, either by the name of interest or by that of damages.'\n\n For this conclusion, the court cites a number of opinions of the Attorneys General of the United States, among them that of Attorney General cushing reported in 7 Op. Attys. Gen. 523, from the headnote to which the language above quoted was taken. In the course of that opinion the Attorney General said (page 531):\n'There is another possible case of apparent, but not real, exception, if the case exists, and that is, of 'damages' provided by statute to be assessed against the government. In one of the general acts above cited, a statute interest on the detention of money is the established rendering of the term 'damages.' 1 Stat. at Large, p. 85. If, therefore, any such case of claim on the government can be shown, with color of demand for interest as 'damages,' it will be no departure from the rule never to allow interest except on express requirement of statute.'\n\n By the statute under consideration the United States is made liable for 'legal damages' upon the same principle and measure of liability as in like cases between private parties. The authorities above reviewed, put the meaning of these words beyond all reasonable doubt; and it is not permissible to attempt to vary that meaning by construction. The rule announced by Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 96 (5 L. Ed. 37):\n'Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for construction. The case must be a strong one, \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 54]\n\u00a0\n indeed, which would justify a court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves did not suggest,'\n\n -has, ever since, been followed by this court.\n In Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 20 S. Ct. 155, 157 (44 L. Ed. 219), it is said:\n'The general rule is perfectly well settled that, where a statute is of doubtful meaning and susceptible upon its face of two constructions, the court may look into prior and contemporaneous acts, the reasons which induced the act in question, the mischiefs intended to be remedied, the extraneous circumstances, and the purpose intended to be accomplished by it, to determine its proper construction. But where the act is clear upon its face, and when standing alone it is fairly susceptible of but one construction, that construction struction must be given to it' (citing cases).\n\n And the court added (page 421 (20 S. Ct. 158)):\n'Indeed, the cases are so numerous in this court to the effect that the province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, that an extended review of them is quite unnecessary. The whole doctrine applicable to the subject may be summed up in the single observation that prior acts may be resorted to, to solve, but not to create an ambiguity.'\n\n It was further said that if the section of law there under consideration were an original act there would be no room for construction, and that only by calling in the aid of a prior act was it possible to throw a doubt upon its proper interpretation.\n The rule was tersely stated in United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396 (18 L. Ed. 830):\n'If the language be clear it is conclusive. There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.'\n\n This is also the recognized rule of the English courts. In one of the English decisions Lord Denman said the \n\n[278 U.S. 41, 55]\n\u00a0\n court was bound to look to the language employed and construe it in its natural and obvious sense, even though that was to give the words of the act an effect probably never contemplated by those who obtained the act and very probably not intended by the Legislature which enacted it. The King v. The Commissioners, 5 A. & E. 804, 816. See, also, United States v. Lexington Mill Co., \n232 \nU.S. 399\n, 34 S. Ct. 337, L. R. A. 1915B, 774; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 485\n, 37 S. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168; Russell Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514, 519\n, 43 S. Ct. 428.\n The enforcement of the statute according to its plain terms results in no absurdity or injustice, for, as this court recently said, in holding the United States liable for damages including interest in a collision case where the government had come into court to assert a claim on its own behalf:\n'The absence of legal liability in a case where but for its sovereignty it would be liable does not destroy the justice of the claim against it.' United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328, 340\n, 45 S. Ct. 112, 113 (69 L. Ed. 313).\n\n To refuse interest in this case, in my opinion, is completely to change the clear meaning of the words employed by Congress by invoking the aid of extrinsic circumstances to import into the statute an ambiguity which otherwise does not exist and thereby to set at naught the prior decisions of this court and long-established canons of statutory construction.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, Jr. Justice SANFORD, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOUNTIFUL BRICK CO. v. GILES(1928)\nNo. 193\nArgued: January 18, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry D. Moyle, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. B. Horovitz, of Boston, Mass., and Harvey H. Cluff, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for determination is whether the Utah Workmen's Compensation Act (Comp. Laws Utah 1917,  3113, and subsequent amendments), which provides compensation for personal injury or death of an employee by accident 'arising out of and in the course of his employment,' as it was construed and applied to the facts by the court below, contravenes the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It is difficult to make a satisfactory statement of the facts from the evidence because of the absence from the record of a plat of the premises which was used before the state industrial commission and referred to by the witnesses, particular places, position of railway tracks, etc., being pointed out by references to the plat. But considering the testimony in connection with the findings of the industrial commission and of the court below, the following is a fair summary:\n On June 17, 1925, Nephi Giles, an employee of the brick company, while crossing the tracks of the Bamberger Electric Railroad Company on his way to work, was struck by a train and killed. The yard of the brick company is on the west side of the railway tracks immediately adjacent thereto, and connected therewith, as the commission found, by a spur. The railroad tracks run north and south. Giles resided-and the evidence indicates that the employees generally resided-easterly from the railway tracks. In going from their homes to the brickyard, it was impossible to avoid crossing the railway tracks. There was a public crossing, called the Burns road, about 200 yards south of the brickyard. The right of way of \n\n[276 U.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n the railway company opposite the yard was fenced on both sides. Giles, as well as other employees, in going to work, sometimes followed the Burns road to the railway crossing, and then went north along the railway tracks to the northeast corner of the brickyard, and thence through a gap in the fence to the north entrance of the yard; and sometimes employees, including Giles, entered the right of way through the east fence at other points north of the Burns road, and thence crossed the tracks more or less directly to the gap. This varied practice was well known to the company and carried on without objection on its part. It was possible to reach the brickyard by following the Burns road across the railway tracks and for a distance west, and thence northerly and easterly to the west entrance of the yard, but this way was long, circuitous and inconvenient, and, so far as the evidence shows, not used. A deep open ditch lying north of the road prevented access to the south end of the brickyard.\n The manager of the company testified that he knew of the many ways by which the employees crossed the tracks; that he had seen Giles coming in all ways; that he cautioned Giles a number of times to be careful, but did not instruct him or any of the employees to discontinue these methods of crossing.\n On the occasion of the accident which resulted in his death, Giles entered the Bamberger right of way through the wire fence on the east side at a point nearly opposite the gap in the west fence. He was struck while proceeding across the tracks to this point of exit.\n From these facts the industrial commission found the company liable and made an award accordingly, which the court below affirmed. 68 Utah, -, 251 P. 555.\n Whether Giles was negligent in entering through the fence where he did, or in crossing the tracks, or in not \n\n[276 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n selecting the safest way, are matters not relevant to the inquiry. Liability was constitutionally imposed under the Utah Compensation Law if there was a causal connection between the injury and the employment in which Giles was then engaged substantially contributing to the injury. Cudahy Co. v. Parramore, \n263 U.S. 418\n, 423-425, 44 S. Ct. 153, 30 A. L. R. 532. And employment includes not only the actual doing of the work, but a reasonable margin of time and space necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done. If the employee be injured while passing, with the express or implied consent of the employer, to or from his work by a way over the employer's premises, or over those of another in such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employer's premises, the injury is one arising out of and in the course of the employment as much as though it had happened while the employee was engaged in his work at the place of its performance. In other words, the employment may begin in point of time before the work is entered upon and in point of space before the place where the work is to be done is reached. Probably, as a general rule, employment may be said to begin when the employee reaches the entrance to the employer's premises where the work is to be done; but it is clear that in some cases the rule extends to include adjacent premises used by the employee as a means of ingress and egress with the express or implied consent of the employer.

A. 1916A, 318.\n In the Parramore Case the same Utah statute was under consideration, and we held that it was valid as applied to the case of an employee who, while on his way to work, \n\n[276 U.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n was killed by a locomotive at a public crossing on a railroad adjacent to his employer's factory. There, as here, it was necessary for the employees, in order to get to the place of work, to cross the tracks, and they were in effect invited by the employer to do so. The difference between the two cases is that in the former the crossing customarily used was entirely upon a public road, while here the way followed was in part along the railway tracks and by crossings within the railroad right of way wherever the employees upon their own volition might choose to go.\n The present case, though it comes nearer the border line, falls within the principle of the Parramore Case. Since the only way of access to its brickyard from the east was across the railway tracks, the company necessarily contemplated the crossing of them by its employees. No definite line of travel being indicated by the company or followed by the employees, who, with the company's full knowledge and acquiescence, habitually crossed wherever they saw fit, it results that, however the crossing was made, the risk thereby incurred was reasonably incidental to the employment and became annexed as an implied term thereof. If it were necessary to strengthen the implication of consent on the part of the company to the crossing by any way its employees chose to take, it would be enough to refer to the testimony of the manager, who, knowing of the practice, did not forbid it, but in effect approved it by warning Giles simply to be careful.\n It is said that Giles was a trespasser upon the railroad right of way; but if that be established by the evidence, the answer is that, if the company, not being the owner, could under any circumstances defend upon that ground (Daltry v. Electric Light Co., 208 Pa. 403, 411-412, 57 A. 833 ), it cannot avail itself of the defense here because it consented to the trespass.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRIMSTONE R. & CANAL CO. v. UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. R. Liskow, of Lake Charles, La., Wylie M. Barrow, of Baton Rouge, La., and James T. Kilbreth, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. W. Knowlton and P. J. Farrell, both of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant seeks annulment of an Interstate Commerce Commission order, entered December 14, 1925, which designated the divisions it might thereafter receive from \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n agreed joint rates and required readjustment of divisions received subsequent to August 1, 1921, when the investigation began.\n The court below dismissed the bill. Two of the objections to the order, there advanced, will be considered.\n\n\n (1)\n The Commission failed to investigate or determine the reasonableness or justness of the divisions, or whether they were unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, as between the carriers; also failed to consider whether the circumstances entitled one to a greater or less proportion than another of the joint rates, as commanded by section 15(6), Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  15; Comp. St.  8583).\n\n\n (2)\n The joint rates were agreed upon by the parties, and not 'established pursuant to any finding or order' of the Commission, within section 15(6), Transportation Act 1920. Consequently the Commission had no power to require adjustments for any period prior to the final order.\n Section 1(4), Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St.  8563), directs common carriers to establish through routes, reasonable and equitable rates, fares, and charges; also to establish divisions of joint rates just, reasonable, and equitable as between the participants, which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of them.\n Section 15(1) empowers the Commission, whenever, after full hearing, it shall find any rate charged by a carrier is or will be unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential, or prejudicial, or otherwise in violation of this act, to determine and prescribe the just and reasonable rate thereafter to be observed, and to make an order requiring the carrier to cease and desist from such violation.\n Section 15(3) provides that 'the Commission may, and it shall whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after full hearing,' establish joint \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 110]\n\u00a0\n rates, 'and the divisions of such rates, fares, or charges as hereinafter provided.'\n Section 15(6):\n'Whenever, after full hearing upon complaint or upon its own initiative, the Commission is of opinion that the divisions of joint rates, fares, or charges, applicable to the transportation of passengers or property, are or will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between the carriers parties thereto (whether agreed upon by such carriers, or any of them, or otherwise established), the Commission shall by order prescribe the just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers, and in cases where the joint rate, fare, or charge was established pursuant to a finding or order of the Commission and the divisions thereof are found by it to have been unjust, unreasonable, or inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, the Commission may also by order determine what (for the period subsequent to the filing of the complaint or petition or the making of the order of investigation) would have been the just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers, and require adjustment to be made in accordance therewith. In so prescribing and determining the divisions of joint rates, fares and charges, the Commission shall give due consideration, among other things, to the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated, the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, and the importance to the public of the transportation services of such carriers, and also whether any particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line, and any other fact or circumstance which would ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, entitle \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 111]\n\u00a0\n one carrier to a greater or less proportion than another carrier of the joint rate, fare or charge.'\n\n Appellant owns and operates a railroad ten miles long in southwestern Louisiana, is a common carrier of freight only, and makes interchanges with lines of the Southern Pacific1 and Kansas City Southern. Except five shares, its capital stock-$200,000-is owned by Union Sulphur Company, which operates mines near its line and consigns and receives over 90 per centum of the property moving thereon. Prior to 1920 appellant and connecting carriers established through rates and divisions by agreements. These were modified as permitted or suggested in Ex parte 74 (1920) 58 Interst. Com. R. 220, and Matter of Reduced Rates (1922) 68 Interst. Com. R. 676.\n In Ex parte 74, the Commission considered applications under section 15a,2 Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  15a; Comp. St.  8583a), for authority generally to increase rates so that carriers as a whole might earn a fair return. It found (July 29, 1920, 58 Interst. Com. R. 220): \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 112]\n\u00a0\n ... The following percentage increases in the charges for freight service, including switching and special services, together with the other increases hereinbefore approved, would under present conditions result in rates not unreasonable in the aggregate under section 1 of the act and would enable the carriers in the respective groups, under honest, efficient, and economical management and reasonable expenditures for maintenance of way, structures, and equipment, to earn an aggregate annual railway operating income equal, as nearly as may be, to a return of 5 1\/2 per cent. upon the aggregate value, for the purposes of this proceeding, of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation and one-half of 1 per cent. in addition; Eastern group, 40 per cent.; Southern group, 25 per cent.; Western group, 35 per cent.; Mountain-Pacific group, 25 per cent. ...\n'After carefully considering the situation we find that with the exceptions hereinafter noted general percentage increases made to fit the needs of the groups of lines serving each of the four groups must be considered for present purposes the most practicable. This conclusion is without prejudice to any subsequent finding in individual situations.'\n\n And it accordingly authorized general increases as specified 'in the rates, fares, and charges of railroads within the continental United States.' It did not approve or require the adoption or maintenance of any particular rate.\n In the Matter of Reduced Rates (May 16, 1922) 68 Interst. Com. R. 676, instituted to determine whether further general reductions might be required under section 1, also what would constitute fair return under section 15a(3), after referring to the authorized increases of 1920, the Commission found that 5.75 per centum would be fair thereafter and would result if formerly authorized rates were reduced by specified perentages. The order was that carriers should promptly report 'whether the \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 113]\n\u00a0\n findings herein will be carried into effect without formal order or orders by us.' It did not require the adoption or maintenance of any rate, nor was any particular rate approved.\n August 1, 1921, the Commission began 'an investigation into and concerning the justness, reasonableness, and equitableness of the divisions received by the Brimstone Railroad & Canal Company out of the joint rates applicable to the transportation of property.' It ordered:\n'That the Brimstone Railroad and Canal Company, the Southern Pacific Company, and the Kansas City Southern Railway Company be and they hereby are made respondents to this proceeding.'\n\n Testimony was taken relative to ownership and organization of the Brimstone Company; its relation to Union Sulphur Company; its operating and financial condition, including dividends, surplus, and character of service performed; volume of road-building material carried for parish purposes; establishment by United States Railroad Administration of divisions with connecting lines, with factors considered in connection therewith; comparison between the questioned divisions and those received by otehr lines in the same territory; also value of operating property, including cost of reproduction.\n The Commission's first report-April 4, 1922-declared the Brimstone Company a common carrier subject to the interstate commerce act entitled to participate in joint rates, or have its charges absorbed under appropriate tariff provisions, and further:\n'The divisions to the Brimstone should produce no more than an amount sufficient to cover the cost of its service and a fair return upon the property held for and used in the service of transportation. We conclude that the facts of record, including the dividends paid by the Brimstone in past years and the accumulated credit balance to profit and loss, indicate divisions to the Brimstone \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 114]\n\u00a0\n which are disproportionate, in view of the service rendered, and are tantamount to a rebate to the proprietary company.\n\n'We find that the divisions of joint rates now received by the Brimstone from the two other respondents on interstate traffic are, and for the future will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, and to the extent that they exceed or may exceed the cost of the service and a fair return upon the property held for and used in the service of transportation for the public generally, are excessive, and, in effect, amount to a rebate to the proprietary company. It does not necessarily follow that reasonable and equitable divisions to the Brimstone should be on the maximum basis.\n\n'The record will be held open for a period of ninety days from the date of service of this report, during which respondents will be expected to make the necessary cost studies for the purpose of arriving at reasonable divisions to the Brimstone.'\n\n The subsequent studies related only to the Brimstone Company; they did not extend at all to connecting carriers. The Commission (88 Interst. Com. R. 63, March 10, 1924) said they were 'intended to develop the average cost, including return on investment, of moving loaded cars to any from the Southern Pacific and Kansas City Southern.' No studies were made or evidence taken concerning efficiency of Southern Pacific and Kansas City Southern lines, amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and fair return upon their property, or the public importance of services performed by them, or any other fact or circumstance (except as shown above) which ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, would entitle them to a greater or less proportion of the joint rate. Section 15(6).\n March 10, 1924, a second report and order prescribed what the Brimstone Company might thereafter receive \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 115]\n\u00a0\n from joint rates and ordered readjustment of divisions received after August 1, 1921. No change was directed in the joint rates or finding made relevant to their justness, nor was there any pronouncement concerning apportionments amongst other carriers. The Commission said:\n'Based upon the cost of the service and a fair return upon the property held for and used in the service of transportation for the public generally, we find that during the period from August 1, 1921, to, but not including, July 1, 1922, just, reasonable, and equitable divisions to the Brimstone would have been: (Here follow certain specific divisions.)\n\n'We further find that on and after July 1, 1922, just, reasonable, and equitable divisions to the Brimstone were, are, and for the future will be: (Here follow certain specific divisions.)\n\n'We further find that the divisions received by the Brimstone should be adjusted on a basis not in excess of the charge above found just, reasonable, and equitable during the periods named.'\n\n On December 14, 1925, a final report and order reaffirmed the order of March 10, 1924, with some modifications (presently unimportant) in amounts allowed the Brimstone Company from the joint rates.\n The Commission evidently undertook to deprive the Brimstone Company of receipts supposed to exceed a fair return on its property and award the same to connecting carriers without evidence tending to show they were in need or had or would receive more or less than a fair return from agreed divisions, or that the joint rates themselves were unfair and unjust, or that the agreed divisions were 'unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between the carriers.'\n Counsel suggest that, in addition to facts revealed by studies of the Brimstone Company's affairs, the Commission did consider existing division sheets of joint rates, \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 116]\n\u00a0\n volume and distribution of traffic, past division sheets, divisions accorded to the Brimstone Company by the federal Director General; also testimony showing competition controlled the agreed divisions. But the very definite command of section 15(6) required more than that.\n Both parties rely upon New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270, and United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co. \n265 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S. Ct. 565\n\n\n The first involved an order granting larger divisions to New England roads. We there recognized the necessity of evidence 'typical in character, and ample in quantity, to justify the finding made in respect to each division of each rate of every carrier,' and declared that with such evidence before it the Commission properly proceeded to consider the importance to the public of the weak carriers and directed divisions intended to effectuate the purpose of Congress to insure adequate transportation service for the whole country, by extending aid to them. Nothing in the opinion supports the view that the Commission may take something from one carrier merely because its net revenue appears unduly large and donate this to another demanding nothing and not in need. Cost of service to one carrier is not the only factor to be considered in determining just divisions.\n In the second case the Commission undertook to modify existing divisions for the benefit of a weak road. It did not appear that any matters consideration of which was required by section 15(6), Transportation Act 1920, had been ignored, but the evidence concerning some of these things had not been properly presented and therefore the order was annulled. It was there said:\n \n265 U.S. 284\n (44 S. Ct. 568): 'Relative cost of service is not the only factor to be considered in determining just divisions.'\n \n265 U.S. 291\n (44 S. Ct. 570): 'The power conferred by Congress on the Commission is that of determining, in respect to each joint rate, what divi- \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 117]\n\u00a0\n sions will be just. Evidence of individual rates or divisions, said to be typical of all, affords a basis for a finding as to any one. But averages are apt to be misleading. It cannot be inferred that every existing division of every joint rate is unjust as between particular carriers, because the aggregate result of the movement of the traffic on joint rates appears to be unjust. These aggregate results should properly be taken into consideration by the Commission; but it was not proper to accept them as a substitute for typical evidence as to the individual joint rates and divisions. In the New England Divisions Case, tariffs and division sheets were introduced which, in the opinion of the Commission were typical in character, and ample in quantity, to justify the findings made in respect to each division of each rate of every carrier. A like course should have been pursued in the proceeding under review.'\n The record discloses that before making the challenged order the Commission failed to consider the items indefinitely specified by section 15(6). And it must be annulled.\n The court below gave special attention to the second of the above stated objections to the order. This relates only to the retroactive feature. And it approved what we regard as an erroneous view touching readjustments of past divisions announced by the Interstate Commerce Commission in several proceedings. Pittsburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Pittsburg Co., 61 Interst. Com. R. 272, decided April 5, 1921; Western Maryland Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 69 Interst. Com. R. 703, 707; New York Dock Ry. Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., 89 Interst. Com. R. 695; and Marion & Eastern Ry. Co. v. C. & E. I. R. R. Co., 96 Interst. Com. R. 402.\n Prior to 1920, the Interstate Commerce Act contained the following provisions concerning the readjustments of divisions of rates determined and prescribed by the Commission.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 104, 118]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 15. That whenever, after full hearing ... the Commission shall be of opinion that any individual or joint rates or charges whatsoever demanded, ... are unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or prejudicial or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of this act, the Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable individual or joint rate or rates, charge or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case as the maximum to be charged, ... and to make an order that the carrier or carriers shall cease and desist from such violation to the extent to which the Commission finds the same to exist. ... Whenever the carrier or carriers, in obedience to such order of the Commission or otherwise, in respect to joint rates, fares, or charges, shall fail to agree among themselves upon the apportionment or division thereof the Commission may, after full hearing, make a supplemental order prescribing the just and reasonable proportion of such joint rate to be received by each carrier party thereto, which order shall take effect as a part of the original order. ...' Comp. St.  8583.\n An explanation of the meaning of and reasons underlying that part of section 15 italicized above appears in Morgantown & Kingwood Divisions, 40 Interst. Com R. 509, 510:\n'The provision dates back to the time when the Commission, under section 15 of the original act, had no authority to deal with rates except upon formal complaint. It now constitutes a part of that section, as amended, which gives us power to require, after hearing either upon formal complaint or in a proceeding instituted on our own motion, the establishment and maintenance of joint rates lower than the aggregate of the intermediate rates or joint rates already in effect, or proposed by the carriers in tariffs under suspension. It does not come into play until, as a condition precedent, the Commission has made some re- \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 119]\n\u00a0\n quirement after full hearing. The reason therefor, as we understand it, is to provide a means of determining which carrier, or to what extent each carrier, shall bear an enforced reduction or participate in an approved increase in the existing or proposed through charge. In other words, the Commission, in creating a joint rate or in reducing a joint rate below what had been established voluntarily or is proposed by the carriers, having brought about a situation different from that as to which their agreement applied and not in contemplation when the agreement was made, is to have the power to complete what it has undertaken, in case the carriers themselves do not find it possible to agree upon the divisions of the new rate.'\n\n'The language of the act (1917) seemed to indicate that the authority was to be exercised only when the parties failed to agree among themselves, and only in supplement to some order fixing the rates.' New England Divisions Case, 26s U. S. 194, 43 S. Ct. 274.\n\n The occasion for the changes incorporated in section 15(6), Act 1920, were pointed out before the House Committee by Interstate Commerce Commissioner Clark, July 16, 1919 (House Hearings, Return of Railroads, etc., vol. 1, p. 29). He said:\n'There has been a good deal of difference of opinion, both inside and outside of the Commission, as to its powers under the present act. The act now authorizes the Commission to establish joint rates and says that if the carriers are not able to agree on a division of the rates so prescribed, the Commission may determine those divisions and its decision relative thereto shall become effective as a part of the original order and as of the date upon which the rates tions as to divisions of rates which had not been prescribed by the Commission and which had become unsatisfactory to one or possibly more became effective. But there have come up questhan one carrier. \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 120]\n\u00a0\n The Commission originally held that it did not have jurisdiction to prescribe the divisions of a joint rate that had not been prescribed by it. Morgantown & Kingwood Divisions, supra. Thereafter, the dissatisfied carrier could bring that question at issue by filing a revocation of its concurrence in the rates, or if it happened to be a carrier that published the rates, by filing a cancellation of them. That was frequently protested, often suspended by the Commission, and upon hearing it developed that the only difficulty was their differences as to divisions of rates. Requiring them by order to continue the rates was, in effect, establishing those rates as joint rates, and we thereupon proceeded to prescribe the divisions, if they could not agree.\n\n'Later, by a majority vote, the Commission decided that it had power to prescribe the divisions, even if it had not prescribed the rates ( Morgantown & Kingwood Divisions, 49 Interst. Com. R. 540), but that has not as yet come to rest through any final adjudication.\n\n'Under this amendment the Commission would be authorized to prescribe the divisions of the joint rates, fares, and charges as between the carriers, whether it prescribed the rates or not, and it is provided that if it be a rate, fare, or charge that has been prescribed by the Commission, it may then, by order, make its division of that rate retroactive to the date upon which the rate prescribed by it became effective; but as to rates not prescribed by the Commission, its order prescribing the divisions of the rate would be effective only from the effective date of the order.'\n\n Reporting in behalf of the House Committee (November 10, 1919, H. R. vol. 2, Reports on Public Bills), Chairman Esch said:\n'Section 417 amends section 15 of the Commerce Act so as to give the Commission power not only to fix the maxi- \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 121]\n\u00a0\n mum rate, but to fix the particular rate to be charged, or the maximum, or the minimum, or the maximum and minimum. ...\n\n'The amendment also increases the powers of the Commission in regard to making of through routes and joint rates, authorizing it to prescribe the joint rate or the maximum, or the minimum, or the maximum and minimum. The Commission is authorized to prescribe just and reasonable divisions of joint rates among the several carriers and where the joint rate was fixed by the Commission and the divisions are found to have been unjust, the Commission may determine what would have been the just division thereof, and require adjustment to be made.'\n\n Section 15(6) should be construed in the light of the recognized difficulties. Under the earlier act a clear distinction was made between joint rates 'agreed upon' and those 'determined and prescribed' by the Commission after full hearing 'to be thereafter observed.' The Commission had power to declare proper divisions of those in the latter category by order 'which shall take effect as part of the original order'-that is, from the date the rate was prescribed. Whether it could determine divisions of agreed rates for the future was not clear; but certainly it could not require readjustments of divisions of such rates for past periods. Morgantown & Kingwood Divisions, 40 Interst. Com. R. 509; Id., 49 Interst. Com. R. 540, 551. Section 15(6) established the right to prescribe future divisions of agreed rates, but we think the studied purpose was to grant no power to require readjustments of past receipts from agreed joint rates. Theretofore power in respect of past divisions existed only when rates had been determined and prescribed after full hearing-that is, where the Commission had passed upon the reasonableness of the rate and required observance. Obviously a carrier may have \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 122]\n\u00a0\n assented to a through rate only because of the divisions accorded to it; to permit the Commission to change this arrangement as to past transactions would be exceedingly harsh, if not wholly unreasonable. Ordinarily, divisions of a particular rate are not of public interest, if the rate itself is reasonable. Probably aware of hardships under the old rule, the new act shortened the time during which readjustment might be required-limited its beginning to the commencement of investigation or filing of complaint.\n In support of the retroactive provision of the present order counsel say that joint rates between the Brimstone Company and connecting carriers were made under authority of Ex parte, 74, 58 Interst. Com. R. 220, and Matter of Reduced Rates, 68 Interst. Com. R. 676, and therefore were 'established pursuant to a finding or order of the Commission.' But mere general permission or suggestion concerning rates for all carriers, without consideration of the reasonableness of any particular rate, is not the 'finding or order' referred to by section 15(6). We think that refers to one which, after full hearing, determined and prescribed a rate thereafter to be observed. The contrary view would place substantially all presently existing rates in the class with particular rates established by order of the Commission after full hearing, subject them to retroactive adjustments, and thus destroy the practical value of the distinction which Congress carefully preserved.\n The power to require readjustments for the past is drastic. It may reasonably exist in cases where the particular rate has been approved by the Commission after full hearing; it ought not to be extended so as to permit unreasonably harsh action without very plain words. The general findings and permission of Ex parte 74 and Matter of Reduced Rates did not approve or fix any particular rate and certainly did not determine and prescribe the rates divisions of which are here under consideration. \n\n[276 U.S. 104, 123]\n\u00a0\n Neither case approved 'any specific rate as reasonable in itself or as properly adjusted with respect to other rates nor did it justify in advance any rate which might be published as a result thereof.' In them the Commission was dealing with the whole body of rates throughout the country-were looking at the general level of all rates-and the propriety of the rates to which the Brimstone Company was party was not the subject of particular investigation or consideration. See Morgantown & Kingwood Divisions, 40 Interst. Com. R. 511; Globe Soap Co. v. A. & S. Ry. Co., 40 Interst. Com. R. 121; Steel & Tube Co. v. Director General, 61 Interst. Com. R. 526.\n Section 15(1), Transportation Act 1920, authorizes the Commission, after full hearing, to determine and prescribe joint rates to be thereafter observed. Section 15(3) permits the Commission, after full hearing, to establish joint rates 'and the divisions of such rates, fares, or charges as hereinafter provided.' And section 15(6) authorizes readjustments of divisions already received only when the joint rate was established pursuant to a finding or order of the Commission. Such finding or order must have been under section 15(1) or (3), after full hearing in respect to the specific rate. This construction will insure compliance with the purpose of Congress by requiring the Commission, upon full hearing, to pass upon the particular rate before divisions for the past can be directed. Mere permission to increase or diminish all rates according to the general needs of carriers throughout the country is not enough.\n The decree below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded there for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The lines of the Louisiana Western Railroad are part of the Southern Pacific System. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Transportation Act 1920, sec. 15a (added February 28, 1920).

This will bequeathed to the Safe Deposit & Trust Company of Baltimore $80,000 in trust to pay the income to the petitioner for life, then to her daughters for their lives, and, upon the death of the last survivor, to divide the principal between the descendants then living of the daughters per stirpes. The will was proved in Maryland and in 1914 was admitted to probate in the Corporation Court of Norfolk as a foreign will. The property held in trust has remained in Maryland and no part of it is or ever has been in Virginia.\n The petitioner has paid without question a tax upon the income received by her. But the doctrine contended for now is that the petitioner is chargeable as if she owned the whole. No doubt in the case of tangible prop- \n\n[277 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n erty lying within the State and subject to a paramount lien for taxes, the occupant actually using it may be made personally liable. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n218 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 31 S. Ct. 95; Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, 24 S. Ct. 318. But here the property is not within the State, does not belong to the petitioner and is not within her possession or control. The assessment is a bare proposition to make the petitioner pay upon an interest to which she is a stranger. This cannot be done. See Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n272 \nU.S. 567, 575\n, 47 S. Ct. 202.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v. U. S.(1928)\nNo. 33\nArgued: January 4, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert N. Golding, of Chicago, Ill., for Brown.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case came here from the Circuit Court of Appeals upon a certificate submitting questions upon which instruction was desired. After argument upon the certificate, it was ordered that the entire record be certified to this court, so that the whole matter in controversy might be considered.\n The questions to be determined upon that record arise upon the following facts: The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on July 13, 1925, issued its subpoena, addressed to the National Alliance of Furniture \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n Manufacturers, commanding it to appear before the grand jury at a time and place named and produce:\n'All letters or copies of letters, telegrams, or copies of telegrams, incoming and outgoing, passing between the National Alliance of Furniture Manufacturers and its predecessor, the National Alliance of Case Goods Associations, their officers and agents, and the several members of said National Alliance of Furniture Manufacturers and its predecessor, the National Alliance of Case Goods Associations ( including corporations, partnerships, and individuals, and their respective officers and agents), during the period from January 1, 1922, to June 15, 1925, relating to the manufacture and sale of case goods, and particularly with reference to-\n\n'(a) General meetings of Alliance;\n\n'(b) Zone meetings of Alliance members;\n\n'(c) Costs of manufacture;\n\n'(d) Grading of various types of case goods;\n\n'(e) Issuing new price lists;\n\n'(f) Discounts allowed on price lists;\n\n'(g) Exchanging price lists;\n\n'(h) Maintaining prices;\n\n'(i) Advancing prices;\n\n'(j) Reducing prices;\n\n'(k) Rumors of charges of price cutting;\n\n'(l) Discounts, terms and conditions of sale, etc.;\n\n'(m) Curtailment of production;\n\n'(n) The pricing of certain articles or suits of furniture by W. H. Coye;\n\n'(o) Cost bulletins;\n\n'(p) Intention of W. H. Coye and A. C. Brown to attend furniture markets or expositions at Jamestown, N. Y., Grand Rapids, Mich., Chicago, Ill., and New York City, N. Y., and meetings of members held prior to and during said furniture markets or expositions;\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n '(q) Conditions obtaining at various furniture markets or expositions at Jamestown, N. Y., Grand Rapids, Mich., Chicago, Ill., and New York City, N. Y.;\n'(r) Manufacturers maintaining a fair margin of profit between cost prices and selling prices.'\n\n The subpoena contained no ad testificandum clause.\n Service of this subpoena was made upon Arthur C. Brown, secretary of the Alliance, who appeared in person before the grand jury; refused to say anything concerning the matters set forth in the subpoena unless he should first be subpoenaed and sworn; produced and read to the grand jury a written statement in which, after reciting the service of the subpoena upon him, he said that there was no such person or entity as the National Alliance of Furniture Manufacturers capable of being served with subpoena or of appearing in answer to one, and that he appeared in deference to the official position of the grand jury to inform them of that fact. He declined to say whether his refusal to obey the subpoena ws because to do so would incriminate him in connection with his private and personal affairs. Counsel for the government informed him that the requirements of the subpoena were not with reference to his private or personal affairs but concerned him only as he was connected with the of the Alliance. The grand jury presented Brown to the District Court as a contumacious witness and requested that steps be taken to compel him forthwith to comply with the requirements of the subpoena.\n To this presentment, Brown filed an answer, admitting service of the subpoena upon him, his appearance in person before the grand jury, and the making of the written statement above referred to. He further stated that the Alliance was a voluntary organization of furniture manufacturers, and not a corporation, either de jure or de facto; that the matter then under the investigation by the grand \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n jury was the same matter as had been investigated by a previous grand jury, which had returned an indictment in which he, Brown, was named as a defendant; that prior to the issue of the subpoena in question, a subpoena duces tecum ahd been served upon him, directed to and commanding him to produce the same documents; that in answer thereto he appeared before the grand jury and brought with him the documents so requested, but declined to answer questions propounded unless sworn as a witness; that thereupon he was excused from further attendance upon the grand jury. He further answered that, 'said organization being a voluntary one and not a corporation,' to compel him in response to the subpoena set forth to produce documents in his possession would be to compel him to submit to an unlawful seizure and to produce evidence against himself, in violation of Amendments 4 and 5 of the federal Constitution; that said subpoena failed to show that the documents described were important or material; that it was a blanket command to produce all letters or copies of letters and telegrams sent to or received from a large number, to wit, 192 persons during a period of more than three years, and called for many documents obviously harmless and of no evidentiary value; and that said subpoena was not a bona fide attempt to obtain evidence, but constituted a fishing expedition, undertaken without knowledge whether or not he had in his possession evidence desired by the United States or the grand jury, but undertaken in the hope that evidence might be discovered which could be used against him on trial of the pending indictment or under a new one.\n After a hearing, the court held that no sufficient excuse in law had been shown, and ordered Brown, then present in court, forthwith to appear before the grand jury and produce the evidence called for in the subpoena, whether the grand jury saw fit to administer an oath to him or not. \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n Subsequently Brown again appeared before the grand jury and, being asked to produce the documentary evidence called for in the subpoena, refused to do so, except upon condition that he should be subpoenaed and sworn. He was again presented to the District Court as a contumacious witness, and as for a criminal contempt for the last-mentioned refusal to comply with the requirements of the subpoena. Upon this presentment, the court adjudged Brown guilty of contempt and sentenced him to imprisonment for 30 days.\n The contentions on Brown's behalf are-\n\n\n (1)\n The subpoena was a nullity because directed to an unincorporated association; (2) it was invalid because too broad and indefinite; (3) the order of the District Court compelled Brown to produce his own papers and thereby submit to an unlawful seizure and to incriminate himself in violation of his constitutional rights.\n\n 1. \nThe general rule is that, in the absence of statute, an unincorporated association is not a legal entity which may be sued in the name of the association. Many of the states have adopted statutes expressly providing that such associations may be sued. But an express provision is not indispensable. Such a suit may be maintained in virtue of a necessary implication arising from statutory provisions although the statute does not in terms so provide. Here such an implication arises from the provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209 ( 15 USCA  1-7, 15). That act denounces as illegal every contract, combination, and conspiracy in restraint of interstate and foreign trade, and provides that every person who shall make any such contract or engage in such combination or conspiracy shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Section 8 of the act provides that the word 'person' shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of the United States, of any territory, state, or foreign country; that the Alliance \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n was an association within the meaning of this section, and therefore subject to the provisions of the act is clear. The provisions of the act creating criminal and civil liability against such an association necessarily carry the implication that it may be proceeded against by its common name to enforce the liability. Consequently, for a violation of the Anti-Trust Act, it may be prosecuted, indicted, convicted, and judgment rendered against it and satisfied by execution out of its assets. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 U.S. 344\n, 385-391, 392, 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762; Dowd v. United Mine Workers of America (C. C. A.) 235 F. 1, 5, 6. To say that an association thus may be prosecuted, indicted, convicted, fined, and judgment satisfied, and that appropriate process may be issued and executed to these ends, but that a subpoena duces tecum without an at testificandum clause (Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 372\n, 31 S. Ct. 538, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558) cannot in the course of the very proceeding go against it by its common name, would be to utter an absurdity. While the subpoena duces tecum directed to the officer in possession of the documents would have been good, and perhaps preferable, the matter is not one of substance, but purely of procedure, and we entertain no doubt that the subpoena here directed to the association and served on such officer is valid.\n\n 2. \nIn Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, 26 S. Ct. 370, here cited in support of Brown's second contention, this court held that a subpoena duces tecum requiring a witness to produce all understandings, contracts and correspondence between a corporation named and six different companies, as well as all reports made and accounts rendered by them from the date of the organization of the corporation, and all letters received by the corporation since its organization from more than a dozen different companies, was to sweeping to be regarded as peasonable. The limitation in respect of time embraced the entire period of the corporation's existence and there was no specification in re- \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n spect of subject-matter, and this court said that, if the return had required the production of all the books, papers, and documents found in the office of the corporation, it would scarcely be more universal in its operation, or more completely put a stop to the business of the company. The subpoena here under consideration is very different. It specifies a reasonable period of time, and with reasonable particularity the subjects to which the documents called for relate. The question is ruled, not by Hale v. Henkel, but by Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont, \n207 \nU.S. 541, 553\n, 554 S., 28 S. Ct. 178, 12 Ann. Cas. 658, and Wheeler v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 478, 482\n, 483 S., 489, 33 S. Ct. 158.\n But the form of the subpoena aside, it appears from Brown's own statement that, prior to the issue of the subpoena in question, a subpoena duces tecum had been directed to and served upon him personally, commanding him to produce the same documents, and that in answer thereto he had appeared before the grand jury with them. This is equivalent to a demonstration that the description contained in the subpoena was sufficient to enable Brown to know what particular documents were required and to select them accordingly. Having produced them once without difficulty and without undue interference with the affairs of the association, so far as appears, there is no reason why he should not produce them again in response to another subpoena identical in terms. See Lee v. Angas, L. R. 2 Eq. 59, 64; Starr v. Mayer & Co., 60 Ga. 546, 549.\n The probable materiality of the documents is sufficiently indicated by the description of their subject-matter contained in the subpoena.\n\n 3. \nWhether Brown's relation to the association or to the documents in question was such as to entitle him under any circumstances to assert the constitutional privilege, we do not find it necessary to inquire. All other matters aside, it is impossible for us to say, upon the record before \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n us, that the claim of such privilege was sustained. Upon Brown's appearance before the grand jury in response to the subpoena, he made no claim of the privilege, but insisted only that there was no such person or entity as the National Alliance capable of being served with a subpoena or of appearing in answer to one. This notwithstanding the fact that his attention was directed to the subject of self-incrimination. Upon his presentment to the District Court as a contumacious witness, he answered among other things, that to compel him to produce the documents set forth in the subpoena would to be submit to an unlawful seizure and to produce evidence against himself. There was a hearing, but the record fails to disclose what was before the court for its consideration upon that hearing. It appears only that the court held that no sufficient excuse for Brown's conduct had been shown, and he was ordered to again appear before the grand jury and produce the documents called for, whether that body saw fit to administer an oath to him or not. Appearing before the grand jury, he again refused, except on condition that he should be subpoenaed and sworn. Thereupon, he was adjudged by the District Court to be in contempt for his failure to comply with its order, and sentenced to imprisonment.\n Whether the papers were produced for the inspection of the court does not appear, but it may well be that they were and that from an examination of them it appeared that the claim of privilege was wholly without merit. In any event it was Brown's duty to produce the papers in order that the court might by an inspection of them satisfy itself whether they contained matters which might tend to incriminate. If he declined to do so, that alone would constitute a failure to show reasonable ground for his refusal to comply with the requirements of the subpoena. Consolidated Rendering Co. v. Vermont, supra, pages 552, 553 (28 S. Ct. 178, 12 Ann. Cas. 658). As very pertinently said by the Court of \n\n[276 U.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n Appeals of Kentucky in Commonwealth v. Southern Express Co., 160 Ky. 1, 3, 169 S. W. 517, 518 (L. R. A. 1915B, 913, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 378):\n'... The individual citizen may not resolve himself into a court and himself determine and assert the criminating nature of the contents of books and papers required to be produced.'\n\n See, also, Ex parte Irvine (C. C.) 74 F. 954, 960; United States v. Collins (D. C.) 145 F. 709, 712; Mitchell's Case, 12 Abb. Pr. 249, 260-261. And see, generally, Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 282\n, 39 S. Ct. 468.\n From the foregoing we may properly assume in support of the judgment below that either from an inspection of the papers or from other facts appearing there was disclosed to the District Court a want of substance in Brown's claim of privilege. Certainly there is nothing in the record, beyond Brown's mere assertion, that affirmatively shows or tends to show that the claim was well founded.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUZYNSKI v.

Wayman, both of Galveston, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. N. Rayzor, of Houston, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Karl Buzynski, brought a libel in personam in admiralty in the federal District Court for Southern Texas against the Luckenbach Steamship Company, the owner of the Steamship Edgar F. Luckenbach, and the Texas Contracting Company, to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by him while working as a stevedore for the Contracting Company, an independent contractor engaged in loading cargo on the steamship while at dock in the port of Galveston. He was awarded a judgment against the two Companies jointly. (D. C.) 12 F.(2d) 92. This was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. Buzynski, 19 F.(2d) 871.\n Shortly after Buzynski had started to work, and while he was removing a cover from one of the hatches on the ship, he was struck and severely injured, without fault on his part, by a chain which fell from the end of the boom of a derrick at this hatch, which was used in loading the cargo. The accident was caused by the starting in motion, in a manner not shown by direct evidence, of a winch belonging to the ship which connected with and controlled the movement of the boom. The winchman who operated the winch was an employee of the Contracting Company and a fellow servant of Buzynski.\n The District Court was of opinion that the accident resulted from a defect in the winch for which both Companies were responsible. The Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion that the evidence showed no defect in the \n\n[277 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n winch for which either of the Companies was liable, and that, although there was evidence from which it might reasonably be inferred that the accident was caused by negligence of the winchman or of another stevedore, nevertheless the Contracting Company would not be liable for the negligence of such fellow servant.\n We granted this writ of certiorari on account of this ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the negligence of a fellow servant; and no other question need be considered here.\n It is settled by this Court that section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 1 incorporated into the maritime law in favor of injured 'seamen' the applicable provisions of the Employers' Liability Act2 and its amendments, and that these may be enforced either in suits in admiralty or actions at law.

Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 19, we held that the word 'seamen' as used in section 33 included a stevedore engaged in the maritime work of stowing cargo upon a vessel, and that under the applicable provisions of the Employers' Liability Act, he could recover from the stevedoring company for an injury caused by the negligence of a fellow servant.\n The view of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the Contracting Company would not be liable for the negligence of a fellow servant, was erroneous, and its judgment must be reversed. But since it did not determine whether the accident was in fact due to such negligence, or to some other cause, the case will be remanded to that court with \n\n[277 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n instructions to determine this question and take further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

Casey, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 413, 415]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Casey, was convicted upon two counts of an indictment, the first of which charged him with the purchase of three and four-tenths grains of morphine not in or from the original stamped package, at Seattle, within the jurisdiction of the Court. The conviction was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 20 F.(2d) 752. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n Here the second count was admitted by the Government to be bad, so that the only matter to be considered is whether the conviction can be sustained upon the first. It is argued that the evidence is not enough.- Casey had practiced law in Seattle for many years, had been in the habit of visiting King County jail and had defended prisoners addicted to the use of narcotics. There was evidence tending to show that on different occasions he had promised to furnish them with opiates, and that in pur- \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n suance of such promises and for pay received by him he had given or sent to them preparations of morphine, concealed, it was said, by soaking towels or the like in a solution of the drug. If this evidence was believed it showed that Casey was in possession or control of what he sent and it safely may be inferred that he did not proclaim his illegal purpose by putting stamps upon the towels. But the charge is a purchase, not a sale. There was no testimony directly concerning the purchase and the Government relies in part at least upon the presumption of a violation of section 1 of the Act of December 17, 1914, c. 1, as amended by the Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,  1006; 40 Stat. 1057, 1130, 1131, that that section purports to create. C. title 26,  692 (26 USCA  692; Comp. St.  6287g).\n The amended section makes the purchase, sale, etc., of opium and derivatives unlawful except in or from the original stamped package, and the absence of the required stamps from any of the said drugs 'shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found.' For the petitioner it was argued that the presumption thus created does not and, consistently, with the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, cannot extend so far as to show a purchase within the district and thus to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the trial Court. The Circuit Court of appeals answered that the objection to the venue was not raised specifically below. The Court was asked to direct a verdict for the defendant on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient and elsewhere it has been held that such a request is enough to save the question, and that a presumption extended to the place of purchase could not be upheld. Brightman v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.( 2d) 532; Cain v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 580; Hood v. United States (C. C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 925; De Moss v. United States (C. C. A.) 14 F.( 2d) 1021. But we are of opinion that upon \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n the facts of this case the Court was right. If the jury believed that the defendant, long established in Seattle, said that he has not the drug, but would, and shortly thereafter did, furnish it, the inference that he bought it in Seattle is strong, and it is reasonable to suppose that if attention had been called to the point the inference could have been made stronger still. But the effort of the defense did not stop at this detail but was to show that Casey had nothing to do with the business and was wholly innocent of the offense charged.\n With regard to the presumption of the purchase of a thing manifestly not produced by the possessor, there is a 'rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed' (Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 25\n, 34 S. Ct. 10; Yee Hem v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 178, 183\n, 45 S. Ct. 470). Furthermore there are presumptions that are not evidence in a proper sense but simply regulations of the burden of proof. Greer v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 559\n, 38 S. Ct. 209. The statute here talks of prima facie evidence, but it means only that the burden shall be upon the party found in possession to explain and justify it when accused of the crime that the statute creates. 4 Wigmore, Evidence,  2494. It is consistent with all the constitutional protections of accused men to throw on them the burden of proving facts peculiarly within their knowledge and hidden from discovery by the Government. 4 Wigmore, Evidence,  2486. In dealing with a poison not commonly used except upon a doctor's prescription easily proved, or for a debauch only possible by a breach of law, it seems reasonable to call on a person possessing it in a form that warrants suspicion to show that he obtained it in a mode permitted by the law.-The petitioner cannot complain of the statute except as it affects him.\n We do not feel at liberty to accept the suggestion that the Government induced the crime. A Court rarely can \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n act with advantage of its own motion, and very rarely can be justified in giving judgment upon grounds that the record was not intended to present. Upon this record, it was testified and might have been found for the Government that after Casey's visits addicts were noticed by the jailers to be under the influence of narcotics and that on a previous occasion Casey for money had got morphine at the request of Cicero, the supposed stool pigeon. It does not appear expressly that this last was told to the jailer before the supposed plot to entrap Casey, but in view of the relation between the parties it was very likely-and had the matter been in issue very probably would have been proved. We do not think that we are entitled to assume the contrary. If known to the jailers there was very probable cause to believe Casey an habitual practitioner. His own language when he was on guard, admitting that he frequently had promised the drug to prisoners, the testimony as to what was said in his presence (to the effect that he was the man who supplied the boys with narcotics when they wanted it) and his language importing habit (as, that he hadn't a thing with him today) all tend to the same conclusion. We hardly can assume that the jailers did not know the facts in order to convict them of a gross wrong, when we keep in mind that the case was tried and the record made up without this in mind. Furthermore Casey according to the story, was in no way induced to commit the crime beyond the simple request of Cicero to which he seems to have acceded without hesitation and as a matter of course. According to the evidence, he seems to have promised morphine to Nelson, who does not appear to have been in the supposed plot. We are not persuaded that the conduct of the officials was different from or worse than ordering a drink of a suspected bootlegger. Whatever doubts we may feel as to the truth of the testimony we are not at liberty to consider them on the only question \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n before the Court. The grounds for uneasiness can be considered only by another power.\n The statute is much more obviously a revenue measure now then when United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86\n, 39 S. Ct. 214, was decided, and is said to produce a considerable return. Alston v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 47 S. Ct. 634. It is too late to attempt to overthrow the whole act on Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449. It is said also that no opium is produced in the United States, and at all events the statute has been so modified that now at least United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 658, does not apply to this case. United States v. Wong Sing, \n260 \nU.S. 18, 21\n, 43 S. Ct. 7. We pass as not needing discussion some minor points.\n Judgment upon the first count affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n I accept the views stated by Mr. Justice BUTLER. With clarity he points out the unreasonableness of the construction of the statute advocated by counsel for the United States. But I go further.\n The provision under which we are told that one may be presumed unlawfully to have purchased an unstamped package of morphine within the district where he is found in possession of it conflicts with those constitutional guaranties heretofore supposed to protect all against arbitrary conviction and punishment. The suggested rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed is imaginary.\n Once the thumbscrew and the following confession made conviction easy; but that method was crude and, I suppose, now would be declared unlawful upon some ground. Hereafter, presumption is to lighten the burden of the prosecutor. The victim will be spared the trouble of confessing and will go to his cell without mutilation or disquieting outcry. \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n Probably most of those accelerated to prison under the present act will be unfortunate addicts and their abettors; but even they live under the Constitution. And where will the next step take us?\n When the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Law (26 USCA  211, 691-707; Comp. St.  6287g-6287q) became effective, probably some drug containing opium could have been found in a million or more households within the Union. Paregoric, laudanum, Dover's Powders, were common remedies. Did every man and woman who possessed one of these instantly become a presumptive criminal and liable to imprisonment unless he could explain to the satisfaction of a jury when and where he got the stuff? Certainly, I cannot assent to any such notion, and it seems worthwhile to say so.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in these views.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n The question presented is whether possession within the district of morphine not in the original stamped package is evidence sufficient to sustain the charge that it was illegally purchased therein. I have no occasion to consider that question. For, in my opinion, the prosecution must fail because officers of the government instigated the commission of the alleged crime.\n These are facts disclosed by the government's evidence: In the Western District of Washington, Northern Division, prisoners awaiting trial for federal offenses are commonly detained at King county jail. The prisoners' lawyers frequently come there for consultation with clients. At the request of prisoners, the jailer telephones the lawyers to come for that purpose. A small compartment-called the attorneys' cage-is provided. Prior to the events here in question, the jailer had, upon such request, telephoned Casey, from time to time, to come to see prisoners accused of crimes other than violation of the \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n Narcotic Act. He had doubtless telephoned also, upon request of prisoners who were accused of these crimes. for Casey had acted as attorney in a number of narcotic cases. The jailer observed-or thought he did-that after Casey came some of those visited were under the influence of narcotics. He suspected that Casey had brought them the drug. To entrap him, the following scheme was devised by Patterson and Close, federal narcotic officers, and carried out with the aid of George Cicero, a convicted felon and drug addict, then in the jail on a charge of forgery, and Mrs. Nelson, the alleged sister-in-law of Roy Nelson, another prisoner and drug addict.\n On December 29th Patterson and Close installed a dictaphone in the attorneys' cage, and arranged so that, from an adjacent room, they could both hear conversations in the cage and see occupants. Then they deposited with the superintendent of the jail $20 to Cicero's credit; arranged with him to request the jailer to summon Casey to come to the jail; and also that, when Casey came, Cicero would ask him to procure some morphine and would pay him the $20 for that purpose. The jailer telephoned Casey as requested. Thereafter the federal agents were in waiting. Casey did not come until about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 31st. Cicero talked from the attorney's cage with Casey, and gave him an order for the $20. By arrangement, Casey talked there also with Roy Nelson, who gave him an order on the superintendent for $50. Both orders were immediately cashed. Mrs. Nelson talked with Casey in the corridor.\n The testimony of Patterson, Close, Cicerco and Mrs. Nelson, if believed, is sufficient to prove that Cicero and Roy Nelson asked Casey to procure morphine for them; that he agreed to do so; that the money paid was for that purpose; that it was arranged that the morphine should be smuggled into the jail in laundry; and that \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Nelson arranged with Casey that she would call at his office in the afternoon. She did call, having first gone to the office of the narcotic agents and conferred with them. She testified that she saw at Casey's office a Chinaman or a Japanese; that Casey gave her the package for Roy Nelson; and that she took it immediately to the federal narcotic office. A federal narcotic agent who is a chemist testified that upon soaking one of the towels in the package brought to the office by Mrs. Nelson he found that it contained morphine.\n I am aware that courts-mistaking relative social values and forgetting that a desirable end cannot justify foul menas-have, in their zeal to punish, sanctioned the use of evidence obtained through criminal violation of property and personal rights or by other practices of detectives even more revolting. But the objection here is of a different nature. It does not rest merely upon the character of the evidence or upon the fact that the evidence was illegally obtained. The obstacle to the prosecution lies in the fact that the alleged crime was instigated by officers of the government; that the act for which the government seeks to punish the defendant is the fruit of their criminal conspiracy to induce its commission. The government may set decoys to entrap criminals. But it may not provoke or create a crime and then punish the criminal, its creature. If Casey is guilty of the crime of purchasing 3.4 grains of morphine, on December 31st, as charged, it is because he yielded to the temptation presented by the officers. Their conduct is not a defense to him. For no officer of the government has power to authorize the violation of an act of Congress, and no conduct of an officer can excuse the violation. But it does not follow that the court must suffer a detective- made criminal to be punished. To permit that would be tantamount to a ratification by the government of the \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 424]\n\u00a0\n officers' unauthorized and unjustifiable conduct. \n1\n Compare Gambino v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 310\n, 48 S. Ct. 137.\n This case is unlike those where a defendant confessedly intended to commit a crime and the government, having knowledge thereof, merely presented the opportunity and set its decoy. So far as appears, the officers had, prior to the events on December 31st, no basis for a belief that Casey was violating the law, except that the jailer harbored a suspicion. Casey took the witness stand and submitted himself to cross- examination. He testified that he had 'never bought, sold, given away or possessed a single grain of morphine or other opiate,' and that he had 'never procured, or suggested to any one else to procure morphine or narcotics of any kind.' He testified that the payments made on orders from Cicero and Roy Nelson were payments on account of services to be rendered as counsel for the defense in the prosecutions against them then pending. He denied every material fact testified to by witnesses for the prosecution and supported his oath by other evidence. The government's witnesses admitted that the conversations in the attorneys' cage were carried on in the ordinary tone of voice; that there was no effort to lower the voice or to speak privately or secretly; and that they could have heard all that was said without the use of the dictaphone. They admitted that, when the narcotic agents searched Casey's office under a search \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 425]\n\u00a0\n warrant, on the evening of December 31st, they did not find any narcotics or any trace of them or any other incriminating article; and that when, at about the same time, they arrested Casey, he was taking supper with his wife and daughter at his home seven miles from Seattle. Whether the charge against Casey is true we may not inquire. But if, under such circumstances, the mere suspicion of the jailer could justify entrapment, little would be left of the doctrine.\n The fact that no objection on the ground of entrapment was taken by the defendant, either below or in this Court, is without legal significance. This prosecution should be stopped, not because some right of Casey's has been denied, but in order to protect the government. To protect it from illegal conduct of its officers. To preserve the purity of its courts. In my opinion, the judgment should be vacated with direction to quash the indictment. Compare United States v. Healy (D. C.) 202 F. 349, 350; United States v. Echols (D. C.) 253 F. 862.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD, dissenting.\n I think that the case is not made out by the statutory provision as to prima facie evidence, and that the judgment should be reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The first count charges an unlawful purchase of 3.4 grains of morphine. The second charges unlawful sales. Defendant was convicted on both, and sentenced to the penitentiary for fourteen months on each, the terms to run concurrently. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on both counts. Here the government rightly says that the conviction on the second count should not be sustained. This Court accepts that view, and as to that count petitioner is entitled to have the judgment reversed.\n The indictment is under section 1 of the Harrison Narcotic Act of December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785, as amended \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 426]\n\u00a0\n February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1130 (26 USCA  692; Comp. St.  6287g). It was enacted under article 1,  8, of the Constitution, granting to Congress power to lay and collect taxes. The words of the section under which the first count was found are:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase ... any of the aforesaid drugs except in ... or from the original stamped package . ...'\n\n The essential substance of the first count follows:\n Thomas J. Casey on the 31st day of December, 1925, at Seattle, Wash., did unlawfully purchase from a person unknown, and not in or from the original stamped package, 3.4 grains of morphine.\n By far the larger part of the testimony heard related to the second court, and was not admissible to prove the purchase alleged in the first. That evidence cannot fairly be brought forward now to sustain conviction on the first count.\n Mere purchase or possession of morphine is not crime. Congress has not attempted, and has no power, to make either an offense, The gist of accusation is purchase of 3.4 grains of morphine that was not in or taken from a stamped package when delivered to defendant. That is the corpus delicti.\n There was testimony sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant, at the time and place specified, had possession of 3.4 grains of morphine. But there was no evidence to show how, when or where or from whom he got it. There is much difference between such a possession and the crime charged. A statutory provision is invoked in lieu of evidence to bridge this gap. It is found in the twelfth paragraph of the section; and, in order to show the immediate environment of the words relied on, the first three clauses of the paragraph are quoted:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute any of the aforesaid drugs except \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 427]\n\u00a0\n in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from any of the aforesaid drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found; and the possession of any original stamped package containing any of the aforesaid drugs by any person who has not registered and paid special taxes as required by this section shall be prima facie evidence of liability to such special tax.'\n\n This section defines many offenses. They include purchasing, selling, dispensing, distributing, importing, manufacturing, producing, compounding, dealing in, administering and giving away of each of the numerous drugs mentioned in the section. The things forbidden are not alike. Some are essentially different from and inconsistent with the others. It cannot reasonably be said that mere possession of 3.4 grains of morphine without a stamp thereon was sufficient to establish prima facie that defendant was guilty of all these crimes, or all that related to morphine, or even to those respectively involving manufacture, sale and purchase of the 3.4 grains. There is no more reason to select one of these than there is to choose another for the application of the statutory rule of evidence.\n The 'absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps' cannot be said to make out dissimilar and inconsistent offenses. Tax-paid stamps are significant to show payment of taxes, and their absence under some circumstances properly may be evidence of nonpayment. According to its words, the clause in question merely makes such absence 'prima facie evidence of a violation of this section,' the clause following makes possession of an original stamped package containing the drug by one not registered evidence of liability for a tax. Fairly considered, both clauses have to do with tax liability. The first to the tax on the drug, and the second to the tax imposed on importers, dealers, \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 428]\n\u00a0\n physicians, etc. That construction would be reasonable and would not stretch the law against those accused of the crimes created by the section.\n And it is always to be remembered that this act is to be construed as a measure to 'lay and collect taxes.' It has no other legal existence. The tax is one cent on each ounce or fractional part thereof. Defendant had 3. 4 grains without a stamp on it. He is not accused of failure to pay a tax. The unlawful purchase charged is punishable by a fine of not more than $2, 000 or by imprisonment of not more than five years or by both. U. S. C., tit. 26,  705 (26 USCA  705). The only legal justification for such penalties is that they are calculated to aid collection of taxes. It is hard to continue to say that this act is a taxing measure in order to sustain it. Eagerness to use federal law as a police measure to combat the opium habit-a purpose for which Congress has no power to legislate-should not lead to the enactment or the construction of laws that shock common sense.\n And, above all, the statutory rule of evidence should be construed having regard to the ancient and salutary doctrine known and rightly cherished as fair play by the people, the bar and the courts of this country, that every person on trial for crime is presumed to be innocent; and that, in order to convict him, the evidence must satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the crime charged. See Coffin v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 432, 453\n, 15 S. Ct. 394, L. Ed. 481; Cochran and Sayre v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 286, 298\n, 15 S. Ct. 628; Davis v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 469\n, 16 S. Ct. 353. The connection, if any between the possession shown and the substance of the offense charged is too remote. Attention has not been called to any decision that goes so far. None can be found. \n\n[276 U.S. 413, 429]\n\u00a0\n There is no evidence in the record that reasonably tends to show that defendant purchased the 3.4 grains of morphine or that, when purchased, it was not in or taken from the original stamped package.\n I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

INDEPENDENT PIER CO.(1928)\nNo. 22\nArgued: October 10, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. H. Brown Jr., and J. T. Manning, Jr., both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Howard M. Long, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent in No. 22.\n Messrs. Chauncey I. Clark and Frederic Conger, both of New York City, for respondent in No. 23.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two numbers on our docket present one cause in admiralty. It arose out of a collision between the single screw steamer Gulftrade-429 feet long, 59 foot beam-and two loaded scows which, with two others, were being towed by the tug Taurus upon hawsers astern. The flotilla was about 400 feet long. Both the tug and scows were owned or chartered by petitioner, Charles Warner Company. The Gulftrade was accompanied by the tugs Triton and Churchman, made fast to her port bow and port quarter. They were owned respectively by Independent Pier Company and Alfred E. Churchman. The Triton's master was upon the steamer and commanded the three associated vessels.\n The accident occurred in the Schuylkill river near its confluence with the Delaware at 3:00 p. m., October 1, 1923. The weather was fair, tide flood, wind light.\n Drawing her tow the Taurus passed slowly up the Delaware with the tide and rounded into the still water of the 200-foot channel of the Schuylkill. The Gulftrade followed under her own power, carrying with her the attending tugs, their engines motionless until \n\n[278 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n the last moment before the collision. Shortly after the flotillas entered the Schuylkill, the Gulftrade for the third time, by a single blast, indicated her desire to pass to starboard-eastward. The Taurus (as she had done twice before while in the Delaware) gave an assenting blast. Attempting to pass in mid-channel, the steamer struck two of the scows and caused material loss.\n The District Court found that:\n'The set of the tide swung the tail of the tow to the eastward and more or less athwart the channel until it had straightened out. ... This, however, was a condition which the steamship was bound to anticipate and doubtless did. What happened was that the navigator of the ship expecting the tow would go to the westward and seeing it was so headed assumed it would be out of his way by the time he reached the passing point and that a passage up mid-channel would be clear. In this he miscalculated and hence the collision.'\n\n It declared the steamer guilty of negligence the Taurus without fault, and awarded full damages in favor of petitioner Charles Warner Company primarily against the Independent Pier Company, owner of the Triton, and secondarily against the Gulftrade.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (Independent Pier Co. v. Warner Co., 20 F.(2d) 111) held:\n'Under the circumstances, the Taurus was in fault in giving consent to the Gulftrade to come ahead, relying too much on her ability to get out of the channel. Evidently the Taurus miscalculated the situation. So, also, it seems the Gulftrade was at fault. She was the following vessel. All she had to do was to hold back, and not run into the scows. She certainly saw danger ahead when she gave the second signal, and she certainly saw it more imminent when she gave the third signal. It was quite clear that she did go ahead, and took an equal chance with the Taurus on the ability of the latter to give her free channel-way to pass. The result was a needless collision.' \n\n[278 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n We cannot conclude that the Taurus was in fault. She was prudently navigated in plain view of the Gulftrade who knew the relevant facts; and by assenting that the latter might pass she certainly did not assume responsibility for the maneuver. At most the Taurus obligated herself to hold her course and speed so far as practicable, to do nothing to thwart the overtaking vessel, and she knew of no circumstances not open to the observation of the Gulftrade which would prevent the latter from going safely by, if prudently navigated. Of course, no ship must ever lead another into a trap. There was ample room for the Gulftrade to pass. But, if not, she should have slowed down and kept at a safe distance. Her fault was the direct and sole cause of the collision.\n\n By the act to adopt regulations for preventing collisions, etc., approved June 7, 1897 (chapter 4, 30 Stat. 96 et seq. (33 USCA  154 et seq.)), it is provided:\n'Art. 18, Rule VIII. When steam vessels are running in the same direction, and the vessel which is astern shall desire to pass on the right or starboard hand of the vessel ahead, she shall give one short blast of the steam whistle, as a signal of such desire, and if the vessel ahead answers with one blast, she shall put her helm to port; or if she shall desire to pass on the left or port side of the vessel ahead, she shall give two short blasts of the steam whistle as a signal of such desire, and if the vessel ahead answers with two blasts, shall put her helm to starboard; or if the vessel ahead does not think it safe for the vessel astern to attempt to pass at that point, she shall immediately signify the same by giving several short and rapid blasts of the steam whistle, not less than four, and under no circumstances shall the vessel astern attempt to pass the vessel ahead until such time as they have reached a point where it can be safely done, when said vessel ahead shall signify her willingness by blowing the proper signals. The vessel \n\n[278 U.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n ahead shall in no case attempt to cross the bow or crowd upon the course of the passing vessel. ...\n\n'Art. 23. Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse. ...\n\n'Art. 24. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.' 33 USCA  203, 208, 209.\n\n Under these regulations the duty of the Gulftrade was clear. She should have anticipated the effect of the flood tide in the Delaware upon the flotillas as they rounded into the still water of the Schuylkill and kept herself out of the zone of evident danger.\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Haglund (The Thoroughfare), \n277 \nU.S. 304\n, 48 S. Ct. 510, we said:\n'The Relief was not at fault in accepting the passing signal of the Thoroughfare. This was merely an assent to the proposed passage in the rear of the Enterprise, expressing an understanding of what the Thoroughfare proposed to do and an agreement not to endanger or thwart it by permitting an interfering change in the position of the Enterprise. See Atlas Transp. Co. V. Lee Line Steamers (C. C. A.) 235 F. 492, 495. And the Relief, being in a position to fully carry out its agreement, was under no obligation to decline the passing signal because of the approach of the Union on the other side and to sound instead a warning signal. There was nothing in the situation to indicate that the approach of the Union would prevent the Thoroughfare from passing safely, if, as the Relief had the right to assume, it were navigated with due care.'\n\n In Atlas Transp. Co. v. Lee Line Steamers, 235 F. 492, 495, the Circuit Court of Appeals (8th C. C. A.) had held:\n'The reply of the Josh Cook to the passing signal of the Rees Lee was no more than an assent to it, at the risk of \n\n[278 U.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n the vessel proposing it. It expressed an understanding of what the Rees Lee proposed to do, and an agreement not to thwart it; but the success of the maneuver was at the risk of the Rees Lee.'\n\n Whitridge v. Dill, 23 How. 448, 453:\n'The vessel astern, as a general rule, is bound to give way, or to adopt the necessary precautions to avoid a collision. That rule rests upon the principle that the vessel ahead, on that state of facts, has the seaway before her, and is entitled to hold her position; and consequently the vessel coming up must keep out of the way.'\n\n The steamer Rhode Island, Fed. Cas. No. 11,745:\n'The approaching vessel, when she has command of her movements, takes upon herself the peril of determining whether a safe passage remains for her beside the one preceding her, and must bear the consequences of misjudgment in that respect.'\n\n See also, City of Baltimore (C.

LEITCH(1928)\nNo. 98\nArgued: March 14, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. Douglas W. Brown, of Huntington, W. Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. John H. Holt, of Huntington, W. Va., for respondent. \n\n[276 U.S. 429, 430]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the respondent, an engineer, to recover from the petitioner for injuries suffered by him through contract with a mail crane or mail sack hanging from it as he looked from the window of his engine upon the petitioner's road. There is no doubt that the case is governed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59; Comp. St.  8657-8665), but the respondent got a verdict in the State Court, which was sustained by the Supreme Court of Appeals, Leitch v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co., 101 W. Va. 230, 133 S. E. 140, and the question is whether there is any sufficient distinction between this and Southern Pacific Co. v. Berkshire, \n254 \nU.S. 415\n, 41 S. Ct. 162, in which it was held that the engineer took the risk. The grounds of that decision were that it is impracticable to require railroads to have no structures so near to their tracks as to endanger persons who lean from the windows of the cars; that they are obliged to erect mail cranes near enough to the tracks for the trains to pick up mail sacks without stopping; that it is almost if not quite impossible to set the cranes so far away as to leave no danger to one leaning out, and that in dealing with a well known incident of the employment, adopted in the interest of the public, it is unreasonable to throw the risk of it upon those who were compelled to adopt it.\n Of course it is answered that these general considerations should not exonerate the railroads from using such care as they can within the conditions. But it seems to us unjust to let the risk of a danger that in any event is imminent vary upon disputed evidence that the danger was brought an inch or two nearer than it would have been if a blueprint adopted for the whole line had been followed with a more precisely mathematical accuracy. In the Berkshire Case the testimony for the plaintiff left a distance of fourteen inches from the end of the crane to the car. Here the plaintiff's witness makes it ten. The \n\n[276 U.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n witnesses for the petitioner with greater plausibility make it appreciably more. If there is to be a standard in these cases, and if, as decided, the general rule is that the engineer takes the risk, the railroad should not be made liable for this class of injury except where some unquestionable disregard of obvious precautions is shown. The plaintiff here as in Berkshire's Case well knew of the existence of the crane, which had been in place for three or four years. He was an experienced engineer and although here as there presumably he never had measured the distance, he like Berkshire knew the fact that threatened danger. At the trial Leitch testified that he was looking to see the position of a block signal, pointedly contradicting a statement that he dictated and signed near the time of the accident. He admitted however that it was the fireman's business to look out for the block and notify him, and the fireman's more favorable position for seeing and other circumstances sufficiently indicate that there was no great or sudden emergency, if that would affect the case. Without discussing the evidence in detail we are satisfied upon a consideration of it that it does not show grounds for making an exception to the general rule.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, M., ST.

D., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by appellants, receivers of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, in the District Court for South Dakota against the appellees, county commissioners of Minnehaha county, to enjoin the apportionment and assessment of benefits upon appellants' land for the maintenance of a drainage system, under the state agricultural drainage statutes (S. D. Laws 1907, c. 134, re-enacted as S. D. Rev. Code 1919,  8458-8491, as amended by S. D. Laws 1920 (2d Sp. Sess.), c. 46), on the ground that the statutes and the proceedings has under them are in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. From an order of the District Court, three judges sitting, denying an application for an interlocutory injunction, the case comes here on direct appeal. Jud. Code,  238, 266 (11 USCA  345, 380); Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 385.\n One phase of the controversy now presented and the statutes involved were before this court in Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S. Ct. 236. In that case it appeared that the railroad company, which is represented by the appellants here, owned lands in Minnehaha county, some of which had not been included within an established drainage district known as 'ditch No. 1 and ditch No. 2.' Those ditches having been seriously damaged by floods, a proceeding had been begun before the county commissioners for the enlargement and reconstruction of the system, now described as 'drainage district No. 1 and 2,' with the object of assessing the benefits and cost of the work on lands of the railroad \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 569]\n\u00a0\n company and others lying both within and without the original drainage district.\n The suit was begun by the railroad company in the District Court for South Dakota to enjoin the county officers from making any apportionment and assessment of benefits affecting the property of the railroad company, on the ground that the drainage statutes of South Dakota and the proceedings under them violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The District Court held that the statutes were valid and constitutional, but that the assessments for reconstruction and maintenance of the existing drainage system, so far as applied to lands outside the original drainage district, were unauthorized by the state statutes. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. v. Risty (D. C.) 282 F. 364. No appeal was taken by the railroad company from the decree of the District Court, but on appeal by the county officials so much of the decree as involved the construction of the drainage statutes and their application to lands outside of the original drainage district was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (297 F. 710), and by this court in Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., supra.\n Following the decision in this Court, the appellants began the present suit, in which they raised anew the questions as to the constitutionality of the South Dakota drainage statutes, and sought relief the effect of which, if granted, would be to enjoin those assessments on the land of plaintiffs within the original drainage district which had been left undisturbed by the decree in the earlier litigation.\n Appellees, on the present application for an interlocutory injunction, have set up that decree as res judicata as to all questions presented here. But an examination of the decree of the District Court in the earlier litigation, set out in the present record, discloses that by its terms \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 570]\n\u00a0\n the decree was 'without prejudice to any and all rights of the plaintiff to contest any such apportionment of benefits, or any assessment which may be made' affecting the land of appellants within the original drainage district and saving the right of the railroad company in this regard as though 'this suit had not been instituted or this decree entered.' Although reliance is placed upon this decree as res judicata, neither the record nor the briefs disclose the reason for the insertion of these provisions, and no reason is suggested why its language is not to be taken at its face value as saving to appellants the right to litigate anew the questions now presented.\n Since our decision in Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., supra, the Supreme Court of South Dakota in State v. Risty (S. D.) 213 N. W. 952, has had occasion to pass upon the construction and the constitutionality of the South Dakota drainage statutes. Taking a different view from that of this court and the lower courts in Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., supra, it held that the proceedings involved in that litigation and in this, for the assessment of benefits upon lands both within and without the original drainage district, were authorized by the statutes of South Dakota. It held that the action taken for reconstruction of the old drainage ditches was not a proceeding for maintenance or repair of the old system, but a new and independent proceeding, and that the statutes authorized the establishment of a new drainage district embracing all the lands benefited, whether included in the old district or not. It also construed the sections regulating the proceedings for assessing the benefits and costs of the reconstruction and enlargement of the drainage ditches and, as construed, held them constitutional. This construction of the state statutes by the highest court of the state we, of course, accept. People of Sioux County v. National Surety Co. (February 20, 1928) \n276 \nU.S. 238\n, 48 S. Ct. 239: St. Louis & Kansas City Land Co. v. Kansas City, \n241 \nU.S. 419, 427\n, 36 S. Ct. 647. \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 571]\n\u00a0\n As determined by the state Supreme Court in State v. Risty, supra, the proceedings resulting in the proposed assessment now assailed were taken and authorized under S. D. Rev. Code (1919),  8458-8463, as amended. Under section 8459, upon petition of the owners of land 'likely to be affected by the proposed drainage,' the board of county commissioners, under section 8460, caused a survey to be made of the proposed drainage project and, under section 8461, upon the filing of the surveyor's report with the commission, fixed the line of the proposed drainage ditch as that of the pre-existing ditches No. 1 and No. 2, but increased the width of the ditch from approximately 40 feet, as originally established, to 90 feet. Notice of hearing upon the petition was given by publication and posting, as required by section 8461, printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 567, 572]\n\u00a0\n The notice as required described 'the route of the proposed drainage and the tract of country likely to be affected thereby in general terms,' and specifically included the lands of the appellant, which are described in the present bill of complaint. Upon the hearing the board of county commissioners, acting under section 8462, made its order establishing the drainage as prayed. Proceeding under section 8463, printed in the margin, 2 the board then fixed tentatively the proportion of benefits of the drainage among the lands affected, and particularly described and gave published notice of the time and place for all owners of the land to be heard on equalization of the benefits. \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 573]\n\u00a0\n At the outset appellant challenges the constitutionality of the statutes and proceedings on the ground that the notice of the hearing on the petition for the establishment of the drainage project fell short of constitutional requirements. It is said that notice to all persons affected by the proposed drainage, describing only 'the route of the proposed drainage and the tract of country likely to be affected thereby in general terms,' is too vague and indefinite to constitute notice to any landowner other than those through whose land the drainage ditch is to be constructed.\n If it were necessary to our decision, we should hesitate to say that the required notice was insufficient, at least as to the owners of land embraced within the old district. For it showed unmistakably that the projected improvements were in substance an enlargement of a drainage ditch for the construction of which the lands within the district, including appellants', had already been assessed. No particular form of notice is necessary to satisfy constitutional requirements. If it be such as fairly apprises the landowner of what is proposed, and affords reasonable opportunity to be heard, it suffices. North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, \n268 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 45 S. Ct. 491, No one who, like appellants, had paid assessments for the original construction of the ditch, could have doubted that his lands were within the tract 'likely to be affected' by the proposed reconstruction.\n But in any case there is no constitutional reason why any notice need have been given, for the purpose of the first hearing is not to determine what lands are to be included in the assessment district. It was said by the Supreme Court of South Dakota in State v. Risty (S. D.) 213 N. W. at 959:\n'The hearing upon this notice is not for the purpose of determining the particular land that may be benefited by the construction of ditch, nor the extent to which any \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 574]\n\u00a0\n tract of land may be benefited, but to determine whether the proposed drainage or any variation thereof shall be 'conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, or necessity, or practical for draining agricultural lands.' If the board finds that such drainage will be conducive to the public health, convenience, or welfare, or necessary or practical for draining agricultural lands, the board may establish the drainage accordingly and proceed to let contracts for the work. It then becomes necessary to determine the particular tracts of land that will be benefited by the drainage and the extent to which it will be benefited.'\n\n Due process of law does not require notice of a proceeding to determine merely whether an improvement shall be constructed without at the same time establishing the boundaries of the assessment district. It is enough if landowners who may be assessed are later afforded a hearing upon the assessment itself. Londoner v. Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 378\n, 28 S. Ct. 708; Goodrich v. Detroit City, \n184 U.S. 432\n, 437, et seq., 22 S. Ct. 397; Voight v. Detroit, \n184 \nU.S. 115, 122\n, 22 S. Ct. 337; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242\n, 36 S. Ct. 317; Soliah v. Heskin, \n222 \nU.S. 522\n, 32 S. Ct. 103.\n No objection of substance is made to the sufficiency of the notice of the hearing on the equalization of benefits. The lands of the railroad, described in the complaint, were described in the notice as required by the statute. At that time no assessment district had been established, and no lien had attached to them, nor would any attach until a final assessment had been made. Section 8464; Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., supra, 388. As the statute was construed by the Supreme Court of South Dakota in State v. Risty (S. D.) 213 N. W. at 959, upon the hearing for the equalization of benefits under section 8463, 'an interested party may appear and show any reason why his property should not be assessed that he could have shown at the hearing for determining whether the drainage \n\n[276 U.S. 567, 575]\n\u00a0\n should be established. If his property will not be benefited by the establishment of the drainage this may be shown at either hearing, and if shown at either hearing his property will not be assessed.'\n The state court further held that upon this hearing the landowner may be heard upon the question whether his lands are benefited by the drainage system and the extent of those benefits, if any, or whether the proposed assessment was unjust or unwarranted and may raise all constitutional objections to the assessment; citing Milne v. McKinnon, 32 S. D. 627, 631, 632, 144 N. W. 117; State ex rel. Curtis v. Pound, 32 S. D. 492, 143 N. W. 778. From determinations of the board on either hearing, appeals lie to the circuit court under section 8469\n\n\n Appellants did not appear or file objections on the date set for either hearing, and, under the state statute as interpreted in State v. Risty, supra, thus lost their right to urge any objection to the assessment. As the inclusion of appellants' lands in the new assessment district depended wholly upon their being benefited by the proposed improvements, their failure to avail of the opportunity afforded by the statute to make the objections to the assessment now urged forecloses all consideration of those objections here.

Ct. 80; First National Bank v. Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450\n, 44 S. Ct. 385.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  8461. Surveyor's Report-Notice of Hearing.-The surveyor shall report in writing to the board of county commissioners and his report shall be filed with the petition. After personal inspection or after the receipt of the surveyor's report the board shall determine the exact line and width of the ditch, if the same shall not be fixed in the petition, and shall file its determination with the petition. The board shall then fix a time and place for the hearing of the petition and shall give notice thereof by publication at least once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of the county, to be designated by the board, and by posting copies of such notice in at least three public places near the route of the proposed drainage. Such notice shall describe the route of the proposed drainage and the tract of country likely to be affected thereby in general terms, the separate tracts of land through which the proposed drainage will pass and give the names of the owners thereof as appears from the records of the office of the register of deeds on the date of the filing of the petition, and shall refer to the files in the proceedings for further particulars. Such notice shall summon all persons affected by the proposed drainage to appear at such hearing and show cause why the proposed drainage should not be established and constructed, and shall summon all persons deeming themselves damaged by the proposed drainage or claiming compensation for the lands proposed to be taken for the drainage to present their claim therefor at such hearing. ... \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n]  8463. Equalization of Benefits.-After the establishment of the drainage and the fixing of the damages, if any, the board of county commissioners shall fix the proportion of benefits of the proposed drainage among the lands affected, and shall appoint a time and place for equalizing the same. Notice of such equalization of proportion of benefits shall be given by publication at least once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of the county, to be designated by the board, and by posting copies of such notice in at least three public places near the route of the proposed drainage. Such notice shall state the route and width of the drainage established, a description of each tract of land affected by the proposed drainage and the names of the owners of the several tracts of land as appears from the records of the office of the register of deeds, at the date of the filing of the petition, and the proportion of benefits fixed for each tract of property, taking any particular tract as a unit, and shall notify all such owners to show cause why the proportion of benefits shall not be fixed as stated. Upon the hearing of the equalization of the proportion of benefits, the board of county commissioners shall finally equalize and fix the same according to benefits received. The proportion of benefits which any county, city, town or township may obtain by the construction of such drainage to highways or otherwise, and the benefits which any railroad company may obtain for its property by such construction, shall be fixed and equalized together with the proportion of benefits to tracts of land. Benefits to be considered in any case shall be such as accrue directly by the construction of such drainage or indirectly by virtue of such drainage being an outlet for connection drains that may be subsequently constructed. \n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF GAINESVILLE v. BROWN-CRUMMER INV. CO.(1928)\nNo. 433\nArgued: April 13, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 54, 55]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. O. Davis, of Gainesville, Tex., for petitioner.\n Messrs. H. O. Head, F. C. Dillard, and Rice Maxey, all of Sherman, Tex., for Head.\n Mr. Alex F. Weisberg, of Dallas, Tex., for Brown-Crummer Inv. Co.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was begun by the city of Gainesville, Tex., in a state court of Texas, against the Southern Construction Company, a partnership consisting of Harry D. Levy and Lester Levy, and against H. W. Head and the Southern Surety Company, all of whom were citizens of Texas, except the surety company, which was an Iowa corporation. The action grew out of a contract between the city and the Southern Construction Company for street improvements. The city issued city time warrants payable to bearer to pay the contractor. The contract was partly executed and the improvements partly constructed. A second contract was then made by which some of the warrants were to be issued before the rest of the work was done and were to be placed in escrow to be delivered to the contracting company as the work should be completed and approved. The performance of the escrow conditions was guaranteed to the city by H. W. Head and the Southern Surety Company of Iowa became his surety on this guaranty.\n There is in the record a signed stipulation of the parties descriptive of the details of the proceedings, which in part is as follows:\n'Default judgment in said cause was rendered by said court in favor of the plaintiff against all defendants for $15,000 and against the Southern Construction Company for $4,090, which judgment upon appeal by said Head and said Southern Surety Company was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth Supreme Judicial District as to said Head and said Southern Surety Company, but was affirmed as to said Southern Construction Company. See Head v. City of Gainesville, 254 S. W. 323. Upon the remand of said cause to the district court for Cooke county. H. O. Head, as executor, \n\n[277 U.S. 54, 57]\n\u00a0\n made himself a party in lieu of H. W. Head, who had died in the meantime, and he and the Southern Surety Company filed an answer to the petition. Thereupon the plaintiff amended its petition making Brown-Crummer Investment Company, a Kansas corporation, a party defendant, and said Brown-Crummer Investment Company within the time allowed by law filed its petition to remove said cause to this court ( i. e. the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas) upon the ground of a separable controversy. After a transcript of the proceedings were filed in this court, a motion to remand made by the plaintiff was overruled. All parties having repleaded in this court with the exception of the Southern Construction Company, which did not appear, it is agreed that the transcript of the proceedings in the District Court as well as all abandoned pleadings may be omitted by the clerk in making out the record for the Circuit Court of Appeals, as immaterial.'\n\n The Brown-Crummer Company was made a party by the city on the ground that it had in its possession $15,000 of the city warrants which the city did not owe because the paving contract had not been completed. The city sought to have them delivered up to be canceled to prevent their sale to a bona fide purchaser. The company was a dealer in municipal securities at Wichita, Kan., and claimed to be owner as bona fide purchaser of the warrants, and, when made a party, sought judgment on them in this case against the city. It is upon the validity of those warrants that the chief issue in the case turns.\n Upon the removal of this cause from the state to the federal court, the defendant Head sought to avoid liability, on his guaranty to return $ 15,000 of warrants of the city, and that of his surety, the Southern Surety Company, by the contention that the warrants in question were illegally issued, void under state law, and of no value. In all its petitions but the last the city had alleged that \n\n[277 U.S. 54, 58]\n\u00a0\n its warrants were valid. In its later pleading, however, it changed its attitude somewhat, and pleaded in the alternative that, if the court should hold the warrants void, they should, as against the Brown-Crummer Company, be so declared, and asked that they be canceled.\n Both the issue between the city and the Brown-Crummer Company on the warrants, and that between the city and Head and the Iowa surety company for breach of their guaranty were tried to a jury in the District Court. The court directed a verdict on the warranted in favor of the Brown- Crummer Company, and gave judgment against the city for $13,125 with interest. On the claim of the city under the guaranty against Head and the surety company, the court directed a verdict for the defendants, and gave judgment of dismissal against the city.\n The case was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit. 20 F.(2d) 497. That court in its opinion dealt at some length with the questions whether the city warrants were valid under the state law and whether they were held by Brown-Crummer Company as a bona fide purchaser without notice of any infirmity in their origin. The Court of Appeals held the warrants legal, and adjudged that the city was estopped as against the company to plead irregularities in their issue. The court therefore found no reversible error in the directed verdict in favor of the Brown-Crummer Investment Company. To that extent the judgment was affirmed.\n The Court of Appeals dealt with the judgment in favor of the executor Head and the surety company against the city, which the city had sought to review and seeks to review here, by remanding it to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the proceedings as between the parties.\n Objection is first made by the petitioner that there was no separable controversy and so no jurisdiction. This question does not seem to have been presented to, and was \n\n[277 U.S. 54, 59]\n\u00a0\n certainly not considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals. By the stipulation made in the federal District Court below, the transcript of the proceedings in the state district court, from which the removal was had, as well as all abandoned pleadings, were omitted by the clerk in making out the record for the Circuit Court of Appeals as immaterial. The petition for removal from the state court to the federal court is not shown, nor is the motion to remand. There was repleading by all the parties after the motion to remand was overruled. The stipulation, therefore, would seem to constitute an acquiescence in the removal, and indicates that the jurisdiction had been conceded by all parties, and that the question had been abandoned until it is now renewed in the briefs in this court. Of course a question of jurisdiction cannot be waived. Jurisdiction should affirmatively appear, and the question may be raised at any time. Grace v. American Central Ins. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 278, 283\n, 3 S. Ct. 207; Mansfield C. & L. M. Railway Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S. Ct. 510; Mattingly v. Northwestern Virginia Railroad Co., \n158 \nU.S. 53, 56\n, 57 S., 15 S. Ct. 725. Yet the action of the party in acquiescing may strengthen inferences of necessary facts from the record to sustain the jurisdiction, in the absence of a showing to the contrary. It sufficiently appears here that the controversy between the Brown-Crummer Company of Kansas and the city was as to the validity of the warrants and as to the ownership by that company of them and their acquisition by that company as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. This was a controversy wholly between citizens of different states which could be fully determined as between them. The question of the guaranty as between the city and Head's estate and the surety on the guaranty needed not to be considered or determined in that controversy, and had no bearing on it. The jurisdiction is sufficiently clear.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 54, 60]\n\u00a0\n A further objection is made that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in not deciding the issue made as between the city and the executor, Head, and the surety company, and in remanding it with directions to dismiss it. This objection is more serious. The necessary effect of the removal on such a ground was to remove the whole suit. This brought it all before the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for complete disposition.\n By the Act of July 27, 1866 (chapter 288, 14 St. 306), a defendant of a different state from that of the plaintiff was enabled to remove a separable controversy between them, leaving the plaintiff, if he so desired, to proceed in the state court against the other defendant or defendants on the other issues. But later came the Act of March 3, 1875 ( chapter 137, 18 St. pt. 3, p. 470), the language of which was repeated in the present section 28 of the Judicial Code, and with minor changes is now the law. See 36 St. 1094 (28 USCA  71). It provides that-\n'When in any suit mentioned in this section there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different states, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the District Court of the United States for the proper district.'\n\n In Barney v. Latham, \n103 \nU.S. 205, 211\n, 26 S. L. Ed 514, this court held that, in distinction from the removal provided in the act of 1866, the act of 1875 removed the whole case to the federal court for judgment. This conclusion was confirmed in Brooks v. Clark, \n119 \nU.S. 502, 512\n, 7 S. Ct. 301, and in Torrence v. Shedd, \n144 \nU.S. 527, 530\n, 12 S. Ct. 726. The rule established by these cases has never been varied or questioned.\n It was the duty, therefore, of the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the other issue in this case, which it erroneously remanded to the lower court to be dismissed. We must then reverse the judgment and send the cause \n\n[277 U.S. 54, 61]\n\u00a0\n back to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings.\n It may be suggested that we might consider the correctness of the judgment against the city in favor of the Brown-Crummer Company on the city warrants and decide that. We have been advised by counsel that a case involving the validity of such warrants under the state law is now pending in the Texas Supreme Court, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals should have the benefit of that decision before passing on the question.\n Without intimating that the decision of the Texas court on the question of city warrants will be controlling under the circumstances of this case, we deem it better to remand the whole case to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings and complete disposition.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK v. UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 260\nArgued: March 2, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis and Edward L. Patterson, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here relates to the validity of certain taxes assessed by the City of New Brunswick, New Jersey, upon real estate to which the United States Housing Corporation held the legal title.\n The Housing Corporation was organized by authority of the President, pursuant to an Act of May, 1918,1 for the purpose of providing housing for employees of the United States and workers engaged in industries connected with the national defense during the late war; for which an appropriation was made. The entire capital stock of the Corporation is held for and on behalf of the United States. For the purpose stated the Corporation purchased in 1918 a tract of land in New Brunswick, subdivided it into lots, and erected houses upon them.\n By an amendment of July, 1912,2 providing for winding up its affairs, the Corporation was authorized and directed to sell and convey all its property remaining undisposed of after the termination of the war, 'Provided, however, That no sale or conveyance shall be made hereunder on credit without reserving a first lien on such property for \n\n[276 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n the unpaid purchase money.' Section 1. Pursuant thereto the Corporation entered into to contracts for the sale of the New Brunswick lots to various purchasers. Each contract provided that the Corporation should sell and the purchaser should buy the property at a stipulated price, to be paid in instalments, the first on the execution of the contract, and the remainder in equal monthly payments, with interest; that after the purchaser had paid ten per cent. of the purchase price the Corporation should execute and deliver a special warranty deed for the property and the purchaser should execute and deliver a note or notes with mortgage on the property to secure the balance of the purchase price in accordance with the terms of the contract; that taxes should be apportioned as of the date of the contract and all thereafter becoming due should be paid by the purchaser, and if he failed so to do and they were paid by the Corporation, the amount thereof should be added to the purchase price; and that if the purchaser defaulted for thirty days in the performance of the terms of the contract the Corporation might retain all payments made thereon as liquidated damages, and the purchaser should be relieved from any further obligation under the contract.\n The purchasers entered upon and took possession of the lots upon the execution of their respective contracts. Either then or later each paid the Corporation the entire percentage of the purchase price which entitled him under the terms of his contract to receive a deed. Nearly all of such payments were made prior to October 1, 1920. But because the City had meanwhile assessed certain taxes on these properties, which remained unpaid, the Corporation refused to execute deeds to the purchasers; and they, consequently, did not execute notes and mortgages for the balance of the purchase price.\n While the Corporation thus continued to hold the legal title to the lots the City assessed them for taxation to the \n\n[276 U.S. 547, 554]\n\u00a0\n purchasers for the years 1920 to 1923, inclusive. These taxes were not paid. And thereupon, to prevent threatened tax sales the Corporation brought this suit, in which the United States joined as a plaintiff, in the federal court for New Jersey, to have the assessments canceled and sales for the collection of the taxes enjoined. None of the purchasers were parties to this suit. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court held that the assessment for the year 1920 was invalid, but, being of opinion that the equitable title had passed to the purchasers under their contracts in such manner as to render the lots taxable as their property after the dates on which they had become entitled to their deeds, sustained the validity of the assessments for the year 1921 and subsequent years on all lots for which the purchasers had become entitled to deeds prior to the date of the assessment, and denied an injunction to restrain the sales. 1 F.(2d) 741. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, being of opinion that the assessment of taxes to the purchasers for 1920 and subsequent years, while the legal title to the lots was still in the Corporation, was invalid, reversed the decree of the District Court and directed it to cancel the assessment for such years4 and enjoin the sale of the lots for the enforcement of the taxes so assessed. 11 F.(2d) 476.\n The City concedes here that the assessments made to the purchasers for the year 1920 were invalid under the New Jersey law;5 and the question before us relates only to the taxes for 1921 and subsequent years. \n\n[276 U.S. 547, 555]\n\u00a0\n It is unquestioned that so long as the Corporation held title to the lots as an instrumentality of the United States and solely for its use and benefit, they were not subject to taxation by the City. Clallam v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341, 344\n, 44 S. Ct. 121. But after the purchasers had made the payments entitling them to receive deeds to the lots, the Corporation ceased to hold title solely for the United States, and held partly for the purchasers, who had become the equitable owners of the property and entitled to conveyance of the title subject to their obligation to execute mortgages securing the payment of the balance of the purchase price. In equity the situation was then the same as if the Corporation had conveyed title to the purchasers, as owners, and they had mortgaged the lots to the Corporation to secure the unpaid purchase money. As between the Corporation and the City, the taxability of the lots is to be determined as if both the deeds and the mortgages had been executed; that is, as if the Corporation, while conveying the legal title to the purchasers, had retained a mortgage lien to secure the balance of the purchase price.\n By the specific provision of the Act of 1919, the Corporation was not authorized to convey the property 'without reserving a first lien ... for the unpaid purchase money;' and the contracts of sale could not waive, and did not purport to waive, this lien or subordinate it to taxes.\n Under the provisions of the New Jersey law the taxes assessed to the purchasers as equitable owners, rest upon the entire lots including not only the interests of the purchasers as equitable owners, but the interest of the Corporation retained and held as security for the payment of the unpaid purchase moneys; no distinction being made under that law between the interest of the owners and that of mortgagees or lienors. We see no reason, however, if the New Jersey law permits, why the \n\n[276 U.S. 547, 556]\n\u00a0\n City may not assess taxes against the purchasers upon the entire value of the lots and enforce collection thereof by sale of their interest in the property. With that the Corporation and the United States have no concern. But it is plain, under the doctrine of the Clallam Case, that the City is without authority to enforce the collection of the taxes thus assessed against the purchasers by a sale of the interest in the lots which was retained and held by the Corporation as security for the payment of the unpaid purchase money whether as an incident to the retention of the legal title or as a reserved lien or as a contract right to mortgages. That interest, being held by the Corporation for the benefit of the United States, is paramount to the taxing power of the State and cannot be subjected by the City to sale for taxes.\n We conclude that, although the City should not be enjoined from collecting the taxes assessed to the purchasers by sales of their interests in the lots, as equitable owners, it should be enjoined from selling the lots for the collection of such taxes unless all rights, liens, and interests in the lots, retained and held by the Corporation as security for the unpaid purchase moneys, are expressly excluded from such sales, and they are made, by express terms, subject to all such prior rights, liens, and interests. This, we think, will meet the equities of the case as between the Corporation and the City, and fully protect the paramount right of the United States.\n The decree is reversed; and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the District Court reached the proper conclusion and that its decree should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 550, c. 74; as amended, 40 Stat. 594, c. 92 (Comp.

Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  1, 34 Stat. 584, 585; Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539, 547; Act of Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  401, 41 Stat. 456, 475 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St.  8563).\n J. K. Dering Coal Company, which owns a large mine located on the Illinois Central Railroad, desired a direct connection also with the railroad commonly known as the Big Four. To this end, it built a private track, about three and a half miles long, from its mine to the right of way of the Big Four. Thereafter it applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission, under paragraph 9 of section 1, for an order requiring the Big Four to construct, maintain, and operate the desired switch connection. The mine, its track, and the proposed connection are wholly within the state of Illinois. Upon full hearing, the Commission found the facts which, under that paragraph, must exist before a shipper can require the railroad to construct a connection. That is, it found that the coal company had built its track up to the right of way of the railroad; that it had made application in writing for the connection; that it had tendered interstate traffic; that the business was sufficient to justify the construction and maintenance of the proposed connection; that the connection is reasonably practicable and can be put in with safety; and that the connection should be constructed and maintained by \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 407]\n\u00a0\n the railroad. Thereupon the Commission entered the order prayed for. J. K. Dering Coal Co. v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co., 96 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 143; Id., 109 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 55.\n The Big Four brought this suit against the United States and the coal company in the federal court for Northern Illinois to set aside that order. The Commission intervened as defendant. \n1\n The case was heard before three judges upon motion for an interlocutory injunction, which was denied. Later, upon final hearing, a decree was entered dismissing the bill. That decree is here on appeal, under Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 USCA 47), and section 238 of the Judicial Code as amended by Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (18 USCA  345).\n The District Court did not make findings of facts, render an opinion, or indicate by recital in the decree the grounds of its decision. The abridged record occupies 492 printed pages, besides numerous exhibits. There are 21 assignments of error. And the appellant's briefs fill more than 200 pages. No irregularity in the proceedings before the Commission is suggested. It is urged that some essential findings of fact made by the Commission are without support; but the evidence is clearly ample. The claim of invalidity is rested mainly upon contentions of an entirely different nature. These are numerous; and all are groundless. But, because they are peculiar in character and novel, they must be stated in detail.\n First. It is contended that the power of the Commission, under paragraph 9, to require the construction of a switch connection with a side track built by a shipper and \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 408]\n\u00a0\n located wholly within one state, was abrogated by paragraph 22, which was added to section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act by Transportation Act 1920. Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 478. Paragraph 22 declares:\n'The authority of the Commission conferred by paragraphs (18) to (21), both inclusive, shall not extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one state. ...'\n\n Paragraph 22 in no way affects the power conferred by paragraph 9. By its terms, it operates as a limitation only upon the authority conferred upon the Commission in 1920 by paragraphs 18 to 21. These paragraphs relate to the construction, acquisition, extension, and abandonment of a railroad. They deal primarily with rights sought to be exercised by the carrier. Compare Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331, 345\n, 44 S. Ct. 376; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263; Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Jackson & E. R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244, 249\n, 46 S. Ct. 535. In denying their application to side tracks or spurs, paragraph 22 refers to tracks built by the carrier as a part of its railroad. Compare Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 281, 285\n, 290 S., 37 S. Ct. 287. Paragraph 9, on the other hand, relates to switch connections with private sidings built by the shipper. The power to compel such had been granted to the Commission by the Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  1, 34 Stat. 584, 585. Futhermore, Congress gave explicit proof that, in adding paragraph 22 to section 1, it meant to leave paragraph 9 unaffected. For Transportation Act 1920 provided specifically that the paragraph concerning switch connections, which as it then stood was unnumbered, should (without change) be numbered 9. Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91,  401, 41 Stat. 456. 475.\n Second. It is contended that if the authority given the Commission by paragraph 9 was not abrogated by the en- \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 409]\n\u00a0\n actment of paragraph 22, its exercise in the present case was subject to the requirements of paragraphs 18 to 21, and that the Commission's order is void for noncompliance therewith. The contention has two phases. In the first place, it is said that if the switch connection is made, the side track, by enabling the Big Four to reach into territory hitherto served wholly by another carrier, will become an extension of its lines within the meaning of paragraph 18. Compare Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263; Marion & Eastern R. R. Co. v. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., 318 Ill. 436, 149 N. E. 492; certiorari denied \n271 \nU.S. 661\n, 46 S. Ct. 473. This argument proceeds from the same misconception of the purpose of paragraphs 18 to 21 as does the argument discussed above. These paragraphs deal with construction and abandonment on the part of the carrier, not with side tracks built by the shipper. Furthermore, the order gave the Big Four no trackage rights over the coal company's track. The mere fact that a side track with which a connection is sought extends to an industry located on another railroad does not make the switch connection or the track of the shipper, or both combined, an extension of the railroad within the meaning of paragraphs 18 to 21.\n The Big Four appears to place greater reliance on the other phase of the contention. The coal company's track crosses at grade, in addition to three highways, the tracks of the Illinois Central and the Southern Illinois. There is an agreement between these carriers and the coal company under which, by means of appropriate switch connections which it is physically possible to make, trains from these other lines could pass over the track, and thus, as it contended, tap territory now tributary to the Big Four. The argument is that, because of the possibilities of the use of the track by these other carriers, it is an extension within the meaning of paragraph 18. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 410]\n\u00a0\n supra. But no such connection has been made or attempted or threatened; and neither the Illinois Commerce Commission nor the Interstate Commerce Commission has authorized such connection or use. If the track is used by the Illinois Central or the Southern Illinois in the manner described, paragraph 20 of section 1 furnishes the appellant with an appropriate remedy. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., supra.\n Third. It is contended that, regardless of the fact that the order of the Commission provides only for a switch connection with the siding of the coal company, the siding must be regarded as an extension within the meaning of paragraphs 18 to 21, because, under the law of Illinois, all tracks which cross highways are deemed public tracks, and this track crosses highways. It is true that, under section 45 of the Public Utilities Act of the state (Cahill's Illinois Revised Statutes 1925, c. 111a, par. 60), a switch track, though built by an industry and used in connection with it, is a part of the railroad subject to public use. Public Utilities Commission v. Smith, 298 Ill. 151, 131 N. E. 371; St. Louis, Springfield & Peoria R. R. v. Commerce Commission, 309 Ill. 621, 141 N. E. 405. But obviously a state cannot, in respect to the regulation of interstate commerce, override the will of Congress. Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n272 \nU.S. 605\n, 47 S. Ct. 207. The Commission was given the authority to compel an interstate carrier to construct a switch connection with a side track built by an industry. The state cannot curtail the Commission's power over interstate commerce by denying it authority to compel a connection with such a side track unless the circumstances are such that public necessity and convenience require an extension of the railroad under paragraphs 18 to 21. Compare Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Jackson & E. R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 535. As the Commission said, when making the \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 411]\n\u00a0\n order:\n'We, of course, are not concerned with the character of the track with respect to intrastate commerce.' 109 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 55, 57.\n\n Fourth. It is contended that the coal company is estopped by certain proceedings in the state courts from denying that the track from the mine to the right of way of the Big Four is an extension, within the meaning of paragraphs 18 to 21. The facts relied upon, so far as material, are these. In 1922, the coal company applied to the Illinois Commerce Commission for leave to build this track, and later prayed that its use be limited to a private minelead track. The Big Four challenged the Commission's jurisdiction, on the ground that the proceeding was one to compel the connection or extension of interstate carriers and was within the exclusive control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Illinois Commerce Commission overruled the challenge, found for the petitioners on the merits, and, at their request, provided in its orders that the track when built and connected with the Big Four should not be used for any other purpose than to serve the mine of the coal company, until permission for further use should be granted by the Illinois Commission. Thereupon the Big Four assailed the orders of the state commission in the circuit court for Saline county and was defeated there. After the validity of the orders had been affirmed by that court, the track was constructed. Later, the Supreme Court of the state, reviewing the circuit court's decision, held the order of the state commission void, on the ground, urged by the Big Four, that, in spite of the limitation in the orders, the track would be, under the law of Illinois, a public track, and, hence an extension of the railroads within the meaning of paragraphs 18 to 21, and that, since the carrier was engaged in interstate commerce, the jurisdiction to compel construction of the switch vested in the Interstate \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 412]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission, C., C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Commerce Commission, 315 Ill. 461, 476, 146 N. E. 606, 612. That court said:\n'This section (45 of the State Utilities Act) cannot be held to apply to situation coming under the Federal Transportation Act. As to such the latter act is supreme. Nor can it be said that the Legislature in enacting section 45 sought to confer on the Illinois Commerce Commission jurisdiction of those matters coming under the Federal Transportation Act. The steam railways involved here are interstate carriers. That which amounts to an extension of their lines is under the sole jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Illinois Commerce Commission is without jurisdiction.'\n\n The Big Four, having thus convinced the state court that the order of the state commission was void because the matter is one within the jurisdiction of the Federal Commission, insists now that the latter cannot act because of the state decision. The judgment of the highest court of the state is, of course, conclusive in so far as it declares that the state commission exceeded its statutory powers. But obviously neither the Legislature nor the courts of a state can limit the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to compel connections with private side tracks. The declaration of the state court that the track which the federal authority determines is private shall be deemed public cannot affect the validity of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. If it could, construction by the railroad of the switch connection with the shipper's track would not be compellable under either state or federal law. Compare United States v. New York Cent. R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 457, 459\n, 47 S. Ct. 130.\n Fifth. It is contended that the coal company is not, within the meaning of paragraph 9, a 'shipper' on the Big Four, because its mine was already connected with the Illinois Central. The argument is that Congress did not intend to give a shipper the right to a direct connection \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 413]\n\u00a0\n with more than one railroad. There is nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act which justifies such a limitation of the general language of paragraph 9. Coal mines are often connected with more than one railroad. Compare United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533\n, 44 S. Ct. 610; In re Irregularities in Mine Ratings, 25 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 286, 287; Dering Mines Co. v. Director General, 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 265; Fairmont & Cleveland Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 269; Bell & Zoller Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. Co., 74 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 433.\n Sixth. It is contended that the coal company is not a shipper on the Big Four, within the meaning of paragraph 9, because up to the time of the application to the Commission it had not actually shipped coal by this route over the Big four. The argument is that no one, unless he is already a shipper at the time of the application to the Commission, is entitled to a switch connection. Congress imposed no such limitation. It safeguarded the expenditures of the carrier by other provisions. It limited the railroad's obligation to the building of the switch connection, leaving the burden of building the side track upon the shipper. Winters Metallic Paint Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co., 16 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 587; Ralston Townsite Co. v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 22 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 354; National Industrial Traffic League v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co., 61 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 120, 121; Certain-Teed Products Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. R. Co., 68 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 260, 263. And the railroad cannot be ordered to build the switch until after the shipper has built the private siding. Virginia Coal & Fuel Co. v. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co., 55 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 61; Schlicher v. Director General, 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 181, 186.\n Seventh. It is contended that the coal company is not a shipper on the Big Four, within the meaning of paragraph 9, because the railroad can be compelled to build the connection only with a 'private side track which may \n\n[275 U.S. 404, 414]\n\u00a0\n be constructed to connect with its railroad,' and the track of the coal company, if a private track, could not be legally constructed. The argument is that, under the law of Illinois, only a public track may cross a highway; that an Illinois mining corporation has no power to build a public track; that, since the coal company is an Illinois corporation the construction of the track was ultra vires; that hence, whether the track be public or private, it is an illegal structure; and that consequently it is not a track 'which may be constructed' within the meaning of paragraph 9. Congress obviously did not impose upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the duty of determining, before issuing an order, whether or not a private track actually in existence had been constructed by the shipper ultra vires. Whether in so acting the shipper transgressed powers conferred upon it by the state is a question which cannot be raised in this suit. If the state concludes to question the legality of the shippers's acts, it must do so in a direct proceeding instituted by it for that purpose. Kerfoot v. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank, \n218 \nU.S. 281, 287\n, 31 S. Ct. 14\n\n\n Thus all the contentions of the Big Four are clearly unfounded. The District Court properly refused to grant a stay of the Commission's order pending an appeal. It is difficult to believe that the appeal would have been persisted in, if that court had delivered an opinion setting forth its reasons for dismissing the bill. Where the trial court omits to state the grounds of its decision, the appellate court is denied an important aid in the consideration of the case; and the defeated party is often unable to determine whether the case presents a question worthy of consideration by the appellate court. Thus both the litigants and this court are subjected to unnecessary labor. Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 222. See, also, Lawrence v.

Park, of Macon, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In July, 1926, the Richland State Bank, organized under the laws of the State of Georgia, closed its doors and turned its affairs over to the defendant in error, the Superintendent of Banks for the State. In the following September the Superintendent issued a notice to each of the plaintiffs in error that an assessment of 100 per centum on the par value of his stock was levied, as necessary to pay the depositors in full. These proceedings were under and in accordance with the Banking Act of Georgia, of 1919, as amended in 1925, codified in 13 Park's Annotated Code,  2268( t). That section provides that if any stockholder notified shall neglect to pay the assessment the Superintendent shall issue an execution for the amount, to be enforced like other executions, 'provided, however, that any stockholder shall have the right by affidavit of illegality, as in cases of affidavits of illegality to other executions, to contest his liability for such assessment and the amount and necessity thereof.' In that case the affidavit and execution are to be returned to court for trial. The execution is made 'a lien on all property of the defendant subject to levy and sale for the amount which shall be adjudged to be due thereon from the date of the issuance thereof by the Superintendent.' The plaintiffs in error filed a petition in equity to enjoin the Superintendent from taking the next statutory steps, on the ground that the section was contrary to the \n\n[277 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment by denying to them due process of law. A general demurrer was sustained by the trial court and by the Supreme Court of the State. 164 Ga. 350, 138 S. W. 670.\n The objection urged by the plaintiffs in error seems to be that this section purports to authorize an execution and the creation of a lien at the beginning, before and without any judicial proceeding. But the stockholders are allowed to raise and try every possible defense by an affidavit of illegality, which, as said by the Supreme Court of Georgia makes the so-called execution 'a mode only of commencing against them suits to enforce their statutory liability to depositors.' A reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present the defense is given and if a defense is presented the execution is the result of a trial in court. The Fourteenth Amendment is not concerned with the form. Missouri ex rel. Hurwitz v. North, \n271 \nU.S. 40, 42\n, 46 S. Ct. 384. The fact that the execution is issued in the first instance by an agent of the State but not from a court, followed as it is by personal notice and a right to take the case into court, is a familiar method in Georgia and is open to no objection. Martin v. Bennett (D. C.) 291 F. 626, 630, 631. If the debtor does not demand a trial the execution does not need the sanction of a judgment (see Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272); the plaintiffs in error by becoming stockholders had assumed the liability on which they are to be held. Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 27 S. Ct. 755\n\n\n As to the lien, nothing is more common than to allow parties alleging themselves to be creditors to establish in advance by attachment a lien dependent for its effect upon the result of the suit. We see nothing in this case that requires further argument to show that the decision below was right.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL CREDIT CO. v.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel brought by the United States in November, 1925, in the federal court for the Western District of Washington, under section 3450 of the Revised Statutes1, to forfeit a Ford coupe upon the ground that it had been used in the removal, deposit, and concealment of intoxicating liquor, with intent to defraud the United States of the tax thereon. The Commercial Credit Company intervened as claimant, asserting title to the car and alleging that it had no knowledge that the car was used or intended to be used in violation of law.\n By stipulation of the parties the case was heard by the District Judge without the intervention of a jury. The evidence showed that in October a customs inspector who, in consequence of reports that this car was being used to distribute Canadian liquor about the city of Seattle, had \n\n[276 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n watched its movements for some days, discovered one Campbell-who had purchased the car under a conditional sale-in the act of backing the car out of an alley in the rear of his house, stopped the car, searched it, found that it contained thirteen quarts of whisky and gin, arrested Campbell, and seized the car. The liquor bore labels indicating that it was of foreign manufacture, and there were no stamps on the bottles showing the payment of duty or internal revenue taxes. It was also stipulated at the hearing that Campbell was prosecuted in the District Court under the National Prohibition Act2 on the charges of 'unlawful possession and transportation of liquor and plead guilty to unlawful possession, whereupon the government dismissed as to the transportation, and that covers the identical transaction here involved.' Thereafter the government brought the libel to forfeit the car. \n3\n At the close of the evidence the claimant moved to dismiss the libel, on the ground, among others, that the United States had elected to proceed under the National Prohibition Act and was barred from proceeding under section 3450. The District Judge denied this motion, and entered a decree condemning and forfeiting the car to the United States. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that, as Campbell's conviction of unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor was under section 3 of title 2 of the Prohibition Act (27 USCA  12), and did not entail a disposition of the car under section 26 of that title (27 USCA  40), the government was at liberty to proceed under section 3450 for the forfeiture of the car. 17 F.( 2d) 902.\n The petition for the writ of certiorari was based solely on the ground that under section 26 of the Prohibition Act the \n\n[276 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n government was barred from proceeding to forfeit the car under section 3450; and no other question will be considered.

Drummond, No. 60, \n275 \nU.S. 199\n, 48 S. Ct. 53, Nov. 21, 1927\n\n\n Section 26 provides that:\n'When the Commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. Whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle ... and shall arrest any person in charge thereof. Such officer shall at once proceed against the person arrested under the provisions of this title in any court having competent jurisdiction; but the said vehicle or conveyance shall be returned to the owner upon execution by him of a good and valid bond ... approved by said officer and ... conditioned to return said property to the custody of said officer on the day of trial to abide the judgment of the court. The court upon conviction of the person so arrested ... unless good cause to the contrary is shown by the owner, shall order a sale by public auction of the property seized, and the officer making the sale, after deducting the expenses of keeping the property, the fee for the seizure, and the cost of the sale, shall pay all liens, according to their priorities, which are established, by intervention or otherwise at said hearing or in other proceeding brought for said purpose, as being bona fide and as having been created without the lienor having any notice that the carrying vehicle was being used or was to be used for illegal transportation of liquor, and shall pay the balance of the proceeds into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.' \n\n[276 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n The essential distinction between section 26 and section 3450, in so far as relates to the forfeiture of a vehicle, is that, where section 26 is the only applicable provision for its forfeiture, the interests of innocent owners and lienors are not forfeited, but, where it may be forfeited under section 3450 by reason of its use to evade the payment of a tax, the interests of those who are innocent are not saved. United States v. One Ford Coupe , \n272 \nU.S. 321, 325\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025.\n\n In Port Gardner Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 564, 566\n, 47 S. Ct. 165, which came to this court on a certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the driver of an automobile seized by prohibition agents had been charged with possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor in violation of the Prohibition Act, and had pleaded guilty to both charges and been sentenced. In answering one of the questions presented by the certificate we held that the 'prosecution with effect' of the driver of a car under the National Prohibition Act constituted 'an election by the government to proceed under section 26 of that act,' and thereby prevented the forfeiture of the car under section 3450. As to this we said:\n'The disposition of the automobile prescribed in section 26 became mandatory after' the driver's 'conviction, and being inconsistent with the disposition under section 3450 necessarily precluded resort to proceedings under the latter section.'\n\n The claimant states that the question here presented is that which was referred to in a concurring opinion in the Port Gardner Co. Case, 567 ( 47 S. Ct. 166), namely, 'whether the prohibition officer discovering one in the act of transportation may disregard the plain and direct commands of section 26 to proceed against the vehicle as there directed'; and on that assumption the arguments have been largely directed to the question whether, whenever an officer discovers a person in the act of transporting intoxicating liquor in a vehicle, the provisions of section 26 become mandatory in such sense as to furnish the exclusive remedy for the forfeiture \n\n[276 U.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n of the vehicle. \n4\n But, since it appears that the officer in fact seized the vehicle and arrested Campbell, who was in fact proceeded against under the Prohibition Act, the question of the officer's duty to proceed under section 26 is not here involved.\n In this case Campbell was prosecuted both for the unlawful possession and the unlawful transportation of the intoxicating liquors. These are made criminal offenses by section 3 of title 2 of the Prohibition Act, and are punishable under section 29 of that title (27 USCA  46). Section 26- although not in itself making either of these acts a criminal offense- provides that, when an officer discovers a person in the act of unlawfully transporting intoxicating liquor in a vehicle, he shall seize both the vehicle and the intoxicating liquors 'transported or possessed illegally,' arrest such person. and proceed against him under the Prohibition Act; and that, if such person is convicted, the vehicle shall be disposed of as therein prescribed.\n The stipulations in this case, read in thelight of the evidence, show that the unlawful possession for which Campbell was prosecuted, and of which he pleaded guilty, was not a separate possession antecedent to and independent of the transportation-which would not have entailed a forfeiture of the car under section 26-but was the possession involved in and incidental to the transportation itself; that is, the 'possession in transportation' referred to in United States v. One Ford Coupe , supra, 334 (47 S. Ct. 154).\n Campbell's conviction on the charge of such possession, following his arrest when discovered in the act of transportation, required, we think, a disposition of the car under the provisions of section 26. That section, read in its entirety, governs the disposition of the car where the \n\n[276 U.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n person in charge of the vehicle is convicted of the unlawful possession incidental to the transportation, as well as where he is convicted of the unlawful transportation itself. Therefore, under the doctrine of the Port Gardner Co. Case, the disposition of the car under section 26 becoming mandatory after Campbell's conviction, 'and being inconsistent with the disposition under section 3450, necessarily precluded resort to proceedings under the latter section.'\n This renders it unnecessary to consider whether, if Campbell had not been convicted of the unlawful possession, the government's voluntary dismissal of the charge of unlawful transportation, before trial, would likewise have precluded a resort to section 3450.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; and the cause will be remanded to the District Court, with instructions to dismiss the libel.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not sit in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

FIREMAN'S FUND INS. CO.(1928)\nNo. 510\nArgued: April 19, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John D. Grace, of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. T. Catesby Jones, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are eleven libels filed in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana by a Mexican corporation known as the Compania de Navegacion, against as many different insurance companies, English and American, on eleven separate policies, insuring the tug Wash Gray in favor of the libelant as owner in different sums aggregating $85,000, and covering a voyage of the tug while in tow from Tampico, Mexico, to Galveston, Tex.\n The tug was designed for inland waters. She was 87 1\/2 feet long, with 19 feet beam, 9 feet depth of hold, and was of 105 tons. She was insured specially for this sea voyage, to be towed, as agreed with the insuring companies, by the Freeport Sulphur No. 1, a vessel engaged in regular trade on the Gulf of Mexico, and measuring 309 feet in length, 45 feet beam, with 22 1\/2 feet depth, and of approximately 3,000 tons displacement. \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n When application was made for insurance, the underwriters required an inspection for seaworthiness, general fitness, and towing arrangements for that voyage. For that purpose two well-known marine surveyors, representing the various underwriters, made a thorough, critical inspection, followed by recommendations for preparations for the voyage, including certain overhauling, particularly of her towing bitts and decking, and for the planking up of doors, ports, and other openings. They reported in writing to the underwriters that the requirements had been complied with, and certified her seaworthiness and her fitness for the particular voyage. Because of the extrahazardous risk involved in the transit of this small inland vessel in tow at sea, the premiums were much increased by the underwriters. They varied, in the different policies, between 1 1\/2 to 2 1\/8 per cent., or from six to more than eight times the usual rate for a tow of the ordinary size and power to resist the sea. The voyage contemplated was first to Freeport, Tex., a distance of some 420 miles, a trip taking some 45 or 50 hours. From there she was to go to Galveston by another towing vessel, also to be satisfactory to the underwriters. The weather from Tampico was fair, and the sea calm. She followed nicely, handled well, and continued in tow through the first night and through the next day, making some 9 miles per hour with no straining or difficulty. Ordinarily, under her own power, she was good for from 10 to 12 miles per hour. During the second evening came a fresh to strong northwesterly breeze. Later the weather grew squally, until about 8 o'clock the wind reached a velocity of 25 miles an hour, with occasional puffs or gusts. Because of these and a cross current and swell, the sea grew choppy, with waves running up 4 to 5 feet from trough to crest, and sufficient to break over her head. The rough weather and the choppy seas out a strain on \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n the vessel. As required by contract, she had up all steam necessary to work her pumps. The mate was sent below, and in a few minutes reported to the captain that the forward bitts had worked loose, that her seams were opening, and she was taking water rapidly. The pounding and straining continued until she made more water than her pumps could discharge. She was then about 100 miles from Freeport, Tex., and had completed three- fourths of the voyage to that point. The Wash Gray's captain signaled to the towing ship to stop. The water in the tug had rolled forward, thus bringing her head down. The tow lines were then cut. This brought her head up, and she righted herself. The larger vessel stood by. The captain of the Wash Gray notified the towing captain that the tug could stand no more pulling. Shortly thereafter the captain and crew of the tug were taken aboard the ship for safety. The latter then stood by until daylight, when the master sent his engineer, mate, and some six men on board the tug to attempt to save her. They found no water in the boiler for steam. They attempted by a hose to pump it in, but the leaking sea water put out the fire. The vessels then proceeded slowly at one mile per hour until half past 10, when the tug began to sink slowly, and went down at half past 11.\n The District Judge found for the owner of the Wash Gray on all the policies. The insurance companies appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which, without objecting to the facts as found by the District Court, reversed the case, with directions to dismiss the libels. 19 F.(2d) 493, 496.\n Counsel for the insurance companies seek to sustain the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals on four grounds. They say, first, that the insurance companies were released from liability because there was not disclosed to them before the voyage a contract of towage, a term of which was material to the risk and was concealed, and the policies were thus avoided. The towage contract provided as follows:\n\n\n[277 U.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n \"Freeport Sulphur No. 1 will furnish hawser. All other risk and expense to be borne by the tug. It is understood you will keep sufficient men on board to keep up steam and man the tug's pumps. S. S. Freeport No. 1 is not responsible in any way for loss or damage to the Wash Gray.'\n All the policies had attached to them by rider and rubber stamp a clause like the following:\n'Any agreement, contract or act, past or future, positive or implied, by the insured whereby any right of recovery of the insured against any vessel, person or corporation is released, decreased, transferred or lost, which would, on acceptance of abandonment, or payment of loss by this company, belong to this company but for such agreement, contract or act, shall render this policy null and void as to the amount of any such loss or damage, but the company's right to retain or recover the full premium shall not be affected.'\n\n We do not think that the towing contract has the effect claimed for it by the companies. It did not release the Freeport from any loss or damage to the Wash Gray due to the negligence of the master or crew of the towing vessel; and for a loss thus caused the companies would be subrogated to the claim of the owner of the Wash Gray.\n The rule laid down by this court in The Steamer Syracuse, 12 Wall. 167, 171 (20 L. Ed. 382), covers the point. That was a libel by the owner of a canal boat agaisnt the steamer Syracuse for negligence in towing the canal boat and running her into a vesselat anchor in the harbor of New York. The claim was made that there had been a special agreement between the canal boat and the steamboat by which the canal boat was being towed at her own risk. Upon this point the court said:\n'It is unnecessary to consider the evidence relating to the alleged contract of towage, because, if it be true, as the appellant says, that, by special agreement, the canal- \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n boat was being towed at her own risk, nevertheless, the steamer is liable, if, through the negligence of those in charge of her, the canal-boat has suffered loss. Although the policy of the law has not imposed on the towing boat the obligation resting on a common carrier, it does require on the part of the persons engaged in her management, the exercise of reasonable care, caution, and maritime skill, and if these are neglected, and disaster occurs, the towing boat must be visited with the consequences.'\n\n In view of this state of the law, the towing contract here shown was not a fact material to the risk, a concealment of which from the underwriters would injure them or avoid the policy.\n The second objection is that the tug was negligently towed at too great a speed, proximately causing the loss. There is really very little evidence to sustain the claim that there was any negligence on the part of the towing vessel or her master or her crew. The trial court specifically found that the towing was well done, that 9 miles an hour was not too fast a speed to be maintained, but that on the contrary the maintenance of such speed was necessary in order to prevent the towed vessel from turning over or careening, and there is no finding to the contrary by the Court of Appeals.\n The third objection is that the tug was not seaworthy, and therefore the risk never attached. The finding by the trial court distinctly negatives any such claim. It said:\n'Libelant's case, upon this point, does not depend entirely on the fact that, as a condition precedent to the underwriting, the insurers required and obtained inspections, detailed recommendations of two expert marine surveyors, and a certificate of compliance with all requirements deemed by them necessary to show that the Wash Gray was seaworthy and fit, equipped and apparelled with a view to the particular voyage, in tow of the particular \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n ship to Freeport, to be thence towed by another approved by them to Galveston, for the specific, known purpose of general overhauling and changing of her engines. There is, additionally, the oral testimony which clearly shows that these surveyors were correct in their report and had competently functioned in making their recommendations and accepting the compliance by the owner, as per their certificate. The unwarranted assumption that the Wash Gray pulled apart, upon which the contrary is argued in the brief of respondents, is not sustained by the evidence. She did not pull apart in any particular. It is conclusively shown, and uncontradicted, that her forward bitts pulled loose because of the extraordinary straining and pounding under the stress of weather encountered. This was overcome, as the evidence shown, by the rigging of the Spanish windlass. The water which caused the sinking was shipped through her seams, from which the caulking had worked by the same cause. The only hope of overcoming this was by pumping, but pumping was inadequate.' 14 F.(2d) 199.\n\n This issue, however, brings up clearly the difference between the view of the District Court and that of the Court of Appeals in respect to liability in this case. What does 'seaworthy' mean in the implied or expressed warranty to which the insured is to be held?\n Arnould on Marine Insurance, vol. II (10th English Ed.) says:\n'Section 710. It is obvious that there can be no fixed and positive standard of seaworthiness, but that it must vary, with the varying exigencies of mercantile enterprise. The ship,' said Lord Cairns, 'should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter' on the voyage. Steel v. State Line S. S. Co. (1877) 3 App. Cases, 72, 77. ...\n\n'Again the class of vessel may be such as will not admit of being put into that condition of seaworthiness \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n requisite in ordinary cases for the contemplated voyage. The effect of this is not to dispense with the implied warranty of seaworthiness, but to accommodate the warranty to what is reasonably practicable in the particular case. But the underwriter must be informed of the peculiar nature of the risk. Thus, if a steamer built for river navigation is to be sailed from this country to Calcutta or to Odessa, and the underwriter accept the risk with full information as to the class of vessel and the intended voyage, the assured is only required to make her as seaworthy for the voyage as is reasonably practicable with such a vessel by ordinary available means.' Burges v. Wickham ( 1863) 3 B. & S. 669; The Vortigern (1899) P. 159; Clapham v. Langton, 34 Law Journal, Q. B. 46; Turnbull v. Jenson, 3 Aspinwall W. S. 433.\n\n This view of varying seaworthiness according to the circumstances known to both parties is fully supported in the case of Thebaud v. Great Western Insurance Co., 155 N. Y. 516, 50 N. E. 284. There the plaintiff applied to the defendant insurance company to insure, for a voyage from Philadelphia to Frontera, Mexico, a steamer in course of construction for use on rivers and inland waters. The defendant caused the vessel to be examined by an engineer, and issued the usual marine policy, exacting, however, a double premium. The vessel proceeded part of the way on her voyage, avoiding the sea, but in reaching Mexico she had to put out to open sea and was lost. It was held that, as both parties to the contract knew that the vessel was not a sea-going craft or suitable for the navigation of the high seas, and as the defendant issued its policy with full knowledge of the nature of the risk, the warranty of seaworthiness, implied in a contract of marine insurance should not be construed in a way to be repugnant to the general purpose of the parties in executing the contract, nor held to be broken by the \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n fact that the vessel was not so constructed as to be fit for a sea voyage. See 4 Joyce on Insurance,  2159\n\n\n In Klein v. Globe & Rutgers Insurance Co., 2 F.(2d) 137, decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit, the policy covered an upper river steamboat for a voyage down the Mississippi river to New Orleans, and from there in tow down the river and across the Gulf to Tampico, for which a higher premium than usual was paid. She was bulkheaded and otherwise prepared under the supervision of the agents of the insurance company for her voyage to Tampico. She was inspected and found to be thoroughly all right at the mouth of the Mississippi river, but, after she was being towed in the Gulf, an examination disclosed considerable water in the hold, and thereafter the vessel sank. It was held that the implied warranty of the insured was that the boat was seaworthy to the extent of being able to withstand all the ordinary perils of navigation of the upper river and that the perils of the sea in the Gulf, against which she was insured, were such perils as would be extraordinary to a vessel of her type. Judgment was given for the insured.\n Again, in Farmers' Feed Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, 166 F. 111, affirming the District Court for the Southern District of New York, 162 F. 379, the defendant insurance company knowing the age and exact condition of a barge, insured her for operation in waters adjacent to New York at a high premium. The loss occurred by reason of wind and tide near Brooklyn Bridge, and the defense was of unseaworthiness. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'The Mackey was undoubtedly very old and somewhat decayed, but her condition, her history and all the facts regarding her were fully known to the company at the time the policy was executed, a written record stating \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 78]\n\u00a0\n all the particulars being on file with the company. The underwriters knew that she was not a desirable risk, they knew that they were taking more than the ordinary hazard and they guarded themselves against it by charging more than the ordinary premium. The theater of the Mackey's operations were, by the express terms of the policy, confined to the waters adjacent to New York, practically New York harbor. The ordinary perils of the sea were not intended, but only such perils as were to be encountered in the comparatively quiet waters referred to. The question of seaworthiness must be considered in the light of the service required. ...'\n\n The fourth objection claimed by the respondents is that no recovery could be had because the loss of the Wash Gray was not caused by any peril insured against. These policies all contained a clause like the following:\n'It is the intent of this insurance company by this policy to fully indemnify the insured against the adventures and perils of the harbors, bays, sounds, seas, rivers and other waters above named.'\n\n It is urged by the insurance companies that weather, when the wind did not exceed a velocity of 25 miles, though with squalls, and with a cross current and swell producing a choppy sea, with waves 5 feet high and breaking over the head of the vessel, did not constitute a peril of the sea.\n There was some emphasis too placed by counsel for the companies on the log of the Sulphur No. 1, in which the state of the weather and of the sea seemed to be minimized. Upon this point the trial court finds it to be unreliable, because the entries in the log do not seem to have been made at the times of the observations they record, and moreover the entries were made from the standpoint of a vessel of 3,000 tons, and not one of a vessel of the size of the Wash Gray. The court said:\n\n\n[277 U.S. 66, 79]\n\u00a0\n \"What amounts to a light breeze, or a small swell, or a choppy sea, as logged for a large ocean-going steel vessel would be relatively, if logged for a little inland wooden tug, with two or three feet of freeboard, an extremely dangerous gale and rough sea. The first would ride comfortably, safely, and easily, while the other would toss and pound furiously, strain her timbers, lose the caulking of her butts and seams, and so contract the comparative calm for one to the comparative fury for the other. The oral testimony, however, makes such speculation and refinement unnecessary, since it convincingly shows that for the Wash Gray in the open Gulf, the wind and the condition of the sea were extremely perilous; that both the towing ship, its officers and crew, and the crew of the little tug omitted nothing that good seamanship, skill, and prudence would dictate.'\n But it is contended on behalf of the insurance companies that the phrase 'perils of the sea' has not a varying but an absolute meaning, and they rely on the language of Mr. Justice Story in The Reeside, 20 Fed. Cas. No. 11,657, p. 458, 2 Summ. 567, quoted and approved in Garrison v. Memphis Insurance Co., 19 How. 312. In the former case the question was whether great damage to bales of carpeting by absorbing oil which had leaked from a number of casks, said to have been improperly stowed, was occasioned by the perils of the sea and the extraordinary rolling of the schooner during the voyage. Justice Story said:\n'The phrase 'danger of the seas,' whether understood in its most limited sense, as importing only a loss by the natural accidents peculiar to that element; or whether understood in its more extended sense, as including inevitable accidents upon that element, must still, in either case, be clearly understood to include only such losses as are of an extraordinary nature, or arise from some irresistable \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 80]\n\u00a0\n force, or some overwhelming power, which can not be guarded against by the ordinary exertions of human skill and prudence.'\n\n But we think the definition of 'dangers of the sea' by Justice Story was meant by him to be applied in the ordinary case of a seagoing vessel, with no special circumstances as to the exceptional character of the vessel known to both parties and recognized by both in a high premium charged and paid. A contract of maritime insurance is usually not different from any other contract, except that the words and phrases used may have a technical nautical meaning, to be understood by the parties and enforced accordingly. We have seen, however, from the cases, that the term 'seaworthiness' varies with the circumstances and the exceptional features of the risk known to both parties. The view of the Circuit Court of Appeals that perils of the sea has an absolute meaning and may not be varied by the knowledge of the parties as to the circumstances and must be maintained stiffly in favor of the insurance companies and against the insured, is not necessary or reasonable. The variation n the significance of 'seaworthy,' as shown by the above authorities, when caused by exceptional circumstances known to both parties, applies as well to the meaning of perils of the sea as to that of seaworthiness. The two terms in such cases are correlative terms. Klein v. Globe & Rutgers Insurance Co., 2 F.(2d) 137, 139, 140.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals distinguished Klein v. Globe & Rutgers Insurance Co., Farmers' Feed Co. v. Insurance Co. and Thebaud v. Great Western Insurance Co., and 4 Joyce on Insurance,  2159, as follows:\n'Recovery was allowed in each of those cases on the actual contract, which was held to be different from the contract evidenced by the insurance policy. It was merely \n\n[277 U.S. 66, 81]\n\u00a0\n held that effect should be given to the actual contract. The facts in this case do not warrant the conclusion that appellant bound itself by its conduct, or by any agreement, to accept the risk of unseaworthiness.'\n\n We find ourselves unable to follow this distinction. In all these cases the recovery was on the contract, and the question was of the construction of the contract. Its construction was affected necessarily by the special circumstances surrounding the contract known to both parties and acted on by them in charging and paying an increased compensation for the risk run. The circumstances in this case are very like those shown in the cases cited. They certainly justify the conclusion to which we have come.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORONA CORD TIRE CO. v.

The District Court \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissed the bill for lack of validity of the patent. 10 F. (2d) 598. The dismissal was reversed, and the patent and the infringement charged were both sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 16 F. (2d) 419. A writ of certiorari was granted April 11, 1927 (\n273 \nU.S. 692\n, 47 S. Ct. 570), because in the prior case of Dovan Chemical Corporation v. National Aniline & Chemical Company, 292 F. 555, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed the decree of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (not reported) in favor of the Dovan Corporation, and had held that the patent was invalid on the ground that Weiss was not the first discoverer.\n The patent in suit relates to the vulcanization of rubber. Vulcanizing consists in mixing a small amount of sulphur with rubber and subjecting the mixture to heat for a period of time, during which a chemical combination of the rubber and sulphur takes place and commercial rubber is made. The patentee recites that the object of his invention is to 'improve rubber compounds so that the finished product shall be of superior quality and so that the time required for vulcanization shall be greatly reduced over that ordinarily required for such a purpose. It is known that when certain organic substances are added to the rubber mix during the compounding, a catalytic or similar action is produced which causes the rubber or similar gum to unite or react more rapidly and thorougly with sulphur or other vulcanizing agents.' The patentee continues:\n'I have discovered that disubstituted guanidines, particularly diphenylguanidine, is particularly effective for this purpose.' (This substance is indicated by the formula given in the patent.)\n\n He says further:\n'I am aware that triphenylguanidine has been suggested, and probably used to some extent, as an accelera- \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n tor in the vulcanization of rebber, but the use of diphenylguanidine for that purpose appears to have been unknown prior to my researches on this substance.\n\n'I have found that diphenylguanidine is much more powerful and efficacious as an accelerator in vulcanization than triphenylguanidine. For example, in the vulcanization of hard rubber articles the use of diphenylguanidine not only hastens the vulcanizing action but results in a final product much superior in texture, strength, durability and aging qualities over that when the triphenylguanidine is used.'\n\n The patentee makes a short reference to a formula by which he produces the rubber mix, in which he says:\n'The rubber may be compounded in the following proportions: 50 parts by weight of new rubber, 45.5 parts by weight of zinc oxide, 3.5 parts by weight of sulphur, 1 part by weight of diphenylguanidine. These are mixed together in any suitable way, such as by milling, and then vulcanized or cured in the usual molds or otherwise under heat corresponding to a steam pressure of about 40 lbs. per square inch. This vulcanizing temperature should be continued until the compound is suitably vulcanized, which requires from 10 to 20 minutes depending upon the shape and size of the articles being vulcanized.'\n\n The patent contains twelve claims. Those mainly relied on are: The fourth, for 'the process of treating rubber or similar materials which comprises combining with the rubber compound diphenylguanidine'; the eighth, for 'the process of treating rubber or similar materials, which comprises combining with the rubber compound a vulcanizing agent and diphenylguanidine'; and the twelfth, for 'a vulcanized compound of rubber or similar material combined with a vulcanizing agent and diphenylguanidine.'\n Vulcanizing is old and well known. Its present high state of development represents an evolution of about 80 \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 367]\n\u00a0\n years. Practically all rubber must be vulcanized for commercial use. The amount of sulphur in the mixture is comparatively small, as, for instance, 4 to 10 parts of sulphur to 100 parts of rubber. The remainder of the mixture may be all rubber or it may be partly rubber and partly other ingredients such as fillers and pigments, the other ingredient used most widely being zinc oxide. In the manufacture of automobile tires a considerable proportion of zinc oxide is generally used. A very old and well known proportion has been 50 parts of rubber, 45 parts of zinc oxide and 5 parts of sulphur and is the one shown in the specification of the patent. The mixture is 'cured' by subjecting it to heat to make the vulcanized rubber of commerce. Platen molds have to be provided for giving the desired form to the rubber vulcanized. Steam has to be supplied for heating the molds and the rubber mix, during the 'cure.' A 'cure' is the successful completion of the chemical union or vulcanization of the rubber with the sulphur. The fact of a successful 'cure' for practical purposes is established by a simple and short method called the thumb and tooth test. By this test, rubber chemists settle the fact and determine by the resulting product the satisfactory quality of the stock or the mix for vulcanization and they become expert at it. If by this test the product is not well united chemically, it is said to be 'under cured' or 'over cured,' and then the operator changes the ingredients or the time of the process. When it is important to determine with greater exactness the tensile strength and degree of elasticity or other qualities of the product, a special machine measure or test is used, but the thumb and tooth test is the frequent way of knowing a cure, and it is a satisfactory one for everyday use is business.\n It has been known that a 'cure' can be hastened by mixing with the ingredients a small quantity of what \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 368]\n\u00a0\n is called an accelerator or vitalizer. Inorganic substances like lime or litharge were originally employed as such, but it was subsequently found that certain organic substances were more powerful or more 'active' as the term is, and they came into more general use. The heat to which the rubber mixed with sulphur is subjected has a deleterious effect upon the substance of the raw rubber, and the longer the heating, the greater the injury. An accelerator, as it lessens the time of the cure, not only increases the output of the equipment used but reduces the danger of deterioration of the product. An accelerator thus improves the elasticity, tensile strength, and other desirable commercial qualities of the finished product. It is not fully understood what the vitalizing or catalytic action of the accelerator is, but its existence and its results have long been known.\n The patentee in his specifications speaks of triphenylguanidine, and compares its operation as an accelerator with that guanidine, the utility of which as an accelerator he claims to have discovered, called diphenylguanidine. Guanidines are a group of organic substances which have become prominent and important in this quest for useful accelerators. The monophenylguanidine and the diphenylguanidine and the triphenylguanidine are closely related chemically. Their long names, used to indicate the variation in the component elements, have been shortened so that it is usual to refer to diphenylguanidine by letters as 'D. P. G.' and the triphenylguanidine as 'T. P. G.'\n So closely do the chemical compositions of these two resemble each other that the petitioner contends that the patent is invalid because the utility of D. P. G. as an accelerator was plainly indicated by general chemical knowledge, and did not involve patentable discovery after T. P. G. had proven to be a good one for this purpose. But we cannot agree with this view. The catalytic ac- \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 369]\n\u00a0\n tion of an accelerator cannot be forecast by its chemical composition, for such action is not understood and is not known except by actual test.\n The respondent attempts to show that the resulting improvement in the rubber product by the use of diphenylguanidine was something different from that in the use of other accelerators. The good results of the use of diphenylguanidine are chiefly or wholly due to its greater activity and the lessened time of the cure. The expert evidence seems to show that T. P. G. as an accelerator develops the same desirable qualities, set forth on behalf of respondent, in the vulcanized rubber as does D. P. G., except that the cure of the latter is more rapid with its to be expected advantages. Moreover, claims of peculiar usefulness of D. P. G. in other than its 'activity' and speed as an accelerator, even if proven, could not in any degree affect the issue in this case. If employment of D. P. G. as a useful accelerator was a discovery by Weiss, prior to any one else, Weiss, or his assignee, is entitled to all the advantages that flow from that increased activity or from any other quality in its use as such. Roberts v. Ryer, \n91 U.S. 150\n, 157; Stow v. Chicago, \n104 U.S. 547\n, 550; Lovell Mfg. Co. v. Cary, \n147 \nU.S. 623, 634\n, 13 S. Ct. 472.\n It does not, on the other hand, give Weiss any more right to appropriate D. P. G. as an accelerator because he may have elaborated in his specifications other advantages from its use than if he had not mentioned them. Nor, on the other hand, does it minimize or affect the priority of completed discovery by some one else before Weiss that the prior discoverer may not have perceived and stated all the advantages of an earlier use of D. P. G. as an accelerator.\n Judge Hough, of the Second Circuit, truly said, therefore, that this patent meant, condensed in one sentence:\n'I claim the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator, because I \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 370]\n\u00a0\n was the first person who observed its efficacy for that purpose.'\n\n Similarly, the examiner in the Patent Office who allowed the patent said that Weiss' application was 'no more than a broad disclosure of the use of (D. P. G.) without disclosing any details other than those usually employed with accelerators of this class.'\n The patent in suit was applied for November 12, 1921, and was granted March 28, 1922. Weiss had referred in the specifications of this patent to another patent of his which was applied for July 2, 1921, and granted July 11, 1922. This latter patent was for a process for making D. P. G. in large or commercial quantities. In the application for that patent, the patentee pointed out that before his process was discovered D. P. G. could not be made except in small quantities for chemical research because the cost was prohibitive. The validity of the Weiss patent for a process in making diphenylguanidine is not attacked. The new patented process by reason of the lessened cost has resulted in the very great use of D. P. G. for commercial purposes, and has been very profitable. But the purpose of securing the patent in suit and maintaining its validity is more ambitious. It is not to protect and preserve the new process already being safely enjoyed, but it is to prevent the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator, however made by any process that may be subsequently discovered. It is to enlarge a monopoly of D. P. G. as an accelerator, and is thus in effect to discourage effort to find other and cheaper means of making it. What we have to decide here is not the priority of discovery of the cheap process of making the accelerator D. P. G., which it is conceded Weiss invented, but whether he was the first person to discover the efficacy of D. P. G. as an accelerator whether made by any process, cheap or costly. \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 371]\n\u00a0\n We feel it necessary to call attention to a lack of relevancy of Weiss' successful process patent in the case before us, because the majority opinion in the Circuit Court of Appeals seems to us erroneously to have confused the credit due to Weiss for the process patent, already conceded, with his right to his present claim of entire monopoly of the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator.\n The issues and the evidence in this case cannot be considered and discussed without reference to a paper read by Dr. George Kratz, a rubber chemist, at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Chemical Society between the 2d and the 6th of September, 1919. It was entitled 'The Action of Certain organic Accelerators in the Vulcanization of Rubber,' and was a review of the comparative excellence of a number of well-known and used accelerators, as well as that of D. P. G. with T. P. G., in which he found D. P. G. to be very much more active than T. P. G. Then under an experimental part he described the kinds of rubber used, the proportions of rubber and sulphur in the mixture, and the manner in which the accelerator was incorporated and the method of vulcanization. He said:\n'The rubber used was good quality, first latex, pale crepe, and the same lot was employed in all mixtures. All mixtures were made under standard conditions; the average time of each batch on the mill was 17.5 min. The same proportion of rubber and sulphur-92.5 parts rubber, and 7:5 parts sulphur-was employed in each instance, but the amount of accelerator was varied, according to the conditions of the experiment.\n\n'All the accelerators soluble in alcohol were dissolved in the smallest quantity of this liquid and introduced into the rubber in solution. Those not soluble-and this applied to the anhydroformaldehyde bodies only-were \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 372]\n\u00a0\n ground to 100 mesh and added to the rubber with the sulphur. After mixing, the mixtures were allowed a recovery period of 24 hrs. before they were vulcanized. Vulcanization was carried on in a platen press of the usual type.'\n\n Table 1.-Relative Activities-Thiourea Series. Parts Required to Equal One Part Aniline.\n Aniline 1.000 Urea 0.250 Thiourea 0.300 Monophenylthiourea 0.450 Diphenylthiourea 0.850 Monophenylguanidine (a) 0.075 Diphenylguanidine (Sym.) 0.075 Triphenylguanidine 0.500\n\n The activities of the various substances were compared in the mixture previously mentioned-92.5 parts of rubber and 7.5 parts of sulphur-taking as a standard the effect obtained with one part of aniline, vulcanized for 90 min. at 148 C. The amounts of various substances in the urea series required to effect the same degree of vulcanization as obtained with one part of aniline are shown in Table 1.\n The paper thus shows that the activity and superiority of D. P. G. as an accelerator over T. P. G. is approximately as 7 is to 1.\n In the answer to the bill in this case, the Kratz paper was set up as a defense, but, although read before September 6, 1919, it was not published until April, 1920\n\n\n Under section 4886, Revised Statutes (35 USCA  31; Comp. St.  9430), a person who claims to have invented any patentable improvement is not to be denied a patent because of any printed publication subsequent to his discovery, unless there was publication or public use or sale more than two years prior to his application. Kratz's article was not printed until less \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 373]\n\u00a0\n than two years before Weiss' application for a patent in November, 1921, and therefore the paper could not be used as a basis for defense against his patent if his discovery was earlier than the publication. It nevertheless plays a very important part in understanding the facts in this case.\n The main and only issue here is divided, by reason of the evidence and the lines of argument pursued, into two parts. The first is the effect of that part of it devoted to Weiss' discovery and his reduction to practice. The second is that part devoted to Kratz's discovery and his reduction to practice.\n First. It is contended by the petitioner that the file wrapper and evidence show that the patent was secured by false evidence and is not entitled to the presumption of validity which ordinarily accompanies the grant. The examiner in the Patent Office three times rejected the Weiss application, the third time by a reference to the Kratz paper. The hearing on that reference was ex parte. The third rejection was followed by acquiescence by the examiner because of two affidavits, one by Weiss and one by his fellow chemist, Daniels, who claimed to have been with him at the time in the laboratory of the Republic Rubber Company of Youngstown. In these final affidavits, Weiss had said that D. P. G. was produced and actually used 'in the vulcanization of rubber goods' during the early part of the year 1919, and Daniels said:\n'These tests were also carried out in the compounding laboratory for the various departments of the Republic Rubber Company at Youngstown, Ohio, and the accelerator proved to be highly efficient in the actual vulcanization of rubber goods, such as hose, tires, belts, valves and other mechanical goods.'\n\n It now appears, without contradiction, that the only rubber Weiss made during the early part of the year 1919 from D. P. G. was test slabs of rubber in which D. P. G. was the accelerator, and \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 374]\n\u00a0\n that in fact neither he nor anybody in the rubber company had vulcanized rubber goods, as Daniels described them, before the Kratz publication. But we do not think this would invalidate the patent for the reason that the actual fact was that these test slabs of rubber with D. P. G. if proven to be properly vulcanized, as the evidence seems to show, were a demonstration of the utility of D. P. G. as an accelerator and were a completed and demonstrated discovery constituting reduction to practice. Production of rubber goods for use or sale was not indispensable to the granting of the patent. Hence the affidavits, though perhaps reckless, were not the basis for it or essentially material to its issue. The reasonable presumption of validity furnished by the grant of the patent, therefore, would not seem to be destroyed.\n Then it is claimed that the reference to the Kratz paper which was not attacked by the applicant for its insufficiency as a reference under section 4886 of the Revised Statutes should be treated as equivalent to a prior patent, the priority of which could only be overcome by evidence eliminating all reasonable doubt. The Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275\n, 12 S. Ct. 443, 450; Deering v. Winona Harvester Works, \n155 \nU.S. 286, 300\n, 15 S. Ct. 118; Clark Thread Company v. Willimantic Linen Company, \n140 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 11 S. Ct. 846. But the Kratz paper was not a prior patent, and, while it may be that other circumstances such as a reference to a publication made before the application for the patent may have the effect to require the same convincing proof of earlier discovery to avoid its effect (Westinghouse, etc. Co. v. Catskill, etc., Co. (C. C. A.) 121 F. 831, 834; New England Motor Co. v. Sturtevant Co. (C. C. A.) 150 F. 131, 137; Wendell v. American Laundry Machinery Co. (C. C. A.) 248 F. 698, 700), we do not think that the mere failure to invite the attention of the examiner to the defect of the reference under section 4886, Revised Statutes, calls for the strict rule of proof \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 375]\n\u00a0\n to avoid the reference. This conclusion keeps the burden of proof on the defendant in attacking the patent on the ground of a prior use.\n It is also claimed that, because the trial court in this cause found, after hearing the witnesses the weight to be with the petitioner and against Weiss, assignor of respondent, his conclusions of fact, except for manifest error, are to be treated as unassailable. Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S. Ct. 169; Davis v. Schwartz, \n155 \nU.S. 631\n, 15 S. Ct. 237; Kimberly v. Arms, \n129 \nU.S. 512\n, 9 S. Ct. 355; Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 149\n, 8 S. Ct. 894; and Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 556\n, 43 S. Ct. 200. We do not think that this rule applies in the case before us at least to its full extent, first, for the reason that the Circuit Court of Appeals, having considered all the evidence upon which the trial judge reached his conclusion, declined to approve of his findings, and, second, because in the National Aniline & Chemical Co. Case, which is in conflict with the case here, the trial judge reached a different conclusion on the same issue and the same evidence which we have here. Thomson Spot Welder Co. v. Ford Motor Co., \n265 \nU.S. 445, 447\n, 44 S. Ct. 533. We think, therefore, that the respondent is entitled under these conditions to retain a presumption of validity for his patent in the consideration of the case before us. This brings us then to the evidence which Weiss adduces in support of his first discovery of D. P. G. as an accelerator.\n Morris L. Weiss received a degree in chemistry from the Cooper Union of New York City late in 1917, and attended a course of chemical study in the Polytechnic of Brooklyn. He entered the employ of the Republic Rubber Company of Youngstown, Ohio, in October, 1917. That company manufactured rubber articles largely from shoddy or reclaimed rubber. It was seeking to find an improved accelerator in T. P. G., and was building a plant \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 376]\n\u00a0\n for its commercial use. Weiss, in addition to his usual work in T. P. G., became interested in 1918 and 1919 in the possibilities of the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator which he had inquired into because it was mentioned with T. P. G. among the guanidines in a textbook of chemistry which he had read. He was required by the rules of the company to enter his experiments in a book called the 'X Book,' kept for the purpose. During the term of his employment, prior to September 6, 1919 (the date of Kratz's reading his paper), this X Book showed three dated and recorded experiments with D. P. G. as an accelerator. Two of these were with a shoddy mixture, and there is doubt whether they showed the marked superiority of D. P. G. over T. P. G., as Weiss in another case seems to have admitted. But there was another test with pure rubber recorded in the X Book of successful vulcanization by D. P. G., the date of which is in dispute. It was as follows:\n\n Number X 2034 Made for accelerator tests-\n E 50 D. P. G. 1 Sulphur 4 Zinc 43 M. G. O. 2 ___\n 100 Cure 20\/30 Stretch 14 1\/2 Strength 3000 Set 1\/2 Date 2.10.19\n As it appears now, the date is February 10, 1919. Weiss does not deny that first figure of the date has been changed, but says that it was probably changed because it \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 377]\n\u00a0\n was made originally by mistake as a '1,' as on January 10, 1919, when it ought to have been as a '2,' as in February, and the change was only to make it one month later. It is contended on the other side, and it was testified by an expert on handwriting, and the District Judge so held, that the change was made from 9-10-19 to 2-10-19, which would carry the original and correct date of this test to the later date of September 10, 1919, or three or four days later than the reading of the paper by Dr. Kratz to the American Chemical Society, and after Weiss had been informed by his colleague Daniels of Kratz's blackboard statement of the results of his discoveries. Weiss says he made other tests between the first successful one and the reading of the Kratz paper, but they are not recorded under specific dates, nor are they in regular order. There is a record of many tests after the Kratz paper, but none others are shown to be before it except by Weiss' and Daniels' unassisted memory.\n Then it is said he did not claim discovery until his application for this patent in November, 1921, while in an application for employment as a chemist at another rubber company in March, 1920, he did claim credit for the new process in commercially making D. P. G., but he attributed its importance to the revelation of the Kratz paper. His explanation is that he then supposed that accelerators were not patentable and he was absorbed in cheapening the production of D. P. G.\n Other circumstances are detailed at length in the brief of counsel to show that Weiss' real knowledge of the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator was prompted by Kratz's paper and could not be independent discovery on his part before his hearing of and reading it. But after full consideration of all the doubt-giving circumstances we do not think that the attack on Weiss' proof of February 10, 1919, as the date when he first discovered by a completed \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 378]\n\u00a0\n experiment the successful use of D. P. G. as an accelerator in making rubber, has overcome the evidence given to support it and the presumption of its correctness from the patent itself.\n Second. Kratz's discovery-Dr. Kratz had been engaged in the chemistry of rubber and in its manufacture for more than seven years. He read his paper on D. P. G. and other accelerators in September, 1919. He had been employed as a chemist with the Diamond and Goodrich Companies, and, subsequently, with the Norwalk Tire & Rubber Company of Connecticut, for several years, and after April, 1917, with the Falls Rubber Company, of Cuyahoga Falls, near Akron, Ohio. He had directed his efforts to the subject of vulcanization almost exclusively, and was intimately familiar with the commercial practice therein. His first work with accelerators was as research chemist in 1913. On April 1, 1914, he went with the Norwalk Company in the capacity of chemist, and in April, 1917, he became chief chemist of the Falls Rubber Company.\n In 1916, while with the Norwalk Company, Kratz prepared D. P. G. and demonstrated its utility as a rubber accelerator by making test slabs of vulcanized or cured rubber with its use. Every time that he produced such a slab he recorded his test in cards which he left with the Norwalk Company and kept a duplicate of his own. By these tests he arrived at figures representing the degree of superiority of D. P. G. over T. P. G. and other known accelerators, so that he could determine exactly how much D. P. G. it would be necessary to use to produce the same accelerating effect as would be produced by a larger amount of T. P. G. or of other accelerators in the same time. This work was known to, and was participated in, by his associate in the Norwalk Company, his immediate superior and the chief chemist of the company, Dr. Rus \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 379]\n\u00a0\n sell, who fully confirms Kratz's records and statement. This work was finally recorded in a carefully prepared contemporaneous report which Kratz left in the files of the Norwalk Company, and which is now produced by Dr. Russell in evidence before us. When Kratz left the Norwalk Company to go to the Falls Rubber Company, he took with him this record for his use in his future work, so that there are two records of the same thing. The report in 1916 was as follows:\n'XI\/1\/16.\nG. D. K.\n'Relative Catalytic Effect of Compounds Related to Sulpho Carbaninide.\n\n'The following formula was used to try out the activity of various substances more or less closely related to sulpho-carbaninide:\n\n\"The following formula was used to try out the activity of various substances more or less closely related to sulpho-carbaninide: White para 100 Zinc oxide 100 Sulphur 5\n\n'The following effects were recorded and, in cases where an acceleration was produced, the amounts required to give a cure in one hour equal to the cure produced by 3% of S-Carb, were as follows (in the first column):\n\n (As shown in Chemical Society Paper, Sept., 1919 Aniline 3.50 % 3.5 Di pheny thio urea 3.0 % 2.975 Mono phenyl thio urea 1.5 % 1.575 Thio urea 1.0 % 1.050 Tri phenyl guanidine 1.75 % 1.750 Di phenyl guanidine 0.25 % 0.262 Urea .033 %\" 0.875)\n These results were confirmed by Kratz at the Falls Rubber Company in 1918 and 1919, and were reported \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 380]\n\u00a0\n in his paper at the chemical meeting in September of 1919 as shown in the second column above, multiplied by 3.5 in order to put them on the same basis.\n These values were determined by Kratz in some eight or nine tests in 1916 with each of the substances named, for which test slabs were made in each instance, and the series was extended until the desired result was obtained. The first substance is aniline and the second is thio ( diphenylthiourea). These substances were generally known and widely used as accelerators, and therefore were used as standards of comparison. They show that Kratz's tests taught him in 1916 that D. P. G. was seven times as strong and as active as T. P. G. The report to the Norwalk Company also shows two different formulas by which Kratz made his own D. P. G. in 1916.\n In the fall of 1917, when Kratz was chief chemist of the Falls Company, he received a special order for 1,000 inner tubes for automobile tires. In filling 300 tubes, of this order of 1,000 tubes which were made under Kratz's personal supervision-for he had then become chief chemist of the Falls Company-he used D. P. G. as an accelerator.\n A little later in 1918 and 1919 Kratz conducted at the Falls plant a series of tests with D. P. G. closely paralleling the series of tests which he had made in 1916 at the Norwalk plant and confirming those already reported as above. At Norwalk he had used mostly zinc oxide as part of the rubber mix, and he desired to verify the results obtained in tests of the same accelerators in other compounds of rubber with other than zinc oxide. All this was part of the preparation of his paper on accelerators to be read before the 1919 meeting of the American Chemical Society. The year before he had attended The 1918 meeting of the Society expecting to hear the subject discussed, but nothing was said, and so he and his assist \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 381]\n\u00a0\n ant, Flower, gathered their material for a paper at the next meeting. That paper as read covered much more than the mere demonstration of the utility of D. P. G. as an accelerator. It dealt with a number of other accelerators also. The authenticity and reliability of Dr. Kratz's testimony about them is not questioned in this record. It is not too much to say that the report of Dr. Kratz's results made a great impression upon the rubber chemists of the country.\n The only lack of corroboration of Kratz and the only challenge to his testimony of fact in this case is in reference to his account of sending to a customer the 300 inner tubes for automobile tires accelerated by D. P. G. He says that they were sent to the purchaser whose name he gives and that they proved to be satisfactory, as he knew by having tagged them and having received approval of the whole lot by the purchaser. He says that this was a special order; that he had at the time a small supply of D. P. G. which he himself had made; that these 300 tubes exhausted his supply; and that in filling the remainder another accelerator was used. This sale and the use of D. P. G. as an accelerator took place in August, 1917, as shown by the memoranda that Kratz produces. The record of the shipment of the 1,000 tubes, the memorandum shipping order by Kratz and the O. K. by the president of the Falls Company are introduced.\n Kratz says he did not tell any one of his use of D. P. G. in these 300 tubes. This is urged by respondent as a reason for discrediting it. Were this an isolated instance not taken out of the history of all of Kratz's relation to accelerators and to D. P. G., it might reasonably give rise to such question. But the undoubted fact that Kratz had demonstrated the utility of D. P. G. in his eight or nine tests in 1916 at Norwalk and the corroporation of Dr. Russell as to his work there, and the memorandum which \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 382]\n\u00a0\n he had taken with him of the tests and of the report to the Falls Rubber Company, and, indeed, the reflexive corroboration of his paper at Philadelphia, show undoubtedly that he knew the excellence of D. P. G. as an accelerator, and tend to confirm his account as to the 300 tube sale. It was not unnatural that with a small amount of D. P. G. he should try it in a special order of this kind from which he might confirm the conclusion he had already reached. The effort to disprove it was vague and inconclusive, which, it is only fair to say, was to be expected five years after the event.\n Kratz was not seeking a patent. He inferred, with reason, that D. P. G. would not make a successful business accelerator because of its then cost. He is wholly disinterested pecuniarily in the result of this case. The fact that he is the only witness is not fatal or any reason for denying its weight in connection with other circumstances. Reed v. Cutter, 1 Story, 590, Fed. Cas. No. 11,645, 20 Fed. Cas. 435; Coffin v. Ogden, 18 Wall. 120; Egbert v. Lippmann, \n104 U.S. 333\n.\n But, even if we ignore this evidence of Kratz's actual use of D. P. G. in these rubber inner tubes which were sold, what he did at Norwalk, supported by the evidence of Dr. Russell, his chief, and by the indubitable records that are not challenged, leaves no doubt in our minds that he did discover in 1916 the strength of D. P. G. as an accelerator as compared with the then known accelerators, and that he then demonstrated it by a reduction of it to practice in production of cured or vulcanized rubber.\n This constitutes priority in this case. It was not followed by commercial use thereafter, because of the then cost of D. P. G. But this patent is for the mere discovery and application in the making of rubber of a particular accelerator. It was the fact that it would work with great activity as an accelerator that was the discovery, and \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 383]\n\u00a0\n that was all, and the necessary reduction to use is shown by instances making clear that it did so work, and was a completed discovery. Bedford v. Hunt, 1 Mason, 302, Fed. Cas. No. 1217, 3 Fed. Cas. 37; Reed v. Cutter, supra; Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477; Coffin v. Ogden, supra.\n It is said that these tests of Kratz were mere abandoned laboratory experiments. There was no abandonment in the sense that Kratz had given up what he was seeking for in demonstrating a new and effective accelerator in D. P. G. If he had been applying for a patent for the discovery he clearly could have maintained proof of a reduction to practice. A process is reduced to practice when it is successfully performed. A machine is reduced to practice when it is assembled, adjusted and used. A manufacture is reduced to practice when it is completely manufactured. A composition of matter is reduced to practice when it is completely composed. Walker on Patents,  141a; Hunter v. Stikeman, 13 App. D. C. 214, 226; Mason v. Hepburn, 13 App. D. C. 86, 92; Lindemeyer v. Hoffman, 18 App. D. C. 1, 5; Roe v. Hanson, 19 App. D. C. 559, 564.\n Nor were the tests of Kratz abandoned laboratory experiments. If so, then the cure by Weiss tested in February, 1919, was or the same character and was not of itself a reduction to use. Weiss showed his production of vulcanized rubber with D. P. G. in February, 1919, only by a so-called laboratory experiment. He demonstrated the value of D. P. G. as an accelerator by exactly the same kind of experiment as that which Kratz had used two years before. Weiss founded his claim on the cured slab of rubber which had been vulcanized with D. P. G., and this Kratz had done two years earlier with slabs of the same kind and composition deposited in the same way in a platen mold. \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 384]\n\u00a0\n Kratz's method of testing his rubber slabs is criticized. As already said, it is the method known as the thumb and tooth test. This is not so exact a method in determining all the qualities that a test machine would show in the product, but it is, as already said, one very generally used for practical purposes in factories in determining that the vulcanization or cure is complete. It was the one by the use of which Kratz disclosed and demonstrated to the rubber chemists of the country who listened to him in September, 1919. that D. P. G. was an accelerator and how powerful it was as compared with others, and thereby revolutionized knowledge in the art as the evidence abundantly shows and as Weiss himself asserted in his application for employment in 1920. It is true that in the test by Weiss of February 10, 1919, the details of tensile strength and time of cure and elasticity were disclosed by machine test with more particularity, but the speed of the cure and the 'activity' of D. P. G. and the fact of the cure were clearly shown by the simpler test.\n It is a mistake to assume that reduction to use must necessarily be a commercial use. If Kratz discovered, and completed, as we are convinced that he did, the first use of D. P. G. as an accelerator in making vulcanized. rubber, he does not lose his right to use this discovery when he chooses to do so for scientific purposes or purposes of publication or because he does not subsequently sell the rubber thus vulcanized or use his discovery in trade or does not apply for a patent for it. It is not an abandoned experiment because he confines his use of the rubber thus produced to his laboratory or to his lecture room. It is doubtless true that Kratz by his course in respect to his discovery as to the use of D. P. G. has abandoned any claim as against the public for a patent, but that is a very different thing from saying that it \n\n[276 U.S. 358, 385]\n\u00a0\n was abandoned as against a subsequent discoverer or patentee.\n The conclusion we reach then is that, so far as this record shows, the first discovery that D. P. G. was a useful accelerator of the vulcanization of rubber was made by George Kratz and not by Weiss.\n We come then to the question of the validity of claims 1, 5 and 9 of the patent, which seek to appropriate to the patentee the process of treating rubber by combining with the rubber compound 'a disubstituted guanidine.' Now the class of disubstituted guanidines includes not only D. P. G. but all other derivatives of guanidine in which two of the hydrogen atoms of guanidine uncleus have been substituted by other groups. The fact that disubstituted guanidines have been use as accelerators appeared in an article published by one Du Bosc, July 15, 1919, a fact which would defeat the claims applied for November 24, 1921. Moreover, the experts show that there are between 50 and 100 substances which answer this description, of which there is quite a number that are not accelerators at all. Weiss could certainly not claim the entire group of such compounds. He makes no showing that there is any general quality common to disubstituted guanidines which made them all effective as accelerators. Claims for their exclusive use cannot therefore be sustained. This is shown by the decision of this court in this Incandescent Lamp Patent, \n159 \nU.S. 465\n, 16 S. Ct. 75, where the court said, at page 475 (16 S. Ct. 79):\n'If, as before observed, there were some general quality, running through the whole fibrous and textile kingdom, which distinguished it from every other, and gave it a peculiar fitness for the particular purpose, the man who discovered such quality might justly be entitled to a patent; but that is not the case here.'\n\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDANCIGER v. SMITH(1928)\nNo. 224\nArgued: February 27, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 542, 543]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. I. J. Ringolsky and W. G.

Harrell, both of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by Smith in the district court for Dallas County, Texas, to recover brokerage commissions claimed to be due him from Danciger and the Emerich Oil Co. He assigned part of this claim to his attorneys; and later assigned the remainder to two of his creditors as security for antecedent debts, agreeing to prosecute the suit in his name and account to them for the proceeds. \n\n[276 U.S. 542, 545]\n\u00a0\n More than four months thereafter he filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. He did not mention this claim in the schedules, and stated that he had no assets and that none of his property had been assigned for the benefit of creditors. He was thereupon adjudicated a bankrupt. No trustee was appointed for his estate; and he was granted a discharge.\n At the trial of the suit the defendants, in addition to their defenses on the merits, relied upon the defense, appropriately pleaded, that by reason of the proceeding in bankruptcy Smith had ceased to be the owner of the cause of action and was not entitled to prosecute the suit. This contention was overruled, and Smith recovered judgment. This was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, 286 S. W. 633; and an application to the Supreme Court for a writ of error was denied, 116 Tex. 269, 289 S. W. 679.\n The petitioners contend that by permitting Smith to continue the prosecution of the suit after his adjudication in bankruptcy they were deprived of a right, privilege and immunity under the Bankruptcy Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The act provides, with certain exceptions not here material, that a trustee of the estate of a bankrupt, upon his appointment and qualification, shall be vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt, as of the date he was adjudged a bankrupt, to all nonexempt property, including rights of action (section 70 (11 USCA  110)); and that the trustee may, with the approval of the court, be permitted to prosecute any suit commenced by the bankrupt prior to the adjudication ( section 11c (11 USCA  29)).\n It is clear that under these provisions an adjudication in bankruptcy, until followed by the appointment of a trustee, does not divest the bankrupt's title to a cause of action against a third person or prevent him from instituting or maintaining suit thereon. Thus, he may insti- \n\n[276 U.S. 542, 546]\n\u00a0\n tute and maintain such a suit before the election of a trustee. Johnson v. Collier, \n222 \nU.S. 538, 539\n, 32 S. Ct. 104; Christopherson v.

Rosskam, 107 Ill. App. 427, 436. In Johnson v. Collier, supra, this Court said:\n'While for many purposes the filing of the petition operates in the nature of an attachment upon choses in action and other property of the bankrupt, yet his title is not thereby divested. He is still the owner, though holding in trust until the appointment and qualification of the trustee, who thereupon becomes 'vested by operation of law with the title of the Bankrupt' as of the date of adjudication. ... Until such election the bankrupt has title- defeasible, but sufficient to authorize the institution and maintenance of a suit on any cause of action otherwise possessed by him. ... During that period it may frequently be important that action should be ... taken to recover what would be lost if it were necessary to wait until the trustee was elected. The institution of such suit will result in no harm to the estate. For if the trustee prefers to begin a new action in the same or another court in his own name, the one previously brought can be abated. If, however, he is of opinion that it would be to the benefit of the creditors, he may intervene in the suit commenced by the bankrupt. ... If the trustee will not sue and the bankrupt cannot sue, it might result in the bankrupt's debtor being discharged of an actual liability. The statute indicates no such purpose, and if money or property is finally recovered, it will be for the benefit of the estate. Nor is there any merit in the \n\n[276 U.S. 542, 547]\n\u00a0\n suggestion that this might involve a liability to pay both the bankrupt and the trustee.'\n\n It follows that Smith's title to the right of action was not divested by the proceeding in bankruptcy, no trustee having been appointed to whom it could pass; and that the Bankruptcy Act did not prevent him from subsequently prosecuting the suit to judgment.\n The doctrine of First National Bank v. Lasater, \n196 \nU.S. 115, 119\n, 25 S. Ct. 206, on which the petitioners rely-that a bankrupt who omits to schedule and withholds holds all knowledge of a valuable claim, cannot, after obtaining a discharge from his debts, assert title to such claim and maintain a suit thereon in his own right-has no application here; for in that case a trustee had been appointed to whom the right of action had passed.\n No other federal question is presented by the record. If, as urged by the petitioners, the assignments made by Smith were void as against his other creditors-who were not before the court-any question that may arise as to whether he holds the judgment for the benefit of his assignees or of his general creditors, may be determined in appropriate proceedings taken for that purpose. See Griffin v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., supra, 665 (46 S. E. 870). In any event the petitioners were not prejudiced.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 30 Stat. 544, c. 541; U.

The judgment afterwards was set aside on the evidence of two important witnesses, husband and wife, that they had committed perjury at the trial. A new trial was had which resulted in a judgment for the defendant, the present petitioner. The judgment was entered on June 21, 1923. It was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error and on March 21, 1924, a mandate from that court affirmed the judgment with costs. See Ginsberg v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 296 F. 439. The witnesses who had testified for the plaintiff at the first trial testified for the defendant at the second, and after the term of the District Court in which the foregoing steps had been taken had expired without being extended in any form, the husband made an affidavit showing that his testimony at both trials was false and that in fact he knew nothing about the matter. The trial Judge was applied to, and after hearing testimony in open court he made an order on May 9, 1925, purporting to set aside the judgment that had been affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals during a previous unextended term. The petitioners thereupon applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus to reinstate the judgment, but the Circuit Court of Appeals held that it had no jurisdiction to grant the writ. 15 F.( 2d) 137. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n273 \nU.S. 685\n, 47 S. Ct. 247.\n However strong may have been the convictions of the District Judge that injustice would be done by enforcing the judgment, he could not set it aside on the ground that the testimony of admitted perjurers was perjured also at \n\n[276 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n the second trial. The power of the Court to set aside its judgment on this ground ended with the term. In re Metropolitan Trust Co., \n218 \nU.S. 312, 320\n, 31 S. Ct. 18. As the Court was without jurisdiction to vacate the judgment mandamus is the appropriate remedy unless to grant that writ is beyond the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals. In re Metropolitan Trust Co., \n218 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 31 S. Ct. 18. We perceive no reason to doubt the power of that Court. It had affirmed the judgment of the Court below. Brown v. Alton Water Co., \n222 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 32 S. Ct. 156. Like other appellate courts (In re Potts, \n166 \nU.S. 263\n, 17 S. Ct. 520), the Circuit Court of Appeals has power to require its judgment to be enforced as against any obstruction that the lower Court, exceeding its jurisdiction, may interpose (McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268\n, 30 S. Ct. 501). The issue of a mandamus is closely enough connected with the appellate power.\n But it is said that the granting of the writ of mandamus is discretionary and it is implied that if we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals was mistaken in denying its power to grant the writ, that court still might deny it on the ground that injustice would be done if the judgment were allowed to stand. But neither Court would be warranted in declaring the judgment unjust after it had become unassailable- certainly not on a speculation as to which of three statements is true, when it was known at the trial that the witness was perjured, either at the first trial, as he said, or then-not to speak of the further difficulties that the plaintiff might encounter in the recent decision of Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Goodman, \n275 \nU.S. 66\n, 48 S. Ct. 24, October 31, 1927. It certainly would be unjust to leave the case in the air, because the District Court had made an unwarranted attempt to set aside a judgment that it had no jurisdiction to touch.\n It follows that the writ should issue.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELAWARE, L. & W. R. CO. v. TOWN OF MORRISTOWN(1928)\nNo. 147\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 182, 183]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis and J. L. Seager, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Conover English and Robert H. McCarter, both of Newark, N. J., for respondents.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 30, 1924, petitioner brought this suit in the District Court for New Jersey against the town of Morristown and 16 operators of taxicabs to restrain the town from enforcing an ordinance establishing a public hack stand in a driveway on petitioner's station grounds, to prevent the use of its land for parking of taxicabs and other vehicles, and to restrain the individual defendants from going on its premises to solicit patronage and from using its ground as a hack stand.\n The Morris & Essex Railroad Company owns the railroad, and petitioner operates it as lessee in perpetuity. September 24, 1912, an agreement was made between the town and the companies providing for the elevation of the tracks, in order to eliminate certain grade crossings. The agreement was fully performed. The tracks run north and south through station grounds, of somewhat irregular shape, containing about four acres. The main station building is on the west side of the tracks, and on the east side there is a platform roofed over, called the shelter house. The town agreed to lay out and construct a new street extending to the station grounds on the east side of the tracks. The companies agreed to 'dedicate any lands owned by them necessary for the laying out of such new street.' Petitioner constructed and maintains driveways within its grounds, one of which passes under the track along the north boundary, and thence south parallel to the tracks and near the east side of the shelter \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n house, to the south boundary of the grounds, where it connects with the new street. It was agreed that:\n'Said driveway shall be kept open at all times for passengers, pedestrians ... and ... vehicular traffic to and from the station grounds on the easterly side of said railroad and for the use of those now having rights of egress to Morris street in Saw Mill lane, but this contract shall not be construed as a dedication of said driveway as a public highway.'\n\n It was further agreed:\n'That the town may and shall exercise all necessary police powers in and upon the station, station grounds, approaches and driveways, for the purpose of regulating foot and vehicular traffic at said station, and for the enforcement of the rules and regulations of the railroad companies in respect thereto.'\n\n Passengers arriving on trains from New York get off on the east side and leave the station grounds by the driveway described. Prior to 1922, operators of taxicabs were accustomed to drive into the grounds to meet these trains and there solicit patronage. It is a matter of common knowledge that such competition for the transportation of passengers and their baggage from railway stations is liable, if not indeed certain, to be attended by crowding together of cabmen, confusion, noisy solicitations, importunities and contentions resulting to the annoyance and disadvantage of those sought to be served. \n1\n And the record shows that these or similar abuses prevailed or were liable to occur at the Morristown station. December \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n 28, 1922, petitioner made an agreement with one Welsh in which it was stated that petitioner desired to establish adequate cab service for the accommodation of its passengers and to regulate the solicitation of business in its station and upon its station grounds and the parking of vehicles there. It granted to him the privilege, under the control of petitioner's manager, to solicit business as a cabman in the station and on its grounds, to have a stand and telephone facilities in the station and to park his vehicles upon a specified space in the driveway east of the shelter house. Welsh agreed to have a sufficient number of vehicles, to maintain them at the highest standard of efficiency and to give satisfactory service at specified rates which should 'in no wise exceed the rates now or hereafter prescribed 'by municipal ordinance.' Then, on February 7, 1923, the municipal authorities, conceiving that this agreement created a monopoly and was unjust to other taxicabmen, adopted an ordinance prohibiting the standing of automobiles upon the space set aside for Welsh for 'a longer time than is necessary to take on and let off passengers, expressage or baggage,' and prohibiting such standing of vehicles on any other part of the driveway. In a suit brought by Welsh against the town the state Supreme Court held this ordinance to be a valid regulation of traffic under general power of the town and under the track elevation agreement. 98 N. J. Law, 630, 121 A. 697, affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals sub nomine Welsh v. Potts, 99 N. J. Law, 528, 124 A. 926. Upon the termination of that litigation, the town, October 22, 1924, passed the ordinance here in question. It declared a space including that set aside by the petitioner for the use of Welsh's vehicles to be 'an additional public hack stand' and prohibits the parking of vehicles in other parts of the driveway. Immediately upon the passage of this ordinance, the individual defendants entered the station grounds, parked their vehicles upon the space so designated and solicited patronage. \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner brought this suit claiming that the enforcement of the ordinance would take its property for municipal purposes without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. In defense fense the respondents maintain that the establishment of the public hack stand does not amount to a taking of petitioner's property, but is a mere traffic regulation that the town is authorized to make under the track elevation agreement and also by the exertion of its police power.\n After trial, the District Court entered its final decree declaring the ordinance repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and restraining the town from taking the company's land for a public hack stand, and preventing it from interfering with the company's use of its premises or control of vehicles thereon, and commanding the individual defendants to refrain from parking vehicles or soliciting patronage on the station grounds. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and directed the District Court to dismiss the case. 14 F.(2d) 257. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 686\n, 47 S. Ct. 335.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the track elevation agreement authorized the town to establish a public hack stand on the driveway in the station grounds. The principal purpose of that agreement was to eliminate grade crossings; regulation of traffic to from the station was incidental. The town has not acquired by purchase or eminent domain any part of petitioner's land or the right to establish a public hack stand there. It is not claimed that the agreement expressly authorized the town to make such an appropriation of petitioner's land. And there is nothing from which such a grant may be implied. The intention of the parties is plainly expressed. There is an express dedication by the companies of their lands within the new street opened by the town outside the station grounds. But, there being no such purpose in respect of land within the grounds, the agreement declares \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n 'this contract shall not be construed as a dedication of said driveway as a public highway.' There is no room for construction. And, even in the absence of that clause, the facts disclosed by the record are not sufficient to raise a presumption of dedication. Wood v. Hurd. 34 N. J. Law, 87.\n While petitioner owed its passengers the duty of providing a suitable way for them to reach and leave its station, it was not bound to allow cabmen or others to enter upon or use any part of its buildings or grounds to wait for fares or to solicit patronage. Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., \n199 \nU.S. 279, 295\n, 26 S. Ct. 91; Thompson's Express Co. v. Mount, 91 N. J. Eq. 497, 111 A. 173, 15 A. L. R. 351. Its agreement to keep the driveway 'open for traffic to and from the station' did not add to its obligations or enlarge the powers of the town. Respondents put much reliance upon the clause providing that the town 'may and shall exercise all necessary police powers' in and upon the station grounds 'for the purpose of regulating traffic' at the station and for the enforcement of petitioner's rules and regulations in respect thereto. But it is to be borne in mind that the taking of private property for public use is deemed to be against the common right and authority so to do must be clearly expressed. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Penn. R. R., \n195 \nU.S. 540, 569\n, 25 S. Ct. 133; Lewis on Eminent Domain (3d Ed.)  371; Inhabitants of Springfield v. Connecticut River Railroad Co., 4 Cush. ( Mass.) 63, 69-72; Holyoke Co. v. Lyman, 15 Wall. 500, 507. Cf Richmond v. Southern Bell Telephone Co., \n174 \nU.S. 761, 777\n, 19 S. Ct. 778. The provision relied on is merely petitioner's authorization and the town's agreement that the municipal power of police shall be exerted for the purpose of regulating, and to carry into effect petitioner's rules in respect of, the traffic at the station. The agreement does not empower the town so to appropriate petitioner's land.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 182, 193]\n\u00a0\n Is the provision of the ordinance of October 22, 1924, declaring a part of the driveway to be a public hack stand, a valid exercise of the police power? We assume that by the laws of the state the town is authorized to regulate traffic and to establish public hack stands in its streets and other public places. It does not claim the power to take or appropriate private property for such a purpose without giving the owner just compensation, but it contends that the establishing of this hack stand 'was justified under the police power by the public necessities for the safety, welfare and comfort of the public using the driveway,' and that it does not take private property for public use without compensation 'because the lands taken are devoted to a public use.' But, assuming that under the circumstances the creation of the public hack stand would be a proper exertion of the police power, it does not follow that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would not safeguard to the owner just compensation for the use of its property. Penna. Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 416\n, 43 S. Ct. 158, 28 A. L. R. 1321. The police power may be and frequently it is exerted to effect a purpose or consummate an enterprise in the public interest that requires the taking of private property; but, whatever the purpose or the means employed to accomplish it, the owner is entitled to compensation for what is taken from him. The railroad grounds, station, platforms, driveways, etc., are used by the petitioner for the purposes of its business as a common carrier; and, while that business is subject to regulation in the public interest, the property used belongs to petitioner. The state may not require it to be used in that business, or take it for another public use, without just compensation, for that would contravene the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 577\n, 578 S., 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105\n\n\n As against those not using it for the purpose of transportation, petitioner's railroad is private property in every legal sense. The driveway in question is owned and held by petitioner in the same right and stands on the same footing as its other facilities. Its primary purpose is to provide means of ingress and egress for patrons and others having business with the petitioner. But, if any part of the land in the driveway is capable of other use that does not interfere with the discharge of its obligations as a carrier, petitioner as an incident of its ownership and in order to make profit for itself has a right to use or permit others to use such land for any lawful purpose. Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., supra, 294 (26 S. Ct. 91).\n There was no duty upon petitioner to accord to other taxicabmen the use of its lands simply because it had granted Welsh the privileges specified in its contract with him. Petitioner is not bound to permit persons having no business with it to enter its trains, stations or grounds to solicit trade or patronage for themselves; they have no right to use its property to carry on their own business. Petitioner had no contract relations with taxicabmen other than Welsh and owed them no duty because they did not have any business with it. The enforcement of the ordinance here assailed would operate to deprive petitioner of the use of the land in question and hand it over to be used as a public hack stand by the individual defendants and others. As to them, and so far as concerns its use as a public hack stand, the driveway was petitioner's private property and could not be so appropriated in whole or in part except upon the payment of compensation.\n Under the guise of regulation, the town cannot require any part of the driveway to be used in a service that peti- \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 195]\n\u00a0\n tioner is under no duty to furnish. And, as petitioner's duty here involved is confined to the business of carrying passengers by railroad, the declaration of the ordinance that the specified part of the driveway 'is hereby designated and established as an additional public hack stand' clearly transcends the power of regulation. To compel the use of petitioner's land for that purpose is to take it without compensation in contravention of the constitutional safeguard here invoked. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 \nU.S. 340, 346\n, 35 S. Ct. 753; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Cahill, \n253 \nU.S. 71\n, 40 S. Ct. 457, 10 A. L. R. 1335.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the decree of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, concurring in part.\n I agree that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing a dismissal of the railroad's bill, should be reversed. But I think that the decree of the District Court requires serious modification. That decree ordered among other things:\n'That the town of Morristown, do desist and refrain, and is hereby forever restrained and enjoined, by the attempted enforcement of said ordinance or otherwise, from in any manner interfering with or hindering or obstructing the complainant, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company, in the occupation, use or control of its said station grounds, or in regulating the place, manner or time in which public or private vehicles going to and from said station grounds shall enter, stand or wait thereon or depart from the same.'\n\n This part of the decree is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the terms of the contract between the railroad and the town, with the decision of the highest court of the state construing the same (Welsh v. Morristown, 98 N. J. Law, 630, 121 A. 697, affirmed sub \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 196]\n\u00a0\n nom. Welsh v. Potts, 99 N. J. Law, 528, 124 A. 926), and with the general law of New Jersey. It seems to me inconsistent, also, with the law concerning the obligations of railroads as heretofore declared by this court.\n The situation which confronted the town authorities was this: About 3, 000 passengers are handled in and out of the station each day. Continuously, for nearly 10 years after the elimination of the grade crossings, cabs had, under the direction of the town authorities and with the acquiescence of the railroad, parked at the place later assigned by the ordinance here in question. Then in 1922, arose the controversy which gave rise to the Welsh Case and to the case at bar. The bulk of the traffic passing through the station is composed of persons commuting to Newark and New York. Accordingly, the demand for taxicabs at the station is largely concentrated in the late afternoon hours. There are 42 licensed cabs in Morristown. About 25 of them were accustomed to park at the station, at various times of the day. Presumably most of them were available for service at the rush hour in the late afternoon. Welsh, for whom the railroad asserts the exclusive privilege of using the driveway as a hack stand, has only 3 licensed cabs. Obviously, these are insufficient to give an adequate service. It is true that Welsh made application for additional licenses, and that these have been denied by the town authorities. But the testimony shows that the authorities were of the opinion that there were already more taxicabs in the town than could be operated profitably. No new license had been granted to any one since a date preceding Welsh's application; and no cabman had a license to operate more than three cabs.\n The railroad presented this alternative to the town: 'Either grant to Welsh licenses sufficient in number to enable him to supply the needs of all passengers arriving at the station, or submit to a denial to such passengers of \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 197]\n\u00a0\n the facilities customary on leaving the station.' To escape from that dilemma the town first resorted to the means upheld by the New Jersey courts in the Welsh Case. It prohibited all parking on the driveway, and located a public taxi stand on a public street adjacent thereto. While this provided a service adequate so far as the number of vehicles was concerned, it proved unsatisfactory in other respects. The taxi stand was several hundred feet distant from the shelter house, was not easily visible therefrom, and was difficult of access in inclement weather. The town then passed the ordinance which gave rise to the present suit. It undertook to establish near the station door a public taxi stand on the railroad's land. That it clearly had no right to do; for the contract between it and the railroad had not made the driveway a public street. Obviously a railroad's property cannot be taken without compensation for a purpose unconnected with its rail transportation. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 \nU.S. 340, 346\n, 35 S. Ct. 753; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Cahill, \n253 \nU.S. 71\n, 40 S. Ct. 457, 10 A. L. R. 1335. A public taxi stand is such an unconnected purpose. It would be open to use by cabs which do not serve the patrons of the railroad, as well as those which do. In establishing this public taxi stand, the town exceeded its powers. Enforcement of this ordinance was properly enjoined. And since the individual defendants must base their claims on the ordinance, the injunction against them also was proper. Compare Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., \n199 \nU.S. 279\n, 26 S. Ct, 91; Thompson's Express & Storage Co. v. Mount, 91 N. J. Eq. 497, 111 A. 173, 15 A. L. R. 351.\n But the injunction granted by the District Court was so broad as to prevent the town from making, by future ordinance, provisions which it may deem necessary to assure to its inhabitants adequate cab facilities. While the contract between the town and the railroad did not make the driveway a public highway, it did not restrict \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 198]\n\u00a0\n rights which the town would otherwise have had under the New Jersey law and under decisions of this court. Under the New Jersey law the railroad was bound to keep the driveway open to all persons seeking access to and from the station on legitimate business. It could not obstruct the driveway by physical enclosure. Public Service Ry. Co. v. Weehawken, 94 N. J. Eq. 88, 92, 119 A. 90. It could not, by its private contract with Welsh, interfere with the power of the municipality to make appropriate regulations as to traffic there. Welsh v. Morristown, supra. For, as the New Jersey court said, 'the driveway in question was and is devoted to public use, although the fee thereof remained in the railroad company.' Like all property of a carrier by railroad, the driveway was subject to the power of the state to compel the provision of adequate facilities incident to the rail transportation.\n In these days, the ability of the traveler to obtain conveniently, upon reaching the street door of the station, a taxicab to convey him and his hand baggage to his ultimate destination, is an essential of adequate rail transportation. The duties of a rail carrier are not necessarily limited to transporting freight and passengers to and from its stations. It must, in connection with its stations, provide adequately for ingress and for egress. And if it does not itself provide the facilities essential for the convenient removal of freight and passengers from the station, it may be required to let others provide them. That a railroad's obligations may be extended beyond its rails, is settled by numerous decisions of this court. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v.

Public Service Commission, \n265 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 44 S. Ct. 439. Its power to require adequate provision for carrying passengers to their ultimate destination rests on the same basis. Compare New York ex rel. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Knight, \n192 \nU.S. 21, 26\n, 24 S. Ct. 202.\n The Lackawanna Railroad recognized the importance of proper cab service. It undertook to provide it by the contract with Welsh. But Welsh was in no position to furnish adequate service. He had only three licensed cabs. The railroad answers that Welsh agreed by his contract with it to supply as many cabs as were needed, and that, but for the refusal of the town to grant him more licenses, he would have supplied the requisite number. The town was not obliged to issue additional licenses to Welsh. Its refusal to do so was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The ground of its refusal was that the granting of additional licenses would ruin the business of the established cabmen who had long been engaged in serving its inhabitants, and thus would impair the cab service of the general public throughout the town. The principle on which the town acted is one that is general in motor vehicle regulation to-day. \n2\n It is one that has been ap- \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 200]\n\u00a0\n proved by this court. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S. Ct. 263; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Holyoke Street Ry. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 45, 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 298. Compare Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 145\n, 44 S. Ct. 257; Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n271 U.S. 583\n, 599-600, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457.\n The record shows that the service which Welsh can furnish is inadequate, that to grant him sufficient licenses to enable him to furnish such service would impair taxi service throughout the town, and that a taxi stand located elsewhere than on the driveway does not satisfy the needs of travelers leaving the station. If, under these circumstances, the town should pass an ordinance establishing, \n\n[276 U.S. 182, 201]\n\u00a0\n on the driveway, a taxi stand available only to incoming passengers, I see no reason why, under the contract between it and the railroad or under the general laws of New Jersey, it may not do so. Certainly Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., \n199 \nU.S. 279\n, 26 S. Ct. 91, presents no obstacle. For in that case, the court expressly left open the question whether the state, to secure adequate service, might require what the cabmen there asserted of own right. Page 298, 26 S. Ct. 91. Compare Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra.\n Moreover, the decree is subject to another infirmity. By its broad language, it restrains the town from making and enforcing reasonable traffic regualtions applicable to the driveway. In so doing it conflicts with both the terms of the contract and the decision of the New Jersey courts in the Welsh Case. The contract between the railroad and the town expressly declares that the driveway 'shall be kept open at all times for passengers, pedestrians, carriages, wagons, automobiles and general vehicular traffic to and from the station grounds,' and that 'the town may and shall exercise all necessary police powers in and upon the station, station grounds, approaches and driveways, for the purpose of regulating foot and vehicular traffic.' It was decided in Welsh v. Morristown, 98 N. J. Law, 630, 121 A. 697, affirmed sub nom. Welsh v. Potts, 99 N. J. Law, 528, 124 A. 926, that under this contract the town had power to prohibit all parking on the driveway. That construction, being a ruling on a matter of law, is binding upon us.

Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Whitcomb et al. (D. C.) 12 F.(2d) 279.\n Appellees operate telephone plants in Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane, Wash., under local franchises which designated maximum permissible rates. These were granted prior to 1911, but after adoption of the present Constitution of the state.\n The 'Public Service Commission Law' of Washington (chapter 117, Laws 1911; Remington's Comp. Stat. 1922, ss \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n 10339-10441), authorized a public service commission and directed that telephone rates, tolls, contracts and charges 'shall be fair, just, reasonable and sufficient.' etc. It further provided-\n'Sec. 43 (Remington's Comp. Stat. 1922,  10379).-Nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent any telegraph company or telephone company from continuing to furnish the use of its line, equipment or service under any contract or contracts in force at the date this act takes effect or upon the taking effect of any schedule or schedules of rates subsequently filed with the commission, as herein provided, at the rates fixed in such contract or contracts: Provided, however, that the commission shall have power, in its discretion, to direct by order that such contract or contracts shall be terminated by the telephone company or telegraph company party thereto, and thereupon such contract or contracts shall be terminated by such telephone company or telegraph company as and when directed by such order.'\n\n'Sec. 55 (Remington's Comp. Stat. 1922,  10391).-Whenever the commission shall find, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, that the rates, charges, tolls or rentals demanded, exacted, charged or collected by any telegraph company or telephone company ... are unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential, or in any wise in violation of law, or that such rates, charges, tolls or rentals are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for the service rendered, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rates, charges, tolls or rentals to be thereafter observed and in force, and fix the same by order as hereinafter provided. ...'\n\n Chapter 7, Laws of 1921, vested in the Department of Public Works powers theretofore intrusted to the commission. \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n Control of the telephone systems owned by appellees was assumed by the Postmaster General August 1, 1918, and retained for one year. He fixed rates for Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane higher than the maximum rates permitted by the original franchises.\n The Act of July 11, 1919 (41 Stat. c. 10, p. 157) repealed the Act of July 16, 1918 (40 Stat. 904)-which authorized federal control of telephone systems-and directed that rates established by the Postmaster General should continue for four months after the termination of federal control ( July 31, 1919), unless sooner modified or changed by public authorities.\n August 8, 1919, the Public Service Commission directed appellees to observe the rates established by the Postmaster General; and they continued so to do. January, 1922, the Department of Public Works by formal complaint challenged the reasonableness of these rates. In the autumn of 1922 appellees files schedules of proposed increased rates which were suspended. Extended hearings were had concerning the value of properties devoted to the service and the reasonableness of the rates proposed. The department found and declared the value of the properties; also 'that the existing rates are just, fair, reasonable, and sufficient; that the proposed increased rates, both toll and exchange, are unjust, unfair, unreasonable, and more than sufficient.' And on March 31, 1923, it ordered 'that the applications of respondents for increased rates be and the same are hereby denied; that the proposed increased rates in their entirety be and they are hereby permanently suspended; that the same shall not become effective, and existing rates shall remain in effect until the further order of the department.'\n Shortly thereafter appellees began these proceedings in the United States District Court. They attacked the valuations by the department and alleged that the rates designated by the order of March 31, 1923, were confisca- \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n tory. The matter went to a master and was heard upon his report, etc. The court approved the master's conclusions that the department's valuations were too low and the prescribed rates were confiscatory. It accordingly adjudged the challenged order void and without effect.\n The causes are here by direct appeal. The valuations approved by the court are not questioned; nor is it now claimed that the rates prescribed by the departmental order would yield adequate returns. But it is said that these rates must be regarded as contractual franchise rates and therefore they cannot be confiscatory in a constitutional sense.\n Appellants maintain that under the statutes of Washington when the department terminates a franchise rate and prescribes another the result is 'simply to terminate one rate and substitute therefor a new rate, and that, after such substitution has been made, there still continues a franchise contract between the company and the city, which cannot be again changed except by the discretion of the department, and that the refusal of the department to exercise that discretion raises no question of confiscation.' Here, it is asserted, the department merely refused to change existing approved rates which were higher than the maxima originally specified in the granted franchises.\n The powers and duties of the Department of Public Works and the effect of its orders must be ascertained upon a consideration of the local Constitution and statutes, and the construction placed upon them by the state courts. Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 43 S. Ct. 613; Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. Chariton, \n255 \nU.S. 539\n, 41 S. Ct. 400.\n The Public Service Law authorizes investigation of existing rates and expressly directs that whenever after a hearing they are found to be unjust or insufficient to yield reasonable compensation the department shall determine what will be just and reasonable ones thereafter to be \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n observed and fix the same by order. The order of March 31, 1923, in effect declared the rates then being observed just and sufficient to yield reasonable compensation. It expressly commanded their future observance and was sufficient to terminate the provisions of the franchises as to maximum rates, within the purview of section 55, supra.\n The department made its investigation and order without regard to the franchise rates and treated the questions presented as unaffected thereby. It exercised the power and duty to fix reasonable and compensatory rates irrespective of any previous municipal action. We must treat the result as a bona fide effort to comply with the local statute. There is no adequate basis for the claim upon which appellants rely. See Puget Sound Traction Co. v. Reynolds, \n244 \nU.S. 574, 578\n, 37 S. Ct. 705\n\n\n Much consideration was given to the Public Service Law by the Supreme Court in State ex rel. Spokane v. Kuykendall (1922) 119 Wash. 107, 111, 205 P. 3. There a gas company operating in Spokane under a franchise which prescribed maximum rates asked for increased rates. The commission disapproved the proposed schedule but permitted the company to charge rates declared to be just, reasonable and sufficient. These exceeded the ones theretofore charged and were 561,  34) the terms of a franchise contract The court said:\n'... By the act of 1911 (Laws 1911, p. 561,  34) the terms of a franchise contract like the one in question here are binding upon the parties until the department of public works (heretofore the public service commission) has made an order directing a departure therefrom; and, without question, the department has the right and power to order a departure. State ex rel. Ellertsen v. Home Tel. & Tel. Co., 102 Wash. 196, 172 P. 899. In the case of State ex rel. Webster v. Superior Court, 67 Wash. 37, 120 P. 861, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 78, L. R. A. 1915C, 287, it was decided that the public service com- \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 103]\n\u00a0\n mission law placed the entire subject of rate regulation under the control of the commission, that no contract between a city representing the public and a public service company would be allowed to interfere with that control, and by way of application of the rule, it was decided in that case to be the duty of the commission to the company to fix a rate which was sufficient (a rate that would afford a fair interest return on the investment), in spite of the franchise contract fixing rates which were too low. That, in legal effect, is what has been done in the present case.'\n\n Responding to an argument in behalf of the city, based upon the proviso of section 43, supra, the court further said:\n'Therefrom it appears to be argued that the rates provided in the contract should continue until the commission makes an order specifically declaring and directing in so many words that the contract shall be terminated. We may overlook the fact, if need be, that, upon the petition of the city, the rates were reduced in 1913, and that in 1918 they were increased upon the application of the gas company, and consider the franchise contract as having been wholly undisturbed until the present time, and still we would be compelled to determine, as we do determine, that the present order of the department of public works is just as effective as if, after fixing the rates, there had been added therein the words 'and it is hereby directed that the rates provided in the franchise shall be and they are hereby terminated,' or words of similar import. That is the legal effect of what was done, and the form or language by which it was accomplished is not very material.'\n\n In the same cause the gas company maintained that the rates prescribed by the commission's order were inadequate for its needs and unjust. This matter was carefully considered upon the merits, but the opinion nowhere suggests that the rates prescribed should be treated as if \n\n[276 U.S. 97, 104]\n\u00a0\n specified in the franchise and obligatory upon the company whether compensatory or no.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration of this case. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDONNELLEY v. UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 110\nArgued: January 19, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank H. Norcross, of Reno, Nev., and Frank M. Hoyt, of Milwaukee, Wis., for Donnelley.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant was the prohibition director for Nevada. An information filed in the United States court for that district charged that he, having knowledge of the unlawful possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor by one Curran, did willfully and unlawfully fail to report such violations to the United States attorney. The jury found him guilty, and the court imposed a fine of $500. Alleging various grounds for reversal, he took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court, acting under section 239 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  346), certified to this Court a question concerning which it desired instruction. Defendant submitted the question upon a brief. Later we required the entire record to be sent up, and so brought \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n the case here for decision. The United States filed additional briefs. Oral arguments were made for the respective parties. But defendant failed to submit any other brief or to file any statement of points or specification of errors intended to be urged here. Rule 25, par. 2(e), par. 4. And see rule 11, par. 9. We confine our consideration to the question argued in his brief. Southeastern Express Co. v. Robertson, \n264 \nU.S. 541\n, 44 S. Ct. 424; Home Benefit Association v. Sargent, \n142 \nU.S. 691, 694\n, 695 S., 12 S. Ct. 332. The substance of the contention is that intentional failure of a prohibition director or other enforcement officer, having knowledge of crimes and offenders against the act, to report them to the United States attorney, is not a punishable offense.\n Section 2, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (chapter 85, 41 Stat. 305, 308; U. S. C. Tit. 27,  11 (27 USCA  11)), provides:\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, his assistants, agents, and inspectors shall investigate and report violations of this act to the United States attorney for the district in which committed. ...'\n\n The act does not specifically fix punishment for a violation of that provision. But section 29 (27 USCA  46) provides that:\n'Any person ... who ... violates any of the provisons ... for which offense a special penalty is not prescribed, shall be fined for a first offense not more than $500. ...'\n\n As there are no common-law crimes against the government (United States v. Eaton, \n144 \nU.S. 677\n, 12 S. Ct. 764), each case involves the construction of a statute to determine whether the acts or omissions of the accused are denounced as punishable. And regard is always to be had to the familiar rule that one may not be punished for crime against the United States unless the facts shown plainly and unmistakably constitute an offense within the meaning of an act of Congress. United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S. Ct. 625; Todd v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 15 S. Ct. 889; Fasulo v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 620, 629\n, 47 S. Ct. 200. \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 512]\n\u00a0\n The evidence showed, and the verdict, when read in the light of the court's charge, means, that the jury found that Curran was discovered transporting ten barrels of intoxicating liquor, and that plaintiff in error, with actual knowledge of that violation, intentionally failed to report the crime and offender for prosecution. Plainly that was a violation of duty imposed on him by section 2. And section 29 declares that violators of any provision shall be punished. Taken according to their ordinary meaning, the words used are sufficient to make the facts alleged and found a punishable offense. The rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of persons accused is not violated by allowing the language to have its full meaning where that construction is in harmony with the context and supports the policy and purposes of the enactment. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 395; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95. Section 3 forbids a narrow or strict construction of the act, and directs that all its provisions 'shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.'\n Diligence and good faith on the part of enforcement officers are essential. The great difficulties always attendant upon efforts to suppress the liquor traffic have been noticed and cited in a number of decisions of this Court. Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S. Ct. 98; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 282\n, 297 S., 40 S. Ct. 141; Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545, 560\n, 44 S. Ct. 628; Lambert v. Yellowley, \n272 \nU.S. 581, 595\n, 47 S. Ct. 210, 49 A. L. R. 575. The failure to enforce laws of the States passed to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor was one of the principal reasons for the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. Violations of such enactments were open and notorious. Connivance and co-operation between officers and offenders frequently existed. Those who drafted and passed the enforcement act knew that national prohibition would be assailed by \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 513]\n\u00a0\n influences more powerful than those that had embarrassed earlier and less sweeping state laws. Experience had shown that it would not do to leave prohibition enforcement officers free to determine what cases should be prosecuted and what ignored, and that mere imposition of duty to report offenders would not be enough. The infliction of punishment for their intentional violations is an appropriate measure to hold them to the performance of their duties.\n The act is comprehensive and discloses a legislative purpose fully to enforce the prohibition declared by the Eighteenth Amendment. National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350\n, 40 S. Ct. 486; Corneli v. Moore, \n257 \nU.S. 491\n, 42 S. Ct. 176; Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, \n258 \nU.S. 403\n, 42 S. Ct. 330; Grogan v. Hiram Walker & Sons. \n259 \nU.S. 80\n, 42 S. Ct. 423, 22 A. L. R. 116; Everard's Breweries v. Day, supra; Lambert v. Yellowley, supra. The forfeitures, fines and imprisonments unquestionably provided for show an intention to compel obedience. Congress was not content to impose duties and merely direct their performance; it diligently provided means for enforcement. An abridged reference to the things denounced as unlawful or expressly forbidden and those by the act commanded to be done will be sufficient to indicate how thoroughly Congress intended to enforce this article. The act prohibits beverages having as much as one-half of one per cent. of alcohol by volume. Section 1 (27 USCA  1). It declares that no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess such liquor except as authorized by the act. Section 3 ( 27 USCA  12). Denatured alcohol, medicinal, toilet and other preparations unfit for beverage purposes are not forbidden, if they correspond with the descriptions and limitations specified. Purchase and possession of liquor to make such articles are allowed, but manufacturers are required to procure permits, give bonds, keep records and make reports. Section 4 (27 USCA  13). No person is allowed without a permit to manufacture, sell, purchase, transport \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 514]\n\u00a0\n or prescribe liquor, but one may purchase and use it for medicinal purposes when prescribed by a physician. Section 6 (27 USCA  16). No one but a physician holding a permit may issue a prescription for liquor. And no physician is allowed to prescribe it unless, upon an examination or the best information obtainable, he believes its use as a medicine is necessary and will afford relief from some known ailment. No more than a pint of spirituous liquor shall be prescribed for the same person within ten days, and no prescription shall be filled more than once. Every physician is required to keep a record showing the date of every prescription, the amount prescribed, to whom issued, the purpose or ailment for which it is to be used, the amount and frequency of the dose. No physician may prescribe liquor, and no pharmacist may fill any such prescription, except on blanks furnished by the Commissioner, and pharmacists are required to keep records of prescriptions filled. Sections 7 and 8 (27 USCA  17, 19). No person is allowed to manufacture, purchase for sale, sell or transport liquor without making a permanent record showing prescribed details. Section 10 (27 USCA  22). Copies of permits to purchase must be preserved by the seller. Section 11 (27 USCA  23). Manufacturers are required to attach labels showing details concerning liquor made and sold by them. Section 12 (27 USCA  24). It is unlawful for any person to procure the transportation of liquor without giving the carrier notice of the character of the shipment. No carrier is permitted to transport and no person may receive liquor from a carrier unless there is shown upon the package specified information as to consignor and consignee, and also the number of the permit allowing the transportation. Section 14 (27 USCA  26). It is unlawful for any consignee to receive or any carrier to deliver any liquor in a container on which appears any statement known to be false. Section 15 (27 USCA  27). It is unlawful to advertise liquor or to permit a sign advertising it to remain on one's premises (section 17 (27 USCA  29)), or to advertise or to \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 515]\n\u00a0\n possess for sale any utensil, substance or recipe intended for use in its unlawful manufacture (section 18 (27 USCA  30)), or to give any information as to how liquor may be obtained in violation of law (section 19 (27 USCA  31)). Every place where liquor is made, kept or sold in violation of the law is declared to be a nuisance, and the person who maintains it is liable to specified punishment. Section 21 (27 USCA  33). It is declared that any violation on leased premises by the lessee or occupant shall work a forfeiture of the lease at the option of the lessor. Section 23 (27 USCA  35). When an officer shall discover one transporting liquor in any vehicle in violation of law, it is his duty to seize the liquors, take possession of the vehicle, arrest and proceed against the person in charge of it. Section 26 (27 USCA  40).\n A conservative analysis of the provisions of the title is contained in one of the briefs filed by the government. It shows eight provisions declaring specified things to be unlawful, eighteen prohibiting others and fifteen commanding the performance of various obligations imposed. Except for nuisance (sections 21-23 (27 USCA  33-37). Cf.  24, 25 (27 USCA  38, 39)), all punishments to be imposed on offenders are prescribed by section 29. Its substance follows:\n'Any person who manufactures or sells liquor in violation of this title shall for a first offense be fined ... or imprisoned. ...'\n\n Second and subsequent offenses are more severely to be punished. 'Any person violating the provisions of any permit, or who makes any false record, report, or affidavit required by this title, or violates any of the provisions of this title, for which offense a special penalty is not prescribed, shall be fined for a first offense not more than $500;' and heavier penalties are prescribed for second and subsequent offenses. Obviously Congress intended to provide for the punishment of the things declared to be unlawful and those specifically prohibited. And it is plain that there was no failure to provide measures for the enforcement of its commands. Undoubtedly the general clause of this \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 516]\n\u00a0\n section covers unauthorized transportation, importation, exportation, delivery, possession and the advertising or possession for sale of anything intended for use in its unlawful manufacture. The clause is broad enough-and it is the only one-to make punishable violations of the provisions governing manufacturers, pharmacists, shippers and carriers. Undoubtedly Congress intended to penalize their violation of the duties imposed on them. And, unless it is to be restricted by implication in favor of enforcement officers, the general language used also covers violations of the provisions enacted to govern their official conduct.\n But there is no support for a construction so restrained. It always has been deemed necessary to enact laws to compel performance of duty and to prevent corruption on the part of public officers. They are not attended by any special presumption that general language in disciplinary measures does not extend to them. Neglect of official duty is a misdemeanor at common law. Russell Crimes and Misdemeanors (7th Ed.) p. 601; People v. Herlihy, 35 Misc. Rep. 711, 72 N. Y. S. 389, and cases cited. Intentional failure of enforcement officers to report violations is doubly injurious to the public. It encourages offenders and disgraces the law. Performance of duty by prohibition agents is quite as important as compliance with law by authorized manufacturers, physicians, pharmacists and carriers. The general clause in question applies to the latter. With equal reason it may be held to cover failures of enforcement officers to report for prosecution violations and offenders known to them. And that construction is consistent with the established policy of Congress. Similar neglect of duty has long been punishable. The Act of July 18, 1866, 1 imposes penalties upon collectors of customs and other officers for failure to make required \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 517]\n\u00a0\n reports. An Act of July 20, 1868,2 provides that any revenue officer or agent who, having knowledge or information of the violation of the revenue laws, fails to report the same to his superior officer and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, shall be punished by fine and imprisonment. The duties of prohibition officers and revenue officers overlap. They are in the same department and directed by the same head. They are under like duty to report. Cf. R. S.  3164, as amended; U. S. C. tit. 26,  26 (26 USCA  26); Comp. St.  5884. Treasury regulations require that the reports of prohibition agents shall include statements of infringements of internal revenue laws also involved. Regulations 12, art. 35. They are entitled to like protection against prosecution in state courts for acts done under color of their office. Maryland v. Soper (No. 1 ), \n270 \nU.S. 19\n, 46 S. Ct. 185. And the policy of Congress is further shown by the Prohibition Act for the District of Columbia, which makes it an offense for any officer to fail to report violations to the corporation counsel. \n3\n These and other acts4 prescribing punishment for neglect of official duty strongly support the contention that Congress intended to make prohibition officers punishable for failure to make the reports required by section 2.\n Defendant argues that, it the failure of enforcement officers to report violations be held punishable 'they cannot ... determine what classes or character of violators it is most advantageous, for the purpose of real enforcement, to investigate and report.' But there is \n\n[276 U.S. 505, 518]\n\u00a0\n nothing to indicate that any such determinations are to be made. Congress intended that prohibition officers should not intentionally fail to report violations and that the law should be enforced against all offenders. The general clause covers all violations except the relatively few specifically dealt with. And it reasonably may be held to apply to violations of official duties and to safeguard against connivance between officers and offenders. He also argues that the imposition of heavier penalties for second and subsequent offenses shows that the clause was not intended to apply to offending officers because, as it was said they would not be in office after conviction. But that suggestion has little, if any, weight when it is remembered that the clause is aimed at so many violations and nonoffice-holding offenders. There is no rule requiring every part of the provision to apply to all classes covered by it. Cf. United States v. Union Supply Co., \n215 \nU.S. 50, 55\n, 30 S. Ct. 15. Moreover, it is not impossible that an enforcement officer may be in office subsequent to a conviction for such an offense.\n The construction contended for by defendant unduly restrains the language of the clause in question, is inconsistent with the context and contrary to the purposes of the act and the policy of Congress. It is without substantial support, and cannot be sustained.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice SANFORD dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 42, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178, 188; R.

STATE OF OHIO(1928)\nNo. 766\nArgued: April 10, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. L. Johnson, of Xenia, Ohio, and Robert F. Cogswell, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Joseph A. Finney, of Xenia, Ohio, for the State of Ohio.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n M. J. Dugan was convicted before the mayor's court of the city of Xenia, Greene county, Ohio, for the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor under section 6212-15 of the General Code of Ohio. The conviction was sustained by the common pleas court of Greene county, Ohio, by the Court of Appeals of the same county, and by the Supreme Court of the state ( 159 N. E. 477). The defendant has duly raised the question of the constitutional impartiality of the mayor to try the case. This is the only issue for our consideration. The objection is based on the ground that for the mayor to act in this case was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that the mayor occupied in the city government two practically and seriously inconsistent positions, one partisan and the other judicial; that as such mayor he had power under the law to convict persons without a jury of the offense of the possession of intoxicating liquor and punish them by substantial fines, half of which were paid into the city treasury, and as a member of the city commission he had a right to vote on the appropriation and the spending of city funds; and further that, while he received only a fixed salary and did not receive any fees, yet all the fees taxed and collected under his convictions were paid into the city treasury, \n\n[277 U.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n and were contributions to a general fund out of which his salary as mayor was payable.\n The defendant in February, 1924, pleaded guilty and was fined $400 for possessing intoxicating liquor, and thereafter was convicted and fined $ 1,000 for a subsequent similar offense. This is a review of the second conviction.\n The city of Xenia is a charter city, and has a commission form of goverment, with five commissioners. The charter provides that a member of the city commission shall also be mayor. The mayor has no executive, and exercises only judicial, functions. The commission exercises all the legislative power of the city, and together with the manager exercises all its executive powers. The manager is the active executive. The mayor's salary is fixed by the votes of the members of the commission other than the mayor, he having no vote therein. He receives no fees. The offense charged here was committed within the corporate limits of the city of Xenia. Xenia is the capital of Greene county, having, according to the census of 1920, a population of 9,110. Greene county is a rural county, with no larger city than Xenia.\n Was the mayor disqualified as judge by the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted and applied in Tumey v. State of Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S. Ct. 437, 50 A. L. R. 1243? We think not. The Tumey Case does not apply to this. Tumey was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor at White Oak, a village in Hamilton county, Ohio, on a warrant issued by the mayor of North College Hill. The latter was a village of 1,100 in the county, which included the city of Cincinnati with half a million population. The counsel for the state asserted in that case that the purpose of the law in its application to the mayor of a village in large counties was to extend jurisdiction to break up places of outlawry that were located on the municipal boundary just outside of large cities; \n\n[277 U.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n that in some of the cities the normal enforcement agencies under the law did not perform their duty, and the jurisdiction of mayors of village courts over the whole county was conferred so that there might be some courts through which effective prosecutions for city offenders could be had, and that the system by which the fines to be collected were divided equally between the state and the village was for the proper purpose of stimulating the activities of the village officers and agents to due enforcement over the county. The council of any village might by ordinance authorize the use of half of the fines collected for the violation of the prohibition law, so that by contingent commissions to attorneys, detectives, or secret service officers they could secure the enforcement of the law and very much increase the revenue of the village.\n The duties of the mayor of a village in Ohio like that of North College Hill were primarily executive. He was the chief conservator of the peace and directed to see that all ordinances were faithfully obeyed and enforced. He communicated to council from time to time a statement of the finances of the municipality. He supervised the conduct of all the officers of the corporation, including those engaged in prosecuting the liquor law violators.\n This court in the Tumey Case held that it was a violation of due process of law to make the compensation of the mayor dependent upon his conviction of defendants in this especially organized 'liquor' court, from which the mayor received, in addition to his salary, about $100 a month from convictions. The direct dependence of the mayor upon convictions for compensation for his services as a judge was found to be inconsistent with due process of law.\n As the plaintiff in error contends, however, the mayor's individual pecuniary interest in his conviction of defendants was not the only reason in the Tumey Case for hold- \n\n[277 U.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n ing the Fourteenth Amendment to be violated. Another was that a defendant brought into court might with reason complain that he was not likely to get a fair trail or a fair sentence from a judge who as chief executive was responsible for the financial condition of the village, who could and did largely control the policy of setting up a liquor court in the village with attorneys, marshals, and detectives under his supervision, and who by his interest as mayor might be tempted to accumulate from heavy fines a large fund by which the running expenses of a small village could be paid, improvements might be made, and taxes reduced. This was thought not to be giving the defendant the benefit of due process of law.\n No such case is presented at the bar. The mayor of Xenia receives a salary which is not dependent on whether he convicts in any case or not. While it is true that his salary is paid out of a fund to which fines accumulated from his court under all laws contribute, it is a general fund, and he receives a salary in any event, whether he convicts or acquits. There is no reason to infer on any showing that failure to convict in any case or cases would deprive him of or affect his fixed compensation. The mayor has himself as such no executive, but only judicial, duties. His relation under the Xenia charter, as one of five members of the city commission, to the fund contributed to by his fines as judge, or to the executive or financial policy of the city, is remote. We agree with the Supreme Court of Ohio in its view that the principles announced in the Tumey Case do not cover this.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEQUITABLE TRUST CO.

The bankrupts had credit with many foreign banks and to enable small banks in this country to issue drafts upon such banks in their own name offered these terms:\n'Upon receipt of advice of draft, accompanied by adequate funds payable at par in New York, we shall promptly forward our advice of the same and provide the drawee with funds sufficient for the payment of the draft abroad, by a transfer of credit from our balance, or otherwise, provided the draft is drawn on a bank named in our latest list of correspondents.'\n\n It was added that the drawing banks act as principals and draw in their own name, the bankrupts being employed merely 'as agents of the drawers for the purpose of advising the issue of their drafts and providing the drawee banks with sufficient funds to cover their payment.' The bankrupts sent out lists of their foreign correspondents and also daily rate cards fixing the rate for the various foreign currencies, including their own compensation, good only for the day of the date. In accordance with this plan the Trinidad bank drew a draft on a branch of the Banca Commerciale Italiana for 24,360 lire, sent notice to the bankrupts that they had sold it 'and shall thank you to protect same upon presentation,' and remitted therewith a check for $1,191.20, which the bankrupts received on May 22, 1923, \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n and deposited to their general account. On the same day the bankrupts sent to the Italian bank and to its branch a list and description of the drafts issued by inland banks and by the bankrupts and requested it to 'honor the above listed drafts charging same to our account.' The list was received on or before June 4, 1923; the account of the bankrupts was debited with the total amount and to that extent ceased to draw interest, the bank getting its compensation in this way. At the same time in account termed 'Drafts Payable' was credited with the same amount, this account being credited in the same way with drafts from other dealers with the bank and the bankrupts themselves. In accordance with the practice in international banking, the bankrupts when they saw fit to do so canceled their advices and were recredited in their general account; and although in fact they did not cancel the advice of inland drafts except when requested by the inland banks, the Italian bank did not know or inquire into reasons and so far as appears the Trinidad bank or at all events the holder of the draft knew nothing of the mode of bookkeeping described.\n The draft was presented after the petition in bankruptcy had been filed and was dishonored; the petitioner as drawer had to take it up and now claims on the two grounds that the sum paid by it was paid upon trust to be applied to the draft, and that as holder of the draft it is, by subrogation, an equitable assignee of the bankrupts' deposit with the drawee. The first of these need not detain us. Beecher v. Cosmopolitan Trust Co., 239 Mass. 48, 131 N. E. 338. Legniti v. Mechanics & Metals Nat. Bank of New York, 230 N. Y. 415, 130 N. E. 597, 16 A. L. R. 185. The identity of the fund was not maintained and no one expected it to be. See National City Bank of New York v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50, 56\n, 57 S., 34 S. Ct. 20. The bankrupts undertook to 'forward' advice but only to 'provide' the drawee with funds. The second contention was that which prevailed below. Of course there is room for difference if \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n the parties did not express very clearly what they wanted or meant but we are led to a different conclusion whether the reliance be upon the rights of the holder or upon the original contract between the respondent and the bankrupts. In the first place the ignorance of the whole affair on the part of the holder and the general understanding that the party dealing immediately with the bank having the 'Bills Payable' account is master of it, as between himself and the bank, are quite inconsistent with the notion that an entry on that account is the appropriation of a fund to the holder's use. The respondent tries to give a different turn to the evidence but the master's finding and our own conclusion from the testimony leave no doubt in our minds. It is true that after such an entry the interest allowed to the depositor stops but that is only a convenient way of giving compensation to the bank. It is not uncommon in commercial transactions to see some of the elements of an earlier or a half imitated transaction appear, although the essentials of the transaction are not there. Whether a fund was appropriated or not depended wholly on the dealings between the bankrupts and the Italian bank; and both of them dealt with the account as subject to the bankrupt's control. The cessation of interest was for the benefit of the bank because the account was only with its general funds, and did not have any assets especially set aside and appropriated to it-in short was a bookkeeping device for the convenience of the bank.\n Again, the terms offered by the bankrupts to their correspondents seem to us to promise the appropriation of a specified fund to the draft as little as they promise to apply the money received by them to that end. They are to provide the drawee banks with sufficient funds for the payment of the drafts by transfer of credit from our balance 'or otherwise.' They are to provide, that is, as convenient to themselves, for payment by the drawee banks, not to give them an earmarked corpus to be \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n handed over. They are requested by their correspondents to protect the drafts, which again means merely to see that they are paid. Wabash, St. L . & P. R. Co. v. Ham, \n114 \nU.S. 587, 596\n, 5 S. Ct. 1081. People dealing with large banks do not ordinarily seek the ambiguous security of an identified fund, they are satisfied if the bank gives them credit. We see no indications that the Trinidad bank was not perfectly content to know that it would have credit with the Banca Commerciale, and that in the usual course of things its drafts would be paid. Evidently with this conception of their duties the bankrupts asked the Italian bank 'to protect to the debit of our account the drafts' in question and others, and the branch bank to 'honor the above listed drafts.' That such a letter of advice is not an assignment is clearly explained in Eastman Kodak Co. v. National Park Bank (D. C.) 231 F. 320, 323, affirmed (C. C. A.) 247 F. 1002\n\n\n We have called the instrument under which the respondent claims as assignee, a draft. But on its face it is called 'check.' The form was a general form furnished by the bankrupts and the purpose is said to have been that in continental Europe or some parts of it checks are not subject to the same stamp tax as drafts. It is said in a reputable work that the fact that the instrument purports to be drawn upon a deposit is what constitutes it a check. Daniels, Negotiable Instruments (6th Ed.)  1569. The existence of this opinion sufficiently explains the words of the document before us 'Pay from balance against this check.' They no more purport to assign a fraction of a fund than does an ordinary check. They would not naturally take that shape as the respondent, the drawer of the check, had no fund in the hands of the drawee.\n The decision of this case depends more upon the general import of the transaction and upon what the parties were \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n likely to want than upon the phrases that can be picked out from the several steps. We repeat that in our opinion what the parties meant to establish and what the respondent got was the assurance of a credit abroad to the extent of its check as in the case of a letter of credit, not an attenuated property right in an account to which no special funds were attached and the particulars of which neither the respondent nor the purchaser of the check could know.\n Order reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n The agreement of the bankrupts, on the faith of which petitioner sold its draft, did more than stipulate that the draft should be paid on presentation. It provided specifically the method of payment; that the bankrupts should 'promptly,' on notice of the draft, 'provide the drawee with funds sufficient for the payment of the draft abroad, by a transfer of credit or otherwise.' It plainly contemplated the course of business, actually followed, in which a credit, to be established with the drawee, was to be set apart and specifically appropriated to the payment of the draft. The draft was by its terms made payable from 'balance against this check.'\n We need not discuss what the petitioner's rights would have been if no such credit had been established, for here the bankrupts had performed their contract fully and to the letter. They set apart the stipulated credit. Withdrawal of it by them would have been a violation of their contract with petitioner, for the contract contained no intimation of a right to revoke it, and if the receiver had not done what they had no right to do the draft would have been paid. Nor does it appear to me that the real question is whether the Italian bank was charged with a trust with respect to funds lodged with it by the bankrupts. It may be assumed that it was not a trustee, but \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n only a debtor to the bankrupts for the funds thus received, with power to discharge the debt pro tanto by payment of the draft when presented.\n Stated with precision the question seems rather to be whether, since the bankrupts had performed their agreement by specifically designating and setting apart enough of their credit with the Italian bank to meet the draft, the credit thus set apart is to be treated in equity as security for the payment of the draft. If subject to that equitable obligation, neither the bankrupts nor the receiver could convert the credit, so set apart, into cash and turn the proceeds over to general creditors freed of that obligation.\n Since Holroyd v. Marshall, 10 H. L. Cas. 191, it has been generally accepted doctrine, the recording acts permitting, that an agreement to hold property which the promisor may afterwards acquire as security for the payment of a debt, operates in equity once the property is acquired, to give the stipulated security to the promisee in preference to general creditors. Such is the rule in this Court. Sexton v. Kessler & Co., \n225 \nU.S. 90\n, 32 S. Ct. 657. I had supposed it to be equally well settled that the agreement need not mention the word 'security' to accomplish that result, if its plain purpose is to provide for the satisfaction of a debt or obligation out of identifiable property. Compare Walker v. Brown, \n165 \nU.S. 654\n, 17 S. Ct. 453; Ingersoll v. Coram, \n211 \nU.S. 335\n, 29 S. Ct. 92; Hurley v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 126\n, 29 S. Ct. 466; Ketchum v. St. Louis, \n101 U.S. 306\n; Parlin & Orendorff Implement Co. v. Moulden (C. C. A.) 228 F. 111, L. R. A. 1917B, 130; Curtis v. Walpole Tire & Rubber Co. (C. C. A.) 218 F. 145. There has been no dissent from the view that an agreement to apply a designated credit or account to the payment of a check or draft drawn upon it creates security in the credit enforcible in equity as against general creditors. Fourth Street Nat. Bank v. Yardley, \n165 \nU.S. 634\n, 17 S. Ct. 439; Farley v. Turner, 35 L. J. Ch. 710; Coates v. First N. Bank of Emporia, 91 N. Y. \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n 20; Muller v. Kling, 209 N. Y. 239, 103 N. E. 138; In re Hollins (C. C. A.) 215 F. 41, L. R. A. 1915B, 438. Equity, in making such agreements effective, does no more than it habitually does in compelling the performance of an agreement to give a mortgage to secure advances made on the faith of the agreement.\n Both parties to this transaction knew that American drafts drawn on European banks would be worthless unless definite arrangement for their payment by the drawee was made in advance of their presentation, and that where, as here, a particular credit was set apart for that purpose the utility of such drafts would be seriously impaired if the credit, once established, could be canceled at will. No intelligent banker would sell such drafts if the establishment of such a credit were not contemplated. A bank here, drawing and selling such drafts against a credit to be established abroad by others, pledges its own credit to the payee and is secured against loss and the dishonor of its drafts only in so far as it may insure the creation of the appropriate credit and retain the benefit of it once it is created. The stipulation that the bankrupts should promptly set apart a credit for that purpose upon receipt of advice of the draft and advise the drawee of it was a material inducement to petitioner to pledge its own credit by the sale of its draft. Once performed it is valuable security to both payee and drawer, if it is permitted to have the legal sanctions which ordinarily attach to agreements of this character.\n The evidence in this case appears to me, as it did to the court below, to fall far short of establishing a practice or custom, or any rule of Italian law, permitting the depositor, while the drafts are outstanding, to cancel or control for his own purposes the credit set apart for their payment. Our own rule is that a bank of deposit may not, with impunity, ignore the known equitable rights of others to the credit established by its depositor, Central Nat. Bank v. Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n, and it would seem \n\n[275 U.S. 359, 372]\n\u00a0\n that that rule should be applied here in determining the rights of the parties in the absence of proof of any other. But in any case, such control, if retained by the bankrupts as between themselves and the Italian bank, could not be rightfully exercised in violation of their contract with petitioner.\n The case would therefore seem to be a proper one for the application of the rule announced by this court in Fourth Street Nat. Bank v. Yardley, supra, that a court of equity will lend its aid to carry into effect an agreement that an obligation shall be satisfied out of a specified credit. Applied here that rule would make effective the intention of the parties and give stability to a large and important class of banking transactions. The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE COLLINS(1928)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 565, 566]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

In a suit pending before that court the petitioner, Collins, having made application for an interlocutory injunction, and having notified the Governor and the Attorney General of the state, requested Judge Jacobs to call two additional judges to sit with him as provided in section 266 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 USCA  380). Judge Jacobs denied the request and, sitting alone, denied the interlocutory injunction. The petitioner thereupon filed this motion. In the accompanying petition, he prays that Judge Jacobs be directed to set aside his order denying the injunction, and to call two judges to sit with him at the hearing. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy. Ex parte Metropolitan Water Co., \n220 \nU.S. 539, 546\n, 31 S.

But, as we deem it clear that the case is not within the scope of section 266, we deny leave to file the petition. Compare Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, 46 S. Ct. 557\n\n\n The defendants in the suit are the city of Phoenix, Arizona, and Schmidt-Hitchcock, Contractors, a private Arizona corporation. The purpose of the suit is to enjoin the city, its officers, and the contractor, from proceeding under a resolution adopted by the city directing the paving of a street on which the petitioner is an abutting owner. The improvement was to be made pursuant to a general statute of Arizona (Civil Code 1913, title 7, c. 13) and the cost was to be defrayed by bonds issued pursuant to another general statute (Session Laws 1919, c. 144). They provide that the cost of the improvement shall be assessed against abutting property according to the benefit received, and that a lien shall thereon arise for the amount assessed. The petitioner claims that the statutes make no proper provision for giving the property owner a hearing, and that therefore they contravene the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. Schmidt-Hitchcock objected to the calling of additional judges on the ground that the case did not fall within the purview of section 266, but was merely one in which it was sought to prevent a municipal corporation and its officers from proceeding with a municipal improvement.\n The suit is not one to restrain 'the enforcement, operation, or execution' of a statute of a state within the meaning of section 266. That section was intended to embrace a limited class of cases of special importance and requiring special treatment in the interest of the public. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[277 U.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n The lower courts have held with substantial unanimity that the section does not govern all suits in which it is sought to restrain the enforcement of legislative action, but only those in which the object of the suit is to restrain the enforcement of a statute of general application or the order of a state board or commission. Thus, the section has long been held inapplicable to suits seeking to enjoin the execution of municipal ordinances,2 or the orders of a city board. \n3\n And likewise it has been held that the section does not apply where, as here, although the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, the defendants are local officers and the suit involves matters of interest only to the particular municipality or district involved. \n4\n Despite the generality of the language, we think the section must be so construed. \n\n[277 U.S. 565, 569]\n\u00a0\n Congress realized that, in requiring the presence of three judges, of whom one must be a Justice of this court or a Circuit Judge, it was imposing a severe burden upon the federal courts. \n5\n The burden was imposed because Congress deemed it unseemly that a single District Judge should have power to suspend legislation enacted by a state. That the section was intended to apply only to cases of general importance is shown by the provision that notice of the hearing must be given to the Governor and the Attorney General-a precaution which would scarcely be deemed necessary in a suit of interest only to a single locality. Support for that view is found also in the provision for a stay of the suit in case there shall have been brought in a court of the state a suit to enforce the statute or order. That the provisions of section 266 applied to cases of unusual gravity was recognized by Congress in 1925, when, in limiting the right of direct appeal from the District Court to this court, it carefully preserved that right in cases falling within the section. Cases like the present are not of that character. If the temporary injunction had been issued, the result would have been merely to delay a municipal improvement. Though here the alleged unconstitutionality rests in the enabling statute, the case does not differ substantially from one where the sole claim is that a city ordinance is invalid. Moreover, the enabling act is not itself being enforced within the meaning of section 266. That act merely authorizes further legislative action to be taken by the city, as by the resolution here in question. It is that municipal action, not the statute of a state, whose 'enforcement, operation, or execution' the petitioner seeks to enjoin.\n Motion denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Senator Burton said of the amendment to the Commerce Court Act, which later became section 266: 'It evidently recognizes the superior degree of consideration and sanction which should be given to a state statute, and prevents hasty interference with the action of a sovereign state.' 45 Cong.

Spillman, of Pierce, Neb., and Hugh La Master, of Tecumseh, Neb., for petitioners.\n Mr. Joseph W. Woodrough, of Omaha, Neb., pro se.\n\n Jr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition by Williams, the tax commissioner of Nebraska, and 71 county treasurers asking for a writ of mandamus to be directed to District Judge Woodrough, of the federal court for that state. A rule to show cause issued (\n276 \nU.S. 597\n, 48 S. Ct. 319, 72 L. Ed. -), and the return has been made. The petitioners are the defendants in a suit in equity commenced in that court by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company. When the cause was ripe for final hearing, they moved the District Judge to call to his assistance two other federal judges as provided in section 266 of \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 269]\n\u00a0\n the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013, and the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  380). Judge Woodrough denied the motion and set the case for final hearing, stating that 'the object and purpose of this action is to enjoin the collection of taxes against plaintiff's property by defendants county treasurers ... and there is no injunction issued, allowed or prayed for to restrain the action of any officer of the state of Nebraska and that the defendants county treasurers are not officers of the state of Nebraska,' within the meaning of section 266 as amended. The petitioners contend that they are entitled as of right to have the case heard before three judges. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy. Exparte Metropolitan Water Co., \n220 \nU.S. 539, 546\n, 31 S. Ct. 600.\n Nebraska has provided for the assessment of railroad property by a state board of equalization. Compiled Statutes 1922,  5839, 5840. After the board completes its valuation, it is required to return to the county clerk of every county in which the railroad has property, a statement showing the proportion of the railroad that lies within the county, its average valuation per mile, and the valuations that shall be placed to the credit of each of the governmental subdivisions of the county. The board is authorized to fix the rate of taxation for state purposes, and it transmits to the county clerk a statement of the rate so established. The county treasurers are ex officio collectors of all taxes levied within their respective counties, whether for state or for local purposes. Sections 5847-5850, 5904, 5905, 5996\n\n\n The railroad seeks in its suit to enjoin the collection of the taxes for 1923 on the ground that the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated in making the assessment. It alleged that its property was assessed by the state board at 122 per cent. of its actual value, while the property of other taxpayers was assessed locally at not \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 270]\n\u00a0\n more than 60 per cent. of its value; that this discrimination was systematic and intentional; that the valuation of its property, fixed by the state board, had been certified to the clerks of the various counties and entered on the tax lists; that the taxes were about to become delinquent; and that the company was without adequate remedy at law. It prayed that the court fix the percentage of the tax levied which it should pay to the county treasurers in tentative settlement, for a temporary restraining order, and for interlocutory and final injunctions. Pursuant to an order of the District Judge, the motion for an interlocutory injunction came on for hearing, in November, 1923, before a court of three judges constituted as provided in section 266 of the Judicial Code. Because certain of the legal questions presented were deemed similar to those involved in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Osborne, \n265 \nU.S. 14\n, 44 S. Ct. 431, then pending in this court, the interlocutory injunction was granted.\n The Osborne Case was decided on April 28, 1924. On June 23, 1925, the District Court, again composed of three judges, appointed, on motion of the railroad, a special master to take evidence. His report was filed on January 31, 1928. Soon thereafter the defendants made the motion that the District Judge call two additional judges to his assistance on final hearing. He was not required to do this, unless the suit was one in which, as provided in section 266, it is sought to restrain 'the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a state by restraining the action of any officers of such state in the enforcement or execution of such statute, or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such state ... upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.' We are of opinion that Judge Woodrough properly denied the motion. \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n A case does not fall within section 266, unless a statute or an order of an administrative board or commission is challenged as contrary to the Federal Constitution. Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S. Ct. 353; Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461, 465\n, 46 S. Ct. 557. Here, there was no question as to the validity of the taxing statute. It was the assessment which the railroad challenged. And an assessment is not an order made by an administrative board or commission, within the meaning of that section. The function of an assessing board is not that of issuing orders. Its function is informational. Its duty is to make findings of fact, and thereby furnish the basis on which other officials are to act in individual instances in levying and collecting the taxes. An assessment does not command the taxpayer to do, or to refrain from doing anything; does not grant or withhold any privilege, authority, or license; does not extend or abridge any power or facility; does not determine any right or obligation. Compare Standard Scale Co. v. Farrell, \n249 \nU.S. 571, 577\n, 39 S. Ct. 380; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278; United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 310\n, 47 S. Ct. 413; Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Railorad Commission (D. C.) 280 F. 901. An assessment is directed by one officer of the state to another. Compare Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S. Ct. 466, decided May 14, 1928. Though in Nebraska the railroad property is, in the main, assessed by a state board and the value of the part within each county is then determined on a pro rata basis, the function of assessing property within a county remains the same as it would be if the valuation of all the property were made by a county board. Whatever the scope of the jurisdiction of the assessing body and whatever the method of valuation pursued, the function to be performed remains simply that of fact finding.\n For the purpose of jurisdiction in federal courts, the difference between the function of regulating, expressed \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 272]\n\u00a0\n in orders of a railroad or like commission, and the function of fact finding is vital. Determinations of an administrative board which are merely findings of fact are not reviewable. Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n, 43 S. Ct. 445. Assessments become reviewable judicially only when they are translated into action, as by levy of the tax based on the assessment. From this difference between regulatory orders of administrative boards or commissions, which constitute action, compare Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 29 S. Ct. 67, and assessments by tax commissions or local assessors, which form merely a basis for action, flows the differenece in the method of review in cases brought here under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344). A judgment of a state court sustaining the validity of a regulatory order of a public utilties board is reviewable by writ of error, like a judgment sustaining the validity of a statute. Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 683\n, 43 S. Ct. 675; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 42\n, 45 S. Ct. 412; Live Oak Water Users' Association v. Railroad Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 46 S. Ct. 149; Sultan Ry. & Timber Co. v. Department of Labor & Industries, No. 274, \n277 U.S. 135\n, S. Ct. 505, decided May 14, 1928. But a judgment of a state court sustaining a tax alleged to be illegal because there has been discrimination in assessing property, can be reviewed only on certiorari. Jett Bros. Distilling Co. v. City of Carrollton, \n252 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 40 S. Ct. 255. This is true whether it was the determination of a state or local assessing body, or, as in the case at bar, of both combined, which is alleged to have produced the discrimination. Baker v. Druesedow, \n263 \nU.S. 137\n, 44 S. Ct. 40.\n Obviously an assessment which is not 'a statute of or an authority exercised under any state,' within the meaning of section 237, before amended by the act of 1925, cannot be a statute or an order of an administrative board or commission under section 266. The orders contemplated by section 266 are directed to railroads or others, of whom action, or nonaction, is commanded, as it is by a statute. \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 273]\n\u00a0\n Compare Sultan Ry. & Timber Co. v. Department of Labor and Industries, No. 274, \n277 \nU.S. 135\n, 48 S. Ct. 505, decided May 14, 1928. Since an assessment by a state board of equalization has none of the qualities that would be associated with 'orders,' it cannot have been the sort of state administrative function which Congress had in mind when by the amendment of 1913, it declared the scope of section 266, so as to include suits in which the injunction was sought on the ground of the unconstitutionality of an administrative order. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Under the Act of February 13, 1925, the final hearing is not required to be before three judges unless the application for an interlocutory injunction was required to be. In a large majority of the cases of this character in which applications for an interlocutory injunction have been made, they have been heard before a single judge; and the propriety of the practice has not been questioned by this court. \n2\n As we hold that the action of the state and \n\n[277 U.S. 267, 274]\n\u00a0\n county boards which is alleged to be discriminatory, is not an order within the meaning of section 266, we have no occasion to consider whether the lower court was right in holding that the 'county treasurers are not officers of the state of Nebraska,' or whether there are other reasons why the suit is not within the scope of that section.\n Rule discharged.\n___ The application for a temporary injunction was entertained by a single judge in Johnson v. Wells Fargo & Co. (D. C.) 205 F. 60, \n239 \nU.S. 234\n, 36 S. Ct. 62 (prior to the act of 1913); Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522\n, 37 S. Ct. 683, Ann.

Rec. 4773. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] This appears to have been the uniform practice where the assessment was made by local officials. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Board of Commissioners of Weld County (C. C.

It has also been the practice in the great majority of cases where the object of the suit was to enjoin local officials from levying a tax based on an assessment made by a state board and claimed to be discriminatory. Mudge v. McDougal (D. C.) 222 F. 562; Nevada-California Power Co. v. Hamilton (D. C .) 235 F. 317; City Ry. Co. v. Beard (D. C.) 283 F. 313; Chicago & Northwestern R. Co. v. Eveland (D.

Osborne, \n265 \nU.S. 14\n, 44 S. Ct. 431, the hearing below was before three judges. In that case, as in this, the tax commissioner was joined as a defendant, but apparently no relief could have been given against him. Where relief by injunction has been sought against state tax commissions, boards of equalization, and their members, the practice has been less uniform. \n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRBANKS, MORSE & CO. v. AMERICAN VALVE & METER CO.(1928)\nNo. 262\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 305, 306]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fred L. Chappell, of Kalamazoo, Mich., and Carroll J. Lord, Howard M. Cox, and Dwight B. Cheever, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Frank A. Whiteley, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for an injunction against the infringement of letters patent and for an accounting. On the first hearing the suit was dismissed for want of equity; but on appeal that decree was reversed. 249 F. 234. Further proceedings resulted in an accounting before a master, who returned the evidence taken by him and reported his findings. Both parties excepted; but the findings were approved and the plaintiffs were given a decree for the profits found by the master with interest from the close of the infringing period and an allowance for fees paid to expert accountants. The defendants appealed, their principal complaint being that the findings and the decree were not in accord with the evidence. The Circuit \n\n[276 U.S. 305, 307]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals declined to examine that complaint because the appellants had not complied with the provision in equity rule 75b relating to the condensation and narration of the evidence. The minor complaints were examined and the decree was approved as to the profits and interest and was disapproved as to the allowance for payments made to expert accountants. 18 F.(2d) 716.\n A writ of certiorari was granted by this court (\n274 U.S. 735\n, S. Ct. 770) to enable it to review the ruling respecting the nonobservance of the equity rule. A like writ already had been granted in Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co., \n274 \nU.S. 728\n, 47 S. Ct. 576, where the same Circuit Court of Appeals (16 F.(2d) 751) had made a similar ruling. Our decision in that case was announced recently (\n275 \nU.S. 372\n, 48 S. Ct. 183), and we then directed the parties in this case to show cause why it should not be disposed of in accordance with that decision. Both parties responded in printed briefs which have been considered.\n The pertinent part of equity rule 75b declares:\n'The evidence to be included in the record shall not be set forth in full, but shall be stated in simple and condensed form, all parts not essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal being omitted and the testimony of witnesses being stated only in narrative form, save that if either party desires it, and the court or judge so directs, any part of the testimony shall be reproduced in the exact words of the witness. The duty of so condensing and stating the evidence shall rest primarily on the appellant. ...'\n\n The rule is set forth in full in the opinion in Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co., and explanation is there made of the reasons for the rule and of the right practice under it.\n In that case the appellant had stated the evidence without appreciable condensation or narration and the statement had been approved by the district court. We agreed \n\n[276 U.S. 305, 308]\n\u00a0\n with the Circuit of Appeals that the statement did not conform to the rule, or to its excepting clause, and that the appellant was not entitled to a re-examination of the evidence thus wrongly brought into the record. But we held that the situation was one in which that court, upon proper terms, should have remitted the transcript to the District Court for the purpose of affording the appellant a further opportunity to conform to the rule. Our reaons for so holding were that in the Seventh Circuit the judges, both circuit and district, commonly had permitted the evidence to be stated without condensation or narration; that the Circuit Court of Appeals had impliedly sanctioned that practice up to the time of its decision in that case; and that to condemn and reject a statement of evidence prepared and approved according to that practice, without according the appellant a further opportunity to conform to the rule, would be so harsh and unseemly as to be an abuse of discretion.\n In this case a part of the testimony was stated in condensed and narrative form; but in the main the requirement respecting condensation and narration was wholly neglected. Much that was redundant or to no purpose was included; and document after document was set forth in full, where at most there was need for only a part. Plainly what was done was not in conformity with the rule or with its excepting clause. Thus the Circuit Court of Appeals was justified in declining to re-examine the evidence in the form in which it was stated.\n But in our opinion that court, instead of proceeding to determine the case without considering the evidence, should have accorded the appellants a further opportunity to have the evidence rightly brought into the record, and to that end should have remitted the transcript to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with the equity rule. The circumstances surrounding the non- \n\n[276 U.S. 305, 309]\n\u00a0\n observance of the rule were substantially identical with those in Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co. In both the evidence was stated and the statement was approved in accordance with the then prevailing practice in that circuit, to which the Circuit Court of Appeals impliedly was giving its sanction. That practice continued up to the time of that court's decision in Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co., which preceded its decision in this case only a few days. There was in this case the additional circumstance that, when the transcript was filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals, it was brought to the attention of one of the judges of that court, and he then made an order declaring that it was 'received as a sufficient compliance with the equity rules.' In the other case we directed that a further opportunity be given for complying with the rule, and we think the reasons assigned for that ruling are equally applicable here.\n The appellees suggest that the appellants were accorded such an opportunity after the Circuit Court of Appeals gave its decision and that the opportunity was waived. The court did make an order granting a rehearing and giving the appellants leave 'to withdraw the transcript' for a period of 30 days. The purpose in giving the leave was not stated but left to conjecture. Nothing was said about further proceedings in the District Court looking to a compliance with the rule or about a remission of the transcript. We think the mere leave to withdraw it was not enough. The fault was not in the transcript, but in the proceedings had in the District Court, whereby the evidence was attempted to be made a part of the record. That court hardly would have regarded the order as requiring it to take up those proceedings anew. The appellants were entitled to a specific order operating as a direction to the District Court. Apparently the Circuit Court of Appeals doubted its power in the premises and \n\n[276 U.S. 305, 310]\n\u00a0\n for that reason was not disposed to give such an order. We think the suggested waiver has no real basis.\n The record does not show whether the rehearing was had, but does show that the court made an order reciting that it adhered to its original opinion and directing that the decree entered thereon be re-entered.\n We come, then, to the terms upon which the appellants should be given further opportunity to get the evidence into the record in accordance with the rule. Of course they should be required to proceed with reasonable dispatch. In Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co. we directed that the appellant be required to pay a stated sum by way of reimbursing the appellee for counsel fees and expenses incurred in securing the elimination of the irregular and objectionable statement of evidence, and also to pay the costs in the Circuit Court of Appeals and in this court. There the appellee had objected in the Circuit Court of Appeals at the outset that the rule had not been complied with and therefore that the evidence could not be considered. Here the evidence was brought into the record in the irregular and objectionable form under an express stipulation between the parties, to which both adhered up to the time of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Thus both parties were at fault. In condemning the statement of the evidence the Circuit Court of Appeals acted on its own motion. In these circumstances we think the appellants should not be required to make any payment by way of reimbursing the appellees for counsel fees or expenses, and that each party should be left to pay its costs in this court and also its costs in the Circuit Court of Appeals up to the time our mandate is carried into effect there.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL INTERMEDIATE CREDIT BANK OF COLUMBIA, S.C., v. MITCHELL(1928)\nNo. 456\nArgued: March 13, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. D. W. Robinson, of Columbia S. C., for petitioner. \n\n[277 U.S. 213, 214]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George L. Buist, of Charleston, S. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is a Federal Intermediate Credit Bank chartered under an Act of March 4, 1923, c. 252, 42 Stat. 1454 (12 USCA  1021 et seq.). All its capital stock is owned by the United States. It sued in the federal court for the Eastern district of South Carolina to promissory notes. The bank is located promissory notes. The bank is located at Columbia, in that state. The defendants were citizens of the state and residents within the district. Jurisdiction was invoked on the ground that the suit is one where the matter in controversy arises under the laws of the United States. Section 21(1), Judicial Code; U. S. C. tit. 28,  41 (28 USCA  41(1)). The district court held that it was without jurisdiction and dismissed the case. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 21 F.(2d) 51.\n The judicial power of the United States extends to all cases arising under its Constitution and laws. Article 3. By section 1 of an Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, which in substance was carried into the Judicial Code as section 24(1), the district courts were given jurisdiction of all suits where the matter in controversy exceeds a specified amount and arises under federal law. A suit by or against a corporation created under an act of Congress is one arising under the laws of the United States. Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 816; American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350\n, 41 S. Ct. 499; Sowell v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n268 \nU.S. 449\n, 45 S. Ct. 528. State citizenship does not result from the mere creation of a corporation under federal law. Bankers' Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific Ry., \n241 \nU.S. 295, 309\n, 36 S. Ct. 569. Section 201(c) of the act (12 USCA  1023) under which petitioner was organized provides that each such bank 'for purposes of jurisdiction shall be deemed a citizen of the state where it is located.' Sec- \n\n[277 U.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n tion 12 of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 941, declares that no District Court shall have jurisdiction of any suit by or against any corporation upon the ground that it was incorporated by or under an act of Congress: 'Provided, that this section shall not apply to any suit ... brought by or against a corporation incorporated by or under an act of Congress wherein the government of the United States is the owner of more than one-half of its capital stock.' U. S. C. tit. 28,  42 (28 USCA  42).\n The lower courts, erroneously conceiving that section 201(c) is in respect of Federal Intermediate Credit Banks the equivalent of section 24( 16) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41(16)) applying to national banking associations, held that the former operates to take suits by or against petitioner out of the general rule, and that the proviso in the Act of February 13, 1925, does not apply to it. That conclusion resulted from a misunderstanding of the decision in Herrmann v. Edwards, \n238 \nU.S. 107\n, 35 S. Ct. 839. That was a suit brought in the United States court by a stockholder of a national bank against its directors to compel them to reimburse the bank for funds wrongfully diverted. It was a controversy arising under the laws of the United States within the meaning of section 24(1); and, if that provision stood alone, the District Court would have had jurisdiction. But section 4 of the Act of July 12, 1882, c. 290, 22 Stat. 162, 163 (Comp. St.  9668), declared that jurisdiction of such suits, except those between a bank and the United States or its officers and agents, 'shall be the same as, and not other than, the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States which do or might do banking business where such national banking associations may be doing business when such suits may be begun.' Section 4 of the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, 554 ( re-enacted August 13, 1888, 25 Stat. 433, 436), provided that national banking associations should for the purposes of all actions by or against them 'be deemed citizens of \n\n[277 U.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n the states in which they are respectively located; and in such cases the Circuit and District Courts shall not have jurisdiction other than such as they would have in cases between individual citizens of the same state'; and it declared that the provisions of the section should not affect jurisdiction of federal courts in cases commenced by the United States or by direction of an officer thereof or in cases for winding up such banks. Section 24(16) of the Judicial Code gives District Courts original jurisdiction of all cases commenced by the United States or by direction of any officer thereof against any national banking association and of cases for winding up any such bank, and of all suits brought by any banking association to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency or any receiver acting under his direction. And it provides that all such banking associations 'shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them ... be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.' This court held that, as to suits not within the specified exceptions, national banks were by the acts of 1882 and 1887 put on the same basis in respect of jurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an act of Congress, and that as to such suits federal incorporation was not a ground for jurisdiction. That conclusion rests upon the direct and affirmative expression of these acts. And the decision makes it plain that while section 24(16) adopted a different form of expression, it was in substance a re-enactment of the earlier provisions in respect of such jurisdiction. The provisions of the Judicial Code are to be construed as continuations of existing statutes, and no change of intent is to be implied unless clearly made manifest. Section 294, Judicial Code (28 USCA  432 note). The Judicial Code did not restore jurisdiction that the acts of 1882 and 1887 had taken away.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 213, 217]\n\u00a0\n The state citizenship granted by section 201(c) governs the places where suit may be brought against such banks. Section 51, Judicial Code, U. S. C. tit. 28,  112 (28 USCA  112). Cf. Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 444\n, 12 S. Ct. 935; In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., \n160 \nU.S. 221, 229\n, 16 S. Ct. 273; Matter of Dunn, \n212 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 29 S. Ct. 299. But it is in no wise inconsistent with the general rule that District Courts have jurisdiction of suits brought by or against corporations organized under an act of Congress on the ground that they are controversies arising under federal law. It is firmly established that, in the absence of enactments plainly expressing that purpose, Congress will not be held to have intended to restrict that jurisdiction. Herrmann v. Edwards, supra, 118 (35 S. Ct. 839); Bankers' Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific Ry., supra, 303 (36 S. Ct. 569). That Congress is accustomed to use direct and unmistakable language to effect such important changes in the law is well illustrated by the acts of 1882 and 1887; by section 5 of the Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, 38 Stat. 803, 804 (Comp. St.  1233a), providing that no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any suit by or against any railroad company upon the ground that such company was incorporated under an act of Congress, and by section 12 of the Act of February 13, 1925. The government owns all the capital stock of petitioner and suits by or against it are plainly within the reasons which prompted the enactment of the proviso in section 12. There is no warrant for an inference that by section 201(c) Congress intended to take suits by or against Federal Intermediate Credit Banks out of the general rule.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFERRY v. RAMSEY(1928)\nNo. 407\nArgued: April 25, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n Mr. L. J. Bond, of El Dorado, Kan., for plaintiff in error ferry.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. M. Brewster and John L. Hunt, both of Topeka, Kan., and Bruce A. Campbell, of East St. Louis, Ill., for plaintiff in error Harris. \n\n[277 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n Mr. K. M. Geddes, of El Dorado, Kan., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These writs of error are brought by Ferry, formerly a director of the Butler County State Bank, of Kansas, and by the executor of a deceased director, to set aside judgments against them in suits by depositors in the bank, on the ground that the statutes of Kansas purporting to establish the directors' liability were contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The statutes were upheld by the State Court. Ramsey v. Adams, 122 Kan. 675, 253 P. 416; Id., 122 Kan. 691, 253 P. 423.\n The plaintiffs (the defendants in error) made deposits in the bank at a time when it was insolvent but had not closed its doors. The statutes under which the directors were held liable to depositors and which are attacked here are Revised Statutes of Kansas, 1923, chapter 9, pars. 163, 164. The former of these makes it unlawful for any director to assent to the reception of deposits by his bank after he shall have had knowledge of the fact that it is insolvent. The law makes it the duty of the directors to examine into the affairs of the bank, and, if possible, to know its condition, and in case of his failure to do as required, he is to be held to have had knowledge of the insolvency of the bank, and is made 'individually responsible for such deposits so received.' By 9-164, in suits for deposits against officers 'the fact that such banking institution was so insolvent or in failing circumstances at the time of the reception of the deposit charged to have been so received, ... shall be prima facie evidence of such knowledge and assent to such deposit ... on the part of such officer, ... so charged therewith.' It is said that 163 denies due pro- \n\n[277 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n cess of law by creating a conclusive presumption of knowledge from ignorance and by implying that the director knowingly assented to a deposit that he should not have received, of which in fact he knew nothing. As to 164 it is said that facts are made prima facie evidence of other facts that they have no rational tendency to prove. The law as construed by the Supreme Court of Kansas meets its severest test in the cases against the executor of Kramer, because Kramer, although not so ignorant or incapable of knowledge as thought by the court of first instance, was seriously ill at the time of the deposits and seemed to have much to be said in his behalf, if the actual state of his knowledge had any relevancy as an excuse.\n It is said that the liability is founded by the statute upon the directors' assent to the deposit and that when this is the ground the assent cannot be proved by artificial presumptions that have no warrant from experience. But the short answer is that the statute might have made the directors personally liable to depositors in every case, if it had been so minded, and that if it had purported to do so, whoever accepted the office would assume the risk. The statute in short imposed a liability that was less than might have been imposed, and that being so, the thing to be considered is the result reached, not the possibly inartificial or clumsy way of reaching it. If without any mention of assent or presumptions or prima facie evidence the statute had said: Every director of a bank shall be personally liable to depositors for every deposit accepted by the bank after it has become insolvent all objections would be met by the answer, You took the office on those terms. The statute would be none the worse if it allowed a defence in the single case of the defendants having made an honest examination and having been led to believe that the bank was solvent. The mention of assent and evidence of knowledge cannot be pressed to conclusions that the statute manifestly does \n\n[277 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n not allow. The conclusions that, as construed by the State Court, it does impose, it imposes however much it may cut down the significance of the assent or knowledge to which it refers. As a matter of law there is nothing new in charging a party with knowledge of what it is his duty to know, in this case the insolvency of the bank, or with assent to deposits that he must expect while the bank's doors remain open. But the essential thing is that whether in a roundabout or a perfectly natural way the statute has said if you take the office you must take the consequences of knowledge whether you have it or not. In most contracts men take the risk of events over which they have imperfect or no control. The acceptance of a directorship is as voluntary an act as a contract.\n The Supreme Court of Kansas affirmed judgments against Ferry and reversed judgments in favor of the executor of Kramer based on Kramer's incapacity to know of or assent to the deposits in question and ordered judgments against him. In so doing it violated no provision of the Constitution of the United States.\n Judgments affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n In respect of the prima facie presumption created by section 9-164 of the Kansas statute, I am unable to agree with the opinion of the court in so far as that section affects the cases against Harris, executor of the will of Kramer, deceased. The evidence shows very clearly that, at the time the deposits in question were made and for a long time prior thereto, Kramer was physically incapable of investigating and ascertaining the condition of the bank, or of assenting to the reception of deposits by the bank, because of his serious illness which resulted in his death after undergoing a major surgical operation. It was substantially so found by the jury in one of the cases and by the trial court in the others. Under these circumstances, \n\n[277 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n the application of the statutory presumption was obviously injurious. Section 9-163 provides that it shall be unlawful for any president, director, etc., to assent to the reception of deposits, etc., after he shall have had knowledge of the fact that the bank is insolvent. Section 9- 164, which creates the objectionable presumption, provides that:\n'The fact that such banking institution was so insolvent or in failing circumstances at the time of the reception of the deposit charged to have been so received, ... shall be prima facie evidence of such ... assent to such deposit, ... on the part of such officer. ...'\n\n Of course, the state may provide that proof of one fact shall be prima facie evidence of another; but this can be done consistently with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only where there is a rational relation between the two facts. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 31 S. Ct. 145; McFarland v. American Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 36 S. Ct. 498. In the latter case this court said, quoting from Mobile, J. & K. C. R. R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 138, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463:\n'It is 'essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.\"\n\n To me it seems clear that there is no rational relation between the fact of insolvency to the reception of a particular deposit. to the reception of a particular deposit. Rather, the rational presumption is the other way, since the law itself requires that an insolvent bank shall not receive deposits; and the assent of the director thereto would be an assent to a violation of law. I do not quarrel with the suggestion that it was within the constitutional power of the state to create an absolute liability against a director if, while insolvent, the bank of which he is a director receive a deposit. But this the state did not do. \n\n[277 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n Instead, it adopted a statute creating a liability only in case the director assents to the deposit; and I should have supposed the liability of the director must be measured by what the state has enacted and not by what it had the power to enact. Under such a statute, without more, it is perfectly plain that proof by the state of such assent would be necessary. But here the state by legislative fiat substituted for such proof on its part the prima facie presumption set forth. It was said that the bank was open and doing business and that it is a reasonable presumption from that fact that assent was given to the receipt of particular deposits. But we are dealing with a specific statutory provision and must take it as we find it; and by that provision the general transaction of business by the bank at the time it received the particular deposits is not made the basis of the statutory presumption. If it were, a different question would be presented. Under these circumstances, as it seems to me, the rule, requiring a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact to be presumed therefrom, plainly applies; and consequently the statutory provision in question is void.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice SANFORD concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFINANCE & GUARANTY CO. v. OPPENHIMER(1928)\nNo. 170\nArgued: January 13, 1928Decided: January 23, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 10, 11]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. M. Brandt, of Norfolk, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph M. Hurt, of Richmond, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the respondent, trustee in bankruptcy for W. A. Lee, to recover the value of four authomobiles seized by the defendant, the petitioner, in circumstances alleged to have made the taking a preference if maintained. The defendant sold the automobiles to the bankrupt by a duly recorded contract of conditional sale. On January 10, 1921, it repossessed itself of the cars by a suit in detinue. Ten days later, on January 20, the petition in bankruptcy was filed against Lee, and on February 25 he was adjudicated a bankrupt. About a year later the trustee brought this suit relying upon the Traders' Act, section 5224 of the Code of Virginia, by which, it may be assumed, all the property used by Lee in his business, including these cars, 'shall as to the creditors of any such person, be liable for the debts of such person.' The trustee prevailed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Opinion, 5 F.(2d) 486; formal conclusion, 15 F.(2d) 1011. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n273 \nU.S. 689\n, 47 S. Ct. 460.\n We are of opinion that the decision was wrong for the reason given by the dissenting judge below. The Su- \n\n[276 U.S. 10, 12]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of Appeals of Virginia has construed the Traders' Act and has established that 'the creditors' in section 5224 means creditors having a line. Capitol Motor Corporation v. Lasker, 138 Va. 630, 123 S. E. 376. The lien of the trustee in bankruptcy did not arise until after the property in question had come back to the hands of the petitioner, which had reserved title to itself. Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., \n239 \nU.S. 268, 270\n, 36 S. Ct. 50; Martin v. Commercial National Bank, \n245 \nU.S. 513, 517\n, 38 S. Ct. 176; Bankruptcy Act,  47a(2), as amended (Code, tit. 11,  75). Therefore the retaking of the property was valid as against the trustee. It could not work a preference unless he represented a claim that was paramount when the property was seized. At that time the petitioner did what it had a right to do as against the bankrupt and simply took what was its own. It did no wrong to any creditor, for no creditor not having a judgment or other lien could have complained so far as the law of Virginia went. See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Cross (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 417, 421, 422. The majority in the Circuit Court of Appeals took the distinction between a trustee under a conventional deed of trust for the benefit of creditors and a trustee in bankruptcy, that the former has no power to vacate preferences. But, as we have implied, a party holding security does not create a preference by taking possession under it within four months if he lawfully may under the law of the State. Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 \nU.S. 516\n, 25 S. Ct. 306; Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 \nU.S. 91\n, 25 S. Ct. 567.\n We understand it to be admitted that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for seven hundred dollars for property not covered by the petitioner's title, that amount having been allowed by the District Court, although it held as we do that the seizure was lawful. We follow the judgment in that respect. With this understanding the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIREMEN'S INS. CO. OF NEWARK, N.J. v.

Appellees, defendants below, are public officers in Louisiana charged with the duty of enforcing Act No. 103, known as the 'Shrimp Act,' passed in July, 1926; so far as material here, it is printed in the margin. \n1\n Plaintiffs sued to enjoin enforcement of certain \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n of its provisions on the ground, among others, that they violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The district judge granted a restraining order pending application for a temporary injunction. There was a hearing before the court, consisting of three judges, organized as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code, U. S. C. tit. 28,  380; it set aside the restraining order and denied the injunction. Then the court allowed this appeal, found that the plaintiffs will sustain irreparable harm and damage, and stayed the enforcement of the act pending determination here.\n The case has not been tried and the sole question is whether, having regard to the particular facts and circumstances, the lower court's refusal to grant a temporary injunction was contrary to some rule of equity or the re-\n___ and after the edible portions of the abdomen popularly called tail meat of said shrimp shall have been removed from the shell, within the state of Louisiana, such lawful taker or possessor, his heirs or assigns, as the case may be, shall be vested with all of the rights and property of the state in and to said shrimp tail meat and shall have the right to sell such shrimp tail meat or ship the same beyond the limit of the state, without restriction or reservation.\n'It shall be the duty of all licensees operating under the Department of Conservation in the shrimp industry in this state to conserve for fertilizer purposes all shells or hulls and heads of salt water shrimp and to report monthly, on blanks to be furnished by the Department of Conservation, the quantity thereof on hand, to the Department of Conservation. It shall be unlawful to export from the state of Louisiana any raw shells or hulls and heads of salt water shrimp as they are required to be manufactured into fertilizer or used for an element in chicken feed. When the shrimp hulls or shells and heads shall have been conserved for the purposes herein stated, the right of property therein theretofore existing in the state shall pass to the lawful taker or the possessor thereof. Any person, firm or corporation violating the provisions of this section shall be liable to the penalties hereinafter imposed.' \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n sult of improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S. Ct. 463.\n\n A brief statement of the allegations of the complaint follows. The Foster Company is a Louisiana corporation and operates a shrimp hulling plant in that state. It gets shrimp from the tidal waters in the 'Louisiana marshes.' The Sea Food Company is a Mississippi corporation and cans and packs shrimp in its plant at Biloxi in that state. Its product is shipped and sold in interstate commerce. The Foster Company and the Sea Food Company have a contract by which the former agrees to catch in Louisiana waters and deliver to the latter in Biloxi a carload of raw shrimp per month during specified periods. The sup- \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n ply is intended for the interstate and foreign business of the Sea Food Company; and, if prevented from obtaining such shrimp, the business of that company will be destroyed and its plant will be of no value.\n There are located at Biloxi plants comprising about one-fourth of the shrimp canning industry in the United States. The waters of Mississippi do not contain an adequate supply of shrimp and practically all that are packed there come from the Louisiana marshes. Shrimp are taken by nets dragged by power boats, and are then put on larger vessels and transported to Biloxi. To prepare the meat for canning, the heads and hulls are picked off; most of them are thrown into the water where they are consumed by scavengers of the sea. But some are made into 'shrimp bran,' which is used to a small extent in the manufacture of commercial fertilizer.\n The act declares all shrimp and parts thereof in Louisiana waters to be the property of the state, and regulates their taking and reduction to private ownership. It grants the right to take, can, pack, and dry shrimp to residents and also to corporations, domiciled or organized in the state, operating a canning or packing factory or drying platform therein. Section 4. It is made unlawful to export from the state any shrimp from which the heads and hulls have not been removed. But, in order that all its inhabitants 'may enjoy the state's natural food product,' the act declares it lawful to ship unshelled shrimp to any point within the state. Whoever shall lawfully take shrimp from the waters is granted a qualified interest which may be sold within the state. And, when the tail meat is removed within the state, the taker or possessor has title and the right to sell and ship the same 'beyond the limit(s) of the state, without restriction or reservation.' It is declared unlawful to export from the state any raw shells or hulls and heads 'as they are required to be manufactured into fertilizer or used for an element \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n in chicken feed.' But, when they have been 'conserved for the purposes herein stated, the right of property therein theretofore existing in the state shall pass to the lawful taker or the possessor thereof.' Section 13. Penalties are prescribed for violations. Section 19.\n And the complaint alleges that for years shrimp taken from Louisiana waters has been shipped out of the state unshelled; that only a negligible amount of hulls and heads of such shrimp as are consumed within the state has ever been used as fertilizer; that the declared purpose to conserve them is a subterfuge. And plaintiffs state that, notwithstanding their willingness to pay all charges, licenses and taxes imposed and to comply with all the valid requirements, defendants, if not enjoined, will prevent plaintiffs from taking or acquiring shrimp from Louisiana waters to their great and irreparable loss.\n At the hearing on their motion for a temporary injunction, plaintiffs presented affidavits which tend to show the facts following. By reason of favorable topographical, climatic, labor and other conditions, shrimp taken from the Louisiana marshes may be more conveniently and economically canned at Biloxi than in Louisiana near to the source of supply. The Biloxi plants have long constituted an important center of the industry, and they are largely dependent upon the Louisiana marshes for their supply. The enforcement of the act would injure or destroy the shrimp business of plaintiffs and the industry at Biloxi. About 95 per cent. of the shrimp obtained from the waters of Louisiana, when taken, is intended for consumption outside the state. Some shrimp bran is made from the hulls and heads in Louisiana; but all of it is shipped to Biloxi, where it is used to make fertilizer. It is worth less than 1 per cent. of the value of the shrimp. Not more than half the hulls and heads removed in Louisiana is used for any purpose. They have no market value, cannot be sold or given away, and often constitute a nuisance. \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n The facts alleged in the complaint, the details set forth in plaintiffs' affidavits and the provisions of the act to be restrained show that the conservation of hulls and heads is a feigned and not the real purpose. They support plaintiffs' contention that the purpose of the enactment is to prevent the interstate movement of raw shrimp from the Louisiana marshes to the plants at Biloxi in order through commercial necessity to bring about the removal of the packing and canning industries from Mississippi to Louisiana. The conditions imposed by the act upon the interstate movement of the meat and other products of shrimp are not intended and do not operate to conserve them for the use of the people of the state.\n One challenging the validity of a state enactment on the ground that it is repugnant to the commerce clause is not necessarily bound by the legislative declarations of purpose. It is open to him to show that in their practical operation its provisions directly burden or destroy interstate commerce. Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 319\n, 10 S. Ct. 862; Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 11 S. Ct. 213. In determining what is interstate commerce, courts look to practical considerations and the established course of business. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Ct. 276; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50, 59\n, 42 S. Ct. 244; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 309\n, 44 S. Ct. 96; Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n268 \nU.S. 189, 198\n, 200 S., 45 S. Ct. 481. Interstate commerce includes more than transportation; it embraces all the component parts of commercial intercourse among states. And a state statute that operates directly to burden any of its essential elements is invalid. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 106; Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Co., supra, \n268 U.S. 199\n (45 S. Ct. 481). A state is without power to prevent privately owned articles of trade from being shipped and sold in interstate commerce on the ground that they are required to satisfy local demands or because they are needed by the people of the state. Penna. v. West Vir- \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n ginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 596\n, 43 S. Ct. 658, 32 A. L. R. 300; Oklahoma v. Kansas Nat. Gas Co., \n221 \nU.S. 229, 255\n, 31 S. Ct. 564, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1193\n\n\n The authority of the state to regulate and control the common property in game is well established. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 U.S. 519\n, and cases cited at page 528 (16 S. Ct. 600, 604). These and many other cases show that the state owns, or has power to control, the game and fish within its borders not absolutely or as proprietor or for its own use or benefit but in its sovereign capacity as representative of the people. In Geer v. Connecticut the court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, said (161 U. S. at page 529 (16 S. Ct. 604)):\n'Whilst the fundamental principles upon which the common property in game rests have undergone no change, the development of free institutions has led to the recognition of the fact that the power or control lodged in the state, resulting from this common ownership, is to be exercised, like all other powers of government, as a trust for the benefit of the people, and not as a prerogative for the advantage of the government, as distinct from the people, or for the benefit of private individuals as distinguished from the public good. Therefore, for the purpose of exercising this power, the state, as held by this court in Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. (367) 410 (10 L. Ed. 997), represents its people, and the ownership is that of the people in their united sovereignty.'\n\n In Lacoste v. Dept. of Conservation, La., \n263 U.S. 545\n, at page 549, 44 S. Ct. 186, 187 (68 L. Ed. 437), we said:\n'The wild animals within its borders are, so far as capable of ownership, owned by the state in its sovereign capacity for the common benefit of all its people. Because of such ownership, and in the exercise of its police power, the state may regulate and control the taking, subsequent use and property rights that may be acquired therein.'\n\n Defendants rely on Geer v. Connecticut to sustain their contention that the act forbidding the shipping of raw and unshelled shrimp out of the state was not in conflict with the commerce clause. The statute of Connecticut \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n declared it unlawful to kill or possess any woodcock, ruffled grouse, or quail for transportation or to transport them beyond the limits of the state. The question was whether the state had power to regulate the killing of game so as wholly to confine its use within the limits of the state. No part of the game was permitted by the statute to become an article of interstate commerce. merce. The court said (161 U. S. at page 529 (16 S. Ct. 604)) that the sole consequence of the provision was 'to confine the use of such game to those who own it, the people of that state' and that (161 U. S. at page 530 (16 S. Ct. 605)), 'in view of the authority of the state to affix conditions to the killing and sale of game , ... it may well be doubted whether commerce is created by an authority given by a state to reduce game within its borders to possession, provided such game be not taken, when killed, without the jurisdiction of the state . ... Passing, however, as we do, the decision of this question, and granting that the dealing in game killed within the State, ... created internal State commerce, it does not follow that such internal commerce became necessarily the subject-matter of interstate commerce, and therefore under the control of the Constitution of the United States. ...' 161 U. S. at page 522 (16 S. Ct. 605): 'The fact that internal commerce may be distinct from interstate commerce, destroys the whole theory upon which the argument of the plaintiff in error proceeds.'\n But that case is essentially unlike this one. The purpose of the Louisiana enactment differs radically from the Connecticut law there upheld. It authorizes the shrimp meat and bran, canned and manufactured within the state, freely to be shipped and sold in interstate commerce. The state does not require any part of the shrimp to be retained for consumption or use therein. Indeed only a small part is consumed or needed within the state. Consistently with the act all may be, and in fact nearly all is, caught for transportation and sale in interstate \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n commerce. As to such shrimp the protection of the commerce clause attaches at the time of the taking. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, supra; Penna. v. West Virginia, supra, \n262 U.S. 596\n et seq. 43 S. Ct. 658, 32 A. L. R. 300. As the representative of its people, the state might have retained the shrimp for consumption and use therein. But, in direct opposition to conservation for intrastate use, this enactment permits all parts of the shrimp to be shipped and sold outside the state. The purpose is not to retain the shrimp for the use of the people of Louisiana; it is to favor the canning of the meat and the manufacture of bran in Louisiana by withholding raw or unshelled shrimp from the Biloxi plants. But by permitting its shrimp to be taken and all the products thereof to be shipped and sold in interstate commerce, the state necessarily releases its hold and, as to the shrimp so taken, definitely terminates its control. Clearly such authorization and the taking in pursuance thereof put an end to the trusts upon which the state is deemed to own or control the shrimp for the benefit of its people. And those taking the shrimp under the authority of the act necessarily thereby become entitled to the rights of private ownership and the protection of the commerce clause. They are not bound to comply with, or estopped from objecting to, the enforcement of, conditions that conflict with the Constitution of the United States. Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553; Power Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 497 S., 47 S. Ct. 678; Hanover Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 507\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713.\n If the facts are substantially as claimed by plaintiffs, the practical operation and effect of the provisions complained of will be directly to obstruct and burden interstate commerce. Penna. v. West Virginia, supra; Oklahoma v. Kansas Nat. Gas Co., supra. The affidavits give substantial and persuasive support to the facts alleged. And as, pending the trial and determination of the case, \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs will suffer great and irremediable loss if the challenged provisions shall be enforced, their right to have a temporary injunction is plain. From the record it quite clearly appears that the lower court's refusal was an improvident exercise of judicial discretion.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Separate Opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n I think the court below properly applied the correct doctrine and that the challenged decree should be affirmed.\n In Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519, 529\n, 534 S., 16 S. Ct. 600, this court upheld legislation by the state which permitted woodcock, ruffled grouse and quail to be killed for transportation and sale within her borders but forbade the killing or possession of such birds when dead for transportation to other states. It accepted the rule relative to dominion over animals ferae naturae as stated in Ex parte Maier, 103 Cal. 476, 37 P. 402, 42 Am. St. Rep. 129:\n'The wild game within a state belongs to the people in their collective sovereign capacity. It is not the subject of private ownership, except in so far as the people may elect to make it so; and they may, if they see fit, absolutely prohibit the taking of it, or traffic and commerce in it, if it is deemed necessary for the protection or preservation of the public good.'\n\n And, commenting upon certain opinions which denied the validity of statutes whereby shipments of game beyond the state were prohibited, it said:\n'... But the reasoning which controlled the decision of these cases is, we think, inconclusive, from the fact that it did not consider the fundamental distinction between the qualified ownership in game and the perfect nature of ownership in other property, and thus overlooked the authority of the state over property in game killed within its con- \n\n[278 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n fines, and the consequent power of the state to follow such property into whatever hands it might pass with the conditions and restrictions deemed necessary for the public interest.'\n\n Manifestly, Louisiana has full power absolutely to forbid interstate shipments of shrimp taken within her territory. These crustaceans belong to her and she may appropriate them for the exclusive use and benefit of citizens. If the state should conclude that the best interests of her people requires all shrimp to be canned or manufactured therein before becoming part of interstate commerce, nothing in the Federal Constitution would prevent appropriate action to that end. This would not interfere with any right guaranteed to an outsider. How wild life may be utilized in order to advantage her own citizens is for the producing state to determine. To enlarge opportunity for employment is one way, and often the most effective way, to promote their welfare.\n Certainly, I cannot accept the notion that the record discloses any subterfuge-something resorted to for concealment-by Louisiana. And I think no weight should be given to the gratuitous allegation of such purpose by nonresidents who are seeking to defeat control by the state in order that they may secure benefits for themselves from wild life found therein.\n Any profitable discussion of this controversy must take into consideration the marked distinction between game and property subject to absolute ownership. Cases like Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106, which concern property of the latter kind are not persuasive here. A state may regulate the sale and transportation of wild things in ways not permissible where wheat is the subject-matter. Geer v. Connecticut, supra; Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 41\n, 29 S.

STATE OF WASHINGTON(1928)\nNo. 841\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 81, 82]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. P. Guthrie, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Ewing D. Colvin, of Seattle, Wash., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant was charged by information with the crime of murder in the first degree in the superior court of King county in the state of Washington. The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty as charged, and a finding by the jury that the death penalty should be inflicted. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were made and overruled, and the judgment was entered upon the verdict.\n The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of the state. That court, after a consideration of the errors claimed to have been committed on the trial, affirmed the judgment and sentence. 144 Wash. 446, 258 P. 508. Final judgment was entered January 18, 1928. On February 6, 1928, a petition for a writ of error from this court was presented to the Chief \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 83]\n\u00a0\n Justice of the Supreme Court of the state. He allowed the writ, and it was accordingly issued. In accordance with our practice, the clerk brought to the attention of the court the fact that this was a criminal case, and was therefore to be expedited. An examination of the assignments of error and the record disclosed that the writ of error was improvidently allowed. The only law under which such a writ of error would lie was section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 (chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937; 28 USCA  344(a), which read as follows:\n'A final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a state in which decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, and the decision is against its validity; or where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.'\n\n The record and the assignments of error do not show that there was here drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, or the validity of a statute of the state of Washington on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. It followed that the writ of error would have to be dismissed. Thereupon the court entered, March 19, 1928, a rule against the plaintiff in error, Wallace C. Gaines, to show cause before this court on April 23d, why, treating the writ of error inadvertently allowed in this cause as a petition for writ of certiorari herein, certiorari should not be denied for lack of a substantial federal question in the record giving this court jurisdiction. \n276 \nU.S. 607\n, 48 S. Ct. 339, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The order to show cause was issued in view of section 237(c) of the Code of Judicial Procedure, as amended by \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n the Act of February 13, 1925 (chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938; 28 USCA  344(c). That paragraph is as follows:\n'If a writ of error be improvidently sought and allowed under this section in a case where the proper mode of invoking a review is by a petition for certiorari, this alone shall not be a ground for dismissal; but the papers whereon the writ of error was allowed shall be regarded and acted on as a petition for certiorari and as if duly presented to the Supreme Court at the time they were presented to the court or judge by whom the writ of error was allowed: Provided, that where in such a case there appears to be no reasonable ground for granting a petition for certiorari it shall be competent for the Supreme Court to adjudge to the respondent reasonable damages for his delay, and single or double costs, as provided in section 1010 of the Revised Statutes.'\n\n In obedience to the rule, the petitioner, Wallace C. Gaines, has filed a return, in which he avers that the first federal question upon which he asks a writ of certiorari arises because of the action of the trial judge, as shown by the record as follows:\n'At the close of the afternoon session on the ninth day of the trial, to wit, August 11th, Judge Jones, the trial judge, said:\n\n\"Before adjourning, I will state that the atmosphere is pretty unbearable. I know the jury must also feel it. I assume there is a certain part of the members of the bar who from the standpoint of students desire to hear the testimony, but with those exceptions, court officers, and members of the bar, the general public will be excluded beginning tomorrow.\"\n\n This action, the return alleges, was a violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the same Constitution, and that this error \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n was duly urged in the trial court and the state Supreme Court, on both grounds.\n The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides in part that-\n'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.'\n\n Many state Constitutions contain a substantially similar guaranty and restriction. The question what constitutes a public trial the right to which is thus guaranteed and what discretion a court may exercise in limiting the audience and spectators is one upon which the cases differ. Two views are given in Reagan v. United States (C. C. A.) 202 F. 488, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 583, and Davis v. United States (C. C. A.) 247 F. 394, L. R. A. 1918C, 1164, in both of which many state cases are cited. According to some of them, the order complained of here would be regarded as erroneous, while in others it would be held to be within the judicial discretion of the court.\n But we are relieved from considering or reconciling the different views taken in these cases by the fact that the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution does not apply to the trial of criminal prosecutions by a state. It has been well settled for years that the first ten amendments apply only to the procedure and trial of causes in the federal courts, and are not limitations upon those in state courts. Spies v. Illinois, \n123 \nU.S. 131, 166\n, 8 S. Ct. 22, and cases cited.\n It is contended, however, that due process of law exacted in the Fourteenth Amendment in causes tried in state courts must be construed as equivalent to the Sixth Amendment in federal trials. The question has not arisen in any case cited to us. It would involve a consideration of whether due process requires more than a trial that is not private or secret, or whether due process would not be satisfied except by such a restriction upon the discretion of the court in regulating attendance as the defend- \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n ant here insists upon and as is held in some of the authorities cited above in enforcing the Sixth Amendment and similar constitutional provisions of an affirmative character. But we need not pass on that question now.\n For even if the due process clause requires the same kind of public trial as that contended for by the petitioner, the record does not disclose facts which would justify us in bringing the case before us for our review. The order of the court complained of was oral only. No formal order was entered, neither was there a minute entry nor a specific mention to any particular officer to see that it was executed so far as the record discloses. The state before the Supreme Court contended that the order to exclude the general public was never executed. This was an issue of fact before both Washington courts. After the fullest examination of affidavits filed by both sides upon the motion for a new trial, the state Supreme Court's conclusion was as follows:\n'Believing that the statement of the court was not carried out, but that the general public were admitted to the courtroom to the extent of its seating capacity during the trial, the rights of the appellant as guaranteed by the Constitution of this state and by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States were not invaded.'\n\n From an examination of the record, we find no reason for rejecting this conclusion of fact reached by the unanimous judgment of that court.\n Another question raised on behalf of the defendant concerns the filing of the information for murder by the prosecuting attorney. Prosecution by information instead of by indictment is provided for by the laws of Washington. This is not a violation of the Federal Constitution. Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S. Ct. 111, 292. Some objection is made to the filing of the information because made pend- \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 87]\n\u00a0\n ing the investigation by the coroner and because the prosecuting attorney was in 'a rage.' The law of Washington prescribes no connection between the two inquiries. The objection is frivolous.\n Then it is contended that the defendant was not personally present or was not in a place where he could hear the evidence. There is nothing in the record of the proceedings of the trial to support such a claim. No objection or exception was taken during the trial on this ground. It is based on affidavits filed in the case after the state Supreme Court had affirmed the conviction. This was much too late. Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 340\n, 35 S. Ct. 582.\n A contention is also made that the presence of defendant at all times at the trial was not affirmatively shown by the record. The record was not well made up, but it contains daily entries showing 'all parties and counsel present' during the trial. This certainly complies with due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n All the other objections said to involve federal questions are equally frivolous. Nothing in the record warrants us in granting a writ of certiorari.\n It has not been the practice of the court to write opinions and state its reasons for denying writs of certiorari, and this opinion is not to be regarded as indicating an intention to adopt that practice, but, in view of the fact that the court has deemed it wise to initiate a practice for speedily disposing of criminal cases in which there is no real basis for jurisdiction in this court, it was thought proper to make an exception here, not to be repeated, and write an opinion.\n The character of the case is such that we should proceed under rule 31, as amended May 2, 1927 (\n274 U.S. 766\n), and shorten the time for issuing the mandate as provided therein, and order that the mandate and notice of the rul- \n\n[277 U.S. 81, 88]\n\u00a0\n ing herein be issued forthwith to the Supreme Court of the state of Washington for further proceeding.\n The order will be entered dismissing the writ of error and denying the application for a certiorari. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEO. O. RICHARDSON MACHINERY CO. v. SCOTT(1928)\nNo. 198\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. D. H. Linebaugh and Paul Pinson, both of Muskogee, Okl., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Jean H. Everest and Charles L. Moore, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Oklahoma provides that, if a foreign corporation doing business within the state fails to appoint an agent upon whom service may be made, process served upon the secretary of state shall be sufficient to give jurisdiction of the person to any court having jurisdiction of \n\n[276 U.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n the subject-matter. Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921,  5436, 5442\n\n\n In September, 1920, Scott, a resident of Oklahoma, brought in a district court of the state an action of contract against the Geo. O. Richardson Machinery Company, a Missouri corporation. He alleged in his petition that the defendant was a foreign corporation doing business in Oklahoma and that it had failed to appoint an agent upon whom process might be served. He asked leave to serve the summons upon the secretary of state as provided in the statute. There was a praecipe for summons pursuant to the statute; the summons issued, and it was served as in the statute provided. The defendant having failed to enter an appearance within the time limited, judgment by default was, in October, 1920, entered for the amount claimed.\n In July, 1921, which was after the expiration of the term at which the judgment was entered, the corporation filed what it called a 'special appearance and motion to quash summons and service thereof and to set aside and vacate judgment.' The motion set forth that the corporation had not had actual notice of the action or the judgment; that, for this reason, it had not had an opportunity to defend; that it had and has a valid defense to the cause of action sued on; that it is not indebted to the plaintiff in any amount; and that, if it had had notice, it would have interposed a defense. It alleged further that it had never engaged in business within the State; that it does, and has done, with residents of Oklahoma a purely interstate business; that the secretary of state was not by contract or law its agent upon whom service could be made; that the statute authorizing service upon the secretary of state was, as applied to it, a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that the trial court had no jurisdiction. It prayed that the \n\n[276 U.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n summons and return be quashed and that the judgment rendered be set aside.\n The proceedings which followed the filing of this motion to quash and vacate extend over a period of more than six years. The report of them occupies more than 200 pages of the printed record. Immediately after filing the motion, the corporation sought from the state district court, and obtained, an order removing the cause to the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship. There the case was heard on the motion to quash the summons and vacate the judgment. On April 27, 1922, after proceedings which it is unnecessary to detail, the federal court remanded the cause to the state court, because the petition for removal had not been filed in time.\n On June 1, 1922, the case came on for hearing in the state court on the motion to quash the summons and to set aside the judgment. The motion was overruled; and exceptions were allowed. Then the corporation was granted leave to file instanter a petition, under section 810 of the Compiled Statutes of 1921, to vacate the judgment. That section provides that the district court shall have power in nine classes of cases to vacate or modify its own judgments or orders, at or after the term at which such judgment or order was made. Among these are:\n'Fourth. For fraud, practiced by the successful party, in obtaining the judgment or order,' and 'Seventh. For unavoidable casualty or misfortune, preventing the party from prosecuting or defending.'\n\n On the same day, a new pleading entitled 'Petition to Vacate Judgment' was filed. This petition did not contain an allegation that the corporation's appearance was special and solely to contest the jurisdiction of the court; nor did it seek to quash the summons issued and served. In addition to allegations made in the motion filed in July, 1921, the new petition alleged that the service was based \n\n[276 U.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n upon an allegation fraudulently made that the corporation was engaged in business in Oklahoma within the meaning of the statute relative to service; that the judgment was rendered upon false and fraudulent testimony given in support of the allegation that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff; that in fact plaintiff was indebted to the corporation in the sum of $29,10; that if it, the corporation, violated the state law by failing to appoint an agent, it had done so unconsciously; that in any event it was entitled to be notified of the pendency of the action; that by fraud the plaintiff concealed from it the fact that the action had been instituted; and that there was no duty devolving upon the secretary of state to notify it. It alleged further, as required by section 814 of the Compiled Statutes, that it had a meritorious defense; that this would have been interposed if it had known of the pendency of that action; that if permitted now to appear and defend, it could and would establish the defense. Annexed to the petition was a copy of the answer which the corporation proposed to file if its prayer to vacate the judgment should be granted. This answer included a counterclaim for the small balance alleged to be due to the corporation. The petition alleged further that a levy upon the corporation's property to enforce the judgment was threatened, offered a bond conditioned to pay the judgment, if sustained, and prayed for a stay of execution pending a hearing on the petition to vacate. As final relief the petition prayed that the judgment be vacated, that the corporation be permitted to file the answer annexed and make proper defense, and that it have other and proper equitable relief.\n To this petition to vacate a demurrer was interposed. There was a hearing upon the demurrer; it was sustained; the petition was dismissed, upon refusal of the corporation to plead further; and on June 19, 1922, a stay of the exe- \n\n[276 U.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n cution, pending an appeal, issued. In October, 1924, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma reversed the judgment dismissing the petition to vacate. Its decision was rested solely upon the ground that, under the statute, the secretary of state was required to give the defendant corporation notice of the service of the summons upon him; that he had failed to do so; that, since the corporation lacked actual knowledge, there was an 'unavoidable casualty or misfortune, preventing the party ... defending,' as defined in subparagraph seventh of section 810 of the Compiled Statutes of Oklahoma; and that, therefore, the case should be remanded for further proceedings. In December, 1925, a rehearing was granted.\n In November, 1926, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma reversed itself and affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the petition to vacate. 251 P. 482. In its second opinion it recited the claim that the statute authorizing service upon the secretary of state violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; stated that the validity of the statute had been sustained in Title Guaranty & Surety Co. v. Slinker, 42 Okl. 811, 143 P. 41, which was binding upon it; and, then exercising jurisdiction, it held that relief could not be had under clause seventh of section 810, because the corporation's lack of knowledge of the commencement of the action was not due to 'unavoidable casualty or misfortune,' but to its own failure to appoint an agent as required by the law of the state. As leading to that conclusion, it held further that the secretary of state was not under a duty to send notice of the summons.\n This court, being of opinion that the constitutionality of the statute concerning service, as so construed, was questionable, and that the question of its validity was one of general importance, granted the petition for a writ of certiorari. \n274 \nU.S. 729\n, 47 S. Ct. 587. Further study of the record discloses that the discussion by the state court of this \n\n[276 U.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n constitutional question was unnecessary to the result reached by it. The jurisdictional question-and hence the constitutional question-had already been eliminated earlier in the opinion. For the court had held that by filing the petition to vacate under section 810, the corporation had, in effect, entered a general appearance. This was true, because embodied in the petition were several nonjurisdictional grounds of relief, including, among others, fraudulent conduct on the part of the plaintiff and the meritoriousness of the corporation's defense, and because the corporation sought affirmative relief against the original plaintiff.\n Since the founding of the state, it has been the settled lwa of Oklahoma that, where a person against whom a judgment is rendered files a petition to vacate the judgment upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the defendant, and the petition is based also on nonjurisdictional grounds, such as those mentioned in subparagraphs fourth and seventh of section 810, the filing of the petition operates as a voluntary general appearance, with the same effect as if such appearance had been made at the at the trial. \n1\n It was probably because this rule had been so long settled, that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma deemed it unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject or to city any of the many cases in which the rule had been acted on.\n As the decision of that court was rested, and may rest, on this rule- an adequate nonfederal ground-the writ must be dismissed.

The petition was dismissed, on demurrer, for failure to state a cause of action. 62 Ct. Cl. 370.\n The facts alleged were these: In October, 1921, the predecessor of the Goodyear Company leased to the United States, for the use of the Veterans' Bureau, certain premises in Cincinnati, Ohio, for a term ending June 30, 1926, at a stipulated annual rental payable in monthly instalments. No appropriation was then available for payment of the rent after the first fiscal year, ending June 30, 1922;2 and the lease provided that if an appropriation was not made under which the rent for any succeeding fiscal year might be paid, it should automatically terminate as of June 30 of the year for which an appropriation was last available.\n The lessor assigned and transferred the lease to the Goodyear Company in January, 1922. In June an appropriation was made, available for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923; and the lease was by agreement 'renewed' for that year. In February, 1923, an appropriation was \n\n[276 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n made, available for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924. Before June 30, 1923, the officials of the Veterans' Bureau informed the Company that the United States would give up the occupancy of the premises as of that date. 'When June 30, 1923, arrived'-as the petition alleged-'the officials of the Veterans' Bureau desired to occupy the premises beyond that date, and possession was continued by the United States into the following fiscal year, the officials of the Veterans' Bureau then stating that there was no intention on the part of the United States to pay rent for any longer time than the actual period of occupancy, and the officials of the claimant company stating that it was their contention that ... even if the original lease was not binding beyond June 30, 1923, nevertheless if the United States remained longer than June 30, 1923, it would at least be liable for the stipulated rent for the year ending June 30, 1924, under the laws of the State of Ohio by reason of holding over.' The United States continued in possession to December 20, 1923, when it vacated the premises. The rent was paid to December 31, 1923\n\n\n The Company claimed that 'by reason of holding over' the United States was bound for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 1924, and liable for the unpaid rental to that date. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In Leiter v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 204, 207\n, 46 S. Ct. 477, 478 ( 70 L. Ed. 906), we held that a lease to the United States for a term of years, made without any specific authority of law and entered into when there was no appropriation available for the payment of rent after the first fiscal year, in so far as its terms extend beyond that year, violates the express provisions \n\n[276 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n of Sections 3732 and 3679 of the Revised Statutes4 (41 USCA  11, 31 USCA  665) and creates no binding obligation on the Government after that year; and that 'to make it binding for any subsequent year, it is necessary, not only that an appropriation be made available for the payment of the rent, but that the Government, by its duly authorized offices, affirmatively continue the lease for such subsequent year; thereby, in effect, by the adoption of the original lease, making a new lease under the authority of such appropriation for the subsequent year.'\n The Company contends 'that since there was a Federal appropriation before June 30, 1923, pursuant to which the lease might have been extended to June 30, 1924, and since by the common law of Ohio, where the land was, such a holding over on June 30, 1923, would have created a tenancy to June 30, 1924, as between individuals, the United States became bound for the year by the act of holding over coupled with the authority to lease the property contained in the appropriation act.'\n We cannot sustain this contention. In order to bind the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924, it was necessary, as held in the Leiter Case, that after the available appropriation had been made, the Government should affirmatively continue the lease for that year, that is, in effect, make a new lease for the year under the authority of such appropriation. This it did \n\n[276 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n not do, either expressly or impliedly. On the contrary, the notice given by the officials of the Veterans' Bureau to the Company, before holding over, that the Government did not intend to pay rent beyond the actual period of occupancy, negatived any intention to continue the lease for the entire year, and left no basis for inferring an agreement to continue it after the Bureau should cease to occupy the premises. It is immaterial that under the common law in Ohio as applied between private parties, a lessee holding over after the expiration of his lease is held, at the option of the lessor, to be bound for another year, under an agreement implied in law, regardless of his actual intention. Railroad Co. v. West, 57 Ohio St. 161, 165, 168, 49 N. E. 344; Bumiller v. Walker, 95 Ohio St. 344, 349, 116 N. E. 797, L. R. A. 1918B, 96. Not having affirmatively continued the lease beyond the actual period of occupancy, the Government cannot, under the doctrine of the Leiter Case, be bound for a longer term.\n Furthermore, independently of that doctrine, the right here invoked to sue the United States under the Tucker Act on a claim founded on contract-as this is-must rest upon the existence of a contract express or implied in fact, no right of action being given by the Act in cases where, if the transaction were between private parties, recovery could be had upon a contract implied in law.

The United States admitted that it occupied the premises under a \n\n[276 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n contract as lessee until June 30, 1923. One consequence of this contract by the law that governed it and by the stipulation of the lessor was that if the lessee held over he held over for a year. I do not see how the United States could accept the contract and repudiate the consequence, or accept the permission of the lessor to continue in possession upon the express condition that it be bound for a year and repudiate the condition, except in the event of there being no appropriation in which case the paramount law of the United States would prevail. There was an appropriation here and therefore there was nothing to hinder the United States being bound until June 30, 1924, except the statement of the agents that it did not mean to be, which seems to me merely the statement that it did not mean to accept the legal consequence of its act.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24 Stat. 505, c. 359; Judicial Code,  145, U.

St.  10071 1\/4 dd). The company claims that these certificates are orders of the Commission, that they were issued without authority of law, and that they are void. The United States and the Commission moved to dismiss on the ground that the certificates sought to be annulled are not orders of the Commission within the meaning of the Commerce Court and Urgent Deficiencies Acts, and that the United States had not consented to be sued. The case was heard before three judges, who dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction. 22 F.(2d) 865. Whether they erred in so doing is the only question presented by the appeal.\n Certificates under section 209 are an incident of the termination of the federal control of the railroads on March 1, 1920. They are provided for in title 2 of Transportation Act 1920. By section 209(c) of that act ( 49 USCA  77(c); Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 dd(c)), the United States guaranteed to each company that its railway operating income for the following six months should be not less than one-half of the amount of the annual compensation to which it was entitled during the period of federal control. Paragraph (g) (49 USCA  77(g); Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 dd(g)) provided that:\n'The Commission shall, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the guaranty period, ascertain and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the several amounts necessary to make good the foregoing guaranty. ...'\n\n Paragraph (h) (Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 dd(h)) provided for the issue, during the guaranty period, of certificates for payment on account, if the carrier furnishes an adequately secured contract to repay to the United \n\n[277 U.S. 172, 179]\n\u00a0\n States any amount received in excess of that which shall be finally determined as the sum to which the carrier is entitled under the guaranty. Section 212, added by the Act of February 26, 1921, c. 72, 41 Stat. 1145 ( 49 USCA  79; Comp. St.  10071 1\/4 e(1)), provided for payments on account after the expiration of the guaranty period, the Commission being authorized to 'make its certificate for any amount definitely ascertained by it to be due, and ... thereafter in the same manner make further certificates, until the whole amount due has been certified.' Upon receipt of certificates, the Secretary of the Treasury was directed 'to draw warrants in favor of each such carrier upon the Treasury of the United States, for the amount shown in such certificate as necessary to make good such guaranty.'\n Upon certificates of the Commission issued to the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (h), he paid the company $6,500,000 in 1920. Upon certificate issued under section 212, he paid it $6,000,000 in 1921. Several years later, in the course of the proceedings for final settlement of the amount due the company under section 209, the Commission issued to the Secretary of the Treasury the two certificates here in suit. Only the second of them is of importance. It certified that the total amount required to make good to the company the guaranty provided for in section 209 was $11,170,214.02. Guaranty Settlement with Great Northern Railway Co. et al., 99 I. C. C. 231; Id., 111 I. C. C. 318. As the Secretary of the Treasury had paid $12,500,000 to the company, he demanded reimbursement, as an overpayment, of $1,329,785.98, being the difference between the aggregate amounts received by the company and the total amount certified as payable under the guaranty. Pending settlement of that claim, the government withheld payment to the company of all amounts accruing for transportation services, but the payments were resumed upon the company's deposit of Liberty bonds as \n\n[277 U.S. 172, 180]\n\u00a0\n collateral. Thereupon this suit was brought by the company to annul the certificates and to restrain the government from enforcing its claim by sale of the Liberty bonds or otherwise.\n The function imposed upon the Commission by section 209 is solely that of determining the amount required to make good the government's guaranty. It is not an exertion of the delegated power to regulate interstate commerce. It is an incident of the World War-a temporary, nonrecurrent task, which might appropriately have been performed for the Treasury by its Comptroller or auditors, or by other trusted official. Congress selected the Commission for this service, doubtless, because of its special fitness. For the Commission had knowledge of railroads and experience in railroad accounting; it had the custody of the records of railroad operations; and its staff was competent to make speedily the necessary investigations.\n Transportation Act 1920, did not confer upon the Commission power to order anything in connection with the issue of the certificates. There is in the certificates no direction, no word of command. They are the recital of a finding of act. They are addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury; and only to him. The form of the certificate expresses appropriately the character of the service performed by the Commission. The final certificate does not purport to declare that the carrier is indebted to the United States in any sum. It states the total amount required of the United States to make good the guaranty and the aggregate amount theretofore certified. It discloses the facts, but does not certify that there was an overpayment. \n1\n Congress distinguished clearly, in fram- \n\n[277 U.S. 172, 181]\n\u00a0\n ing Transportation Act 1920, between provisions which were amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.; Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) and those which, while relating to railroads, were not. The amendments were grouped under title 4. The provisions here involved, which related solely to the termination of federal control, were grouped under title 2. Those which provided for the Railroad Labor Board under title 3. Because issuing certificates is not a part of the Commission's delegated power to regulate commerce, and is not an incident of such regulation, the special remedy provided by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is not available to review the legality or correctness of its action in doing so.\n The company points out that the action of the Commission here in question was affirmative, not negative, as in Proctor & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 761; that it relates to a matter of substance and not merely to a step in procedure, as in United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82\n, 37 S. Ct. 584; that it determines legal rights and \n\n[277 U.S. 172, 182]\n\u00a0\n obligations, and is not simply the tentative or final report of an investigation, as were the orders which we declined to review in Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 438\n, 45 S. Ct. 153, and United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S. Ct. 413; and that its being entitled as a certificate rather than as an order is not fatal to the equity jurisdiction of the District Court under Urgent Deficiencies Act. Compare Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; Home Furniture Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 456\n, 46 S. Ct. 545. But these considerations are irrelevant. For the inapplicability of the special remedy given by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is due to the fact that the certificate deals with a subject-matter not within in the scope of the Commission's duty to regulate commerce, and hence not within the purview of that remedy. In this respect, among others, it differs from the order involved in Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472.\n It is said that, unless this remedy is available, the company may be without redress. The argument is that the determination by the Commission of the amount required to make good the guaranty, may be likened to an award of arbitrators, that the ground of attack upon the certificates is that they were made under a mistake of law, and that an award can be set aside for mistake of law only in equity. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Bonner Mercantile Co. (C. C.) 44 F. 151, 11 L. R. A. 623; McLaurin v. McLauchlin (C. C. A.) 215 F. 345. We have no occasion to inquire whether a remedy at law or some other remedy in equity is available. The mere fact that the certificate may be conclusive, if it be a fact, would not entitle the company to a judicial review. Compare United States v. Babock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S. Ct. 464; Work v. Rives, \n267 \nU.S. 175\n, 45 S. Ct. 252. We find no reason for thinking that, because Congress confided to the Commission the task of certifying the amount to be paid to carriers from the public treasury, as an incident to the World \n\n[277 U.S. 172, 183]\n\u00a0\n War, it thereby consented that the United States should be sued in the special proceeding in equity, devised long before to control the Commission's execution of its regular functions in enforcing the Interstate Commerce Act.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The certificate reads (111 I. C. C. 318, 338, 339):\n'To the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States: ...\n\n'2.

C., for the United States.\n Messrs. Harold Goodman and Edwin Monning, both of Detroit, Mich., for defendants Grosfield and Caplis.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case came here from the court of appeals on certificate submitting certain questions upon which that court desired instruction. Upon an order requiring it, the entire record has been sent up for consideration. Judicial Code,  239, as amended February 13, 1925, by chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  346).\n Suit was brought by the United States on March 11, 1925, in the Federal district court for the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan, against Grosfield and Caplis, owners, and Silverman, tenant, to enjoin the \n\n[276 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n use of certain premises for the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquor and to close such premises, as a common nuisance, for a period of one year. On March 30th, Grosfield and Caplis filed an answer, among other things denying that the premises were a common nuisance, and alleging that, as to whether intoxicating liquor was sold, kept, or bartered upon the premises, they had no knowledge nor information sufficient to form a belief; that the first information they received that the premises were used for illegal purposes was contained in a newspaper account of a raid (made January 17, 1925) containing the information that various appliances for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor had been found and seized; that Silverman, upon being spoken to, declared that there would be no violations of law upon the premises, that everything of an unlawful nature had been taken out, and a lease of the premises was being negotiated for the storage of paper; that thereafter, upon the receipt of a copy of the bill of complaint, steps were taken by defendants to terminate Silverman's tenancy; and that they will proceed to oust him from the premises. On July 10, 1925, after a hearing, the bill was dismissed as to Silverman and a decree entered against Grosfield and Caplis in accordance with the prayer. No effort appears to have been made by those defendants to secure an order from the District Court allowing them to give a bond so as to permit the continued occupation and use of the premises. The only question for our consideration is whether the evidence submitted to the District Court is sufficient to justify the decree.\n By section 21, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 314 (27 USCA  33), any room, house, etc., where intoxicating liquor is manufactured, sold, kept, or bartered in violation of that title, is declared to be a common nuisance. By section 22 (27 USCA  34), it is provided that an action to enjoin such nuisance may be brought in the name of the United States, \n\n[276 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n to be tried as an action in equity; that it shall not be necessary for the court to find that the property involved was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing, but if the material allegations of the petition are found to be true the court shall order that no liquor shall be manufactured, sold, etc., in such room, house, etc.; that upon judgment abating the nuisance the court may order that the premises shall not be occupied or used for one year thereafter, but may in its discretion permit them to be occupied or used upon the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in the sum of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 conditioned that intoxicating liquor shall not thereafter be manufactured, sold, etc.\n Evidence was introduced by the government to the effect that on January 17, 1925, nearly two months before this suit was brought, police officers entered the premises involved (then in Silverman's possession) and there found and seized too 300-gallon copper stills in operation, two copper tanks and other applicances used for the purpose of manufacturing intoxicating liquor, 8,500 gallons of sugar mash, and 60 gallons of whisky distillate. Grosfield, who was the only witness for the defendants, testified:\n'I rented these premises to Silverman for the purpose of storing hay and straw. I had no knowledge of any illegal use of the premises until this case. I have caused the tenancy of Silverman to be terminated and have rented the entire rear part of the building to the Boston Paper Company for the storage of paper.'\n\n Being asked by the court, 'You did not remove this tenant before the institution of these proceedings?' he answered, 'I had no knowledge that the premises were used in this way until these proceedings were started.'\n Considering the evidence in connection with the sworn answer of the defendants, we cannot say that the decree is without adequate support. The purpose of the provision of the statute authorizing an injunction against \n\n[276 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n occupancy and use is not punitive but preventive, Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630, 632\n, 47 S. Ct. 218; and it is no answer to the suit to say that the owner did not participate in the criminal act of the tenant. That the tenant may have been ousted and the illegal use of the premises ended before the decree is not conclusive, if the evidence furnish reasonable ground for apprehending a repetition of such use. United States v. Pepe (C. C. A.) 12 F. (2d) 985, 986; Schlieder v. United States (C. C. A.) 11 F. (2d) 345, 347; United States v. Boynton (D. C.) 297 F. 261, 267, 268; Grossman v. United States (C. C. A.) 280 F. 683, 685, 686. The evidence discloses that the illegal use of the premises was discovered nearly two months prior to the bringing of this suit, with full knowledge of which discovery defendants fairly may be charged, having read a newspaper account of the raid and talked with Silverman about it. When the answer was filed, although 2 1\/2 months had elapsed, Silverman was still in possession, and the answer contains the averment only that steps had been taken to terminate his tenancy and a promise that defendants would proceed to oust him. The tenancy was from month to month. The circumstances called for prompt action, and the failure of the owners of the premises to take any steps to remove the offending tenant until after the suit had been brought against them evidence a lack of concern not easily reconcilable with a real desire upon their part to make sure that the evil use of their property would not be repeated. Grosfield's statement-made in response to the interrogative suggestion of the court that the tenant was not removed before the institution of these proceedings-that he had no knowledge that the premises were being improperly used until the proceedings were begun is inconsistent with the averment in the answer that he had read the newspaper account in respect of the unlawful use of the premises disclosed by the raid of January 17th. \n\n[276 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n That defendants, long before the suit against them was begun, knew of the tenant's violation of law, is not open to reasonable dispute; and their delay until after suit to take steps to get rid of him, in the face of his criminal use of the premises, well might be attributed to a lack of good faith on their part. Nor is it unfair to say that their failure to act until complaint was served upon them evidence a surrender to the unavoidable rather than a voluntary effort to prevent a renewal of the nuisance. The trial judge, who saw Grosfield and heard his testimony, was better able to pass upon his credibility and trustworthiness than are we.\n Upon consideration of all the circumstances, we find no ground for disturbing the conclusion upon which the decree must rest, namely, that the premises ought to be closed for a period long enough to end the probability of a recurrence of their unlawful use. We are the more content with this conclusion since it is still within the power of the District Court to permit the premises to be occupied or used upon the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in the amount and upon the conditions prescribed by the statute.

Simmons and Claude Pollard, both of Austin, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The general statutes of Texas provide that no person shall engage in the business of wholesale dealer in fish without procuring a license from the game, fish and oyster commissioner; that the licensee shall pay a tax of $1 for each 1,000 pounds of fish handled by him; and that failure to pay the tax shall constitute a misdemeanor for which the person offending may be punished. Pen. Code Tex. 1925, art. 936.\n The Gulf Fisheries Company, a New York corporation engaged in the wholesale fish business at Galveston, Tex., brought this suit against the county attorney, in the federal court for southern Texas. The bill alleged that, as applied to the plaintiff, the above statute is void, as it lays an impost on imports and burdens foreign and interstate commerce, thus violating the Federal Constitution (Article 1,  10, par. 2; Article 1,  8, par. 3); that, because the statute is void, plaintiff refused to pay the tax demanded; that, because of its refusal, criminal proceedings are threatened; and that, unless these are enjoined, plaintiff will be subjected to irreparable injury to an amount exceeding $3,000. Both an interlocutory and a final injunction were prayed for. A temporary restraining order issued. An application for the interlocutory injunction was made and heard before three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380). The defendant moved to dismiss the bill; and also answered. Upon final hearing before the three judges the 'temporary injunction' was dissolved; the final injunction was denied; and the bill was dismissed. Gulf Fisheries Co. v. Darrouzet, 17 F.(2d) 374. The case is here on direct appeal from the final decree. Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 385; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 702. \n\n[276 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n Here the only claim made by the company is that the statute as applied lays an impost on imports. The county attorney denies that the fish taxed are imports, insists that even if they are imports, the tax is valid as a license fee exacted to defray the cost of inspection, and contends that the imposition is, in any event, valid, because the fish, before the tax is laid, become mingled with the common mass of property in the state and thus lose their character as imports and their exemptions from state taxation. We have no occasion to inquire whether the fish are imports. Nor need we inquire whether the statute could be sustained as an inspection law. On the facts agreed, the tax is not laid until the fish have lost their alleged distinctive character as imports and have become, through processing, handling and sale, a part of the mass of property subject to taxation by the state. The facts are these:\n The fish are caught in the Gulf of Mexico and are landed, in bulk, by the fishing boats on the wharf of the Galveston Wharf Company. That is the Gulf Fisheries Company's only place of business. And there it has the privileges required for the conduct of its business. It has space for unloading the fish, has several large bins or ice boxes for storage, handling and re-icing; has space for loading fish on express cars, and has space for the office work incident to the loading, selling and shipping. After the fish are unloaded from the vessels, all are weighed and washed. All are immediately re-iced to prevent spoiling. About 75 per cent. are there beheaded and gutted; 7 to 10 per cent. are gutted and gilled with heads on; the remainder are left for sale without beheading or removing gills or entrails. All, except 15 to 20 per cent., which are sold to wholesale dealers within the city, are put into barrels, loose with ice, ready for shipment in \n\n[276 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n filling orders. None are placed in cold storage plants. All are shipped from the wharf as fast as they can be re-iced, washed, handled, and loaded as above stated. Nearly all are shipped on the day they are unloaded from the boats. Occasionally, some are held in the ice boxes on the wharf for more than 48 hours. All are sold to wholesale dealers in quantities of from 50 to 400 pounds. None are sold to retailers.\n The tax is laid, not according to the weight of the fish when landed, but upon the fish sold. \n1\n All that is sold, has been handled as above stated. None of it has remained in its original condition. None is in an original package, and little in its original form. This is obviously true of the 75 per cent. which is beheaded and gutted and of the 7 to 10 per cent. more which is gutted and gilled with the heads on. But the small remainder is, when sold, no longer in its original condition. Before sale, it is washed and re-iced. It is taken from the bulk and put loose with ice in barrels. And all this has been done on the wharf. These facts make inapplicable cases like Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29; Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n. All the fish sold have, after landing and before laying the tax, been so acted upon as to become part of the common property of the state. They have lost their distinctive character as imports and have become taxable by the state. Compare Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.

Calvin Wells, of Jackson, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by Wells in a circuit court of Mississippi to recover damages for injuries suffered by him while employed as a brakeman on a freight train of the Railroad Company. The declaration alleged that these injuries were caused by the negligence of the engineer in giving a very sudden and unnecessary jerk to the train when it was moving and Wells was undertaking to get on it, which threw him on the ground. At the conclusion of the evidence the Railroad Company requested that the jury be instructed to find for the defendant. This was refused. The jury found for the plaintiff; and the \n\n[275 U.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, without opinion.\n It is unquestioned that Wells was at the time employed in interstate commerce, and that the case is controlled by the federal Employers' Liability Act. \n1\n Hence, if it appears from the record that under the applicable principles of law as interpreted by the Federal courts, the evidence was not sufficient, in kind or amount, to warrant a finding that the negligence of the engineer was the cause of the injury, the judgment must be reversed. Seaboard Air Line v. Padgett, \n236 \nU.S. 668, 673\n, 35 S. Ct. 481; Chicago, M. & P. Railroad v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 474\n, 46 S. Ct. 564\n\n\n Wells, who had been employed as an extra brakeman for a few months, was on the day of the injury the rear brakeman on a local freight train containing ten cars. After stopping at a station where some switching was done, the train was coupled up on the main track, on a down grade, in readiness to proceed on its journey. The engineer, fireman and hear brakeman were in the cab of the engine. The engineer was on the right side, and the fireman on the left, it being his duty to take signals from that side and pass them to the engineer. The conductor and flagman were in the caboose at the rear of the train, and Wells was standing on the left of the train, near the caboose. Wells gave a signal to the fireman for the train to go ahead; and the fireman then went down into the deck of the engine to shovel in coal. Just after this signal was given Wells was told by the conductor to throw a derail switch on the left of the main track, some fifty feet from the caboose. After doing this, finding that the train had already started, he ran back. When he reached the train it had gone about fifty feet and was moving from eight to ten miles an hour. The cars had then passed him and he started to get on the caboose. He testified \n\n[275 U.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n that as he caught the grab iron he stepped on a big piece of coal, his foot turned and he 'went down and the engine gave an unusual jerk' which threw him loose from the train, and he fell on the ground, his knee striking on the cross ties, breaking the kneecap and otherwise injuring him. He also testified, on cross-examination, that while the running in of slack on freight trains jerks or lurches them to a certain extent, this was a severe jerk such as he had never experienced before on a train; and, finally, that although he had seen such jerks on through freight trains, he had never seen them in local freights. The plaintiff offered no other evidence as to the cause of the injury.\n All the other members of the train crew were introduced as witnesses by the defendant. Their testimony was to the effect that it was not the duty of the engineer before starting to look out for the men who might be on the other side of the train, that being the duty of the fireman; that when the engineer pulled out he did not know where Wells was; that he started in the ordinary way, with open throttle, and did nothing in operating the engine that could cause a sudden or unusual lurch of the train; that after a freight train starts there are usually jerks or lurches caused by the running out of the slack between the cars; that after the slack runs out the engineer cannot give any jerk or lurch to the train even by suddenly putting on steam; and that at the time of the injury there was in fact no unusual jerk or lurch of the train. No rebuttal evidence was offered.\n It is urged here in behalf of Wells that, despite this evidence, the question of the engineer's negligence was property submitted to the jury because of an inference to be drawn from Well's own statement that 'the engine gave an unusual jerk' which was more severe than any he had ever experienced or seen on a local freight train. We cannot sustain this contention. In the first place, there \n\n[275 U.S. 455, 459]\n\u00a0\n was no evidence that the engineer knew or should have known that Wells was not on the train, but was attempting to get on it after it had started and was in a situation in which a jerk of the train would be dangerous to him. See Texas & Pacific Railway v. Behymer, \n189 \nU.S. 468\n, 23 S. Ct. 622. Aside from this, Wells' statement that the jerk was given by the engine, was, obviously, a mere conjecture, as he was then at the side of the caboose, ten car lengths away, where he could not see what occurred on the engine. And his opinion that the jerk was unusual and severe as compared with those which he had previously experienced on local freight trains, had no substantial weight; his situation on the ground by the side of the moving train, after his foot had turned on the piece of coal and he had gone 'down,' being plainly one in which he could not compare with any accuracy the jerk which he then felt with those he had experienced when riding on freight trains.\n In short, we find that on the evidence and all the inferences which the jury might reasonably draw therefrom, taken most strongly against the Railway Company, the contention that the injury was caused by the negligence of the engineer is without any substantial support. In no aspect does the record do more than leave the matter in the realm of speculation and conjecture. That is not enough. Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway, \n179 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 21 S. Ct. 275; Chicago, M. & St. P. Railway v. Coogan, supra, 478 (46 S. Ct. 564).\n As the jury should have been instructed to find for the defendant, we have no occasion to consider other questions which have been argued in reference to the charge to the jury.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Mississippi for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 65, c. 149 (45 USCA  51-59; Comp.

Cl. 461. For the views of that court, see Deutsch-Australische Dampfschiffs- Gesellschaft, Appellant v. \n\n[277 U.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 450. Appellants are incorporated under the laws of New Jersey and their entire capital stock has long been owned by the Hamburg-American Line, a German corporation.\n In cause No. 3, the appellant seeks to recover (1) compensation for the use of certain docks and piers, New York harbor, seized by the United States April 6, 1917, and used by them until June 28, 1918; and (2) interest on the sum awarded by the President (December 3, 1918) as compensation for the same property, from June 28, 1918, when title was taken thereto until January 5, 1919, the date of actual payment. In cause No. 4 the claim is for the value of two tugboats, launch, barge, and coal hoister requisitioned and taken by the United States April 6, 1917, at the port of New York; and in No. 5 judgment is asked because of three barges, likewise taken on the same day.\n The court below evidently proceeded upon the view that the property of appellant corporations should be treated as owned by an enemy because their entire capital stock belonged to a German corporation. And as the property was seized during the war with Germany it held there could be no recovery. Without doubt Congress might have accepted and acted upon that theory. It was adopted in the St. Tudno, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 198, and the Michigan, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 421. But Congress did not do so; it definitely adopted the policy of disregarding stock ownership as a test of enemy character and permitted property of domestic corporations to be dealt with as nonenemy. The prescribed plan was to seize the shares of stock when enemy owned rather than to take over the corporate property.\n The Trading with the Enemy Act, approved October 6, 1917 (chapter 106, 40 Stat. 411 (50 USCA Appendix,  2(a), Comp. St.  3115 1\/2 aa)), provides:\n'Sec. 2.

These had been plainly indicated by the diverse opinions in Daimler Co. v. Continental Tyre & Rubber Co. (1916) 2 A. C. 307. ...'\n\n The petition in No. 3 states a good cause of action for the use of the docks and piers from April 6, 1917, to June 28, 1918. As Congress might have directed forfeiture of all property beneficially owned by enemy subjects, it had power to provide for seizure followed by such compensation as the President might determine. Here such compensation was fixed and ultimately paid; and we find nothing to show that due allowance was not made for the delay in payment.\n In No. 4 the petition fails clearly to show what action was taken by the United States.

BRUNDAGE(1928)\nNo. 117\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lioyd C. Whitman and Bernhardt Frank, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Edward R. Johnston, Ralph F. Potter, and Henry Jackson Darby, all of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controversy between state court receivers and the receiver of a federal court over the possession of the property and assets of the Daniel Boone Woolen Mills Corporation. It is here by certiorari to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirming a decree of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. 13 F.(2d) 617. The receivers in the state court were appointed on the prayer of what was called a stockholder's bill. The receiver in the federal court was appointed on the prayer of what was called a creditor's bill. The receiver in the federal court was appointed \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n first; but the bill in equity upon which the state court receivers were appointed was filed five days before the bill in the federal court. The receivers in the state court filed a motion in the federal court, requesting that the property in the hands of the federal court receiver be transferred to the state court receivers, on the ground that the state court, by the earlier filing of the bill in that court, had acquired constructive possession, and its receivers were entitled, therefore, to actual possession of the property.\n The Daniel Boone Woolen Mills was a corporation of the state of Illinois, engaged in the manufacture of woolen cloth in Illinois, with its principal place of business there, but with additional plants in other states. It had 187,000 shares of stock, owned by 1,500 individual stockholders, resident in many states. It had been so badly managed during the year 1924, and its indebtedness had been so much increased, that a surplus of $500,000 had been changed into a deficit of more than $2,000, 000. Nevertheless, at the end of 1924, it was alleged by all parties that its assets exceeded its liabilities by $1,000,000, although the event has proved the fact to be otherwise, and administration under receivership shows the debts much to exceed its assets. The mismanagement had led its president and its treasurer, both named Gumbinski, to resign, and they were replaced by Joseph Byfield, as president, and Frank Solomon, as vice president. These two officials had not been able to secure the financial support necessary to meet the expenditures and conduct the business. On February 14, 1925, therefore, Harry Hurwitz, a stockholder of the company, filed a bill in the superior court of Cook county, Illinois, in his own behalf and in that of all other stockholders of the corporation, 'and all other firms or corporations who might be interested in the litigation, and who might seek to intervene or contribute to the expense thereof.' \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n The averment of the bill was that during 1924 those in control had used for their own purposes the assets of the corporation, and it became the duty of the new officers to bring suit to recover the property thus abstracted, embezzled, or wasted, but that nothing had been done. It averred the solvency of the company, but alleged that it was not able to pay its current expenses, that the business ought to be maintained and conducted, in order to make up in salable form a great deal of material on hand uncompleted, and that, in order to save the property in the interest of the stockholders and others, a receiver should be appointed, who should continue the business. The prayer was for an injunction forbidding those engaged in the management from imposing any lien or mortgage on the property. In effect, the bill asked for the appointment of receivers, with authority to take possession of the property, carry on the business, and subsequently after getting the property into proper condition to provide for and call a stockholders' meeting and a transfer of the property back to a new management.\n On the 19th of February, five days later, a bill was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by the United States Worsted Sales Company, a corporation of the state of New York, claiming to be a simple non-judgment creditor of the Woolen Mills in the sum of $6,000. The plaintiff brought the bill on its own behalf and on behalf of all the creditors of the Woolen Mills who would join in the prosecution. Its averments in respect to ownership and the disastrous operation of the company were much the same as those of the bill by Hurwitz in the state court. It specifically averred that the Woolen Mills was not insolvent, but that it had been impossible to secure money with which to carry it on; that there was grave danger of the recovery of judgment and the levy of executions, and of a race for undue preferences; and that in the preservation of the property it was \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n necessary to appoint a receiver to continue the business, make up the uncompleted material, and then to dispose of the property as the court might deem wise, by sale or otherwise, in the interest of all the creditors and of the stockholders. It asked authority for the receiver to apply in either federal or state courts of other states, in which the various factories of the Woolen Mills were situate, for ancillary receiverships. It further asked an injunction against judgments and executions of all creditors and an order requiring them to file their claims with the receiver.\n Application for receivers in the state court in the Hurwitz suit had been made upon the filing of the bill, and notice given to the defendant Woolen Mills that the motion would be presented on February 16, 1925, the bill having been filed February 14th. Upon application of one Cowan, the attorney for the Woolen Mills Corporation, the hearing on the motion for a receivership on the 16th was postponed until February 21st, and meantime the bill in the federal court for a receiver was filed on February 18th. On the same day the Woolen Mills Corporation entered its appearance in the District Court, filed its answer admitting the averments of the bill and consented to the appointment of a receiver. The appointment of Brundage as receiver was made on the following day.\n On the 25th of February, the superior court of Cook county entered an order allowing one Max Goldenberg, a stockholder, to file in the Hurwitz suit his intervening petition, which did not in effect change the nature of the relief asked, but elaborated a description of details of the conspiracy of the Gumbinskies to loot the Woolen Mills Company, and of a conspiracy of the Woolen Mills management to evade the jurisdiction of the state court by delay in the appointment of receivers there and by the collusive answer and consent of the Woolen Mills to the \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n appointment of a federal court receiver. This intervening petition was adopted on March 13th by Hurwitz as an amendment to his original bill. On February 28th, the superior court entered its order appointing the Union Bank and Harkin as receivers of the property. In that order the superior court found that it had had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, and it empowered its receivers to prosecute and defend without further order all existing actions by or against the Woolen Mills Corporation, and enjoined the corporation, its officers and directors, from incumbering or pledging or creating any liens against the property, moneys, accounts and assets of the Woolen Mills Corporation during the receivership. On March 13th the state court receivers filed a motion in the District Court in this cause setting forth their appointment as receivers in the state court and the history of the litigation, charged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to appoint a receiver of the Woolen Mills Corporation or of its property, assets or record, and prayed for an order upon Brundage, as its receiver, to turn over this property now in his possession to them.\n The question mainly argued in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals and here was whether the state court, solely by the filing of a stockholder's bill for the appointment of a receiver, obtained constructive possession of the property and assets of the Woolen Mills Corporation. Upon this motion, evidence was taken disclosing at length the circumstances of the postponement in the state court, the filing of the bill in the federal court and the appointment of the receivers there. Of these we shall hereafter consider the effect. The District Court held that the controversy in the federal court was different from that in the state court, as shown by a comparison of the two bills; that the bill in the federal court was a creditor's bill, whereas that in the state court was \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n a stockholder's bill; that the interests of the creditors were prior and necessarily underlay those of the stockholders, and that the stockholder's bill in the state court would have been ineffective, because in such a case the court had no power to enjoin creditors from judgment and execution against the assets; whereas the jurisdiction in the creditor's bill gave power to preserve by injunction the estate, and thus prevent undue preference among creditors. It was therefore concluded that the creditor who brought the bill was entitled to the receiver as prayed, and that the appointment of the receiver gave the federal court jurisdiction, which the state court receivers could not be permitted to disturb.\n The principle which should govern in a conflict of jurisdiction like this has been a number of times stated by this court. As between two courts of concurrent and coordinate jurisdiction, the court which first obtains jurisdiction and constructive possession of property by filing the bill is entitled to retain it without interference and cannot be deprived of its right to do so, because it may not have obtained prior physical possession by its receiver of the property in dispute; but where the jurisdiction is not the same or concurrent, and the subject-matter in litigation in the one is not within the cognizance of the other, or there is no constructive possession of the property in dispute by the filing of a bill, it is the date of the actual possession of the receiver that determines the priority of jurisdiction. Moran v. Sturges, \n154 \nU.S. 256, 283\n, 284 S., 14 S. Ct. 1019; Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118\n, 29 S. Ct. 230; Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 54\n, 28 S. Ct. 182; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Railroad Co., \n177 \nU.S. 51, 61\n, 20 S. Ct. 564; and Adams v. Mercantile Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 66 F. 617. The difficulty in the application of the rule is in determining whether the conflicting jurisdictions are actually concurrent and the same. A doubtful question, too, is whether the bill is of such a \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n character that its filing is the taking of constructive possession of the property.\n In Palmer v. Texas, the suit in the state court was an action by the state to forfeit the charter of the corporation and wind up its affairs. The suit in the United States court was an action by a stockholder to liquidate the corporation. Both were substantially alike in purpose. The state court had proceeded so far as to appoint receivers of the property and had merely delayed their taking possession until the case might be examined on appeal in the court above. The state court was held to be in constructive possession all the time, and was given priority of jurisdiction over the property as against the receivers of a federal court who had taken actual possession under a subsequent bill.\n In Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Railroad Co., the suit in the federal court was an action to foreclose a mortgage, and the one in the state court sought to enjoin the foreclosure. In that case the controversies were held to be substantially the same, and the filing of the bill in foreclosure in the federal court was held to be a constructive possession of the property.\n In Moran v. Sturges, on the other hand, the controversy was between the jurisdiction of a state court in winding up a corporation and the distribution of its assets which included navigable vessels and the jurisdiction of the federal court which had taken actual possession of the vessels to enforce the collection of maritime liens on them. It was held that, as the state court had no capacity to take jurisdiction of the maritime liens and enforce them, there was not concurrent jurisdiction, and therefore the court which first obtained actual possession of the vessels by its receiver was entitled to retain it without interference.\n In Empire Trust Co. v. Brooks (C. C. A.) 232 F. 641, a suit was pending in the state court for the dissolution of a \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 45]\n\u00a0\n corporation and the distribution of its assets under a state statute, but it had made no order appointing a receiver and had not taken actual possession of the property at the time the suit was brought. A subsequent suit was brought against the corporation in the federal court to foreclose a mortgage upon the property and a receiver was appointed who took possession of the property and it was held in a carefully reasoned opinion that the federal court by receivership had acquired priority of jurisdiction with respect to the property mortgaged, on the ground that the issues and subject-matter of the two suits were not essentially the same and that there was no conflict of jurisdiction. See, also, De La Vergne Refrigerating Machine Co. v. Palmetto Brewing Co. (C. C. A.) 72 F. 579, 584, 585.\n We conclude that if the decision of this motion turned on the question of priority of jurisdiction on the face of the two bills, it could not be said that the courts were exercising concurrent jurisdiction. The creditor's bill conferred on the court the power to enjoin the judgments and executions of creditors and the establishment of undue preferences among the creditors, whereas in the stockholder's bill no such remedy was asked and could hardly be afforded without amendment and further allegation and prayer. Of course, as it has now turned out, because the corporation has proven to be insolvent, it would not have been difficult or be difficult now in the state court bill, by an amendment, to give the stockholder's bill the effect of a creditor's bill, with the receivers in possession. Indeed, it would seem to be its duty to do so.\n These considerations based upon the face of the pleadings in both actions would have justified the conclusions reached in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals were it not that the evidence submitted by the receivers of the state court upon the motion here under consideration discloses a fraud upon the state court by which the appointment of receivers therein was delayed in order that the federal receiver could be appointed. \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 46]\n\u00a0\n There were two parties among the stockholders in the Boone Mills Corporation. Gumbinski and his associates had been ousted in November, 1924, because of charges made public against them of concealment and defalcation and mismanagement. It became a subject of newspaper comment and of great publicity because of the large number of stockholders and the wide distribution of the shares. Byfield and Solomon, who, as already said, had been made in November, 1924, president and vice president, controlled the majority of the stock. Hurwitz as a stockholder, acting for the minority stockholders, filed the stockholder's bill and made the application for receivers to the superior court of Cook county. The application much affected the credit of the corporation, and it was regarded between the stockholders as an important question who should be receiver and by what court he should be appointed.\n Mr. Cowan was one of a firm of lawyers that acted for the defendant the Woolen Mills Corporation, and was himself a member of the executive committee of the board of directors of that company. Mr. Byfield admits that he talked with Mr. Cowan some time before and had expressed his opposition to anything but a federal receivership. The application for a receiver in the state court on the stockholder's bill was set for February 16, 1925. When the motion was called on that day, what followed is recited in the record as agreed upon by the parties. We have inserted it in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 36, 47]\n\u00a0\n An examination of the evidence following this postponement, much of which had to be drawn from the Byfield party and their attorneys, satisfies us that the facts were as follows:\n The delay in hearing the motion for a receiver in the state court was procured by Mr. Cowan, the attorney for \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 48]\n\u00a0\n the Boone Mills Corporation, for the purpose, if possible, of securing the appointment of a receiver in the federal court. One Grand was a stockholder of the corporation and lived in St. Louis, and represented other stockholders, all of whom were of the Byfield party. As soon as the motion was continued in the state court, a conference was held between Cowan, Byfield, and Solomon. It had been said that this conference was to be held with a view of securing money to carry on the corporation, and that this was the reason for asking the delay in the state court. But we think the evidence of Mr. Solomon shows clearly that the conference was for the purpose of seeing whether \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 49]\n\u00a0\n a receivership in the federal court could be secured in advance of the probable appointment in the state court.\n Mr. Cowan telephoned to Mr. Grand to come to his office with the expectation that, because of his diverse citizenship, he could file a stockholder's bill in the federal court. Grand suggested that a law firm of which Stern and Johnston were members should be selected. One of that firm, either Mr. Stern or Mr. Johnston, expressed the opinion that, instead of a stockholder's bill, a creditor's bill should be filed, because on such a bill they were more \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 50]\n\u00a0\n likely to get the receivership. Then the question arose who should be made the plaintiff, Grand, the St. Louis stockholder, not filling the requirement in such a suit. Cowan and others, with Vice President Solomon, examined the list of creditors of the company to see who could be induced to bring the creditor's bill. It was found that one Philipson, who was the agent of the United States Worsted Sales Company, a corporation and citizen of New York, had a claim for $6,000, and also that Stern was a personal friend of the agent. Accordingly, Solomon asked Philipson to turn his claim over to Stern for the protection of the company and creditors and stockholders of the Boone Mills Corporation, saying that the purpose of having a receiver appointed in the federal court was to prevent the appointment of a receiver in the state court. Philipson replied that he would be willing to do so, provided he got the consent of his home office. The statement was made to him 'somewhere along the road' that there would be no expense involved to Philipson's company. Philipson telephoned his company and got their consent. Then Mr. Johnston, the partner of Mr. Stern, drafted the bill in accordance with such information as he says he had had for 30 days and such information as he obtained from Cowan and the other men who were interested. The bill was filed. The answer of the company on the authority of its directors admitting all the facts and consenting to the appointment of a receiver was filed upon the same day with the filing of the bill. Counsel for the Worsted Sales Company knew this would be done. It is unnecessary to rehearse the evidence of the persons engaged in this combination to secure in the federal court the earlier receivership; but it is very clear that the whole suit in which the receiver was appointed was brought to secure that end before the action of the state court, and that the prime actor in the whole matter, \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 51]\n\u00a0\n which it does not do injustice to say had elements of a conspiracy, was the Daniel Boone Mills Company. Cowan was its lawyer and a member of the executive committee of its directors. He sought and procured the continuance in the state court. He continued to act as that company's attorney in his dealings with Grand and in the conferences between Stern and Johnston. When the form of the bill was changed from a stockholder's bill to a creditor's bill, they all, including Cowan, hunted for a nonresident creditor to consent to file the bill. The whole work was the result of Cowan's active agency. Cowan secured the delay in the state court by what on his part for his company was an agreement that nothing in the interim should be done to affect the litigation in the state court and that the status quo should be maintained. Cowan does not really deny this, though he says he did not think he went so far. What he said in court cannot be contested, because it is a stenographic report. The Woolen Mills Corporation was advised that the creditor's bill to be filed could not be sustained, because the nominal plaintiff was not a judgment creditor, but was a simple nonjudgment creditor (Lion Bonding & S. Co. v. Karatz, 262, U. S. 77, 85, 43 S. Ct. 480), and that that defect could only be remedied and immediate court action secured by an answer of the company admitting the averments of the bill and consenting to a receivership ( Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 500\n, 43 S. Ct. 454). So, simultaneously with the filing of the bill, the answer and consent were filed in the federal court. The complainant in the bill was as much the company's agent and tool in bringing the bill as was the Woolen Mills Corporation's own attorney in filing the answer, and in this aspect the suit was collusive. The complainant, the Worsted Sales Company, was, therefore, charged with knowledge of the fraud by which delay had been secured in the state court. The other agents whom defendant company employed to \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 52]\n\u00a0\n bring about the result even if they did not know the means taken to secure the delay, were affected with knowledge of it, because they were acting for the Woolen Mills Company in this transaction in its pursuit of a federal court receivership. We do not impute to Stern or Johnston actual knowledge of Cowan's fraudulent method of securing a postponement in the state court when they filed the bill of complaint. Cowan says he did not tell them. Johnston denies knowledge of it, and there is no evidence that they were informed. But, as explained, their client, the Worsted Sales Company, the complainant, was charged with knowledge of it. The District Court did not know these facts when the bill was filed and the receiver was appointed, but they were all brought to its attention when the motion of the state receivers was made and heard and evidence adduced March 13, 1925\n\n\n We do not wish what we have said to be taken as a general approval of the appointment of a receiver under the prayer of a bill brought by a simple contract creditor simply because it is consented to at the time by a defendant corporation. The true rule in equity is that under usual circumstances a creditor's bill may not be brought except by a judgment creditor after a return of 'nulla bona' on execution. When a receiver has been thus irregularly appointed on such a bill without objection, and the administration has proceeded to such a point that it would be detrimental to all concerned to discharge the receiver, the receivership has been permitted to continue because not seasonably objected to. Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 497\n, 500 S., 43 S. Ct. 454; In re Metropolitan Ry. Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90, 109\n, 111 S., 28 S. Ct. 219; United States v. Butterworth Corporation, \n269 \nU.S. 504, 513\n, 46 S. Ct. 179.\n In refusing the motion of the state court receivers for surrender of the property and assets of the Woolen Mills, the District Court said:\n'It must be borne in mind that the state court did not act until nine days after the appointment in this court, \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 53]\n\u00a0\n and then upon different pleadings. The statement in the state court of the attorney for the defendant, even if given the extreme meaning claimed for it (a meaning which in my opinion is not warranted by the evidence) could not operate to invalidate the proceedings of this court. At most it amounted to an agreement, a violation of which would have been a contempt of the state court. If it has the force of an injunction, it would not render void the action in the federal court.'\n\n Again, the same court said, speaking of the state court:\n'The court had taken no action which brought defendant's property within its custody; and it was not until March 13, 1925, that it was claimed in this court that there was any agreement in the state court beyond the terms of the order of February 16, 1925. In the meantime, the federal court here and in other districts proceeded with the administration of the affairs of the defendant corporation. As Judge Lurton said, it would lead to absurd results and inflict unwarranted injury upon innocent parties, if the alleged oral agreement of the attorney in the state court, of which there was no record, can be invoked to invalidate the proceedings here.'\n\n We differ radically from the trial court as to the purpose and effect of the conduct of Cowan in securing the postponement of the hearing for a receiver in the state court. Ordinarily we should acquiesce in a conclusion of fact by the court that heard the witnesses in such a case, but here the evidence of what was said in the state court is on a stenographic report agreed upon by the parties, and the other circumstances make the necessary inferences therefrom clear.\n Nor can we take the view that when the motion of the state court receivers applied for surrender there were then in the federal court case innocent parties upon whom surrender to the state court of the property would work any hardship, for no creditor had come into the case except the complainant, which by its actual relation to the \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 54]\n\u00a0\n proceeding was charged with knowledge of the means by which a receivership had been obtained. In respect to the effect of the evidence, the language of the Circuit Court of Appeals shows it took a different view of the facts from that of the District Court:\n'That the conduct of debtor's first counsel (not the counsel appearing in this court) was far from commendable is unfortunately most apparent. It is happily not a frequent occurrence that an attorney for a debtor seeks the creditor and urges him to bring suit against his client, or turns over his client's list of creditors to an attorney soliciting business, to say nothing of the violated pledge to the judge and opposing counsel. Moreover, good faith required this counsel to have advised the federal District Court of the pendency of the state court proceedings.\n\n'The case is one where, in their determination to control the receivership, counsel proceeded with such speed and zeal that the code of professional ethics was entirely ignored and forgotten. Counsel should avoid these hurried ex parte applications for friendly receivers. In fact, there should be no 'friendly receiverships.' Whenever possible, notice should be given to any and all interested parties. When the debtor corporation appears, however, and consents to such appointment, the court must rely on counsel to inform it as to all the facts. If essential facts are deliberately withheld, counsel may well forfeit his right to practice further, or be otherwise disciplined.\n\n'Notwithstanding the prejudice which this conduct has created, we have approached the question with the understanding that the client's rights rather than attorney's conduct must be the basis for the determination of this litigation.'\n\n But we do not agree with either of the courts below that the vindication of the cause of comity and good faith as between the two courts should be limited to punitive \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 55]\n\u00a0\n proceedings against the lawyer in the state court whose pledge to that court was broken.\n In this country, in which in every state we have courts of concurrent jurisdiction under the federal and the state authority, it is of the highest importance that conflict of jurisdiction should be avoided. It can only be avoided by forbearance and comity, and by enforcing upon the parties and counsel engaged the utmost good faith and the fullest disclosure in one jurisdiction with reference to what are the exact facts relevant to litigation in a corresponding case in the other. This is especially true with respect to receiverships. The desire of those who represent an embarrassed corporation to seek a refuge from active and urgent creditors under the protecting arm of an officer of the court, leads to strenuous efforts to frame a case which may under equity practice justify a receiver. More than this, circumstances which should have no influence lead the parties in interest to prefer one court to another in the selection of the person to be appointed as receiver, with the hope on behalf of those in charge of the embarrassed corporation that the appointment may fall to one whose conduct will be in sympathy with, rather than antagonistic to, the previous management of the corporation, in the hands of which the embarrassment has arisen. As the Court of Appeals says, there should be no 'friendly' receiverships, because the receiver is an officer of the court and should be as free from 'friendliness' to a party as should the court itself. Nor should there be any competition or rivalry on the part of the two courts themselves in regard to assuming jurisdiction. The temptation of the exercise of power and patronage in the selection of receivers and the management of great businesses under the court should not be a feather's weight in prompting court action. Each court should examine with nicety the question of the right of the parties to have \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 56]\n\u00a0\n a receiver and should advise itself in regard to the circumstances making it its duty to exercise this delicate jurisdiction. If the court finds that by misrepresentation or by a false pledge another court has delayed action by which the possession of the res would have been taken before the application in hand was made, it should insist that the parties and counsel who have misled the other court must give that court full opportunity to remedy the wrong done. What was done here in delaying the state court and inducing the federal court to act without a full disclosure of what had been done in the state court, was a fraud, not only upon the state court, but upon the federal court itself, and, when the federal court learned the method by which its jurisdiction to appoint a receiver had been invoked, it should have denied to those who were guilty the further use of its jurisdiction until after the state court had been given an opportunity to exercise the jurisdiction which it was entitled to exercise, even to taking possession of the property. As we have already said, there was, when the District Court herein came to know the facts, no party before it who was not to be charged with a knowledge of how its jurisdiction had been secured.\n It is quite true, as already said, that if there had been no chicanery in the delay of the proceeding in the state court, the difference between the two proceedings would have justified the retention of the jurisdiction by the federal court. But the two proceedings, while not the same, were closely related, and the proceeding in the state court must by the subsequent insolvency have resulted in reframing in the state court the pleadings so as to make it a creditor's bill. Hence they were closely enough related to call upon the federal court to refuse thereafter to continue jurisdiction through its receiver, and to surrender custody of the res to the receivers of the state court. Such action we deem to have been that which the comity \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 57]\n\u00a0\n and the good faith of a federal court owed to the state court.\n But now the condition has changed, and the rights of innocent creditors who have since become parties are involved, the court and the receiver have proceeded to administer the property, have found it necessary to issue receiver's certificates, and have paid them, have sold some of the property and have made some distribution to the creditors. It would be in some ways easier to allow the settlement to go on as it is, but this would not comport with the obligation of a federal court to observe and emphasize the highest good faith and comity towards state courts in matters where the two have concurrent jurisdiction. We therefore shall direct the district court to reverse its action in denying the motion to surrender through its receivers the property of the estate still in its custody to the state court receivers. But the surrender should be only on condition that the state court receivers produce an order from the state court confirming all that has been done in the sale of the property, the disposition of the assets and the distribution thereof as if it had been by its own decree and shall so shape the pleadings and its orders that the case may proceed in the state court as a creditor's bill and a liquidation of all the debts, to enable it to proceed to the complete distribution of all remaining assets in liquidation, as it would have had to do, in view of the insolvency, in a continued administration under the stockholder's bill. The federal court should, before surrender, fix and pay the compensation due to its officers for the work done by them, and, in doing so, should take care to fix the compensation within limits which are plainly reasonable. After this and other preliminaries are attended to, all the assets then in the hands of the receiver of the federal court shall be turned over for further and complete distribution in the suit in the superior court of Cook county. If such an order of the state court, as is \n\n[276 U.S. 36, 58]\n\u00a0\n herein prescribed, is not entered in that court and produced in the federal court in a seasonable time, the pending administration in the federal court under the creditor's bill shall continue.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals and of the District Court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Gesas: If the court please, this is a bill filed by a stockholder, seeking the appointment of a receiver, for the Boone Woolen Mills, Inc.

TINDLE(1928)\nNo. 341\nArgued: March 7, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. James Walton, of Pittsburgh, pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Before 1892 the late Philander C. Knox built a dwelling house in Pittsburgh, at a total cost for land and buildings of $172,000. He occupied the house as a residence until 1901, when, circumstances requiring his residence elsewhere, he leased the property at a stipulated rental. He continued so to lease it from October 1st in that year until 1920, when it was sold for $73,000. The fair market value of the property on March 1, 1913, was $120,000. Its value in 1901 does not appear. In his income tax return for 1920 he deducted from gross income the difference between the selling price of the property and its March 1, 1913, value, less depreciation from that date to the date of sale. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and assessed a correspondingly increased tax, which was paid under protest. The present suit was brought in the District Court for Western Pennsylvania to recover the additional tax assessed. The trial was to the court, a jury having been waived by written stipulation. Judgment was given for the collector (Tindle v. Heiner (D. C.) 17 F. (2d) 522), which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Tindle v. Heiner, 18 F. (2d) 452). \n\n[276 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n The tax was assessed under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. Section 214 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 g) specifies deductions which may be made from gross income in computing the tax and subsection (a) 5 permits the deduction of\n'losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, if incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with the trade or business.'\n\n Section 215 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 gg) provides that:\n'In computing net income no deduction shall in any case be allowed in respect of (a) personal, living, or family expenses.'\n\n Treasury Regulations 45, promulgated April 17, 1919, and in force during 1920, provide:\n'Art. 141. ... A loss in the sale of an individual's residence is not deductible.'\n\n This was amended on January 28, 1921, to read:\n'... A loss in the sale of residential property is not deductible unless the property was purchased or constructed by the taxpayer with a view to its subsequent sale for pecuniary profit.'\n\n This regulation has remained unchanged under the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926. See article 141 of Regulations 62, Regulations 65, and Regulations 69.\n That the exchange value of a dwelling house may increase or diminish is a consideration not usually overlooked by one who purchases it for residential purposes, but the quoted regulations appear to assume that the acquisition of such property cannot be a transaction for profit within the meaning of subsection (a) 5 of section 214, if the dominating purpose of it is the use of the property for a home. The correctness of that view is not before us, for there is no finding that the taxpayer built his dwelling with any hope or expectation of profit. See Appeal of D'Oench, 3 B. T. A. 24.\n But the findings amply support the view of the Court of Appeals that the purpose to use the property as a residence of the taxpayer came to an end when it was leased \n\n[276 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n in 1901, and that from that date until it was sold 19 years later it was devoted exclusively to the production of a profit in the form of net rentals. It is not questioned that if in 1901 the property had been purchased for that use or inherited and so used the loss might have been deducted, but it is said, as the District Court held, that the only transaction entered into with respect to the property was the purchase of the land and the erection of the house, regardless of the use which might afterwards be made of it, and that these acts did not appear to be a transaction entered into for profit.\n But the words 'any transaction' as used in subsection (a) 5, are not a technical phrase, or one of art. They must therefore be taken in their usual sense, and, so taken, they are, we think, broad enough to embrace at least any action or business operation, such as that with which we are now concerned, by which property previously acquired is devoted exclusively to the production of taxable income. We can perceive no reason why they should not be so taken unless that construction is inconsistent with the purpose or with particular provisions of the act. Section 214, read as a whole, discloses plainly a general purpose to permit deductions of capital losses wherever the capital investment is used to produce taxable income, and the inclusion of the present deduction in those described in subsection (a) 5 would seem to be entirely harmonious with that purpose.\n But it is pointed out that section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918 ( Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 bb), prescribing the method of computing gain or loss upon the sale of property, makes value as of March 1, 1913, or cost if acquired later, the basis of the computation. It is said that this is inconsistent with the use of the market value of the property at the date of rental as the basis of the computation, which would be necessary if the construction contended for were given to subsection \n\n[276 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n (a) 5, and that in any case a computation on that basis would involve administrative difficulties in determining the value, which should lead to a different interpretation.\n But it is obvious that section 202 is not all inclusive. The same and no greater inconsistency and difficulty arise in the case of property acquired by gift, bequest or devise, when market value at the time of acquisition by the donee and not cost is necessarily the basis of computing the tax. That in such cases the difference between the sale price and market value at the date of acquisition, if after March 1, 1913, is deductible under subsection (a) 5, is not questioned. The ascertainment of market value of the property at that date would not seem to involve any greater administrative difficulty than the asscertainment of market value on March 1, 1913. Section 202 itself provides that in the case of exchange the property shall be taken at this fair market value, and under the act of 1918 this was likewise provided for in the case of property acquired by gift, devise or bequest, by Regulations 45, art. 1562, which was incorporated in the later acts. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227 ,  202(a) 2 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 bb); Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253,  204(a) 2 (26 USCA  935(a) 2; Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 bb); Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9,  204(a) 2 (26 USCA  935(a) 2).\n For the purpose of computing the loss resulting from this particular transaction we think it must stand on the same footing as losses resulting from a similar use of property acquired by gift or devise and that whenever needful the fair value of the property at the time when the transaction for profit was entered into may be taken as the basis for computing the loss.\n Article 141 of the Regulations presents no necessary inconsistency with the construction of section 214(a) 5, contended for by the respondent. The article both in its original and in its amended form obviously refers to the \n\n[276 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n sale of residential property of the taxpayer, that is to say, property used by him as a residence up to the time of the sale. Only if that is its meaning can it be reconciled with the Treasury rulings that losses on the sale of residential property acquired by gift, devise or bequest and devoted to rental purposes may be deducted. The loss here has resulted from the sale of property not used for residential purposes by the taxpayer, and the transaction entered into for profit and resulting in the loss was not the purchase of the property but its appropriation to rental purposes. The article of the regulations by its terms has no application to a loss so incurred.\n The findings show that the property was sold for less than its cost and the loss deducted was the difference between its March 1, 1913, value and the sale price. The only loss deductible here under subsection (a) 5 is one incurred in a transaction entered into for profit, later than the date of purchase. For all that appears from the findings the loss which had occurred between the date of purchase and March 1, 1913, may have occurred before the property was devoted to rental purposes. For that reason the findings do not support the judgment. The cause should be remanded for a new trial so that the value of the property as of October 1, 1901, when rented, may be found. If that value is larger than the value of March 1, 1913, the deduction made below should be allowed; if less, only the difference, if any, between its then value and the sale price should be allowed.

Any excess so received over the cost of his stock to the stockholder, or over its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, if acquired prior thereto, is a taxable profit. A distribution in liquidation of the assets and business of a corporation, which is a return to the stockholder of the value of his stock upon a surrender of his interest in the corporation, is distinguishable from a dividend paid by a going corporation out of current earnings or accumulated surplus when declared by the directors in their discretion, which is in the nature of a recurrent return upon the stock.'2\n\n These Regulations, with a change made in 1921 as to the second sentence of article 1548,3 are still in effect so far as distributions in liquidation under the act are concerned. \n\n[276 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n Each of the Hellmans owned one-half of the capital stock of a corporation which had a net surplus of $46,466.27, of which at least $31, 545.58 consisted of earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. In 1919, the corporation was dissolved and liquidated and its assets were distributed to the stockholders. In this liquidation each of the Hellmans realized a gain of $15,004.55 in the distribution made out of the earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. Each in his income tax return claimed that this was a 'dividend' which under section 216(a) being Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 h was to be credited on his net income for the purpose of the normal tax. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ruling these were gains subject to the normal tax, disallowed the claims and made the additional assessments here involved.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is in direct conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Langstaff v. Lucas (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 1022\n\n\n The controlling question is whether the amounts distributed to the stockholders out of the earnings and profits accumulated by the corporation since February 28, 1913, were to be treated under section 201( a) as 'dividends,' which were exempt from the normal tax; or, under section 201(c) as payments made by the corporation in exchange for its stock, which were taxable 'as other gains or profits.'\n It is true that if section 201(a) stood alone its broad definition of the term 'dividend' would apparently include distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a \n\n[276 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n corporation-although this term, as generally understood and used, refers to the recurrent return upon stock paid to stockholders by a going corporation in the ordinary course of business, which does not reduce their stock holdings and leaves them in a position to enjoy future returns upon the same stock. See Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 344-346, 38 S. Ct. 543, and Langstaff v. Lucas (D. C.) 9 F.(2d) 691, 694.\n However, when section 201(a) and section 201(c) are read together, under the long-established rule that the intention of the lawmaker is to be deduced from a view of every material part of the statute, Kohlsaat v. Murphy, \n96 U.S. 153\n, 159, we think it clear that the general definition of a dividend in section 201(a) was not intended to apply to distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a corporation, but that it was intended that such distributions should be governed by section 201(c), which, dealing specifically with such liquidation provided that the amounts distributed should 'be treated as payments in exchange for stock' and that any gain realized thereby should be taxed to the stockholders 'as other gains or profits.' This brings the two sections into entire harmony, and gives to each its natural meaning and due effect. The Treasury Regulations correctly interpreted the act as making section 201(a) applicable to a distribution made by a going corporation to its stockholders in the ordinary course of business, and section 201(c) applicable to a distribution made to stockholders in liquidation of the corporation. And this is in accord with the rulings of the Board of Tax Appeals. Appeal of Greenwood, 1 B. T. A. 291, 295; Appeal of Chandler, 3 B. T. A. 146, 149.\n The gains realized by the stockholders from the distribution of the assets in liquidation were subject to the normal tax in like manner as if they had sold their stock to third persons. The objection that this results in double taxation of the accumulated earnings and profits is no more \n\n[276 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n available in the one case than it would have been in the other. See Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanki, \n255 \nU.S. 509\n, 41 S. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305; Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S. Ct. 390. When, as here, Congress has clearly expressed its intention, the statute must be sustained even though double taxation results. See Patton v. Brady, \n184 \nU.S. 608\n, 22 S.

Wagner and Thomas G. Long, both of Detroit, Mich., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 537, 543]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Isadore Levin, of Detroit, Mich., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, vice president of the payee and acting for it, sued Mrs. Orloff, in the circuit court, Wayne county, Michigan, on her promissory note, payable to the Commercial Investment Trust, or order, executed at Detroit, Mich., July 22, 1921. She defended upon the ground, among others, that the payee was a foreign corporation within the meaning of the Michigan statutes; that it had not complied therewith, and, consequently could not maintain the action. Both \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 544]\n\u00a0\n the trial and Supreme Court of the state sustained this defense.\n Relevant provisions of the statutes follow (Compiled Laws Mich. 1915):\n'Sec. 9063. It shall be unlawful for any corporation organized under the laws of any state of the United States, except the state of Michigan, or of any foreign country, to carry on its business in this state, until it shall have procured from the secretary of state of this state a certificate of authority for that purpose. ...'\n\n'Sec. 9068. No foreign corporation, subject to the provisions of this act, shall be capable of making a valid contract in this state until it shall have fully complied with the requirements of this act, and at the time holds an unrevoked certificate to that effect from the secretary of state.'\n\n'Sec. 9071. The term 'corporations' as used in this act shall be construed to include all associations, partnership associations and jointstock companies having any of the powers or privileges of corporations, not possessed by individuals or partnerships, under whatever term or designation they may be defined and known in the state where organized.'\n\n The Commercial Investment Trust-hereinafter the Trust-is of the class commonly known as 'Massachusetts trusts' or 'common-law trusts.' The following statement sufficiently indicates the general features of the lengthy 'agreement and declaration of trust' under which it was organized at Boston, Mass., March 29, 1915\n\n\n The business of the association shall be conducted under the name specified for the trustees in their collective capacity-the Commercial Investment Trust. They may adopt another. Seven are designated; their successors shall be elected for terms of two years at annual shareholders' meetings, each share being entitled to one vote, which may be cast by proxy.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 537, 545]\n\u00a0\n Wide powers are granted to the trustees to buy and sell stocks, bonds, negotiable securities, personal and real property, to loan money, etc ., and generally to manage and conduct the trust as fully as if they were the absolute owners of the estate; also they shall have power, but without obligation on their part, to execute any and all instruments and to do any and all things not inconsistent with the provisions hereof, the execution or performance of which they may deem expedient. They may appoint and define the duties of officers and agents. 'But the trustees shall not have any power or authority to borrow money on the credit or on behalf of the shareholders or to make any contract on their behalf for repayment of any money raised by mortgage, pledge, charge or other incumbrances in pursuance of the provisions hereof, or to make any contract or incur any liability whatever on behalf of the shareholders or binding them personally.'\n'Trustees shall hold the legal title to, and have the absolute and exclusive control of, all property at any time belonging to this trust subject only to the specific limitations herein contained; they shall have the absolute control, management and disposition thereof.'\n\n'The death or resignation of the trustees, or any of them, shall not operate to annul the trust or to revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of this instrument.'\n\n'Every note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate, share or undertaking and every other act or thing whatsoever executed or done by the trustees or any of them in connection with the trust hereby created, shall be conclusively taken to have been executed or done only in their or his capacity of trustee or trustees under this agreement and such trustee or trustees shall not be personally liable thereon.'\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 537, 546]\n\u00a0\n The trustees and shareholders are exempted from personal liability. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Shareholders' meetings shall be held annually for the purpose of electing trustees. Interest in the estate shall be evidenced solely by certificates for participation shares, to be regarded as personal property. A shareholder's death shall not operate to determine the trust nor entitle the decedent's representative to an accounting or to take action in the courts or elsewhere, against the trustees. Shareholders shall have no title in the trust property or right to call for partition, division, or accounting. The \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 547]\n\u00a0\n trustees shall have no power to call upon shareholders for any sum of money or assessment whatever, except such as they may agree to pay.\n'The trustees, may, from time to time, distribute to the shareholders such receipts or other parts of the trust estate as they shall determine. The amount and conditions of such payments shall be determined by the trustees.'\n\n'For any of the purposes of the trust the number of shares may, from time to time, be increased or reduced by the trustees. In case the number of shares is increased, the additional shares shall be issued and disposed of upon such terms and in such manner as the trustees may determine.'\n\n The trust shall continue until the death of the last survivor of seven named individuals.\n Concerning voluntary associations, chapter 182, Gen. Laws Massachusetts 1921 (volume 2, p. 2077), provides:\n'Sec. 2. The trustees of an association shall file a copy of the written instrument or declaration of trust creating it with the commissioner and with the clerk of every town where such association has a usual place of business. ...'\n\n'Sec. 6. An association may be sued in an action at law for debts and other obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the trustees, or by the duly authorized agents of such trustees, or by any duly authorized officer of the association, in the performance of their respective duties under such written instruments or declarations of trusts, and for any damages to persons or property resulting from the negligence of such trustees, agents or officers acting in the performance of their respective duties, and its property shall be subject to attachment and execution in like manner as if it were a corporation, and service of process upon one of the trustees shall be sufficient.' Gen. Acts Mass. 1916, c. 184. \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 548]\n\u00a0\n The Massachusetts courts give effect to agreements like the one here described, recognize the entity of associations organized thereunder, and hold both trustees and shareholders exempt from personal liability. See Hussey v. Arnold, 185 Mass. 202, 70 N. E. 87; Williams v. Milton, 215 Mass. 1, 102 N. E. 355, and cases cited; Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 106 N. E. 1009.\n\n It was held by the court below that the Trust must be regarded as a corporation within intendment of the Michigan statutes which could not lawfully carry on local business within the state or make valid contracts in connection therewith without having complied with prescribed requirements. There was no attempt to comply therewith.\n Plaintiff in error insists that, as construed by the Supreme Court, the statutes of Michigan deny to the trustees, collectively called 'Commercial Investment Trust,' the benefits of section 2, article 4 of the Constitution:\n'The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.'\n\n Also that they deprive the trustees of property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and restrain interstate commerce.\n It is settled doctrine that a corporation organized under the laws of one state may not carry on local business within another without the latter's permission, either express or implied. A corporation is not a mere collection of individuals capable of claiming all benefits assured them by section 2, article 4, of the Constitution. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 584, 586, 587; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Western Turf Association v. Greenberg, \n204 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 27 S. Ct. 384. See, also, Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 77. In the first of the causes just cited, Chief Justice Taney, for the court said:\n'It is true that in the case referred to (United States Bank v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61) this court decided that in a question of jurisdiction they might look to the char- \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 549]\n\u00a0\n acter of the persons composing a corporation; and if it appeared that they were citizens of another state, and the fact was set forth by proper averments, the corporation might sue in its corporate name in the courts of the United States. ...\n\n'But the principle has never been extended any farther than it was carried in that case, and has never been supposed to extend to contracts made by a corporation, especially in another sovereignty. If it were held to embrace contracts, and that the members of a corporation were to be regarded as individuals, carrying on business in their corporate name, and therefore entitled to the privileges of citizens, in matters of contract, it is very clear that they must, at the same time, take upon themselves the liabilities of citizens, and be bound by their contracts in like manner. The result of this would be to make a corporation a mere partnership in business, in which each stockholder would be liable, to the whole extent of his property, for the debts of the corporation; and he might be sued for them, in any state in which he might happen to be found.\n\n'The clause of the Constitution referred to certainly never intended to give to the citizens of each state the privileges of citizens in the several states, and at the same time to exempt them from the liabilities which the exercise of such privileges would bring upon individuals who were citizens of the state. This would be to give the citizens of other states far higher and greater privileges than are enjoyed by the citizens of the state itself. Besides, it would deprive every state of all control over the extent of corporate franchises proper to be granted in the state; and corporations would be chartered in one, to carry on their operations in another. It is impossible, upon any sound principle, to give such a construction to the article in question.\n\n'Whenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity-of the artificial being created \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 550]\n\u00a0\n by the charter-and not the contract of the individual members. The only rights it can claim are the rights which are given to it in that character, and not the rights which belong to its members as citizens of a state; and we now proceed to inquire what rights the plaintiffs in error, a corporation created by Georgia, could lawfully exercise in another state, and whether the purchase of the bill of exchange on which this suit is brought was a valid contract, and obligatory on the parties.'\n\n Obviously the trust here involved, is a creature of local law which demands the privilege of carrying on business in Michigan as an association-an entity-clothed with peculiar rights and privileges under a deed of settlement undertaking to exempt all of the associates from personal liability. As in the case of a corporation and for the same general reasons it cannot rely upon rights guaranteed to the individuals.\n Whether a given association is called a corporation, partnership, or trust, is not the essential factor in determining the powers of a state concerning it. The real nature of the organization must be considered. If clothed with the ordinary functions and attributes of a corporation, it is subject to similar treatment. This was distinctly pointed out in Oliver v. The Liverpool & London Life & Fire Ins. Co., 100 Mass. 531, affirmed here sub nom. Liverpool Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566. See, also, Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 162\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144\n, 44 S. Ct. 462; Burk-Waggoner Oil Ass'n v. Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110\n, 46 S.

Paine, 137 Wash. 566, 243 P. 2, 247 P. 476.\n Upon the facts disclosed, the court below held the Trust was carrying on the business of dealing in negotiable notes within the state of Michigan, and we find no reason for rejecting that conclusion. Such business is not interstate commerce. Nathan v. Louisiana, 8 How. 73; Paul v. Vir- \n\n[277 U.S. 537, 551]\n\u00a0\n ginia, 8 Wall. 168; Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 162\n, 27 S.

Ct. 385.\n What we have already said shows plainly enough the insubstantial nature of the suggestion that the questioned statutes deprive the Trust, its trustees or members, of property without due process of law.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No recourse shall at any time be had under or upon any note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate, undertaking, obligation, covenant, or agreement issued or executed by the trustees under or pursuant to the terms of this agreement or in managing the trust estate, or by the executive committee or any member thereof, or by any officer or agent of the trustees, or by reason of anything done or omitted to be done by them or any of them against the trustees individually or against the members of the committee or against any such officer or agent or against any shareholder, or the holder of any other security issued by the trustees, either directly or indirectly, by legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any suit or otherwise, except only to compel the proper application or distribution of the trust estate, it being expressly understood and agreed that this agreement and all obligations and instruments executed thereunder are executed pursuant hereto by the trustees and any acts done or omitted to be done by them are solely the obligations, instruments, acts and omissions of or in (folio 204) respect of the trust estate and that all the obligations, instruments, liabilities, covenants and agreements, acts and omissions of the trustees as trustees shall be enforced against and be satisfied out of the trust estate only, or such part thereof as shall, under the terms and provisions of this agreement, be liable for or chargeable therewith, and all personal and individual liability of the trustees, except as above stated, and of the members of the executive committee, and all officers and agents, and of the shareholders and all beneficiaries of the trust, are hereby expressly waived and negatived. The trustees and their agents are not authorized to contract any debt or do anything which will charge the shareholders or bind them personally.' \n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERKNESS v. IRION(1928)\n\nArgued: October 8, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and Maurice Bower Saul and Allen S. Olmsted, 2d, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Percy Saint, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought into a federal court for Louisiana by Herkness, an owner of natural gas wells, to enjoin the \n\n[278 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner of Conservation and the Attorney General of that State from interfering with the erection, on plaintiff's land, and the operation, of a factory for the manufacture of carbon black from natural gas. The bill alleges that a number of other persons are now engaged in that business and have been for many years with the sanction of the Department of Conservation; that it had been its practice to require persons about to engage in such manufacture to apply for a permit; that one of its rules declares unlawful the erection of such a factory without having first obtained one; that plaintiff was refused a permit; that the sole ground of refusal was the policy recently announced by the Commissioner not to issue a permit for the erection of any new carbon black plants and to gradually reduce the amount of gas which holders of permits to operate existing plants can utilize for that purpose; and that this policy has become a fixed rule of administration. The bill charges that the order refusing to issue a permit to the plaintiff is void, because in excess of the powers conferred by the statutes or which could be conferred under the constitution of the State; and also because it violates the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A restraining order and an interlocutory injunction, as well as a permanent injunction, were sought. There were adequate allegations of threatened irreparable injury.\n The District Judge issued a restraining order. The hearing upon the application for an interlocutory injunction was had before three judges, under paragraph 266 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 USCA  380); and the case was later submitted by agreement as upon final hearing. The court denied the injunction and dismissed the bill, 11 F.(2d) 386; but later granted a restraining order pending the appeal. As the bill challenged the validity under the Federal Constitution of an order of an administrative board of the State, \n\n[278 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n the District Court had jurisdiction under section 266, Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S. Ct. 353, and this Court has jurisdiction on direct appeal. We have no occasion to consider any of the constitutional questions presented. For, in our opinion, the statutes do not purport to confer upon the Commissioner power to refuse a permit to a person able and willing to comply with the requirements prescribed by the statute. See Greene v. Louisville & Interurban Railroad Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, App. Cas. 1917E, 88; Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 388, 295\n, 41 S. Ct. 272.\n The conservation of natural resources has been the subject of much legislation in Louisiana. \n1\n The possible wastefulness of the use of natural gas in the manufacture of carbon black was recognized; and the Legislature dealt fully with this use by Act 252 of 1924, which, in effect, embodies the provisions of Act 91 of 1922. State v. Thrift Oil & Gas Co., 162 La. 165, 193, 110 So. 188, 51 A. L. R. 261. No law declares such use necessarily wasteful. Nor has the State purported to confer upon the Commissioner power to refuse a permit to new concerns and to restrict the use to the persons already engaged in the manufacture of carbon black. On the contrary, the use is expressly sanctioned in section 1 of Act 91 of 1922, which declares, 'that natural gas may be used in the manufacture of carbon black under the conditions as fixed and imposed by the provisions of' that act. And it is to those conditions and the means of ensuring their observance that the other provisions of the Act relate. Section 2 thereof directs the Commissioner to determine 'what percentage of consumption of natural gas produced by each gas well may be used in the manufacture of carbon black, ... which percentage shall not be less than fifteen per cent. and not more \n\n[278 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n than twenty per cent. of the potential capacity of such well. ...' By section 3 he is authorized to reduce the consumption of natural gas used in the manufacture of carbon black below that minimum 'after promulgation for sixty days of an order to that effect, whenever (and only whenever) it is actually necessary to do so in obtaining an adequate supply of natural gas for domestic heating and lighting purposes in the State of Louisiana, and for manufacturing plants, industries and enterprises located and operated within the State of Louisiana, other than those engaged in the manufacture of carbon black. ...' Other sections of the 1922 Act define the conditions under which natural gas can be burned into carbon black. There is not even a contention that a condition existed which would have authorized the issue of an order reducing the minimum percentage of use, pursuant to section 3 of Act 91 of 1922\n\n\n Many detailed provisions concerning permits for the building of plants to burn natural gas into carbon black were added by Act 252 of 1924. But the additional provisions, and the specific powers there conferred upon the Commissioner, deal only with regulation of the use. The legislation contemplates, not 'Coast Guard' is laid hold of to show that the further issue of permits to all who will 'completely abide by and comply with all of the provisions of this Act, and with all the rules and regulations of the Commissioner of Conservation established under the provisions of this Act.' Section 5. And it expressly provides that 'The authority given the Commissioner of Conservation by this Act shall in no sense be understood to supersede or nulify any of the provisions of this Act, or any other act of this State, but shall be cumulative and in aid thereof.' Section 11.\n As it is clear that the refusal of the Commissioner was not justified by any statutory provision, we have no occasion to consider the limitations imposed by the constitu- \n\n[278 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n tion of the State upon discriminatory action2 and upon delegation of legislative power to an executive department. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act 71 of 1906; Act 144 of 1908; Acts 172, 190, 196 and 283 of 1910; Act 127 of 1912; Acts 268 and 270 of 1918; Act 250 of 1920. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See State of Louisiana v.

Holland Furniture Co., 18 F.(2d) 387. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Perkins Glue Co. v. Gould Manufacturing Co., 292 F. 596, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Perkins Glue Co. v. Standard Furniture Co., 287 F. 109, had previously held the patent not infringed by the same product. \n1\n This court granted certiorari. \n275 \nU.S. 512\n, 48 S. Ct. 28, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The patent is entitled 'A Patent for Starch Glue and a Method of Making It.' Perkins was the first to make successfully a starch glue suitable for wood veneering and similar uses. Glue made from animal substances, known as animal glue, has long been in common use as an adhesive, and is especially adapted to use in wood veneering, in which thin sheets or layers of wood are fastened together by the use of an adhesive bonding material. The characteristic qualities of animal glue, making it peculiarly suitable for that use, are a low absorptiveness of water and a consequent high degree of fluidity, facilitating its application by mechanical means, high elasticity, and great tensile strength. A high water content, characteristic of other adhesive preparations, delays drying, warps the wood, and when dry leaves too little bonding material to secure the requisite strength. In practice, animal glue is made suitably fluid for use in wood veneering by the addition of a critically small amount of water, three parts by weight to one of glue.\n Long before Perkins' experiments, adhesive paste or mucilage made from starch was well known. The Gerard patent (1874, Belgian, No. 34,869) and the Dornemann \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n patent (1893, French, No. 232,781) described a process of producing an adhesive or glue by dissolving starch in a solution of caustic alkali. The suitablity of starch as a glue base in this and other processes depends upon its water absorptive quality, which varies with the starch of different plants, and under varying conditions with the starch of the same plant. Because of their high water absorption, glues produced from starch, before Perkins, were too viscous, and hence required too large an admixture of water for use successfully as a wood-veneering glue. The controlling difficulty to be overcome in the development of a starch glue suitable for veneering was what may be called the normally large water absorptive quality of starch, corresponding to the viscosity of the resultant glue, a reduction of the one effecting a reduction in the other.\n It has long been known that the viscosity or the water absorptive quality of starches may be reduced by chemical treatment known as degeneration, in which changes in the arrangement of the atoms in the starch molecules are effected by use of a catalytic agent. In 1906 Gerson & Sachse (German, No. 167275) patented a process for the preparation of a starch base for glue manufacture by degenerating starch by the use of oxidizing agents in the presence of an alkali. But the resultant glue from this and other processes was not suitable for use in the wood-working trades. To make it sufficiently fluid for convenient use required too large an admixture of water, four parts or more to one of glue, so that the wood was warped, and, when dried, the glue was not sufficiently tenacious to be used successfully as a substitute in that manufacture for animal glue.\n The Perkins patent described a process for making glue from starch and a resultant product 'as good as animal glue,' 'which will have the great practical advantage that it may be practically used for the same purposes as the best animal glue.' The process consisted of two steps. \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n The basic material was a suitable raw starch, preferably starch made from the cassava root, and the first step was concerned with its conversion or degeneration so as to make a 'glue base,' with lower water absorptivity than ordinary untreated starch. This was to be accomplished by combining the basic raw material with oxidizing agents and subjecting them to heat. The method was that described in the Gerson & Sachse patent, and was not new. The characteristic feature of this first step, as described by Perkins, was not the manner of degeneration but its degree. The degeneration of the raw cassava starch was to be carried to a point just short of its conversion into dextrine, a soluble starch, which, because of that property, is of little value in glue manufacture. The patent in its reissued form stated with precision the particular degree to which the water absorptive properties of the starch might be reduced in the preparation of a suitable glue base and described with particularity tests ( the '9 to 1 boil up' test and the 170 test) for ascertaining when that stage of degeneration had been reached.\n The second step in the process consisted in the treatment of the glue base, as prepared by the first step, by the addition of three parts or less of water by weight to one of the glue base and a specified percentage of cellulose solvent such as caustic potash. This process was described by the Gerard and Dornemann patents and was not new. The fundamental ideas of the process patent might be expressed in simple terms as follows: Glue made by dissolving ordinary starch in an alkaline solution of three parts of water (the quantity with which the wood-working industry is accustomed) is too thick. Glue made from overdegenerated starch is too weak. Between the extremes there is a range of degeneration within which the starch base, when dissolved in \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n caustic potash, will produce glue of ample fluidity without loss of tensile strength or other qualities characteristic of animal glue.\n The product claims, of which more will be said presently, was for the resultant glue, in substance for a starch glue having substantially the properties of animal glue.\n The patent has thirty-eight claims, divisible into groups. One group covers the process of producing the degenerated starch glue base, the first step process, already described. One group embraces the glue base product produced by the first step process. Another group includes the process of dissolving the starch base, by the use of alkaline solvents, the second process step; another, the combination of the two process steps; and, finally, the group with which we are now concerned is based upon the ultimate product, the glue itself. Three of the claims embraced in this ultimate product group are the only ones now in suit, 28, 30 and 31. They are as follows:\n'28. A glue comprising cassava carbohydrate rendered semifluid by digestion and having substantially the properties of animal glue.'\n\n'30. A wood and fiber glue formed of a starchy carbohydrate or its equivalent by union therewith of about 3 parts or less by weight of water and alkali metal hydroxid.\n\n'31. A wood and fiber glue containing amylaceous material as a base dissolved without acid in about three parts of water or less, and being viscous, semifluid and unjellified.'\n\n Of these the broadest in terms is No. 28, but it appears that a glue thus composed will not have 'substantially the properties of animal glue' unless containing only the small amount of water specified in claim 30. We may take it also that an article which is 'wood and fiber glue' as described in the specifications will be 'viscous, semifluid, and unjellified' as described in claim 31, and will also have substantially the properties of animal glue as specified in claim 28, so that in point of substance the \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n product claims in suit are for a starch glue which, combined with about three parts or less by weight of water, will have substantially the same properties as animal glue.\n With respect to the other or nonproduct groups of claims, respondent, in consequence of earlier litigation, has filed a disclaimer. Brief reference must be made to both the litigation and the disclaimer. The respondent brought an infringement suit in the Northern District of Illinois against the Solva Company, asserting an infringement of claims in each of the five groups by the product of that company, comprising in part at least a raw cassava starch glue base which, for present purposes, may be taken as identical with the product of the petitioner. Upon appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Solva Waterproof Glue Co. v. Perkins Glue Co., 251 F. 64, that court rendered an opinion, in some respects obscure, which has given rise to widely differing views as to its effect. In considering the present question, we may assume that the court below was right in saying of that opinion:\n'It held that the claims to the first step of the process and to the product resultant therefrom-the glue base-were anticipated by Gerson & Sachse, and hence that the glue base, as a product and as the foundation of the second step in Perkins' process, was an old and unpatentable product. It found that Perkins' glue had the novelty and merit claimed for it. It sustained the claims to the compound twostep process, and, to some extent, at least, the claims to the ultimate product, and did not sustain the claims to the second-step process. No attention was paid to any distinctions in the different kinds of solva base that were involved. Its treatment of the process claims to the second-step process is open to the interpretation-and we think it the right one-that the court considered those claims broad enough to cover the specified treatment as applied to any starch base, however \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n high in viscosity, and employing water to any extent, and even though the product would not approximate Perkins' glue, and hence thought them invalid. If that view is correct, they were too broad. At the conclusion of its opinion the court said that the decree below 'sustaining the claims for the glue base and (first step) product; and for the so-called second-step as such, is reversed, and that part of it which upholds the claims of the patent for the final process and the resultant product is affirmed.\"\n\n We may assume also the correctness of the view of the court below that the effect of this decision was to sustain broadly the claim to the resultant product, the glue described in claims 28, 30, and 31, as distinguished from the intermediate product which was the resultant of the first step and was found to be old, and that the product claims thus upheld included a starch glue having substantially the properties of animal glue whether made by the employment of both steps of the compound process or not.\n As a result of this decree, the plaintiff filed a disclaimer of all the claims for the glue base itself and all those for the first process step. It also disclaimed from the second process step 'any process of making glue, excepting where the starch or starchy product or carbohydrate subjected to the process, is degenerated to the extent described (in the patent), whereby the process results in the good as animal glue described' in the patent. Again we assume that the court below was right in saying that the effect of the disclaimer as to the second-step claims was to limit them to a process where the material with which the second process step begins is any starch in fact degenerated to the point necessary to produce the result at which the second process step is aimed, whether the degeneration is effected by the first step or other artificial process or the suitable starch is a natural agricultural product, sufficiently degenerated without chemical treatment and purchasable in commercial quantities. \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n The second-step process, as narrowed by the disclaimer, consists in the selection of a starch suitably degenerated, no matter how, and the treatment of it with an alkali as in the Gerard and Dornemann patents, but by the terms of the disclaimer only such starches are suitable; that is to say, fall within the range of selection, which, when treated by the second- step process, will product a glue as good as animal glue for veneering. The use or function of the resultant glue is made the measure or test of the choice of its ingredients.\n Apparently no brand of raw starch which Perkins could procure in commercial quantities when conducting his experiments could be used as a glue base without the artificial degeneration of his first step. But it appears that the defendant has been able to purchase in such quantities a starch which is a natural agricultural product having a low-water absorptiveness and other characteristics making U. S. 222. with this starch, the petitioner employs what is in effect so much of Perkins' second step as is old, by combining the starch with three parts of water or less and approximately 4 per cent. of caustic soda. The mixture, when agitated and heated, produces a glue which petitioner says is heavier than animal glue, but which is used commercially as a substitute for it, and which, for present purposes, may be taken as having substantially the qualities of animal glue. Whether the result may be attributed wholly to reduced viscosity of the starch, due to changed methods of cultivation or manufacture, or in some measure to peculiarities of petitioner's dissolving operation, does not appear.\n Petitioner contends that the raw starch selected and used by it in the manufacture of its product has high water absorptive qualities above the range defined by the patent, not satisfying the tests laid down in the patent for ascertaining whether the appropriate stage for degeneration has been reached for the employment of the second step. As the process claims are not before us, this \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n contention has bearing only upon the broad product claims which are the subject of the present suit. It is the contention of the respondent, and the court below held, that its product claims 28, 30, and 31, concededly broad enough, as stated, to cover the petitioner's product, are valid, and that all starch veneering glues, at least when mixed with three parts of water or less, having substantially the properties of animal glue, infringe the patent whether made by Perkins' process or otherwise.\n We take it, as the respondent argues, that product patents or patents of compositions of matter are distinct from patents of the process by which the product may be produced. The former, if sufficiently described, may exist and be sustained independently of the latter. Providence Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788; Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 301, 318\n, 29 S. Ct. 495. Hence any narrowing of process claims is not necessarily a narrowing of product claims. So much of the claim as is saved from the second step of Perkins' process after the disclaimer, and referred to here as a process claim, is, in fact, only the choice of an ingredient of the glue product, independently of the chemical process of producing it. It was necessary that the Perkins' patent, so far as it is a patent of a composition of matter, should contain some description of the ingredients entering into the composition which would both define the patent, Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 247; Wood v. Underhill, 5 How. 1, 5; Tyler v. Boston, 7 Wall. 327, 330; Bene v. Jeantet, \n129 \nU.S. 683\n, 9 S. Ct. 428; Howard v. Detroit Stove Works, \n150 \nU.S. 164, 167\n, 14 S. Ct. 68, and carry it beyond the previous development of the art. Had Perkins claimed only a glue made of starch dissolved in three parts of water with an alkali, he would not have advanced beyond the Gerard and Dornemann patents and subsequent practice. As his patent discloses, it was well known that ordinary starch treated in this manner produced a thick glue unsuitable for wood veneer- \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 255]\n\u00a0\n ing if made with three parts of water, and a thin glue not strong enough for wood veneering if made with four parts or more of water.\n Perkins' real invention, apart from the combination of his first and second step processes, with which we are not now concerned, was that by the use of a particular kind of starch as an ingredient a new composition of matter was made for which he claimed his patent. Some description of this product was obviously essential to patentability, and Perkins in the reissued patent sought to meet this necessity in two ways. One was to describe the product by describing its characteristic ingredient with particularity. If we look at the specifications, as we may, he did this by indicating the range of water absorptivity or, stated in another way, the degeneration, of the starch ingredient in Perkins' glue. As described, the starch ingredient fell short of dextrine or soluble starch, but was of lower water absorptivity than petitioner's glue base. The glue made of this ingredient within the specified range was a new product. This was invention of a new composition of matter, and was the real contribution Perkins made to the art. As such, it was entitled to the protection of a patent, but as thus described and limited petitioner's product does not infringe.\n To so describe the product is not, as the court below seemed to think, a limitation of product claims by reference to process claims. A patentable process is a method of treatment of certain materials to produce a particular result or product. Cochrane v. Deener, \n94 U.S. 780\n. The description of one does not necessarily embrace the other. Either or both may be patentable. But here we are concerned only with the choice of one ingredient of the product. There can be no description of a composition of matter without some designation of its ingredients. If the selection or choice or designation of an essential ingredient of a composition of matter may be referred to, \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 256]\n\u00a0\n inaccurately as we think, as a process, the 'process' is one inseparable from the composition itself. The description of one necessarily limits the other. Hence the patent of the product cannot extend beyond a product having the designated ingredient. See Giant Powder Co. v. California Powder Works, \n98 U.S. 126\n, 137; Bene v. Jeantet, supra; Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis, \n102 U.S. 222\n\u00a0\n Perkins' second way of describing the starch ingredient of his product was in terms of the use or function of the product itself. The chosen starch ingredient was to possess such qualities that, when combined with three parts of water and with alkali, it would produce a product 'as good as animal glue' for veneering, or having the properties of animal glue; these properties being described in terms of its functions. The ingredient was thus described, not in terms of its own physical characteristics or chemical properties or those of the product, but wholly in terms of the manner of use of the product. Any glue made of a starch base, whatever its composition, water absorptiveness, or other properties, combined with alkali and three parts of water, which has substantially the properties of animal glue, or is as good as animal glue for use in the wood-working trades, is claimed as Perkins' glue. Thus the inventor who advances the art by discovery that a certain defined material may be combined in a product useful for certain purposes seeks to extend his monopoly to any product which may subsequently be made from materials not within any defined range described in the patent, but which is likewise useful for those purposes.\n But an inventor may not describe a particular starch glue which will perform the function of animal glue and then claim all starch glues which have those functions, or even all starch glues made with three parts of water and alkali, since starch glues may be made with three parts of water and alkali that do not have those properties. \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n See the Incandescent Lamp Patent, \n159 \nU.S. 465, 472\n, 16 S. Ct. 75. Revised Stat.  4888 (35 USCA  33; Comp. St.  9432), requires that the patent shall contain a description of the invention 'and of the manner and process of making, constructing, compounding, and using, it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make, construct, compound, and use the same.' One attempting to use or avoid the use of Perkins' discovery as so claimed and described functionally could do so only after elaborate experimentation. Respondents say that laboratory tests would be insufficient, and that 'the best and probably the only satisfactory test is to try it out on a large scale in a furniture or veneering gluing factory.' A claim so broad, if allowed, would operate to enable the inventor, who has discovered that a defined type of starch answers the required purpose, to exclude others from all other types of starch, and so foreclose efforts to discover other and better types. The patent monopoly would thus be extended beyond the discovery, and would discourage rather than promote invention. The Incandescent Lamp Patent, supra, 476 (16 S. Ct. 75). That the patentee may not by claiming a patent on the result or function of a machine extend his patent to devices or mechanisms not described in the patent is well understood. O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 112, 113; Knapp v. Morss, \n150 \nU.S. 221, 228\n, 14 S. Ct. 81; Electric Signal Co. v. Hall Signal Co., \n114 \nU.S. 87\n, 5 S. Ct. 1069; Westinghouse v. Boyden Powre Brake Co., \n170 \nU.S. 537\n, 18 S. Ct. 707; Mitchell v. Tilghman, 19 Wall. 287; Fuller v. Yentzer, \n94 U.S. 288\n; Risdon Iron & Locomotive Works v. Medart, \n158 \nU.S. 68\n, 15 S. Ct. 745. Respondent argues that this principle, applicable to machine patents, is inapplicable to a patent for the composition of matter which is always a result of a process and concededly is patentable as such, but the attempt to broaden product claims by describing the product exclusively in terms of its use or function is subject to the \n\n[277 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n same vice as is the attempt to describe a patentable device or machine in terms of its function. As a description of the invention, it is insufficient, and, if allowed, would extend the monopoly beyond the invention. See Bene v. Jeantet, supra; Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik, \n111 \nU.S. 293\n, 4 S. Ct. 455; Incandescent Lamp Patent, supra; Matheson v. Campbell (C. C. A.) 78 F. 910; American Adamite Co. v. Mesta Machine Co. (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 538.\n So far as respondent seeks to enlarge its product patent by subordinating the patent description of the starch ingredient which the patentee used, and which respondent does not use, to the vague and indefinite description in the three product claims now in suit the patent is subject to the same vice.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Other cases involving the patent in suit are Perkins Glue Co. v.

Mattoon, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alfred Sutro, of San Francisco, Cal., Oscar Lawler, of Los Angeles, Cal., and F. D. Madison, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners are Los Angeles county, and its tax officials-assessor, deputy assessor, collector, and auditor.\n Repondents are incorporated under the laws of California and in that state operate telephone systems for the transmission of local and long distance messages. For the use of patrons in Los Angeles county they supply and maintain more than 300,000 telephone instruments. The component parts of these instruments are the receiver, transmitter, and induction coil, known as the 'talking set'; metal (desk) stand or wooden cabinet ( for attachment to wall), which support, connect, or house the talking devices; and necessary wire connections.\n Talking sets are essential to the operation of any telephone system. Those associated with instruments sup- \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n plied by respondents are Ieased by them from the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, a New York corporation, which holds title thereto. The remaining parts of these instruments-stands, cabinets, etc.-and perhaps all other operating property in the systems-poles, wires, conduits, etc.- are owned by respondents.\n As the statute directs, respondents made regular reports to the state board of equalization showing their operative property (including telephone instruments) and their gross receipts from every source. They paid to the state in lieu of taxes, or were ready to pay when due, the prescribed portions of these receipts. Without making formal objection to the inclusion in such reports of telephone instruments as operating property, the petitioning tax officers, purporting to act for the county and 16 municipalities therein, for local purposes, assessed against the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, as owner, the value of all talking sets within that county (more than 300,000), and demanded payment of taxes thereon for 1925 at the rate borne by ordinary tangible personalty. This was not complied with, and they threatened to disconnect the sets, and sell them, and thereby disrupt systems.\n Thereupon, July 17, 1925, respondents filed the original bill- afterwards amended-in the United States District Court, Southern District of California. They set forth the above-stated facts, referred to the Constitution and statutes of California, and said no tax properly could be laid upon the leased speaking sets, since all possible claim against them had been discharged through due payment to the state of the prescribed portion of gross receipts, partly derived therefrom. They alleged that these sets were not subject to local taxation; to disconnect them from respondents' systems would do irreparable harm; to enforce the demand for local taxes would violate rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; there was no adequate \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n remedy at law, through payment and suit to recover, or otherwise. And they asked for an injunction restraining the threatened wrong.\n It appeared that for the fiscal year 1924-1925 respondent telephone companies paid to the state, out of their gross receipts, $2,080,005.72, and for the year ending June 30, 1926, would pay $2,340,075.12.\n The cause was submitted 'upon defendants' motion to dismiss, and, in the event that said motion should be denied, then, without further hearing, for final determination upon the application for a permanent injunction as prayed in their complaint.'\n The District Court dismissed the bill, February 3, 1926, for want of jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded correctly, we think, that there was jurisdiction; the California statutes afforded no certain adequate remedy through payment of the demanded taxes followed by suit at law to recover; the talking sets were not subject to local taxation, having been wholly relieved by payment of the gross receipts tax to the state. It accordingly reversed the decree of the trial court and directed an injunction as prayed.\n Section 14, article 13, Constitution of California provides:\n'Taxes levied, assessed and collected as hereinafter provided upon railroads, ... telegraph companies, telephone companies, ... shall be entirely and exclusively for state purposes, and shall be levied, assessed and collected in the manner hereinafter provided . ...\n\n'(a) ... all telegraph and telephone companies; and all companies engaged in the transmission or sale of gas or electricity shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their franchises, roadways, roadbeds, rails, rolling stock, poles, wires, pipes, canals, conduits, rights of way, and other property or any part thereof used exclusively in the operation of their business in this state, computed as fol- \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n lows: Said tax shall be equal to the percentages hereinafter fixed upon the gross receipts from operation of such companies, and each thereof within this state. ...\n\n'The percentages above mentioned shall be as follows: ... on all telegraph and telephone companies, three and one-half per cent. (by later legislative action increased to 5 1\/2%). Such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses, state, county and municipal, upon the property above enumerated of such companies except as otherwise in this section provided. ...'\n\n Pertinent provisions of the Political Code are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Considering what this court said in Raymond, Treasurer, v. Chicago Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20\n, 28 S. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757; Home Telephone Co. v. County of Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278\n, 33 S. Ct. 312, \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n and Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291\n, 44 S. Ct. 96, we must conclude that the bill set forth claims of right under the federal Constitution sufficiently substantial to give the trial court jurisdiction of the cause. As it acquired jurisdiction, all material questions were open for decision. Greene, Auditor, v. Louisville, etc., Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88.\n Petitioners maintain that under sections 3804 and 3819, California Political Code, respondents could have protected their rights by paying the assessed tax and bringing actions to recover. But whether either of these sections applies in circumstances like those here presented is far from certain. Section 3819 gives a remedy to the owner; and Warren v. San Francisco, 150 Cal. 167, 88 P. 712, intimates quite strongly that it applies only to actual owners. Whether the lessee who has paid taxes upon the owners' property can recover under section 3804 is also questionable. Counsel differ widely concerning the meaning of these sections and no opinion of the state court removes the doubt. In no permitted proceeding at law could in\n___ 'Sec. 3666. ... 1. If any assessor finds in the report of the operative property in his county, city, and county, municipality, or district, furnished to him by any of the companies as required in section three thousand six hundred sixty-five c of this Code, any piece or parcel of property which he regards as nonoperative property, or partially operative and partially nonoperative, he shall, within thirty days after receiving such report, notify the state board of equalization thereof by mail, which notice shall contain a general description of the property and the assessor's reasons for regarding the same as nonoperative property. ( The board must pass upon the contest.) ... Said decision shall be binding upon all parties, the state, the county, city and county, municipality, or district, and the company, unless set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, and each such assessor must note the decision on his assessment roll, and must assess since property accordingly.' \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n terest upon payments be recovered for the time necessary to obtain judgments. The county and 16 municipalities were interested in the taxes demanded, and, if petitioners had received payments, it would have been incumbent upon them to make prompt distribution. Considering all the circumstances, we find no clear, adequate remedy at law. The equity proceeding was permissible.\n Unquestionably the talking sets would have been free from local assessments if the title had been in respondents; but petitioners stoutly maintain that the gross receipts tax prescribed by the Constitution is not in lieu of local taxes upon leased property.\n No ruling of the California Supreme Court authoritatively determines whether personal property leased by a telephone company and actually used for operating purposes is relieved from local taxation by payment to the state of the prescribed percentage of the lessee's gross receipts. July 2, 1927-after the decision below-that court handed down an opinion which declared leased improved real estate, although actually used as operating property, was subject to local taxation. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. State Board of Equalization (Cal. Sup.) 259 P. 42. But rehearing was granted and this vacated 'the previous opinion and judgment and set the whole matter at large.' Miller & Lux Incorporated v. James, 180 Cal. 38, 48, 179 P. 174, 179.\n The argument against exemption of leased property from local taxation rests chiefly upon literal and narrow interpretation of words in section 14, article 13, California Constitution:\n'... All telegraph and telephone companies ... shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their franchises, ..., poles, wires, pipes, canals, conduits, rights of way, and other property ... used exclusively in the operation of their business,' and 'such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses, \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n state, county and municipal, upon the property above enumerated of such companies.'\n\n But the Constitution plainly directs:\n'Taxes levied, assessed and collected as hereinafter provided upon ... telephone companies ... shall be entirely and exclusively for state purposes' and such companies 'shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their ... polies, ... and other property, or any part thereof, used exclusively in the operation of their business.'\n\n And the Political Code provides:\n'Section 3664: That 'taxes levied, assessed and collected as hereinafter provided upon ... telephone companies ... shall be entirely and exclusively for state purposes, and shall be assessed and levied by the state board of equalization.'\n\n Section 3664a: That 'all ... telegraph and telephone companies ... shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their ... poles, wires , ... and other property, or any part thereof, used exclusively in the operation of their business. ...'\n'Section 3664a(4): 'Such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses, state, county, and municipal, upon the property above enumerated of such companies except ....'\n\n Section 3665a: 'The term 'gross receipts from operation' as used in section 3664a of this Code is hereby defined to include all sums received from business done within this state.'\n'Section 3666: If an assessor finds reported as operative property in his country any which he regards as nonoperative, he shall notify the board of equalization within thirty days.\n\n And section 3607: 'Nothing in this Code shall be construed to require or permit double taxation.'\n Section 14, article 13 (adopted 1910), was proposed by a commission which gave the matter much consideration and made an elaborate report. It is the result of an earnest effort to provide for enforcement of adequate contributions from public service and some other corporations while avoiding double and unjust taxation. Payment of \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n specified percentages (subject to change by the Legislature) of gross receipts was directed upon the theory that the value of operative property could be fairly measured by considering receipts therefrom; also, that by paying to the state a portion of these, the corporation would, in effect, contribute for its operative property the substantial equivalent of all taxes laid upon other property. The commission (Report 1910, p. 19) said:\n'In explanation of the above rates it may be stated that they are fixed on the theory that these proportions of the gross receipts will in each case equal the average burden of taxation on other classes of property. The method of arriving at the different rates is explained in detail in the 1906 report of this commission.'\n\n The Supreme Court of the State has declared the gross receipts tax is essentially one on property, Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 185 Cal. 484, 487, 197 P. 346; and it apparently approves the view that 'a fair tax upon gross earnings bore such a relation to the values of these properties under their unity of use as to justify such a tax upon revenue as being a legal and commutated or substituted tax for other taxes which were or might have been levied.' Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Roberts, 168 Cal. 420, 425, 143 P. 700, 701. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Levee District No. 1, 172 Cal. 345, 156 P. 502; Great Western Power Co. v. City of Oakland, 189 Cal. 649, 209 P. 553.\n The state received from respondents a sum equal to 5 1\/2 per centum of the gross revenues derived from all operative property under their control, leased as well as owned. These did not depend upon ownership, and rent paid out was not considered.\n If payment of the prescribed part of the gross receipts only relieves from local taxation property actually owned and leaves all held under lease subject thereto, inequalities with possible confiscation, would certainly result. Under that theory a corporation with title to half (in value) of its operative property, the remainder being leased, would \n\n[275 U.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n really pay on account of the portion owned at twice the rate required of another corporation operating the same amount of property and having equal receipts, but holding nothing by lease. And if the ratio between property owned and leased were less, the difference in rate would be still greater. A telephone company which leased everything it used would release no property from taxation by paying the gross receipts tax, while the competitor with equal receipts, by paying the same amount, might absolve from local assessment property of very large value.\n These difficulties can not be avoided by saying the lessee will not pay assessments against the lessor and therefore can not complain. Leases are commonly made with reference to taxation. When the lessor discharges the tax the lessee pays rent accordingly. And the Fourteenth Anendment protects those within the same class assainst unequal taxation; all are entitled to like treatment.\n Here respondents have surrendered out of gross receipts the equivalent of the burden imposed upon other property not less valuable than all the operating property in their systems; and now, unless more is paid, disruption is threatened through seizure and sale of essential instrumentalities actually employed to produce those receipts.\n We think the purpose of the 1910 amendment is to tax all operating property of a telephone company by ascertaining the gross receipts and taking therefrom the specified percentage. Thus, the imposition becomes approximately equal to what other property bears. Unless the gross receipts tax be so treated, some very serious questions under the federal Constitution are almost certain to arise. Without an authoritiative holding by the state Supreme Court to the contrary, we must conclude the leased speaking sets are not subject to local taxation.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] California Political Code:\n'Sec. 3664a. ... 1.

UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 376\nArgued: March 9, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n Under Revenue Act 1918,  403, par.(a), subpar. 3 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 d), present value of contingent bequests to charities in will, as determined by combination and adjustment of mortality tables as to whether 15 year old girl would marry, or, if she did, would die without issue before age of 30, 35, or 40, is not deductible from gross amount in determining value of net estate in computing estate tax, since neither taxpayer nor revenue officer could do more than guess at value of contingency. \n\n[276 U.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. Lowry Humes, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the Court of Claims by the executors of Dellora R. Gates to recover $120,508.50, a part of the estate tax alleged to have been illegally exacted under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18,  403, 40 Stat. 1057, \n\n[276 U.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n 1098 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 d). The basis of the claim is that a sum of $ 482,034, which was disallowed in ascertaining the net estate taxable, should have been deducted from the gross amount of $11,783,072.30 disposed of by article fifty-first of the will. The sum disallowed represents the alleged present value of certain contingent bequests to charities made by that article. The question for decision is whether the alleged present value of such contingent bequests is deductible under section 403, par. (a ), subpar. 3, of the Revenue Act. The Court of Claims held that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was right in refusing to allow the deduction. 63 Ct. Cl. 613. This court granted a writ of certiorari. Mitchell v. U. S., \n275 \nU.S. 515\n, 48 S. Ct. 37, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The governing provision of the act is:\n'That for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined-(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the gross estate-... (3) The amount of all bequests ... to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for ... charitable ... purposes.'\n\n Allowance of the deduction was denied pursuant to Treasury Department Regulations 37, art. 56, which declared:\n'Conditional Bequests.-Where the bequest, legacy, devise, or gift is dependent upon the performance of some act, or the happening of some event, in order to become effective it is necessary that the performance of the act or the occurrence of the event shall have taken place before the deduction can be allowed. Where by the terms of the bequest, devise or gift, it is subject to be defeated by a subsequent act or event, no deduction will be allowed.'\n\n Article fifty-first of the will gives one-half of the residuary estate to the testatrix's trustees in trust for her niece, Dellora F. Angell, portions of the principal to be paid to her upon her attaining the ages of 30 and 35 years, the balance to be paid to her upon her attaining the age of 40, the income to be paid to her in the meantime. \n\n[276 U.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n In the event that the niece should die without issue before attaining the age of 40, the amount of the principal not paid to her was given to charities. The remaining half of the residue was to be held in trust for the testatrix's brother during his life, the principal to be disposed of on his death in like manner as the half first mentioned. The testatrix died in 1918. Dellora F. Angell was then living, was 15 years old, and was unwarried. The contention of the executors is that the bequests gave the charities a present property right in the estate; that the present value of a property right which is dependent upon some future event may be determined by the use of standard mortality and experience tables and by the calculations and testimony of actuaries; that the value so determined of the contingency that the whole or a part of the gift would go to charities is at least $482,034; that the deduction must be taken now, for if the executors should wait until the contingency happens, and then, if the charities receive the property, claim a refund, the claim for refund would be barred by the Statute of Limitations; and that, because it was the purpose of Congress to encourage bequests for charitable purposes, the act should be construed so as to allow such a deduction.\n The Court of Claims did not find that the present value of the contingent bequests to the charities can be determined by the calculations of actuaries based upon experience tables. No basis is laid in the record for supplementing the findings in this respect. But the executors urge that we may take judicial notice that such tables exist; and that, by the use of them, actuaries are able to determine that in 1918 the possibility that the residuary gift of $11,783,072.30, or a part thereof, would ultimately go to the charities was worth at least $482,034; or in other words, 4.0909 per cent, of the amount of that residue. The figure, $482, 034, we are told, is reached, through the actuarial art, by some combination and adjustment of the \n\n[276 U.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n standard experience table of mortality, long in use (see Simpson v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 547, 550\n, 40 S. Ct. 367), with two other tables which are relatively little known, and which do not appear to have ever been used in America in legal proceedings. One of these is supposed to show what the probability is that a woman dying at a given age will die unmarried; the other to show what the probability is that if she marries, she will die childless.\n If all the facts stated had been embodied in findings, no legal basis would be laid for the deduction claimed. The volume and character of the experience upon which the conclusions drawn from these two tables are based differ from the volume and character of the experience embodied in standard mortality tables almost as widely as possibility from certainty. Both of these tables are based on data contained in volumes of Lodge's Peerage. The first table, which may be found in the Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, vol. 1, pp. 278, 279, and is called Lees' Female Peerage Tables, was constructed by M. Mackensie Lees. It deals with 4,440 lives, of whom 2,010 died during the period of observation. The second of the tables, which may be found in an article entitled 'On the Probability that a Marriage entered into by a Man of any Age, will be Fruitful,' in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain, vol. 27, pp. 212, 213, was constructed by Dr. Thomas Bond Sprague. It deals with the experience of 1,522 male members of the Scotch peerage and purports to show the probability that a marriage will be childless both as respects men married as peer or heir apparent and men who did not marry as peer or heir apparent. In order to apply the latter table to females certain assumptions and adjustments are necessarily made. It was one such data that the petitioners sought to set a money value on the probability that this Texas girl of 15 will not marry, or, if she does, will die without issue before the \n\n[276 U.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n age of 30, or 35, or 40. Obviously, the calculation that the contingent interest of the charities was equal to 4.0909 per cent. of the residue was mere speculation bearing the delusive appearance of accuracy.\n One may guess, or gamble on, or even insure against, any future event. The Solicitor General tells us that Lloyds of London will insure against having twins. But the fundamental question in the case at bar is not whether this contingent interest can be insured against or its value guessed at, but what construction shall be given to a statute. Did Congress, in providing for the determination of the net estate taxable, intend that a deduction should be made for a contingency the actual value of which cannot be determined from any known data? Neither taxpayer, nor revenue officer-even if equipped with all the aid which the actuarial art can supply-could do more than guess at the value of this contingency. It is clear that Congress did not intend that a deduction should be made for a contingent gift of that character. Compare Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 63\n, 44 S.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Kaibab National Forest and the Grand Canyon National Game Preserve, covering practically the same area, are situated north of the Colorado river in Arizona. They were created by proclamations of the President under authority of Congress. During the last few years deer on these reserves have increased in such large numbers that the forage is insufficient for their subsistence. The result has been that these deer have greatly injured the lands in the reserves by overbrowsing upon and killing valuable young trees, shrubs, bushes, and forage plants. Thousands of deer have died because of insufficient forage. Attempts were made under the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture to remove some of the deer from \n\n[278 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n the reserves to other lands, but these entirely failed, as did other means. The district forester, acting under the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, proceeded to kill large numbers of the deer and ship the carcasses outside the limits of the reserves. That this was necessary to protect the lands of the United States within the reserves from serious injury is made clear by the evidence. The direction given by the Secretary of Agriculture was within the authority conferred upon him by act of Congress. And the power of the United States to thus protect its lands and property does not admit of doubt, Camfield v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 518, 525\n, 526 S., 17 S. Ct. 864; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 404\n, 37 S. Ct. 387; McKelvey v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 353, 359\n, 43 S. Ct. 132; United States v. Alford, \n274 \nU.S. 264\n, 47 S. Ct. 597, the game laws or any other statute of the state to the contrary notwithstanding.\n Appellants interfered with these acts of the United States officials and threatened to arrest and prosecute any person or persons attempting to kill or possess or transport such deer, under the claim that such officials were proceeding in violation of the game laws of the state of Arizona, the observance of which would have so restricted the number of deer to be killed as to render futile the attempt to protect the reserves. Three persons who had killed deer under authority of United States officials were actually arrested. Thereupon suit was brought to enjoin appellants from continuing or threatening such interference, arrest or prosecution. The court below, after a trial, found for the United States, and entered a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill, with the limitation, however, that the decree should not be construed to permit the licensing of hunters to kill deer within said reserves in violation of the state game laws. United States v. Hunt (D. C.) 19 F.(2d) 634.\n While the Solicitor General does not concede the authority of the court to make this limitation, he is content \n\n[278 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n to let the decree stand. We therefore pass the matter without consideration and accept the opinion and decree below, with the modification that all carcasses of deer and parts thereof shipped outside the boundaries of the reserves shall be plainly marked by tags or otherwise, in such manner as the Secretary of Agriculture may by regulations prescribe, to show that the deer were killed under his authority within the limits of the reserves.\n Thus modified, the decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE GILBERT(1928)\nNo. 750\nArgued: January 16, 1928Decided: January 23, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[276 U.S. 6, 7]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT announced the opinion of the Court.\n Under our order of November 21, 1927 (48 S. Ct. 113), the clerk issued a rule to the respondent, Abraham S. Gilbert, of New York City, a member of this bar, which directed-\n That he make written report to this court, showing what fees or allowances have been paid to him (also when and by whom paid) for services as master in the several causes reviewed here during the October term, 1921, and reported in \n259 \nU.S. 101\n, 42 S. Ct. 438, under the following titles: Newton, as Attorney General of the State of New York, et al. v. Consolidated Gas Company of New York; Same v. New York & Queens Gas Company; Same v. Central Union Gas Company; Same v. Northern Union Gas Company; Same v. New York Mutual Gaslight Company; Same v. Standard Gaslight Company of the City of New York; Same v. New Amsterdam Gas Company; Same v. East River Gas Company of Long Island City.\n That he likewise report whether he has returned or repaid any portion of the fees or allowances received by him as such master, with dates and names of the parties.\n That, if he has received fees or allowances as master in any of the specified causes exceeding the maximum amount held by us to be permissible, and has not returned or repaid the excess, then he shall show cause why his name ought not to be stricken from the roll of attorneys permitted to practice here, and he be punished for contempt or otherwise dealt with as the circumstances may require.\n On the return day, January 16, 1928, Gilbert presented himself, filed a written report, and was heard through counsel. \n\n[276 U.S. 6, 8]\n\u00a0\n He asserts that he received as fees for services as master in the eight above-mentioned causes a total of $118,000; he sets out their several amounts and shows by whom and when they were paid. He avers that no one of the gas companies which paid these fees has ever questioned the amount or asked return of any portion, and says that he believes it was proper for him to retain them, notwithstanding they greatly exceeded what we declared permissible. But he further says that if this court, after viewing his response, should conclude that he is under legal or moral obligation to return any part of them, he is willing so to do.\n In December, 1921, the District Court for the Southern District of New York made allowances to respondent for services as master in each of the above-mentioned causes and directed that they be paid by the complaining corporations respectively and thereafter taxed as costs against the defendants, the Attorney General of New York and others. In obedience to such orders and before the time for appeal expired, these were paid, as follows: By Consolidated Gas Company, December 13, 1921, $57, 500.00; by New York & Queens Gas Company, December 16, 1921, $12,500.00; by Central Union Gas Company, December 16, 1921, $12,500.00; by Northern Union Gas Company, December 13, 1921, $7,500.00; by New York Mutual Gaslight Company, December 16, 1921, $11,500.00; by Standard Gaslight Company, January 13, 1922, $7,500.00; by New Amsterdam Gas Company, January 13, 1922, $4,500.00; by East River Gas Company, January 13, 1922, $ 4,500.00.\n The Attorney General and other defendants insisted that the allowances were excessive. The District Court overruled their objections; the matter came here and was decided May 15, 1922. \n259 \nU.S. 101\n, 42 S. Ct. 438. We held that in the Consolidated Gas Company's Case twice too much had been allowed, and in the other causes three times too much; that the total compensation should not exceed $49,250; and further, that in making these awards the District Court abused its judicial discretion. Accord- \n\n[276 U.S. 6, 9]\n\u00a0\n ingly, we reversed the challenged decrees and remanded the causes, with instructions to fix respondent's compensation within the following limitations:\n'In the cause wherein the Consolidated Gas Company is appellee here ( No. 750) not exceeding $28,750, one-half of the amount heretofore allowed: in each of the other seven causes, Nos. 751, 752, 753, 832, 833, 844, and 845, not exceeding one-third of the amount heretofore allowed therein; and in the eight cases allowances totaling not more than $49,250.'\n\n We also directed 'such further action in conformity with this opinion as may be necessary.'\n Upon receipt of the mandates, issued here June 19, 1922, the District Court ordered that the master's fees to the extent of the maximum permitted by us should be taxed against the several defendants as costs. Respondent made no effort to secure any further orders or direction by the District Court or this court.\n More than a year thereafter-December, 1923-apparently moved by published criticisms, respondent instituted a proceeding against the Consolidated Gas Company in the Supreme Court of New York under section 473, New York Civil Practice Act, wherein he sought and obtained a declaratory judgment reciting that that company had no valid claim against him for return of any part of the $57,500 which it had paid. This proceeding was ill-advised, or worse, and the pronouncement therein cannot aid him here. The state court had no power to determine the matter now before us.\n Upon announcement of our opinion, May 15, 1922, it became the imperative duty of respondent immediately to return the fees received by him so far as they exceeded what we declared permissible. It is now his duty, without further delay, to return this excess, with interest thereon at 6 per centum from May 15, 1922\n\n\n When respondent accepted appointment as master he assumed the duties and obligations of a judicial officer. He could not rightfully accept or retain anything as com- \n\n[276 U.S. 6, 10]\n\u00a0\n pensation unless sanctioned by proper order of court. Reception then or now of a gratuity from any party would be indefensible, and whether or no the corporations which paid him by direction of the court are satisfied with the result is now unimportant. He has long been an attorney and counselor authorized to practice at this bar under the sanction of an oath to demean himself 'uprightly, and according to law.' Notwithstanding the adjudication here that excessive fees had been allowed by orders granted in abuse of judicial discretion, he has retained them for more than five years. He knew that he had got unearned money by improper orders of court, but he decided to keep it. Such conduct is far from 'upright and according to law' within the fair intendment of those terms.\n Further action will be postponed until Monday, February 20, 1928. The respondent will present himself at that time and report in writing concerning efforts made to comply with his obligations. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE GILBERT(1928)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 294, 295]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James M.

On that day the respondent presented himself and submitted canceled checks and receipts showing his payment of the excess to the parties litigant entitled thereto, with interest as ordered, the aggregate being $92,744.32. \n\n[276 U.S. 294, 296]\n\u00a0\n This case now comes on for final action.\n In his answer the respondent suggests that he had never had any opportunity on his own behalf to show by hearing and argument the justice of the compensation awarded to him by the District Court, and seeks to raise doubt as to the conclusion we reached, that the allowance made to him was an abuse of discretion by the District Court. Our conclusion was the result of a careful examination of the statement made by the then referee, the present respondent, as to the labor he had performed, and after full consideration. We were desirous of making it clear by our action that the judges of the courts, in fixing allowances for services to court officers, should be most careful, and that vicarious generosity in such a matter could receive no countenance.\n The respondent further says:\n'In reversing the orders appealed from, this court made no order or direction which required me to return the excess fee that had already been paid me by the gas companies. Neither the District Judge, who entered the orders in compliance with the mandate of this court, nor counsel for the gas companies, nor counsel for any of the defendants, ever even suggested that the decision or mandate of this court required the entry of orders by the District Court Judge directing the return by me of the excess fees to the gas companies, which had willingly paid them in the first instance and had believed them to be fair in amount.\n\n'Upon receipt of the mandate of this court, the District Court, upon notice to all parties, without any action on my part, and without any appearance by me, entered the order in the Consolidated Gas Case, as follows:\n\n\"(1) The judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States if hereby made in all respects the judgment of this court.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n \"(2) The compensation of A. S. Gilbert as special master herein, to the extent of $28,750, together with the sum of $655.38 for necessary disbursements of the master, shall be taxed as costs in this suit, to be paid equally by the defendants as provided by the final decree, dated August 11, 1920.'\n'Similar orders were entered in the remaining seven cases, directing the taxation of costs against the defendants in the sums fixed by this court.\n\n'All of the parties to the litigation thus placed a construction upon the decision of this court which left the compensation directed to be paid to me unchanged, except as to the amounts that could be taxed as costs against the appellants, and it is apparent from the form of the order upon mandate that the District Judge took the same view of the effect of the decision of this court.'\n\n It is enough to say that we differ entirely from the inference that this court intended that the referee should retain as his fees moneys already paid him. There is nothing in the record justifying the suggestion that this court intended to allow any other compensation than that which was discussed and decided in its opinion. If the parties or the District Judge conceived that this court desired to eliminate as negligible from its decision the fees already paid the referee, there was no warrant for the assumption.\n The fees which had been paid and the failure to return them did not affect the amount of the costs due from defendants, the city of New York, which was only one-half of fees allowed by this court. Thus the city was not prejudiced by respondent's failure to return the amount due. The officers of the companies litigant seem to have been so satisfied with winning the merits of the issue between them and the city of New York as to be willing that the referee should retain the illegal excess, which \n\n[276 U.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n under our decision belonged to them. Thus it came to pass that the parties, who would naturally have seen to it by application to the District Court or this court that our decision was complied with, took no action and virtually acquiesced in a defeat of our decision.\n If, in the opinion of the gas companies and of the District Judge, our conclusion in the case was mistaken and unjust, it was open both to the respondent Gilbert and to the gas companies to bring the matter again before this court for reconsideration, instead of allowing our decision to be defeated. But, instead of coming to the tribunal which had authoritatively decided the matter, Gilbert relied on the tolerance and favor of the litigant companies, in whose favor on the merits of the case he had decided the issue, not to move for compliance with our decision. This was the front of his wrongdoing. He persisted further by a futile proceeding in a New York state court to secure a declaratory judgment that he owed nothing to the litigant companies, although such an obligation to pay them was the necessary effect of our decision and the existing facts known to him. In that proceeding he evidently relied again on the friendly attitude of the litigant companies and their acquiescence, though against their pecuniary interest. The so-called declaratory judgment was futile.\n We realize that by our order we have required, not only restitution of what Gilbert kept in excess of our decision, but also 6 per cent. interest thereon for nearly six years, so that his restitution now leaves him little out of the fee which we held he was entitled to receive. More than this, he paid income taxes for one year on the whole fee as allowed by the District Court.\n But mere restitution is not enough, considering respondent's departure from duty, We must give our action a punitive quality to mark the high obligation of the members of the bar to respect the decisions of the court. The \n\n[276 U.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n order will be that Abraham S. Gilbert be suspended from his rights and privileges as a member of the bar of this court for six months from this day and that he pay the costs of this proceeding. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINGRAM-DAY LUMBER CO. v. MCLOUTH(1928)\nNo. 126\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. J. Shaw and Ferris D. Stone, both of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner. \n\n[275 U.S. 471, 472]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued in the District Court for eastern Michigan for the decedent's breach of contract to purchase a quantity of lumber. The defense relied on was that the lumber was to be used by the intestate in the performance of contracts he had made with the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation for the construction of a number of ocean-going tugboats; that acting under the President's Executive Orders of July 11, 1917, and December 3, 1918, and the Emergency Shipping Fund provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183, the Fleet Corporation in 1919, before delivery of all the lumber, had canceled the contract with decedent for building the tugs and directed him 'to make no further commitments or expenditures'; and that this action or the decedent's subsequent order to petitioner to stop delivery of the lumber, or both, amounted to a cancellation of petitioner's contract also.\n By written stipulation a jury was waived and the case was tried to the court, which made special findings, among others, that petitioner, at the time of entering into its contract with decedent, knew that the lumber was to be furnished for the building of tugs, but did not know that decedent was building the tugs for the Fleet Corporation. The court also found that decedent had stopped deliveries of the lumber, but there is no finding that this was done or purported to be done under the authority of the Fleet \n\n[275 U.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n Corporation. It was found that petitioner's damage was $647.65, the difference between the contract price of the lumber ready for delivery when the decedent ordered performance stopped and its market price when recut into salable lengths, but that if the ordinary rule of damages should be applied petitioner's loss of bargain on the whole contract would bring its damages up to $42,789.96. The court gave judgment for the smaller amount ((D. C.) 6 F.(2d) 471), and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (13 F.(2d) 581). This court granted certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 684\n, 47 S. Ct. 239.\n The Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Act of 1917 authorized the President '(b) to modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material.' Section 1 (Comp. St.  3115 1\/16 d). It provided that the United States 'shall make just compensation' for any contracts canceled or requisitioned, and authorized the President to delegate the powers conferred upon him. His powers, so far as material here, were delegated to the Fleet Corporation by Executive Orders of July 11, 1917, and December 3, 1918. The statute authorized the cancellation of the government's own contracts, made after its enactment, and just compensation for such cancellation does not include anticipated profits, ordinarily recoverable in an action of assumpsit. Duesenberg Motors Corp. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 115\n, 43 S. Ct. 19; Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428. It authorized also the expropriation or requisition of private contracts, and in computing the just compensation for these the value of the anticipated performance of the contract may be considered. Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 125\n, 44 S. Ct. 471.\n The court below ruled that the petitioner's contract was canceled by the action of the Shipping Board, but upheld \n\n[275 U.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n the judgment for $647.65 in favor of petitioner. Although the suit was for breach of contract against a private person, and not against the government, the court purported to apply the rule of 'just compensation,' which by the statute is made the limit of the government's liability, and denied a recovery for anticipated profits on the supposed authority of Duesenberg Motors Corp. v. United States, supra.\n The question principally argued here was whether there was power in the Fleet Corporation to cancel the petitioner's contract. No such question is presented by the record. There is no finding that in fact the petitioner's contract was either modified, suspended, canceled or requisitioned, nor does the record disclose evidence which would support such a finding. Since a jury was waived in writing, appellate review is limited to the sufficiency of the facts specially found to support the judgment and to rulings excepted to and presented by a bill of exceptions.

The special findings already stated establish the right of petitioner to recover damages for breach of contract, including compensation for loss of bargain, in the sum of $42,789.96.\n As petitioner's contract was framed without reference to or knowledge of decedent's contract with the Fleet Corporation, its rights under its own contract were not dependent on the continued existence of the other.

BLODGETT(1928)\nNo. 197\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward Kelly, of Hartford, Conn., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, complainant below, is a Connecticut corporation engaged in the transportation of passengers in motor busses, exclusively in interstate commerce, between Connecticut and points in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The present suit was brought in the district court for Connecticut to restrain appellees, tax officials of the state, from levying a tax on appellant under a Connecticut statute, Pub. Acts Conn. 1925, c. 254, on the ground that the tax is a unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Application to a court of three judges for an interlocutory injunction under Judicial Code,  266 (28 USCA  380), was denied, 19 F.(2d) 256, and on final hearing the court dismissed the bill on the merits. The application for the preliminary injunction having been pressed to a determination before the court of three judges, the case is properly here on direct appeal from the final decree of that court. Judicial Code,  238, 266 (28 USCA  345, 380); Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 385; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 702\n\n\n The appellant has already complied with the general statutes of Connecticut requiring the registration of motor vehicles. Part 2,  1, of the act in question, imposes a tax of one cent for each mile of highway traversed by any motor vehicle used in interstate commerce 'as an excise on the use of such highway.' By part 2,  4, the proceeds of the tax are to be applied to the maintenance of public highways in the state.\n Appellant objects to the tax as an infringement of the paramount power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, or at least as a discrimination against that commerce. It is not denied that a state may impose a registration or license fee on those using motor vehicles in the state, although engaged in interstate commerce, or that the state may impose a reasonable charge for the use of \n\n[276 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n its highways by motor vehicles so employed, Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, supra, and there is no evidence that the tax here is in itself an unreasonable charge for the privilege. But it is said that the particular scheme of taxation adopted by Connecticut imposes this tax in addition to statutory charges already made for the use of the highways in interstate commerce, and both in purpose and in effect discriminates against appellant and in favor of those operating motor vehicles in intrastate commerce.\n The state has adopted a system of financing its highway construction and maintenance under which about 80 per cent. of the cost is collected from fees for the registration of motor vehicles and for operators' licenses, from taxes on the sale of gasoline and from fines and penalties for violations of the motor vehicle laws. The balance of the cost is paid from general appropriations by the state Legislature and a certain amount received under federal aid legislation. Appellant, it is conceded, pays certain taxes imposed alike on those engaged in intrastate and interstate commerce. These include a personal property tax upon its motor cars used in the state, a registration or license fee for each vehicle so used, and also, it is urged, a tax of two cents a gallon on the sale of gasoline within the state which in practice is absorbed by the consumer in the purchase price.\n But no mileage tax like that imposed by part 2,  1, is levied upon those using motor vehicles in intrastate commerce. Instead part 1,  2 and 3, of the act under discussion, subject all companies engaged in intrastate motor bus transportation to an excise of 3 per cent. of their gross receipts, less such taxes as they have paid locally on their 'real and tangible personal estate.' By part 1,  6, this excise is declared to be in lieu of all taxes on intangible personal property. Moreover, those who pay it are exempt \n\n[276 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n from the income tax of 2 per cent. imposed generally on corporations, including, apparently, the appellant. Conn. Gen. Stat., c. 73, as amended. It like the mileage tax is devoted to the maintenance of highways.\n To show that the mileage tax is discriminatory appellant first points out the obvious differences between it and the gross receipts tax, and, secondly, relies on an uncontradicted allegation in the bill of complaint that, apart from the mileage tax, it already contributes to the maintenance of the highways of the state in the same manner and to the same extent as others in the payment of the personal property tax, the license tax on busses and the shifted gasoline tax.\n The two statutes are complementary in the sense that, while both levy a tax on those engaged in carrying passengers for hire over state highways in motor vehicles, to be expended for highway maintenance, one affects only interstate, and the other only intrastate, commerce. Appellant plainly does not establish discrimination by showing merely that the two statutes are different in form or adopt a different measure or method of assessment, or that it is subject to three kinds of taxes while intrastate carriers are subject only to two or to one. We cannot say from a mere inspection of the statutes that the mileage tax is a substantially greater burden on appellant's interstate business than is its correlative, the gross receipts tax, on comparable intrastate businesses. To gain the relief for which it prays, appellant is under the necessity of showing that in actual practice the tax of which it complains falls with disproportionate economic weight on it. General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367\n, 46 S. Ct. 234; Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Holyoke Street Ry., \n273 \nU.S. 45, 51\n, 47 S. Ct. 298. The record does not show that it made any attempt to do so.\n That appellant is already contributing to highway maintenance is not in itself significant, for the state does \n\n[276 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n not exceed its constitutional power by imposing more than one form of tax as a charge for the use of its highways in interstate commerce. It is for appellant to show that the aggregate charge bears no reasonable relation to the privilege granted.\n It is further objected that the provision of the state statute, part 2,  3, authorizing the suspension of registration as a remedy for the nonpayment of the mileage tax, is invalid in any case, since payment of even a lawful tax may not be enforced by the exclusion of the taxpayer from interstate commerce. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Attorney General of Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530\n, 8 S. Ct. 961; St. Louis Southwestern R. R. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350\n, 35 S. Ct. 99. And it is not denied that appellees have threatened to invoke section 3 against appellant. But we need not consider here whether the principle relied on goes so far as to prevent a state from excluding from its highways a motor carrier which refuses to pay a charge for their use. Compare Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Kane v. New Jersey, supra; Clark v. Poor, supra. Here the relief sought presupposes that the tax is unconstitutional. That point being determined against appellant, we shall not assume that it will persist in its refusal to pay the tax.\n Objections of less moment, which we have considered, do not require comment.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ.

This was two cents per pound more than that fixed by statute. Paragraph 12, c. 256, 42 Stat. 858, 860 (19 USCA  121, par. 12). The rate was raised by the collector by virtue of the proclamation of the President, 45 Treas. Dec. 669, T.

That in order to regulate the foreign commerce of the United States and to put into force and effect the policy of the Congress by this act intended, whenever the President, upon investigation of the differences in costs of production of articles wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States and of like or similar articles wholly or in part the growth or product of competing foreign countries, shall find it thereby shown that the duties fixed in this act do not equalize the said differences in costs of production in the United States and the principal competing country he shall, by such investigation, ascertain said differences and determine and proclaim the changes in classifications or increases or decreases in any rate of duty provided in this act shown by said ascertained differences in such costs of production necessary to equalize the same. Thirty days after the date of such proclamation or proclamations such changes in classification shall take effect, and such increased or decreased duties shall be levied, collected, and paid on such articles when imported from any foreign country into the United States or into any of its possessions (except the Philippine Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the islands of Guam and Tutuila): Provided, That the total increase or decrease of such rates of duty shall not exceed 50 per centum of the rates specified in title 1 of this act, or in any amendatory act. ...\n\n'(c) That in ascertaining the differences in costs of production, under the provisions of subsidivisions (a) and (b) of this section, the President, in so far as he finds it practicable, shall take into consideration (1) the differ- \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 402]\n\u00a0\n ences in conditions in production, including wages, costs of material, and other items in costs of production of such or similar articles in the United States and in competing foreign countries; (2) the differences in the wholesale selling prices of domestic and foreign articles in the principal markets of the United States; (3) advantages granted to a foreign producer by a foreign government, or by a person, partnership, corporation, or association in a foreign country; and (4) any other advantages or disadvantages in competition.\n\n'Investigations to assist the President in ascertaining differences in costs of production under this section shall be made by the United States Tariff Commission, and no proclamation shall be issued under this section until such investigation shall have been made. The commission shall give reasonable public notice of its hearings and shall give reasonable opportunity to parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard. The commission is authorized to adopt such reasonable procedure, rules, and regulations as it may deem necessary.\n\n'The President, proceeding as hereinbefore provided for in proclaiming rates of duty, shall, when he determines that it is shown that the differences in costs of production have changed or no longer exist which led to such proclamation, accordingly as so shown, modify or terminate the same. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a transfer of an article from the dutiable list to the free list or from the free list to the dutiable list, nor a change in form of duty. Whenever it is provided in any paragraph of title 1 of this act, that the duty or duties shall not exceed a specified ad valorem rate upon the articles provided for in such paragraph, no rate determined under the provision of this section upon such articles shall exceed the maximum ad valorem rate so specified.' \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 403]\n\u00a0\n The President issued his proclamation May 19, 1924 (43 Stat. 1951). After reciting part of the foregoing from section 315, the proclamation continued as follows:\n\n'Whereas, under and by virtue of said section of said act, the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation to assist the President in ascertaining the differences in costs of production of and of all other facts and conditions enumerated in said section with respect to ... barium dioxide, ...\n\n'Whereas in the course of said investigation a hearing was held, of which reasonable public notice was given and at which parties interested were given a reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard;\n\n'And whereas the President upon said investigation ... has thereby found that the said principal competing country is Germany and that the duty fixed in said title and act does not equalize the differences in costs of production in the United States and in ... Germany, and has ascertained and determined the increased rate of duty necessary to equalize the same.\n\n'Now, therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States of America, do hereby determine and proclaim that the increase in rate of duty provided in said act shown by said ascertained differences in said costs of production necessary to equalize the same is as follows:\n\n\"An increase in said duty on barium dioxide (within the limit of total increase provided for in said act) from 4 cents per pound to 6 cents per pound.\n\n\"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\n\n\"Done at the city of Washington this nineteenth day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, and of the Independence of the \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 404]\n\u00a0\n United States of America the one hundred and forty-eighth.\n\n\"Calvin Coolidge.\n\n\"By the President: Charles E. Hughes, Secretary of State.\"\n\n The issue here is as to the constitutionality of section 315, upon which depends the authority for the proclamation of the President and for two of the six cents per pound duty collected from the petitioner. The contention of the taxpayers is twofold-first, they argue that the section is invalid in that it is a delegation to the President of the legislative power, which by article 1,  1 of the Constitution, is vested in Congress, the power being that declared in section 8 of article 1, that the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises. Their second objection is that, as section 315 was enacted with the avowed intent and for the purpose of protecting the industries of the United States, it is invalid because the Constitution gives power to lay such taxes only for revenue.\n First. It seems clear what Congress intended by section 315. Its plan was to secure by law the imposition of customs duties on articles of imported merchandise which should equal the difference between the cost of producing in a foreign country the articles in question and laying them down for sale in the United States, and the cost of producing and selling like or similar articles in the United States, so that the duties not only secure revenue, but at the same time enable domestic producers to compete on terms of equality with foreign producers in the markets of the United States. It may be that it is difficult to fix with exactness this difference, but the difference which is sought in the statute is perfectly clear and perfectly intelligible. Because of the difficulty in practically determining what that difference is, Congress seems to have \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 405]\n\u00a0\n doubted that the information in its possession was such as to enable it to make the adjustment accurately, and also to have apprehended that with changing conditions the difference might vary in such a way that some readjustments would be necessary to give effect to the principle on which the statute proceeds. To avoid such difficulties, Congress adopted in section 315 the method of describing with clearness what its policy and plan was and then authorizing a member of the executive branch to carry out its policy and plan and to find the changing difference from time to time and to make the adjustments necessary to conform the duties to the standard underlying that policy and plan. As it was a matter of great importance, it concluded to give by statute to the President, the chief of the executive branch, the function of determining the difference as it might vary. He was provided with a body of investigators who were to assist him in obtaining needed data and asscertaining the facts justifying readjustments. There was no specific provision by which action by the President might be invoked under this act, but it was presumed that the President would through this body of advisers keep himself advised of the necessity for investigation or change, and then would proceed to pursue his duties under the act and reach such conclusion as he might find justified by the investigation and proclaim the same, if necessary.\n The Tariff Commission does not itself fix duties, but, before the President reaches a conclusion on the subject of investigation, the Tariff Commission must make an investigation, and in doing so must give notice to all parties interested and an opportunity to adduce evidence and to be heard.\n The well-known maxim 'Delegata potestas non potest delegari,' applicable to the law of agency in the general and common law, is well understood and has had wider \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 406]\n\u00a0\n application in the construction of our federal and state Constitutions than it has in private law. Our Federal Constitution and state Constitutions of this country divide the governmental power into three branches. The first is the legislative, the second is the executive, and the third is the judicial, and the rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress or the Legislature should exercise the legislative power, the President or the state executive, the Governor, the executive power, and the courts or the judiciary the judicial power, and in carrying out that constitutional division into three branches it is a breach of the national fundamental law if Congress gives up its legislative power and transfers it to the President, or to the judicial branch, or if by law it attempts to invest itself or its members with either executive power or judicial power. This is not to say that the three branches are not co-ordinate parts of one government and that each in the field of its duties may not invoke the action of the two other branches in so far as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch. In determining what it may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistence must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination.\n The field of Congress involves all and many varieties of legislative action, and Congress has found it frequently necessary to use officers of the executive branch within defined limits, to secure the exact effect intended by its acts of legislation, by vesting discretion in such officers to make public regulations interpreting a statute and directing the details of its execution, even to the extent of providing for penalizing a breach of such regulations.

Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320\n, 29 S. Ct. 671\n\n\n Congress may feel itself unable conveniently to determine exactly when its exercise of the legislative power should become effective, because dependent on future conditions, and it may leave the determination of such time to the decision of an executive, or, as often happens in matters of state legislation, it may be left to a popular vote of the residents of a district to be affected by the legislation. While in a sense one may say that such residents are exercising legislative power, it is not an exact statement, because the power has already been exercised legislatively by the body vested with that power under the Constitution, the condition of its legislation going into effect being made dependent by the Legislature on the expression of the voters of a certain district. As Judge Ranney of the Ohio Supreme Court in Cincinnati, Wilmington & Zanesville Railroad Co. v. Commissioners, 1 Ohio St. 77, 88, said in such a case:\n'The true distinction, therefore, is, between the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring an authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.'\n\n See, also, Moers v. Reading, 21 Pa. 188, 202; Locke's Appeal, 72 Pa. 491, 498, 13 Am. Rep. 716.\n Again, one of the great functions conferred on Congress by the Federal Constitution is the regulation of interstate commerce and rates to be exacted by interstate carriers for the passenger and merchandise traffic. The rates to be fixed are myriad. If Congress were to be required to fix every rate, it would be impossible to exercise the power at all. Therefore, common sense requires that in the fixing of such rates Congress may provide a Com- \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 408]\n\u00a0\n mission, as it does, called the Interstate Commerce Commission, to fix those rates, after hearing evidence and argument concerning them from interested parties, all in accord with a general rule that Congress first lays down that rates shall be just and reasonable considering the service given and not discriminatory. As said by this Court in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194, 214\n, 32 S. Ct. 436, 441 ( 56 L. Ed. 729):\n'The Congress may not delegate its purely legislative power to a commission, but, having laid down the general rules of action under which a commission shall proceed, it may require of that commission the application of such rules to particular situations and the investigation of facts, with a view to making orders in a particular matter within the rules laid down by the Congress.'\n\n The principle upon which such a power is upheld in state legislation as to fixing railway rates is admirably stated by Judge Mitchell in the case of State v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co., 38 Minn. 281, 298 to 302, 37 N. W. 782. The learned judge says on page 301 (37 N. W. 788):\n'If such a power is to be exercised at all, it can only be satisfactorily done by a board or commission, constantly in session, whose time is exclusively given to the subject, and who, after investigation of the facts, can fix rates with reference to the peculiar circumstances of each road, and each particular kind of business, and who can change or modify these rates to suit the ever- varying conditions of traffic. ... Our Legislature has gone a step further than most others, and vested our commission with full power to determine what rates are equal and reasonable in each particular case. Whether this was wise or not is not for us to say; but in doing so we cannot see that they have transcended their constitutional authority. They have not delegated to the commission any authority or discretion as to what the law \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 409]\n\u00a0\n shall be-which would not be allowable-but have merely conferred upon it an authority and discertion, to be exercised in the execution of the law, and under and in pursuance of it, which is entirely permissible. The Legislature itself has passed upon the expediency of the law, and what it shall be. The commission is intrusted with no authority or discretion upon these questions.'\n\n See, also, the language of Justices Miller and Bradley in the same case in this Court. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota ex rel. Railroad & W. Commission, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 459\n, 461 S., 464, 10 S. Ct. 462, 702.\n It is conceded by counsel that Congress may use executive officers in the application and enforcement of a policy declared in law by Congress and authorize such officers in the application of the congressional declaration to enforce it by regulation equivalent to law. But it is said that this never has been permitted to be done where Congress has exercised the power to levy taxes and fix customs duties. The authorities make no such distinction. The same principle that permits Congress to exercise its rate-making power in interstate commerce by declaring the rule which shall prevail in the legislative fixing of rates, and enables it to remit to a rate-making body created in accordance with its provisions the fixing of such rates, justifies a similar provision for the fixing of customs duties on imported merchandise. If Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to fix such rates is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power. If it is thought wise to vary the customs duties according to changing conditions of production at home and abroad, it may authorize the Chief Executive to carry out this purpose, with the advisory assistance of a Tariff Commission appointed under congressional authority. This conclusion is amply sustained by a case in which there was no advisory commis- \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 410]\n\u00a0\n sion furnished the President-a case to which this Court gave the fullest consideration nearly 40 years ago. In Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 680\n, 12 S. Ct. 495, 500 (36 L. Ed. 294), the third section of the Act of October, 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 612), contained this provision:\n'That with a view to secure reciprocal trade with countries producing the following articles, and for this purpose, on and after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whenever, and so often as the President shall be satisfied that the government of any country producing and exporting sugars, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, raw and uncured, or any of such articles, imposes duties or other exactions upon the agricultural or other products of the United States, which in view of the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides into the United States he may deem to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable, he shall have the power and it shall be his duty to suspend, by proclamation to that effect, the provisions of this act relating to the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, the production of such country, for such time as he shall deem just, and in such case and during such suspension duties shall be lived collected, and paid upon sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, the product of or exported from such designated country as follows, namely.'\n\n Then followed certain rates of duty to be imposed. It was contended that this section delegated to the President both legislative and treaty- making powers and was unconstitutional. After an examination of all the authorities, the Court said that, while Congress could not delegate legislative power to the President, this act did not in any real sense invest the President with the power of legislation, because nothing involving the expendiency or just operation of such legislation was left to the determination of the President; that the legislative power was exercised when Congress declared that the suspension should take effect upon a named contingency. What \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 411]\n\u00a0\n the President was required to do was merely in execution of the act of Congress. It was not the making of law. He was the mere agent of the lawmaking department to ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to take effect.\n Second. The second objection to section 315 is that the declared plan of Congress, either expressly or by clear implication, formulates its rule to guide the President and his advisory Tariff Commission as one directed to a tariff system of protection that will avoid damaging competition to the country's industries by the importation of goods from other countries at too low a rate to equalize foreign and domestic competition in the markets of the United States. It is contended that the only power of Congress in the levying of customs duties is to create revenue, and that it is unconstitutional to frame the customs duties with any other view than that of revenue raising. It undoubtedly is true that during the political life of this country there has been much discussion between parties as to the wisdom of the policy of protection, and we may go further and say as to its constitutionality, but no historian, whatever his view of the wisdom of the policy of protection, would contend that Congress since the first revenue act in 1789 (1 Stat. 24) has not assumed that it was within its power in making provision for the collection of revenue to put taxes upon importations and to vary the subjects of such taxes or rates in an effort to encourage the growth of the industries of the nation by protecting home production against foreign competition. It is enough to point out that the second act adopted by the Congress of the United States July 4, 1789 (chapter 2, 1 Stat. 24), contained the following recital:\n'Sec. 1. Whereas it is necessary for the support of government, for the discharge of the debts of the United States, and the encouragement and protection of manu- \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 412]\n\u00a0\n factures, that duties be laid on goods, wares and merchandises imported:\n\n'Be it enacted,' etc.\n\n In this first Congress sat many members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787. This Court has repeatedly laid down the principle that a contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution when the founders of our government and framers of our Constitution were actively participating in public affairs long acquiesced in fixes the construction to be given its provisions. Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 175\n, 47 S. Ct. 21, and cases cited. The enactment and enforcement of a number of customs revenue laws drawn with a motive of maintaining a system of protection since the revenue law of 1789 are matters of history.\n More than a hundred years later, the titles of the Tariff Acts of 1897 (30 Stat. 151) and 1909 (36 Stat. 11) declared the purpose of those acts, among other things, to be that of encouraging the industries of the United States. The title of the Tariff Act of 1922 (42 Stat. 858), of which section 315 is a part, is 'An act to provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes.' Whatever we may think of the wisdom of a protection policy, we cannot hold it unconstitutional.\n So long as the motive of Congress and the effect of its legislative action are to secure revenue for the benefit of the general government, the existence of other motives in the selection of the subjects of taxes cannot invalidate congressional action. As we said in the Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 38\n, 42 S. Ct. 449, 451 (66 L. Ed. 817):\n'Texes are occasionally imposed in the discretion of the Legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive.' \n\n[276 U.S. 394, 413]\n\u00a0\n And so here the fact that Congress declares that one of its motives in fixing the rates of duty is so to fix them that they shall encourage the industries of this country in the competition with producers in other countries in the sale of goods in this country cannot invalidate a revenue act so framed. Section 315 and its provisions are within the power of Congress.\n\n The judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJACKSON v. THE ARCHIMEDES(1928)\nNo. 103\nArgued: December 1, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Silas Blake Axtell and John W. Davis, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Roscoe H. Hupper, of New York City, for respondent.\n Mr. Howard Thayer Kingsbury, of New York City, for British Embassy, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether section 10 of the Dingley Act of 1884, 1 as amended by the Seamen's Act of 19152 and the Merchant Marine Act of 1920,3 applies to the payment of advance wages to seamen on a foreign vessel in a foreign port.\n The petitioners are British seamen, who shipped at Manchester, England, in May, 1922, on the Archimedes, a British vessel, for a round trip voyage to New York and return. When they signed the shipping articles they received advances on account of wages, which were cus- \n\n[275 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n tomary and sanctioned by the British law. On June 1, the vessel arrived in New York. On June 3, they applied for and received from the master further payments on account of wages which, with the advances made in England, exceeded one-half of the wages then earned and unpaid. On June 8, while still in port, they made a formal demand upon the master for one-half of the wages then earned and unpaid disregarding the advances made in England. This having been refused, they left the vessel and filed this libel in the District Court, claiming that under R. S.  4530,4 they were entitled to the full wages earned at the time of the demand, without deducting the advances made in England, since these advances were invalidated by section 10 of the Dingley Act, as amended, and should be disregarded in computing the amount of wages due. On the hearing the court dismissed the libel on the ground that the Act does not prohibit advances to seamen on foreign vessels in foreign ports, and such advances cannot be treated as invalid and disregarded when wages are demanded in this country. 10 F.(2d) 234. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the opinion of the District Judge. 11 F.(2d) 1000\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n To understand rightly the effect of the amendment made by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920-the controlling question in this case-it is necessary to consider first the amendment previously made by the Seamen's Act of 1915 and the decisions by this Court in reference thereto.\n By section 11 of the Seamen's Act (Comp. St.  8323), section 10 of the Dingley Act was amended so as to read as follows:\n'Sec. 10(a). That it shall be ... unlawful in any case to pay any seaman wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same. ... Any person violating any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine ... and may also be imprisoned. ... The payment of such advance wages ... shall in no case except as herein provided absolve the vessel or the master ... from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action for the recovery of such wages. ...\n\n'(e) That this section shall apply as well to foreign vessels while in waters of the United States, as to vessels of the United States, and any master ... of any foreign vessel who has violated its provisions shall be liable to the same penalty that the master, ... of a vessel of the United States would be for similar violation. The master ... of any vessel of the United States, or of any foreign vessel seeking clearance from a port of the United States, shall present his shipping articles at the office of clearance, and no clearance shall be granted any such vessel unless the provisions of this section have been complied with.'\n\n It was held by this Court in Sandberg v. McDonald (1918) \n248 \nU.S. 185, 195\n, 39 S. Ct. 84, 86 (63 L. Ed. 200), that section 11 of the Seamen's Act did not render invalid the contracts of foreign seamen as to the advance payment of wages made by a foreign vessel \n\n[275 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n in a foreign country in which the law sanctioned such contract and payment; and that when they made demand in this country for the payment of half wages, the master was entitled to deduct the advances made in the foreign country. In so holding, the Court said:\n'Conceding for the present purpose that Congress might have legislated to annual such contracts as a condition upon which foreign vessels might enter the ports of the United States, it is to be noted, that such sweeping and important requirement is not found specifically made in the statute. Had Congress intended to make void such contracts and payments a few words would have stated that intention, not leaving such an important regulation to be gathered from implication. There is nothing to indicate an intention, so far as the language of the statute is concerned, to control such matters otherwise than in the ports of the United States. The statute makes the payment of advance wages unlawful and affixes penalties for its violation, and provides that such advancements shall in no cases, except as in the act provided, absolve the master from full payment after the wages are earned, and shall be no defense to a libel or suit for wages. How far was this intended to apply to foreign vessels? We find the answer if we look to the language of the act itself. It reads that this section shall apply to foreign vessels 'while in waters of the United States.' Legislation is presumptively territorial and confined to limits over which the law-making power has jurisdiction. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 357 (29 S. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047). ... We think that there is nothing in this section to show that Congress intended to take over the control of such contracts and payments as to foreign vessels except while they were in our ports. Congress could not prevent the making of such contracts in other jurisdictions. If they saw fit to do so, foreign countries \n\n[275 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n would continue to permit such contracts and advance payments no matter what our declared law or policy in regard to them might be as to vessels coming to our ports. In the same section, which thus applies the law to foreign vessels while in waters of the United States, it is provided that the master ... of any such vessel, who violates the provisions of the act, shall be liable to the same penalty as would be persons of like character in respect to a vessel of the United States. This provision seems to us of great importance as evidencing the legislative intent to deal civilly and criminally with matters in our own jurisdiction. Congress certainly did not intend to punish criminally acts done within a foreign jurisdiction; a purpose so wholly futile is not to be attributed to Congress. United States v. Freeman, \n239 U.S. 117\n, 120 (36 S. Ct. 32). The criminal provision strengthens the presumption that Congress intended to deal only with acts committed within the jurisdiction of the United States.'\n\n On the same day, in Neilson v. Rhine Shipping Co., \n248 \nU.S. 205\n, 39 S. Ct. 89, it was likewise held, upon the same general considerations, that the Seamen's Act of 1915 did not make invalid advances that had been made to seamen by the master of an American vessel in a foreign port.\n And later, in Strathearn S. S. Co. v. Dillon (1920) \n252 \nU.S. 348, 355\n, 40 S. Ct. 350, 352 (64 L. Ed. 607), in distinguishing section 4 of the Seamen's Act (Comp. St.  8322)-which in express terms declared that contracts denying seamen the right to demand half of their earned wages at ports reached in the course of a voyage, should be void, and gave seamen on foreign vessels while in American harbors the right to enforce its provisions ion the courts of the United States5-from section 11 of the Act dealing with advance wages, this Court said:\n'In the case of Sandberg v. \n\n[275 U.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n McDonald ... we found no purpose manifested by Congress in section 11 to interfere with wages advanced in foreign ports under contracts legal where made. That section dealt with advancements, and contained no provision such as we find in section 4. Under Section 4 all contracts are avoided which run counter to the purposes of the statute. Whether consideration for contractual rights under engagements legally made in foreign countries would suggest a different course is not our province to inquire. It is sufficient to say that Congress has otherwise declared by the positive terms of this enactment. ...'\n\n The libelants concede that under section 11 of the Seamen's Act, as interpreted by this Court in the Sandberg Case, it would have been necessary to deduct the advances that had been made in England in computing the wages due them when the demand was made in this country, but insist that the law was thereafter changed in this respect by the amendment made by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920.\n By section 32 of the Merchant Marine Act, section 10 of the Dingley Act was further amended so as to make the third sentence of paragraph (a) dealing generally with advance payments, read as follows:\n'The payment of such advance wages ... whether made within or without the United States or territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof, shall in no case except as herein provided absolve the vessel or the master ... from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action for the recovery of such wages.'\n\n This amendment made no change in any other part of paragraph (a), or in paragraph (e) referring to foreign vessels, which remained in full force.\n The libelants contend that in making this amendment Congress intended to meet the effect of the decisions in both the Sandberg and Neilson Cases, and to extend the \n\n[275 U.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n prohibition of advance wages to foreign vessels in foreign ports, as well as to American vessels in foreign ports.\n We cannot sustain this contention. That this amendment expressed no intention to extend the provisions of the statute to advance payments made by foreign vessels while in foreign ports, is plain. This Court had pointed out in the Sandberg Case that such a sweeping provision was not specifically made in the statute, and that had Congress so intended, 'a few words would have stated that intention, not leaving such an important regulation to be gathered from implication.' The amendment, nevertheless, not only contained no such specific statement, but made no reference whatever to foreign vessels; left unchanged and in full force all of paragraph (e) which alone referred to foreign vessels, including the specific provision which, as held in the Sandberg Case, indicated that the prohibition of advance wages was intended to apply to foreign vessels only while in waters of the United States; made no change in the criminal provisions which strengthened the presumption that Congress intended to deal only with acts committed within the jurisdiction of the Unites States; and merely inserted the phrase 'whether made within or without the United States or territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof' in paragraph (a) which made no reference to foreign vessels. This phrase, read in the light of the context, is given full effect when applied to American vessels; and thus construed is entirely consistent with the provision in paragraph (e) relating to foreign vessels while in American waters. In short, the language of the amendment indicates no intention to extend the prohibition of the statute to advance wages paid by foreign vessels while in foreign ports. Nor can such an intention be 'gathered from implication,' or from anything in the legislative history of the amendment, in which no reference was made to foreign vessels.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 23 Stat. 53, c. 121. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 38 Stat. 1164, c. 153. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 41 Stat. 988, c. 250; U.

NATIONAL SURETY CO.(1928)\nNo. 424\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 258, 259]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul H. Ray, John Jensen, E. M. Bagley, and Harold M. Stephens, all of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bynum E. Hinton, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner Jenkins was appointed receiver of the National City Bank of Salt Lake City, an insolvent national bank, by the Comptroller of the Currency, under the provisions of section 5234, R. S. (12 USCA  192). The respondent National Surety Company brought this action against the receiver to compel the allowance of and payment of dividends on its claim upon an indemnity agreement executed by the bank. The agreement was contained in the bank's application for a bond by which the bank as principal and the respondent company as surety undertook that the official deposits of the treasurer of Salt Lake county, Utah, up to a named sum, would be repaid on demand. The deposits at the time of the insolvency exceeded the amount of the bond. The District Court directed that dividends on the claim for indemnity be postponed until the county treasurer should have been repaid the full balance of his deposit. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the decree, with instructions that the respondent \n\n[277 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n be paid dividends on an equal basis with other creditors, including the treasurer. National Surety Co. v. Jenkins, 18 F.(2d) 707. This court granted certiorari (\n275 \nU.S. 515\n, 48 S. Ct. 85, 72 L. Ed. -) to remove a conflict alleged to exist between the decision below and rulings by the Circuit Courts of Appeals in other circuits. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Fouts, 11 F.(2d) 71, 46 A. L. R. 852; Springfield National Bank v. American Surety Co., 7 F.(2d) 44.\n In his answer the receiver prayed that Groesbeck, the county treasurer, and the American Surety Company be required to interplead. An order issued, and they filed a joint answer, from which it appeared that Groesbeck, as principal, and the American Surety Company, as surety, had given to Salt Lake county an official fidelity bond in the sum of $200,000. The treasurer deposited the county funds in his custody in the bank and took as security the respondent's bond in the sum of $125,000, bonds of other surety companies, executed to him as obligee, in the total sum of $ 100,000, and from the bank a certain amount of apparently doubtful collateral.\n When the bank failed his official deposit amounted to $643,094.29. Salt Lake county was paid in full-$200,000 by the American Surety Company as surety of the treasurer's fidelity bond; $125,000 by the respondent National Surety Company; the balance by the other surety companies and by dividends paid by the receiver. When the second dividend was paid, it was sufficient to pay the final balance due from the treasurer to the county and leave a surplus of over $9,000; but there remained an unpaid balance of the deposit due from the bank to the treasurer.\n The claim of the respondent company is for its pro rata share of this surplus and of all dividends paid or to be paid by the receiver as well as of the collateral given to the treasurer by the bank. The claim is resisted by the interpleaded petitioners, the treasurer and the American Surety Company, on two grounds: First, that the right of the \n\n[277 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n treasurer and his surety to full repayment of his deposits before any dividends and paid the respondent is in this case res judicata; second, that the respondent is not entitled to share in the estate of the insolvent debtor until the balance of the creditors' claims have been fully satisfied. On both grounds the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the petitioners.\n The plea of res judicata was based on the decree in an earlier suit brought in the District Court by the county treasurer and the American Surety Company against the receiver to determine their right to the excess of the second divided over the county's claim, to all future dividends and to the collateral. The National Surety Company, the respondent here, was interpleaded and answered. A decree in favor of the American Surety Company was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. National Surety Co. v. Salt Lake County, 5 F.(2d) 34. We think the court below was right in holding that the earlier litigation had determined only that the National Surety Company was not entitled to be subrogated to the treasurer's claim and remedies against the insolvent bank until he had been paid in full, and in no way involved the National Surety Company's present separate claim on its contract of indemnity, and that the plea of res judicata was consequently ineffective. But as the certiorari was granted to review the other branch of the case, and as the view we take of it makes unnecessary an extensive consideration of the first question, we pass at once to the second.\n The right now asserted by the respondent arises, not from subrogation to the rights of the treasurer but upon its independent agreement with the bank for indemnity. The bank's undertaking was to indemnify respondent for liability which it might 'sustain or incur' by reason of its having given its surety bond, which was conditioned on the bank's keeping its deposits 'subject at all times to the check and order of the treasurer.' So long as the bank \n\n[277 U.S. 258, 266]\n\u00a0\n remained solvent respondent would have been entitled to immediate indemnity from the bank, even though that payment neither satisfied the treasurer's claim nor exhausted the surety's own liability. Davies v. Humphreys, 6 M. & W. 153; Ex parte Snowden, 17 Ch. D. 44. As between itself and its principal the surety should not have been required to make any payment at all, and to allow it prompt reimbursement would in no way impede the creditor so long as the principal remained solvent. But if, as here, the principal is insolvent, any dividends paid the surety on its claim for indemnity before the creditor's whole claim has been satisfied would decrease the creditor's dividends by his proportionate share of the payments to the surety. They would also result in a species of double proof, detrimental to the principal's other creditors, for the secured creditor would, under the applicable 'chancery rule,' still be entitled to dividends on his entire original claim. Compare Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, 19 S. Ct. 360.\n Respondent, in insisting on the letter of its agreement, takes a position in effect inconsistent with its obligation it undertook to secure to the treasurer the repayment of his deposits to the extent of $125,000. If after paying that amount to the treasurer it may then compete with him in the distribution of the insolvent's assets, the treasurer recovering on the balance of his claim is reduced accordingly and the benefit of the surety bond to the treasurer is diminished pro tanto. By the expedient of taking a separate indemnity agreement from the debtor the surety would be enabled to deprive the creditor of the full benefit of the security he had demanded.\n The established rule that the surety may not claim subrogation against an insolvent debtor until the creditor is paid in full is a recognition of the inconsistency of that position. United States v. National Surety Co., \n254 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 41 S. Ct. 29, 65 L. ed. 143; Peoples v. Peoples Bros. (D. C.) 254 F. 489; United \n\n[277 U.S. 258, 267]\n\u00a0\n States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Union Bank & Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 228 F. 448, 455. The rule would go for naught if, by claiming indemnity instead of subrogation, the surety could achieve the same result. The same policy against permitting a surety to compete with the creditor for the insolvent debtor's assets requires that the surety be denied subrogation to security given to a creditor for several debts for only one of which the surety is obligated. National Bank of Commerce v. Rockefeller (C. C. A.) 174 F. 22. Similar reasoning underlies the requirement of equity that the surety who holds the security of an insolvent debtor must give the benefit of it to the creditor for whom he is surety, until the debt is fully paid. See Keller v. Ashford, \n133 \nU.S. 610\n, 10 S. Ct. 494; Hampton v. Phipps, \n108 \nU.S. 260\n, 2 S. Ct. 622; Chamberlain v. St. Paul & S. C. R. Co., \n92 U.S. 299\n, 306; 2 Pomeroy, Equitable Remedies (2d Ed.)  925.\n Wherever equitable principles are called in play, as they pre- eminently are in determining the rights and liabilities or sureties and in the distribution of insolvents' estates, they likewise forbid the surety to secure by independent contract with the debtor indemnity at the expense of the creditor whose claim he has undertaken to secure.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN P. KING MFG. CO. v. CITY COUNCIL OF AUGUSTA(1928)\nNo. 392\nArgued: March 12, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bryan Cumming, of Augusta, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. E. H. Callaway, of Augusta, Ga., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in a state court in Georgia to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance of the city of Augusta fixing rates for water power supplied from a canal owned and maintained by the city. The plaintiff is a manufacturing company which operates a mill adjacent to the canal with water power supplied therefrom. The objection urged against the ordinance is that it is repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore invalid, in that it impairs the obligation of a prior contract whereby the city undertook to supply water power for the plaintiff's mill in perpetuity at a lower rate than that fixed in the ordinance. The court of first instance held the ordinance valid and accordingly dismissed the suit. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, 164 Ga. 306, 138 S. E. 159; and the case is \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n here on writ of error allowed by the Chief Justice of that court.\n Counsel on both sides treat the case as one which rightly may be brouhgt to this court on writ of error, but some members of the court doubt that it is such a case. Therefore this question will be given immediate consideration.\n The jurisdiction of this court to review on writ of error judgments or decrees of state courts of last resort is defined by section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as set forth in the amendatory Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 28 USCA  344(a). As there defined this jurisdiction extends to two classes of cases:\n\n\n (1)\n 'Where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, and the decision is against its validity;'\n\n\n (2)\n 'Where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.'\n Plainly the present case is not within the first provision. Is it within the second? This depends on the sense in which the words 'a statute of any state' are used therein. If they are used as narrowly comprehending only an enactment of the state Legislature, the case is excluded; but, if they are used as broadly comprehending any legislation proceeding from the lawmaking agencies of the state, the case is included.\n In usage, 'statute' is a term which has both a restricted and a broad signification. This is reflection in the following excerpt from Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawle's Revision:\n'Statute.-A law established by the act of the legislative power. An act of the Legislature. The written will of the Legislature, solemnly expressed according to the forms necessary to constitute it the law of the state.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n 'This word is used to designate the written law in contradistinction to the unwritten law.\n'Among the civilians, the term 'statute' is generally applied to laws and regulations of every sort; every provision of law which ordains, permits, or prohibits anything is designated a statute, without considering from what source it arises.'\n\n The Constitution of the United States does not use the term 'statute,' but it does employ the term 'law,' often regarded as an equivalent, to describe an exertion of legislative power. Thus it is declared that a bill presented in either house of Congress, if receiving prescribed favorable consideration, shall 'become a law,' article 1,  7; that Congress may 'make all laws' necessary and proper for carrying into execution various enumerated powers, article 1,  8, cl. 18; that no stated 'shall pass' any 'ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts,' article 1,  10, cl. 1; that no state 'shall make or enforce any law' abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, Fourteenth Amendment,  1; that the Constitution, 'laws,' and treaties of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or 'laws' of any state to the contrary notwithstanding, article 6, cl. 2; and that the judicial power of the United States shall extend, among others, to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, 'laws,' and treaties of the United States, article 3,  2.\n It of course rests with each state to determine in what form and by what agencies its legislative power may be exerted. It may legislate little or much in its Constitution, may permit the electorate to make laws by direct vote, may intrust its Legislature with wide lawmaking functions, and may delegate legislative authority to subordinate agencies, such as municipal councils and state com- \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n missions. But whether this power be exerted in one form or another, or by one agency or another, the enactments put forth, whether called constitutional provisions, laws ordinances, or orders are in essence legislative acts of the state; they express its will, and have no force otherwise. As respects their validity under the Constitution of the United States, all are on the same plane. If they contravene the restraints which that instrument places on the legislative power of a state, they are invalid, no matter what their form or by what agency put forth; for, as this court has said, the protection which these restraints afford applies, 'whatever the form in which the legislative power ... is exerted; that is, whether it be by a Constitution, an act of the Legislature, or an act of any subordinate instrumentality of the state exercising delegated legislative authority, like an ordinance of a municipality or an order of a commission.' Standard Scale Co. v. Farrell, \n249 \nU.S. 571, 577\n, 39 S. Ct. 380, 382 (63 L. Ed. 780).\n The jurisdictional provision we are considering is designed to be in aid of such protection. It proceeds on the theory that through inadvertence or design those who are intrusted with the legislative power of a state may exercise the same in a manner forbidden by the Constitution of the United States, and that the state courts may uphold such legislation when it should be held invalid. Unlike other state action, legislation consists of rules having continuing force and intended to be observed and applied in the future; and this regardless of the state agency from which it proceeds.\n Were the question an open one, these considerations would afford impelling reasons for holding that the jurisdictional provision uses the words 'a statute of any state' in their larger sense and is not intended to make a distinction between acts of a state Legislature and other exertions of the state's lawmaking power, but rather to include every act legislative in character to which the \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n state gives its sanction. But the question is not an open one; it heretofore has been resolved in keeping with the view just indicated.\n The jurisdictional provision originally was part of section 25 of the Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 85 (28 USCA  344), which authorized this court to review on writ of error judgments and decrees of state courts of last resort in cases-\n\n\n (1)\n 'Where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity;'\n\n\n (2)\n 'Where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and decision is in favor of such their validity;'\n\n\n (3)\n 'Where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party, under such clasue of the said Constitution, treaty, statute or commission.'\n By the Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385 (28 USCA  344), that section was re-enacted-the first and second provisions without change, and the third to read as follows:\n\n\n (3)\n 'Where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of or commission held, or authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed by either party under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission, or authority.'\n The three provisions-the third as so amended-were carried into section 709 of the Revised Statutes of 1873 and into section 237 of the Judicial Code of 1911. By the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (28 USCA  344), the third provision was \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n eliminated so far as a review on writ of error is 1925, supra, the first and second provisions 1925 supra, the first and second provisions were amended by omitting from both the with that change were re-enacted in section 237(a). 237(a).\n In order that the second provision-the material one in this case-and the change made therein may be accurately in mind, we now quote the provision in both its original and its amended from-\n'(Act 1789) where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of such their validity.'\n\n'(Act 1925) where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.'\n\n It will be seen that the phrase 'a statute of any state' has been in the provision from the time of its original enactment, and that this phrase was retained in the re-enactment of 1925 without change or qualification. So, its meaning before the re-enactment is its meaning now.\n Before coming to decided cases which we deem relevant, it is well to refer to some which, although cited as in point, appear to us not to be so. Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, and Home Insurance Co. v. Augusta, \n93 U.S. 116\n, are examples. The first is a case where a tax ordinance of Charleston was sustained by the state court over the objection that it was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. This court's jurisdiction was invoked, and was by it sustained, page 463, on the ground that the city's action in adopting the ordinance was the 'exercise of an 'authority\" under the state. Whether the ordinance was a statute of the state was not considered. The other case also involved a municipal \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n orinance which the state court had upheld against the contention that it was in conflict with the contract clause of the Constitution. This court took jurisdiction, page 121, on the grounds (a) that the validity of an authority exercised under the state was in question; and (b) that a right claimed under the Constitution was denied. There was no negation of other grounds.\n Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, is the first case in which the phrase 'a statute of any state' in the jurisdictional provision was considered and construed. There a debt arising on contract and owing by a citizen of Virginia to citizens of Pennsylvania had been sequentrated during the Civil War under an enactment of the Confederate States, and collected from the debtor by that government. After the war, the creditors brought a suit against the debtor's administrator in a state court in Virginia to collect the debt. The defendant interposed please setting up the sequentration and collection under the confederate enactment. Judgment went for the defendant on these pleas, over the plaintiffs' objection that the confederate enactment was invalid under the Constitution, and the Supreme Court of Appeals sustained that ruling. The case was brought to this court on writ of error; its jurisdiction being invoked on the grounds that the case was one (a) where the validity of both a statute of the state and an authority under the state was drawn in question as repugnant to the Constitution and was sustained, and (b) where a right, privilege, and immunity claimed under the Constitution was denied. The jurisdiction was contested, but was sustained expressly on 'both' grounds in a considered opinion by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the entire court. In sustaining the first ground, he said, pages 182, 183:\n'The pleas aver that a confederation was formed by Virginia and other states called the Confederate States of America, and that under a law of this confederation, \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n enforced in Virginia, the debt due to the plaintiffs was sequestrated. Now, the Constitution of the United States prohibits any treaty, alliance, or confederation by one state with another. The organization whose enactment is pleaded cannot, therefore, be regarded in this court as having any legal existence. It follows that whatever efficacy the enactment possessed in Virginia must be attributed to the sanction given to it by that state. Any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this court. It would be a narrow construction to limit the term to such enactments as have gone through various stages of consideration by the Legislature. There may be many acts authorized by the Constitution of a state, or by the convention that framed it, which have not been submitted to the consideration of its Legislature, yet have all the efficacy of laws. By the only authority which can be recognized as having any legal existence, that is, the state of Virginia, this act of the unauthorized confederation was enforced as a law of the commonwealth. Its validity was drawn in question on the ground that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States; and the decision of the court below was in favor of its validity.'\n\n Ford v. Surget, \n97 U.S. 594\n, is much like the case just cited. The plaintiff sued in a state court in Mississippi to recover for cotton belonging to him which the defendant had destroyed in that state during the Civil War in obedience to an enactment of the Confederate States. By special pleas the defendant set up that enactment in justification of the trespass; and the plaintiff insisted by demurrers that the enactment was contrary to the Constitution. The demurrers were overruled, and judgment was given for the defendant, which the Supreme Court affirmed. The case was brought to this court by \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n writ of error. The jurisdiction, although contested, was sustained in an opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan. He quoted with approval the above extract from Williams v. Bruffy, and added, page 603:\n'The general orders of the state court overruling the demurrers must be accepted, in every essential sense, as an adjudication in favor of the validity of an act of the Confederate Congress, recognized and enforced as law in Mississippi, and which act, according to the rule laid down in that case, must be, therefore, regarded by us as a statute of that state, within the meaning of the provisions of the act declaring the appellate jurisdiction of this court. It results that we have power to review the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi.'\n\n Stevens v. Griffith, \n111 \nU.S. 48\n, 4 S. Ct. 283, is a case where the Supreme Court of Tennessee had given effect to an enactment of the Confederate States. This court there said, after reciting its ruling in Williams v. Bruffy, page 51 (4 S. Ct. 284):\n'So, in this case, the Confederate enactment, under which the confiscation of the money was had, can be treated only as a statute of Tennessee, by whose sanction it was enforced as a law of that state.'\n\n New Orleans Water-Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., \n125 \nU.S. 18\n, 8 S. Ct. 741, is a case wherein this court was asked on writ of error to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana giving effect to an ordinance of New Orleans against the contention that it impaired the obligation of a contract. The opinion was by Mr. Justice Gray. After stating that, to be within the contract clause of the Constitution, the impairment must be 'by a law of the state,' and that this court 'has no jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a state, on the ground that the obligation of a contract has been impaired, unless some legislative act of the state has been upheld by the judgment sought to be reviewed,' and after quoting with approval the statement \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 110]\n\u00a0\n in Williams v. Bruffy, 'any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which at state gives the force of law, is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this court,' he said, page 31 (8 S. Ct. 748):\n'So a by-law or ordinance of a municipal corporation may be such an exercise of legislative power delegated by the Legislature to the corporation as a political subdivision of the state, having all the force of law within the limits of the municipality, that it may properly be considered as a law, within the meaning of this article of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n In North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 \nU.S. 306\n, 29 S. Ct. 101, 15 Ann. Cas. 276, which came to this court from a Circuit Court of the United States, the question was presented whether a municipal ordinance was state action within the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment prohibiting 'any state' from denying due process or equal protection. The court said, page 313 (29 S. Ct. 103):\n'In this case the ordinance in question is to be regarded as in effect a statute of the state, adopted under a power granted it by the state Legislature, and hence it is an act of the state within the Fourteenth Amendment.'\n\n The construction which was put on the phrase 'a statute of any state' in the jurisdictional provisions by the decisions in Williams v. Bruffy, Ford v. Surget, and Stevens v. Griffith did not stop with those cases, but has been approvingly followed and applied in latter cases.\n In Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548\n, 34 S. Ct. 364, this court was asked to review, on writ of error, a judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina giving effect to a municipal ordinance over the objection that it was invalid under the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Justice Pitney, speaking for the entire court sustained its jurisdiction, and on that point said, page 555 ( 34 S. Ct. 366):\n\n\n[277 U.S. 100, 111]\n\u00a0\n 'A municipal by-law or ordinance, enacted by virtue of power for that purpose delegated by the Legislature of the state, is a state law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution (citing cases).\n'And any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law, is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the pertinent clause of section 709, Rev. Stat., Judicial Code,  237, which confers jurisdiction on this court. Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 183 (24 L. Ed. 716).'\n\n Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 717\n, 35 S. Ct. 511, came here from the Supreme Court of Arkansas on writ of error. The sole question involved was the validity of a municipal ordinance which the state court had sustained against the objection that it was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Justice Pitney again speaking for the entire court said, page 176 (36 S. Ct. 513):\n'The decision of the state court of last resort is conclusive upon the point that the ordinance under consideration is within the scope of the powers conferred by the state Legislature upon the city council of Little Rock. It must therefore be treated, for the purposes of our jurisdiction, as an act of legislation proceeding from the lawmaking power of the state; for a municipal ordinance passed under authority delegated by the Legislature is a state law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution; and any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law, is a statute of the state within the meaning of Judicial Code,  237, ... which confers jurisdiction upon this court. Atlantic Coast Line v. Goldsboro, \n232 U.S. 548\n, 555 (34 S. Ct. 364), and cases cited.'\n\n Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174\n, 43 S. Ct. 24, was brought here on writ of error solely on the ground that the state court had upheld a municipal ordinance against the contention that \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 112]\n\u00a0\n it was invalid under the Constitution of the United States. This court dealt with the initial question of jurisdiction as follows, page 176 (43 S. Ct. 25):\n'The validity of the ordinances under the Federal Constitution was drawn in question by objections properly taken below. A city ordinance is a law of the state within the meaning of section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended, which provides a review by writ of error where the validity of a law is sustained by the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 U.S. 548\n, 555 (34 S. Ct. 364).'\n\n Further applying the ruling in Williams v. Bruffy, this court repeatedly has held that an order of a state commission, made in the exercise of delegated legislative authority, is a statute of the state in the sense of the jurisdictional provision. Excerpts from some of the cases- all brought here from state courts on writs of error-will suffice to show the course of decision.\n'Such an order, being legislative in its nature and made by an instrumentality of the state, is a state law within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress regulating our jurisdiction.' Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 249, U. S. 422, 424, 39 S. Ct. 345, 346 (63 L. Ed. 684).\n\n'The validity of the order prescribing the rates was directly challenged on constitutional grounds, and it was held valid by the highest court of the state. The prescribing of rates is a legislative act. The commission is an instrumentality of the state, exercising delegated powers. Its order is of the same force as would be a like enactment by the Legislature. If, as alleged, the prescribed rates are confiscatory, the order is void. Plaintiff in error is entitled to bring the case here on writ of error and to have that question decided by this court. The motion to dismiss will be denied.' Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, 262 \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 113]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 679, 683, 43 S. Ct. 675, 676 (67 L. Ed. 1176) specifically followed and applied in Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 42\n, 45 S. Ct. 412.\n\n'The cause is here upon writ of error. Considering the circumstances disclosed by the record, we have no jurisdiction, unless it affirmatively appears that in the court below there was duly drawn in question the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under the state, because of repugnance to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Jud. Code,  237, as amended Sept. 6, 1916 . ... Under repeated rulings here, for jurisdictional purposes the order of the Commission must be treated as though an act of the Legislature.' Live Oak Water Users' Ass'n v. R. R. Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 46 S. Ct. 149, 150 (70 L. Ed. 305).\n\n'The authority of the Dock Commssioner and the Sinking Fund trustees, under the Act of 1871 (they exercised delegated legislative power), is such as to make the plan and the refusal equivalent to a statute of the state, and, assuming that it is in conflict with the grant and covenants or relators' deeds, it is a law of the state impairing a contract obligation under section 10, article 1, of the Federal Constitution (citing New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., \n125 \nU.S. 18\n, 8 S. Ct. 741; Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 183; and other cases). We have jurisdiction of the writ of error under  237 of the Judicial Code.' Appleby v. Delaney, \n271 \nU.S. 403, 409\n, 46 S. Ct. 581, 583 (70 L. Ed. 1009).\n\n A like view of an order, legislative in nature, of a state commission has been taken in other related cases. Grand Trunk Western Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 400, 403\n, 31 S. Ct. 537; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 318\n, 34 S. Ct. 48; Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 141\n, 39 S. Ct. 237; Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 292\n, 43 S. Ct. 353.\n In no case has phrase 'a statute of any state' in the jurisdictional provision been construed otherwise than as shown in the foregoing review. With its use else \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 114]\n\u00a0\n where-especially in connections indicative of its use in a different sense- we are not now concerned.\n It is said that the Act of February 13, 1925, which amended the jurisdictional provision, was enacted with the purpose of contracting the obligatory jurisdiction of this court. We recognize that there was such a purpose, and that effect should be given to it. But the act dealt with several jurisdictional provisions, including those relating to cases coming to this court from the Circuit Courts of Appeals, the District Courts, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and the Court of Claims. It shows that the purpose was to cut down and change our jurisdiction in particular respects and to leave it as before in others. We are concerned here with a particular jurisdiction, as to which there was no cutting down or change. The terms whereby it was defined in the original provision were retained, and thus it was left as before.\n We accordingly hold that the ordinance in question is a statute of the state within the meaning of the jurisdictional provision, and therefore that this case is rightly here on writ of error. So we turn to the merits.\n The adoption and terms of the ordinance are not in dispute. Nor is it questioned that the city became obligated long before the ordinance to supply water power from its canal for the plaintiff's mill. But it is questioned that there was any engagement for a designated price or rate in perpetuity. Both courts below found for the city of this point. That finding is entitled to respect, but is not conclusive; for it rests with this court in cases like this, where contract obligations are said to have been impaired by subsequent legislation contrary to the constitutional restriction, to determine whether there was a contract and what obligations arose from it. St. Paul Gaslight Co. \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 115]\n\u00a0\n v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 21 S. Ct. 575; Appleby v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 379\n, 380 S., 46 S. Ct. 569. It is admitted that there was here no formal contract. But it is insisted that a contract arose from conversations and correspondence between representatives of the plaintiff and officers of the city, and that it included an engagement for a designated price or rate in perpetuity. The proofs have been considered. It would serve no purpose to review them in this opinion. We think they fall short of showing any engagement respecting the rate, other than that it was to be the established rate for users in general. The rate had been fixed by ordinance when the plaintiff obtained the right to have water power supplied to its mill, but there was, as we construe the proofs, no engagement that that rate should continue indefinitely. The city may be under a duty to supply the power at a reasonable rate (see Millers v. Augusta, 63 Ga. 722), but that question is not in this case. The plaintiff's objection is confined to the asserted impairment of a prior contract.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs), dissenting.\n I think that the writ of error should be dismissed. The judgment below was entered after the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937, 942. That act struck from section 237 of the Judicial Code the Words 'or an authority exercised under any state.' \n1\n The section as so amended limits the right of review by writ of error to cases where the highest court of a state has denied the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, or has affirmed the validity of a statute of a state, challenged as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 116]\n\u00a0\n United States. Other cases can be reviewed only if this court, in the exercise of its discretion, grants a writ of certiorari. Here the challenge was to the validity of an ordinance of a city. I cannot believe that, if Congress had intended to maintain our jurisdiction to review judgments sustaining such ordinances on writ of error, it would not have found clearer language in which to express its purpose.\n The question before us is the interpretation, not of the word 'laws,' used in the Constitution, but the narrower term 'statute,' employed in the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20,  25, 1 Stat. 73, 85 (28 USCA  344). And our task is to construe, not the single word 'statute,' but the phrase 'statute of any state.' Laws or regulations adopted by a municipality are called, in common speech, either ordinances or by-laws, not 'statutes.' \n2\n In some connections, rules established by an institution are referred to as statutes. Thus the rules adopted by a university or its founder are sometimes spoken of as statutes of the university. But no one would call them statutes of the state under whose law the university is incorporated. Nor would any one, in refer- \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 117]\n\u00a0\n ring to the laws or regulations adopted by municipal or other corporations, speak of them as 'statutes of the state.' Has the phrase as originally used in section 25 of the Judiciary Act of September 4, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 72, 85, and as re-enacted in section 2 of the Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, 386, in section 709 of the Revised Statutes, in section 237 of the Judicial Code, and finally in the act of 1925 (28 USCA  344), acquired a different, a conventional, meaning, so that it must be held to include municipal ordinances?\n Our jurisdiction to review a judgment of a state court sustaining the validity of a municipal ordinance alleged to be repugnant to the Federal Constitution, was first invoked in Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 463-464. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was then in force without amendment, authorized a review by writ of error in any case 'where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of such their validity, or where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party, under such clause of the said Constitution, treaty, statute or commission.' The jurisdiction having been questioned, because of the nature of the proceeding, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall took occasion to specify the clause of section 25 on which he conceived the jurisdiction to rest:\n'In this case, the city ordinance of Charleston is the exercise of an 'authority under the state of South Carolina,' 'the validity of which has been drawn in question, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution,' and 'the decision is in favour of its validity.\" \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 118]\n\u00a0\n The jurisdiction then declared was exercised, without question, in the cases involving municipal ordinances that came before the court during the next half century. \n3\n In 1876 the subject was carefully reconsidered in Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta, \n93 \nU.S. 116, 118\n, 121 S. (23 L. Ed. 825). After stating the possible bases of jurisdiction under section 709 of the Revised Statutes, the court said:\n\n'Here there was drawn in question the authority exercised by the city council under the state in passing the ordinance imposing the tax complained of. The question raised was as to its repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States; and the decision was in favor of the validity of the authority so exercised. A right was also claimed under the Constitution of the United States. The decision was adverse to the claim. The case is, therefore, within two of the categories we have stated. The jurisdictional objection cannot be maintained.'\n\n The court would hardly have omitted to say that review might also have been had by virtue of the 'statute' clause if it had been of opinion that a municipal ordinance could be properly so described.\n The second of the categories mentioned in Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta, was eliminated, so far as the right to review by writ of error was concerned, by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726. In cases where the showing was merely that a title, right, privilege, or immunity guaranteed by the Constitution had been claimed and denied, that act provided that there could be no review except by certiorari. But, as it left unchanged the clause regarding the validity of an authority, on which Mr. Chief Justice Marshall had based the power of this court of review judgments sustaining municipal ordinances, our jurisdiction over such judgments remained unaffected. When, in 1925, the 'authority' clause was \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 119]\n\u00a0\n struck from section 237 of the Judicial Code and our jurisdiction on writ of error under that section was limited to cases involving the validity of a statute, Congress cannot have been unaware of the difference, for jurisdictional purposes, between a statute of a state and a municipal ordinance. For attention had been called to the difference by numerous decisions under several jurisdictional acts; the most recent being of wide public interest.\n The act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 557, section 17 of which was embodied in the Judicial Code as section 266 (28 USCA  380), declared that 'no interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a state by restraining the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement or execution of such statute' should issue except upon a hearing before three judges as there provided. An unbroken line of decisions, beginning in 1911, has held that a municipal ordinance is not a statute within the meaning of that section. Sperry & Mutchinson Co. v. City of Tacoma (C. C.) 190 F. 682; Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Memphis (D. C.) 198 F. 955; Birmingham Waterworks Co. v. City of Birmingham (D. C.) 211 F. 497, affirmed (C. C. A) 213 F. 450; Calhoun v. City of Seattle (D. C.) 215 F. 226; City of Des Moines v. Des Moines Gas Co. (C. C. A.) 264 F. 506; City of Dallas v. Dallas Telephone Co. (C. C. A.) 272 F. 410. See, also, Land Development Co. v. City of New Orleans (D. C.) 13 F.(2d) 898, reversed on the merits (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 1016. The principal ground of these decisions, namely, 'that the natural meaning of 'statute of a state' is a statute or law directly passed by the Legislature of the state, and the natural meaning of 'any officer of such state' is an officer whose authority extends throughout the state, and is not limited to a small district' (Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Memphis (D. C.) 198 F. 955, 957), is, of course, equally applicable to section 237 of the Judicial Code. It cannot have been unknown to Congress. The construction had already been established when the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013, amended section 266 so as to make \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 120]\n\u00a0\n it clearly applicable to suits to enjoin the orders of a state commission. 4 The amending act inserted, after the words 'in the enforcement or execution of such statute,' the words 'or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under an pursuant to the statutes of such state.' Congress did not include in the amendment any reference to municipal ordinances. The fact that it did not is significant. 5 \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 121]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the act of 1925, the difference, for purposes of appellate review, between a statute and a law enacted by a subordinate legislative body, had been called to the attention of Congress also by the cases which settled that the enactments of the Legislatures and other lawmaking bodies of the territories and of the District of Columbia are not statutes of the United States within the meaning of legislation governing the jurisdiction of this court. The question appears to have arisen first under the Act of March 3, 1885, c. 355,  2, 23 Stat. 443. The phraseology of this statute was similar to that of section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and this court has always recognized that decisions under it, and its later re- enactments are authoritative with regard to the construction of section 237 of the Judicial Code. \n6\n It permitted \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 122]\n\u00a0\n review of any judgment of the Supreme Court of a territory or of the District of Columbia where 'is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of or an authority exercised under the United States.' Thereafter that provision, as modified by the act creating the Court of Appeals for the District, February 9, 1893, c. 74,  8, 27 Stat. 434, 436, District Code,  233, 31 Stat. 1189, 1227, governed our appellate jurisdiction over the highest courts of the continential territories ( other than Alaska) and of the District until the enactment of the Judicial Code, in which it was embodied as section 245 (36 Stat. 1158) and, with important changes, as section 250 (36 Stat. 1159). That our appellate jurisdiction over judgments involving the validity of acts of territorial Legislatures and of the legislative body of the District, depended on the clause in the act of 1885 allowing such review where the validity of an authority exercised under the United States had been challenged, was indicated in Maricopa & Phoenix R. R. Co. v. Arizona, \n156 \nU.S. 347, 350\n, 351 S., 15 S. Ct. 391, and Parsons v. District of Columbia, \n170 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 50 S., 18 S. Ct. 521. The subject was fully discussed in more recent opinions. Thus, in New Mexico ex rel. McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 38, 47\n, 48 S., 27 S. Ct. 1, our jurisdiction to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Mexico upholding the validity of a territorial law was sustained on the ground that 'the validity of an authority exercised under the United States in the passage and enforcement of this law is directly challenged, and the case does involve the validity of an authority exercised under the power dervied from the United States.' The right to review on appeal a judgment involving the validity of an ordinance or regulation of the District of Columbia was rested upon the same ground in Smoot v. Heyl, \n227 \nU.S. 518, 522\n, 33 S. Ct. 336, although the statute authorizing the District Commissioners to make regulations provided that they should 'have the same force and effect within the District of Columbia as if enacted by Congress.' Act \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 123]\n\u00a0\n of June 14, 1878, c. 194, 20 Stat. 131. See, also, Walker v. Gish, \n260 \nU.S. 447, 449\n, 43 S. Ct. 174.\n A similary ruling was made in Board of Public Utility Commissioners v. Manila Electric R. R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 262\n, 39 S. Ct. 272, where this court dismissed an appeal and a writ of error to review, under section 248 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat. 1158), a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. That section, until amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, 727, authorized review by writ of error or appeal, of a judgment of the highest court of the Philippine Islands where either the validity or the construction of a statute of the United States was involved. Reavis v. Fianza, \n215 \nU.S. 16, 21\n, 22 S., 30 S. Ct. 1; Gsell v. Insular Collector, \n239 U.S. 93\n, 94-96, 36 S. Ct. 39. The railroad challenged an order of the commissioners purporting to be made in execution of an act of the Philippine Commission authorizing the city of Manila to grant a franchise ordinance passed under the powers thereby granted. This court dismissed the appeal and writ of error for want of jurisdiction, necessarily holding 'that the mere construction by the court of the franchise ordinance, and its consequent ruling that the duty did not rest on the railroad company to give the free transportation which the orders of the Commissioners had directed to be given' did not involve either the construction or the validity of a statute of the United States.\n Obviously, the statutes of territorial Legislatures, the regulations of the commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Philippine statutes and ordinances bear a relation to acts of Congress that is wholly comparable to that borne by municipal ordinances to the statutes passed by the Legislature of a state. Congress cannot have intended that in the Act of 1925, the phrase 'statute of any state' should be read as including municipal ordinances within a state, while, under like circumstances, the phrase 'statute of the United States' does not include \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 124]\n\u00a0\n the ordinances of the District of Columbia, even where the enabling act provides that the ordinances shall have the same force as if enacted by the Congress of the United States.\n Moreover, if municipal ordinances are deemed to be statutes of a state within the meaning of section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, legislative orders of state commissions, boards, and officials must be also. Prior to the act of 1925, judgments sustaining the validity of such orders were reviewable on writ of error as fully as judgments sustaining the validity of statutes and ordinances. Between the effective date of the act of 1916 and that of the act of 1925, this court wrote opinions in 21 cases in which a judgment of the highest court of a state involving the validity of an order of a commission was reviewed on writ of error. \n7\n In none of the opinions was it stated that jurisdiction existed because an order is a statute of state. \n8\n On the other hand, in Lancaster v. McCarty, 267 \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 125]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 427, 430, 45 S. Ct. 342, 343 (69 L. Ed. 696), where our jurisdiction was invoked to review, on writ of error, the judgment of a state court denying the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the jurisdiction was sustained on the ground that the order 'is an authority exervised under the United States which by the contention of the shippers was drawn in question and its validity denied by the state court.' Can it be that, while our power to review on writ of error a judgment of a state court denying the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission rested on the 'authority' clause, our power to review a judgment sustaining the validity of an order of a state commission did not? 9\n The difference between a statute and an ordinance for purposes of appellate review-a difference which rests wholly on expediency-had been acted upon by Congress half a century earlier, when it undertook to deal with the congestion of business in this court by regulating the \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 126]\n\u00a0\n priority of hearings in revenue cases. Act of June 30, 1870, c. 181, 16 Stat. 176 (28 USCA  768); Davenport City v. Dows, 15 Wall. 390, 392.10 It was reaffirmed when Congress, in 1925, withdrew the right to a direct appeal from the District Court in cases involving the validity of municipal ordinances, though allowing such an appeal in certain cases involving the validity of statutes and orders of commissions. On the other hand, the essential identity of statutes, ordinances, and orders, where the question concerns substantive rights, has always been recognized. Since all regulations established by competent authority are laws, the comprehensive term 'laws' has been used when it was desired to include all forms of legislative action. \n11\n Thus, as the enactments of a subordinate body exercising legislative authority are a part of the laws of a state, an ordinance or an order is a law within the meaning of the contract clause, and is state action within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. North \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 127]\n\u00a0\n American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 \nU.S. 306, 313\n, 29 S. Ct. 101, 15 Ann. Cas. 276; Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 400, 403\n, 31 S. Ct. 537; Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 162\n, 163 S., 33 S. Ct. 220, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 224; Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v.

For, as this court has pointed out in New Orleans Water Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., \n125 \nU.S. 18, 30\n, 31 S., 8 S. Ct. 741, 748 (31 L. Ed. 607):\n'It is not strictly and literally true, that a law of a state, in order to come within the constitutional prohibition, must be either in the form of a statute enacted by the Legislature in the ordinary course of legislation, or in the form of a Constitution established by the people of the state as their fundamental law.12\n\n Prior to the act of 1925, final judgments of a District or Circuit Court involving the constitutional validity of a municipal ordinance could be brought directly to this court by writ of error or appeal under section 5 of the Court of Appeals Act, Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827, 828, and section 238 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  345), because such review was authorized 'in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States,' and 'in any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.' Davis & Farnum Manufacturing Co. v. City of Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207, 216\n, 23 S. Ct. 498; Boise Artesian Water Co. v. Boise City, \n230 \nU.S. 84, 90\n, 33 S. Ct. 997. See Standard Scale Co. v. Farrell, \n249 \nU.S. 571, 577\n, 39 S. Ct. 380. And likewise a case involving the constitutional validity of an \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 128]\n\u00a0\n ordinance could be brought here on writ of error to or on appeal from the Circuit Court of Appeals if the jurisdiction of the District or Circuit Court had been invoked in part on constitutional grounds. City of Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259, 267\n, 34 S. Ct. 95. But in 1925 Congress amended section 238 (28 USCA  345) so as to confine the right to a direct appeal in cases involving the validity of state action to those which fell within the provisions of section 266 (28 USCA  380)- provisions which had already been construed as not including municipal ordinances. Unless the phrase 'statute of any state,' as used in sections 237(a) and 240(b) of the Judicial Code as amended (28 USCA  344(a), 347( b)), includes municipal ordinances, no case from any lower court involving only the validity of a municipal ordinance can now be reviewed by this court otherwise than upon certiorari.\n When it is borne in mind that the severe limitations upon the right of review by this court imposed by the act of 1925 were made solely because the increase of the court's business compelled, the reasons why Congress should have taken away the right to a review by writ of error to the highest court of a state in cases involving the validity of ordinances, while leaving unaffected the right in cases involving the validity of statutes, becomes clear. There are only 48 states. In 1920 there were 924 municipalities in the United States of more than 8,000 inhabitants. \n13\n The validity of ordinances of even smaller municipalities had come to this court for adjudication. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[277 U.S. 100, 129]\n\u00a0\n The increasingly complex conditions of urban life have led, as this court noted in Village of Euclid v.Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 386\n, 387 S., 47 S. Ct. 114, to a corresponding increase in municipal police legislation. Recently, two classes of municipal ordinances, new in character-those relating to zoning and those relating to motor vehicles- had become the subject of many controversies. The constitutionality of these ordinances can rarely be determined simply by applying a general rule. The court must consider the effect of the ordinance as applied. As the validity of the particular ordinance depends ordinarily upon special facts,15 these must be examined whenever there is jurisdiction. Dahnke- Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106. Though no burdensome factual inquiry is involved, the controversy may often be of trifling significance, as in the case at bar. Thus, persuasive reasons existed why Congress should have denied, in 1925, review by writ of error in cases which involved only the validity of a municipal ordinance.\n If, by striking out from section 237 of the Judicial Code the clause, 'or an authority exercised under any state,' Congress did not exclude from review by writ of error cases involving the validity of municipal ordinances and commission orders, it wholly failed to accomplish what, in view of the statements made to it in regard to the \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 130]\n\u00a0\n effect of the amendment,16 must be deemed to have been its purpose in so amending the section; that is, to relieve this court, in many cases, of the burden of obligatory review. For, other than these, there had been considered by this court, in the nine years between the effective dates of the Jurisdictional Acts of 1916 and 1925, and decided with opinions, not more than eight cases involving the validity of an authority exercised under a state or under the United States. \n17\n On the other hand the forty cases in which judgments of state courts sustaining municipal ordinances or commission orders had been reviewed on writ of error, had entailed a burden out of all proportion to their number. The evidence introduced to establish the facts in cases involving the validity either of orders or of municipal ordinances is often both volum- \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 131]\n\u00a0\n inous and conflicting. 18 Condensation of the evidence is not required, as in cases coming from the lower federal courts. See Equity Rule 75(b), 226 U. S. Appendix 23; Rule 7(2), \n266 U.S. 657\n, 658. Compare Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard Asphalt & Rubber Co., No. 194, \n275 \nU.S. 372\n, 48 S. Ct. 183, decided January 3, 1928. Although the evidence is often conflicting, findings of fact are not required. Compare Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 20 S. Ct. 336; Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln, \n223 \nU.S. 349, 364\n, 32 S. Ct. 271; City of Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164, 171\n, 48 S. Ct. 66. Congress must have had the threatening volume and the heavy burden of this litigation in mind when it struck from section 237 of the Judicial Code the words 'or an authority exercised under any state.'\n From the decision of Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 463, 464, in which Mr. Chief Justice Marshall rested the jurisdiction of this court to review the judgments of state courts involving the validity of municipal ordinances upon the clause 'or an authority exercised under any state,' to the passage of the act of 1925, ninety-six years elapsed. During that period the court wrote opinions in a multitude of cases in which that specific jurisdiction was exercised. In only two of them has there been found any statement that the jurisdiction could be sustained on the ground that a municipal ordinance is a statute of a state, within the meaning of section 25 of the Juriciary Act of 1789 or its later re-enact- \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 132]\n\u00a0\n ments. These two opinions were written at successive terms by the same member of the court. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 555\n, 34 S. Ct. 364; Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 35 S. Ct. 511. An examination of the record and briefs in the two cases seems to make it clear that the statements were obiter and were made inadvertently. No question of the jurisdiction of this court under section 237 of the Judicial Code was raised or discussed by counsel in either case; and this court could not, under the legislation then in force, have entertained a doubt as to the existence of the jurisdiction. Neither opinion of the court refers to Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 463, 464, or to Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta, \n93 U.S. 116\n, 121- the cases which, on full consideration, had settled that the basis of our jurisdiction was the clause relating to the validity of an authority. Neither refers to New Mexico ex rel. McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 38, 47\n, 48 S., 27 S. Ct. 1, or to Smoot v. Heyl, 227, U. S. 518, 522, 33 S. Ct. 336-the cases which had recently confirmed that ruling. There was obviously no intention to overrule these cases.\n The only authority cited in support of the statement in the Goldsboro and Little Rock cases, Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 183, furnishes no basis for them. That case involved an act of the Congress of the Confederate States-a body whose legislation would obviously be described in common speech as 'statutes.' It was conceded that the particular act was a 'statute.' The question was whether it was a statute 'of any state.' \n19\n The court \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 133]\n\u00a0\n held that, since the enactment had been given the force of law in Virginia, it was as much the action of that state as if it had been originally passed by an authorized legislative body. In being so adopted by Virginia, the enactment clearly did not lose the quality which it had had from its inception; namely, that of being a 'statute.' It was in this connection that Mr. Justice Field said:\n'Any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this court.'\n\n This language was used with reference to the acts of an irregular legislative body whose enactments would be commonly described as 'statutes.' It had no reference to the acts of a regular legislative body whose enactments would never be characterized as statutes, in ordinary speech. That Mr. Justice Field would not so have applied it is clear, for, in the term of court preceding that in which Williams v. Bruffy was decided, he had participated in the decision in Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta, \n93 U.S. 116\n, 121, in which the court had plainly indicated that a municipal ordinance was not a 'statute of any state.'\n The dicta concerning our jurisdiction in Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Goldsboro, and in Reinman v. Little \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 134]\n\u00a0\n Rock, have never been repeated in any later case dealing with municipal ordinances, even where the decisions in the two cases have been relied upon. Some care seems to have been taken not to repeat the expression that a municipal ordinance was a statute of a state. See Thomas Cusack Co. v. Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 529\n, 37 S. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594; Zucht v. King, \n260 \nU.S. 174, 176\n, 43 S. Ct. 24. To construe the phrase 'statute of any state' as applying to a municipal ordinance disregards the common and appropriate use of the words, ignores decisions which for nearly a century have governed our jurisdiction to review judgments of state courts sustaining the validity of such ordinances, and tends to defeat the general purpose of the act of 1925 'to relieve this court by limiting further the absolute right to a review by it.' Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n272 \nU.S. 317, 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 105, 106 (71 L. Ed. 273); Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 47 S. Ct. 385. 20 It completely frustrates the particular purpose which Congress must have had is striking from section 237 the clause 'or an authority exercised under any state.' \n21\n The trivial character of the substan- \n\n[277 U.S. 100, 135]\n\u00a0\n tive question presented by this case-in which a writ of certiorari, if applied for, would plainly not have been granted-illustrates the wisdom of Congress in limiting our jurisdiction on writ of error. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act of 1925 also struck out the words 'or an authority exercised under the United States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These are the terms employed in the charters of American cities and towns both before and since the adoption of the Constitution. They have been continuously employed apparently by all tex-writers on municipal corporations and government. 'Local laws of a numicipal corporation, duly enacted by the proper authorities, prescribing general, uniform and permanent rules of conduct, relating to the corporate affairs of the municipality, are, in this country, generally designated as ordinances. 'By-laws' or 'bye-laws' was the original designation.' McQuillin, Municipal Ordinances,  1; 2 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations,  632. 'The result of legislative action by a municipal council or assembly is a local law usually denominated an ordinance.' 2 Abbott, Municipal Corporations,  514. See, also, Dillon, Municipal Corporations (1st Ed.) p. 270; Munro, Municipal Government and Administration, p. 209; Reed, Municipal Government, p. 173. No instance has been found where such writers have used the word 'statutes' in referring to municipal ordinances. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Waring v. Mayor, 8 Wall. 110; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall, 123; Osborne v. Mobile, 16 Wall. 479; Cannon v. New Orleans, 20 Wall. 577, Compare Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 245, 246. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See the debate in the Senate at the preceding session. 48 Cong. Rec. 8120-8123. The House Committee on the Judiciary was 'of the opinion that the statute should be broadened, so as to prevent this kind of interference (i. e., by a single judge) with state officials who are performing their duties under the provisions of a statute enacted by the Legislature of a state.' House Report, 62d Cong. 3d Sess. No. 1584, p. 2. Mr. Clayton, who was in charge of the bill in the House, said that its purpose was 'to put the order of a State Railroad Commission upon an equality with a statute of a state; in other words, to give the same force and effect to the order of a State Railroad Commission fixing rates as is accorded under existing law to a state statute.' 49 Cong. Rec. 4773. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] This court has not passed expressly on the construction to be given section 266 in this respect. Until amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, section 266 did not require the presence of three judges at the final hearing; and, on appeal to this court from the final decree, the propriety of the action of the single judge in granting or denying a temporary injunction was not strictly in issue. Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 40 S. Ct. 221. But if this court had doubted the power of a District Judge to act in such cases, it would hardly have mentioned without comment the fact that such a judge had granted or denied a temporary injunction. This it has done in a number of cases. See United Railroads v. San Francisco, \n249 \nU.S. 517, 519\n, 39 S. Ct. 361; Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. Chariton, \n255 \nU.S. 539, 541\n, 41 S. Ct. 400; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 42 S. Ct. 351; Paducah v. Paducah Ry. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 267, 271\n, 43 S. Ct. 335; St. Cloud Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, \n265 \nU.S. 352, 355\n, 44 S. Ct. 492. Since the effective date of the act of 1925, this court has decided, on certiorari to Circuit Courts of Appeals, a number of cases in which an application for a temporary injunction against the enforcement of a municipal ordinance had been heard before, and the final decree rendered by, a single District Judge. See Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164\n, 48 S. Ct. 66; Hammond v. Farina Bus Line & Transportation Co., \n275 \nU.S. 173\n, 48 S. Ct. 70; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Morristown, No. 147, \n276 \nU.S. 182\n, 48 S. Ct. 276, decided February 20, 1928. If a municipal ordinance had been a statute within section 266, the decrees of the District Judges in these cases would have been void for want of jurisdiction. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Ireland v.

Ed 696, citing and following United States ex rel. Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 \nU.S. 445, 451\n, 33 S. Ct. 329. The significance of decisions under the act of 1885 is confirmed by the legislative history of the act, which shows, as seemed probable from its language, that the provision with respect to 'a treaty or statute of or an authority exercised under the United States,' was derived, like section 237 of the Judicial Code, from section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. See 16 Cong. Rec. 670, 671. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Live Oak Water Users' Association v. Railroad Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 149, the court while asserting its jurisdiction over judgments sustaining such orders, dismissed a writ of error, as the judgment below rested on adequate nonfederal grounds. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The jurisdiction was first challenged in Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679\n, 43 S. Ct. 675. The court said, at page 683 (43 S. Ct. 676): 'The prescribing of rates is a legislative act. The commission is an instrumentality of the state, exercising delegated powers. Its order is of the same force as would be a like enactment by the Legislature. If, as alleged, the prescribed rates are confiscatory, the order is void. Plaintiff in error is entitled to bring the case here on writ of error and to have that question decided by this court.' In Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 42\n, 45 S. Ct. 412, jurisdiction was assumed on the authority of the Bluefield Case. In Live Oak Water Users' Association v. Railroad Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 46 S. Ct. 149, 150 (70 L. Ed. 305), the court said that 'for jurisdictional purposes the order of the Commission must be treated as though an act of the Legislature.' This was said, of course, with reference to the situation under the act of 1916, for the judgment under review was entered October 23, 1923. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Since the effective date of the act of 1925, no judgment of a state court has been reviewed by this court on writ of error, where the sole claim was that a commission order was unconstitutional. In the following cases, governed by the act of 1925, in which this court reviewed on writ of error a judgment of a state court sustaining the validity of a commission order, the validity of the underlying statute as well as of the order was attacked: Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n272 \nU.S. 605\n, 47 S. Ct. 207; Miller Lumber Co. v. Floyd, \n273 \nU.S. 672\n, 47 S. Ct. 475 (per curiam); Fox River Paper co. v. Railroad Commission, \n273 \nU.S. 651\n, 47 S. Ct. 669; Pierce v. Barker, \n274 \nU.S. 718\n, 47 S. Ct. 589 (per curiam); Stimson Lumber Co. v. Kuykendall, \n275 \nU.S. 207\n, 48 S. Ct. 41; International-Great Northern R. R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, No. 90, \n275 \nU.S. 503\n, 48 S. Ct. 155, 72 L. Ed. -, decided December 5, 1927 (per ciriam). In Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 344\n, 47 S. Ct. 604, and in AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, No. 112, \n275 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 174, decided January 3, 1928, the review was by certiorari. In AEtna Insurance Co. v. Baker, No. 731, \n276 \nU.S. 628\n, 48 S. Ct. 321, 72 L. Ed. -, decided March 5, 1928, certiorari was denied. Compare Phillips v. oklahoma, \n274 \nU.S. 721\n, 47 S. Ct. 588 (per curiam); Phillips v. Oklahoma, No. 20, \n275 \nU.S. 489\n, 48 S. Ct. 32, 72 L. Ed. -, decided October 24, 1927 (per curiam); Missouri v. Public Service Commission, Nos. 21-27, \n275 \nU.S. 489\n, 48 S. Ct. 32, 72 L. Ed. -, decided October 24, 1927 ( per curiam). \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Mr. Chief Justice Chase eplained why the act should be construed as applying only to statutes and not to municipal ordinances: 'This preference is given, plainly enough, because of the presumed importance of such cases to the administration and internal welfare of the states, and because of their dignity as equal members of the Union. The reasons for preference do not apply to municipal corporations, more than to railroad and many other corporations.' Page 392. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] In procedural matters-which, like jurisdiction, rest upon considerations of expediency-the difference between statutes and ordinances has been observed, in some instances, even when in the legislation the more comprehensive term 'laws' was used. Such was the case in Davenport City v. Dows, supra. Again, while municipal ordinances are 'laws of the several states' within the meaning of section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 92, and section 721 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA  725), they will not be judicially noticed in the federal courts; for 'an ordinance is not a public statute, but a mere municipal regulation.' Robinson v. Denver Tramway Co. (C. C. A.) 164 F. 174, 176. Compare Garlich v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 131 F. 837, 839; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. Co. v. Hamilton (C. C.) 182 F. 117, 121. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It was on this statement of Mr. Justice Gray's that the court relied in North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 \nU.S. 306, 313\n, 29 S. Ct. 101, 103 (53 L. Ed. 195, 15 Ann. Cas. 276), where it answered a contention that a bill alleging only municipal legislative action presented no constitutional question sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, by saying: 'In this case the ordinance in question is to be regard as in effect a statute of the state, adopted under a power granted it by the state Legislature, and hence it is an act of the state within the Fourteenth Amendment.' \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Fourteenth Census of the United States (1920) vol. I, table 27. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] See, e. g., Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 \nU.S. 289\n, 14 S. Ct. 829; Wabash R. R. Co. v. Defiance, \n167 \nU.S. 88\n, 17 S. Ct. 748; Wilson v.

Ct. 100, and Village of University Heights v. Cleveland Jewish Orphans Home, No. 594, \n275 \nU.S. 569\n, 48 S. Ct. 141, 72 L. Ed. -, decided November 28, 1927, the court denied petitions for certiorari in cases where Circuit Courts of Appeals had held the zoning ordinances of small suburban districts to be unconstitutional as applied to the respondents. If ordinances are statutes of a state, these cases could have been brought here by writ of error under section 240(b). In Gorieb v. Fox, \n274 \nU.S. 603\n, 47 S. Ct. 675, 53 A. L. R. 1210, a judgment of a state court sustaining a zoning ordinance was reviewed by certiorari. Compare Township of Maplewood v. Margolis, Nos. 644, 645, \n276 \nU.S. 617, 618\n, 48 S. Ct. 212, 72 L. Ed. -, certiorari denied, January 16, 1928; Nectow v. City of Cambridge, No. 509, \n277 \nU.S. 183\n, 48 S. Ct. 447, decided this day. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The court has noted this dependence with respect both to zoning ordinances and to bus regulations. See Euclid v. Amber Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 395\n, 47 S. Ct. 114; Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164, 170\n, 48 S. Ct. 66. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See Hearing before a Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate, 68th Cong. 1st Sess. on S. 2060, p. 35; Hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, 68th Cong. 2d Sess. on H. R. 8206, p. 13. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] In only three cases in which opinion were written aside from those involving municipal ordinances and commission orders, does jurisdiction appear to have been exercised under the clause in the act of 1916 allowing a writ of error in cases where the validity of an authority exercised under a state has been challenged and sustained. Schwab v. Richardson, \n263 \nU.S. 88\n, 44 S. Ct. 60; Love v. Griffith, \n266 \nU.S. 32\n, 45 S. Ct. 12; Appleby v. Delaney, \n271 \nU.S. 403\n, 46 S. Ct. 581. Possibly, under the view announced by the court, even such state action as was involved in these cases amounts to 'a statute of a state.' In five cases jurisdiction seems to have been based on the clause allowing a writ of error where the validity of an authority exercised under the United States has been denied. American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617\n, 37 S. Ct. 656; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 135\n, 39 S. Ct. 502; Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163\n, 39 S. Ct. 507, 4 A. L. R. 1623; Davis v. Newton Coal Co., \n267 \nU.S. 292\n, 45 S. Ct. 305; Lancaster v. McCarty, \n267 \nU.S. 427\n, 45 S. Ct. 324. The first and the last of this group concerned orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which, presumably, must be held to be statutes of the United States if the orders of state commissions are statutes of a state. Perhaps the other three as well were statutes of the United States under the view now taken by the court. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Thus, in Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, the record was 685 pages in length. In Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679\n, 43 S. Ct. 675, the record extended over 1,398 pages. The record in Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S. Ct. 412, contained 1,131 pages in addition to numerous exhibits. In Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164\n, 48 S. Ct. 66, and Hammond v. Farina Bus Line & Transportation Co., \n275 \nU.S. 173\n, 48 S. Ct. 70, the court found itself compelled to remand to the District Court in order for that court to make proper findings of fact. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] That the sole question discussed was whether the act of the Congress of the Confederate States was an act of 'any state' appears from the briefs on file in the office of the clerk. See Supplemental Brief of Enoch Totten for the Plaintiff in Error, pp. 10, 11; Brief of Henry W. Garnett for the Defendant in Error, p. 3; Brief of William A. Maury, as amicus curiae, pp. 4, 5, 7. The question was thus stated by Mr. Maury on p. 5 of his brief: 'Upon what ground, then, can it be maintained that a statute of, or authority exercised under, the hostile de facto government of Virginia was the statute of or authority of a state, in the sense of the law which is this court's commission to take cognizance of appeals from the state tribunals? (Scott v. Jones, 5 How. 343).' The case cited by Mr. Maury Scott v. Jones, 5 How. 343, 376, held that the statutes of an unorganized political body were not statutes 'of a state' within the meaning of section 25 of the Judiciary Act, although that body later became a state. In Miners' Bank v. Iowa, 12 How. 1, a territorial statute was held not to be a statute 'of a state' within section 25, though the territory had since become a state. The language in Ford v. Surget, \n97 \nU.S. 594, 603\n, 604 S., and Stevens v. Griffith, \n111 \nU.S. 48, 50\n, 4 S. Ct. 283, also makes clear the exact point of the decision in Williams v. Bruffy. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Much weight was given to this purpose in construing earlier acts reducing our jurisdiction. Compare McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661, 666\n, 12 S. Ct. 118, Robinson v. Caldwell, \n165 \nU.S. 359, 362\n, 17 S. Ct. 343, American Sugar Refining Co. v. New Orleans, \n181 \nU.S. 277, 281\n, 21 S.

Ct. 553, construing section 250 of the Judicial Code; Inter- Island Steam Navigation Co., Limited, v. Ward, \n242 \nU.S. 1\n, 37 S. Ct. 1, construing section 246 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat. 1158), as amended by the Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, 38 Stat. 803. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] Since the effective date of the act of 1925, judgments of state courts sustaining the validity of municipal ordinances have been reviewed on writ of error in a number of cases. Beery v. Houghton, \n273 \nU.S. 671\n, 47 S. Ct. 474 (per curiam); Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 630; Angelo v. Winston- Salem, \n274 \nU.S. 725\n, 47 S.

But in none of them did counsel question the jurisdiction of this court, or call to our attention the significance of the amendment of section 237 made by the act of 1925. It is well settled that the exercise of jurisdiction under such circumstances is not to be deemed a precedent when the question is finally brought before us for determination. United States v.

The District Judge granted a restraining order pending application for a temporary injunction. There was a hearing before the court, consisting of three judges, organized as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code, U. S. C. tit. 28,  380; it set \n\n[278 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n aside the restraining order and denied the injunction. Then the court allowed this appeal, found that the plaintiffs will sustain irreparable harm and damage, and stayed the enforcement of the act pending determination here.\n The purpose of this act is the same in respect of oysters as that of Act No. 103 in respect of shrimp, considered in Foster-Fountain Packing Co ., Inc., v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1\n, 49 S. Ct. 1, 73 L. Ed. -, decided this day. The challenged provisions of the one closely correspond to those of the other.

TASHIRO(1928)\nNo. 13\nArgued: October 9, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n Mr. U. S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. J. Marion Wright, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondents, subjects of Japan residing in California, presented for filing in the office of the secretary of state of California, one of the petitioners, proposed articles of incorporation of the 'Japanese Hospital of Los Angeles.' The articles provided for the creation of a business corporation with a share capital of $100,000. They purported to authorize the corporation to construct and operate in Los Angeles a general hospital with a home for nurses and resident physicians, and to lease land for that purpose.\n Although the articies complied with all provisions of the California statutes governing the organization of a corporation for such purposes, the petitioners refused to file them on the ground that, as the respondents were citizens of Japan, the Alien Land Law of the state (St. 1921, p. lxxxiii) did not permit an incorporation by them for the purposes named. The respondents then brought, in the Supreme Court of Cali- \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n fornia, a proceeding in mandamus to compel the petitioners to file the proposed articles and to issue a certificate of incorporation to the hospital. The mandamus petition set up that the treaty of commerce and navigation between the government of the United States and the empire of Japan, proclaimed April 5, 1911, 37 Stat. 1504, and now in force, conferred on citizens and subjects of the empire of Japan the right to incorporate in the United States for the purposes named in the proposed articles.\n The state court granted the writ as prayed, basing its determination on the construction of the treaty. Tashiro v. Jordan, 201 Cal. 236, 256 P. 545, 53 A. L. R. 1279. This court granted the petition of the secretary of state of California for certiorari May 14, 1928. \n277 \nU.S. 580\n, 48 S. Ct. 527.\n Section 2 of the Alien Land Law of California, as amended by the Act of the Legislature approved June 20, 1923, Stats. 1923, p. 1020, provides that aliens of a class in which respondents are included may acquire, possess and enjoy real estate within the state 'in the manner and to the extent, and for the purposes prescribed by any treaty now existing between the government of the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject, and not otherwise.' Section 3, in like terms, permits (a) acquisition of land by a corporation, the majority of whose stockholders are aliens; and (b) the purchase by aliens of stock in corporations owning or leasing land, only for purposes prescribed by such a treaty.\n The statutes of California do not otherwise forbid the organizing of a corporation by citizens of Japan residing in the state, and by these enactments there was effected perfect harmony in the operation of the statute and of the treaty. What the treaty prescribes the statute authorizes. There is thus no possibility of conflict between the exercise of the treaty-making power of the federal government and the reserved powers of the state such as that \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n suggested in Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 267\n, 10 S. Ct. 295, on which petitioners placed reliance on the argument.\n The Supreme Court of California, in passing upon the application for mandamus, granted the relief prayed, not as a matter of statutory construction, but because it thought the conduct of a hospital by Japanese citizens through the instrumentality of a corporation, organized under the laws of the state, was a privilege secured to the respondents by the treaty which the state statute did not purport to withhold. The privilege challenged by petitioners is one specially set up or claimed under a treaty of the United States and sustained by the state court and the case is thus one within the jurisdiction of this court conferred by section 237( b) of the Judicial Code, 28 USCA  344(b). Compare Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 120\n, 44 S. Ct. 274.\n The question presented is one of the construction of the treaty, the relevant portions of which are printed in the margin. \n1\n It in terms authorizes the citizens of Japan to carry on trade within the United States and 'to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, and gen- \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n erally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects, submitting themselves to the laws and regulations there established.'\n The petitioners insist that the construction and operation of a hospital is not one of the purposes prescribed by the treaty, which, it is argued, are limited so far as 'trade' and 'commerce' are concerned to the purchase and sale or exchange of goods and commodities, and that, in any case, the treaty does not confer upon Japanese subjects, resident in California, the privilege of forming a corporation under the laws of California or of leasing lands through a corporate agency for such a purpose.\n The principles which should control the diplomatic relations of nations, and the good faith of treaties as well, require that their obligations should be liberally construed so as to effect the apparent intention of the parties to secure equality and reciprocity between them. See Geofroy v. Riggs, supra; Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 22 S. Ct. 195; Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 57\n, 23 S. Ct. 781; In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 475\n, 11 S. Ct. 897. Upon like ground, where a treaty fairly admits of two constructions, one restricting the rights that may be claimed under it and the other enlarging them, the more liberal construction is to be preferred. Asakura v. Seattle, \n265 \nU.S. 332\n, 44 S. Ct. 515; Tucker v. Alexandroff, supra; Geofroy v. Riggs, supra.\n While in a narrow and restricted sense the terms 'commerce,' or commercial,' and 'trade' may be limited to the purchase and sale or exchange of goods and commodities, they may connote, as well, other occupations and other recognized forms of business enterprise which do not necessarily involve trading in merchandise. Asakura v. Seattle, supra. And although commerce includes traffic in this narrower sense, for more than a century it has been judicially recognized that in a broad sense it \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n embraces every phase of commercial and business activity and intercourse. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189.\n Considerations which led this court to conclude that the terms 'trade' and 'commerce' as used in this treaty do not include agriculture, and the circumstances attending the making of the treaty which were deemed to exclude from the operation of its broad language any grant of the privilege of acquiring and using lands within the United States for agricultural purposes, were discussed in the opinions in Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 223\n, 44 S. Ct. 15, Webb v. O'Brien, \n263 \nU.S. 313, 323\n, 44 S. Ct. 112, Frick v. Webb, \n263 \nU.S. 326, 333\n, 44 S. Ct. 115, and need not now be detailed. But in Asakura v. Seattle, supra, it was held that the language of this treaty securing to Japanese citizens the privilege of carrying on trade within the United States was broad enough to comprehend all classes of business which might reasonably be embraced in the word 'trade,' and included the privilege of carrying on the business of a pawnbroker. In Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 396\n, 47 S. Ct. 630, in considering the treaty with Great Britain of July 3, 1815, 8 Stat. 228, and August 6, 1827, 8 Stat. 361, granting reciprocal liberty of commerce between the United States and Great Britain, and in holding that the guarantee that '... the merchants and traders of each nation, respectively, shall enjoy the most complete protection and security for their commerce,' did not extend to a British subject engaged in keeping a poolroom within the United States, we took occasion to point out that the language of the present treaty with Japan was of broader scope than that then before the court.\n Giving to the terms of the treaty, as we are required by accepted principles, a liberal rather than a narrow interpretation, we think, as the state court held, that the terms 'trade' and 'commerce,' when used in conjunction with each other and with the grant of authority to lease land for 'commercial purposes' are to be given a \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n broader significance than that pressed upon us, and are sufficient to include the operation of a hospital as a business undertaking; that this is a commercial purpose for which the treaty authorizes Japanese subjects to lease lands.\n It is said that the elimination from the original draft of this clause of the treaty of words authorizing the leasing of land for 'industrial, manufacturing and other lawful' purposes (see Terrace v. Thompson, supra, page 223 of 263 U. S.) leads to the conclusion that land might not be leased for hospital purposes by Japanese subjects, even though under the other provisions of the treaty they might be permitted to operate such an institution. But as the leasing of land for a hospital is obviously not for an industrial or manufacturing purpose, this argument presupposes that the phrase 'commercial purposes' is limited to merchandising businesses, which for reasons already stated we deem inadmissible. Moreover, a construction which concedes the authority of Japanese subjects to operate a hospital but would deny to them an appropriate means of controlling so much of the earth's surface as is indispensable to its operation, does not comport with a reasonable, to say nothing of a liberal, construction. The Supreme Court of California has reached a like conclusion in State of California v. Tagami, 195 Cal. 522, 234 P. 102, holding that this treaty secured to a Japanese subject the privilege of leasing land within the state for the purpose of using and occupying it for the maintenance of a health resort and sanitarium.\n The contention that the treaty does not permit the exercise of the privileges secured by it through a corporate agency requires no extended consideration. The employment of such an agency is incidental to the exercise of the granted privilege. But it is not an incident which enlarges the privilege by annexing to the permitted business another class of business otherwise excluded from the \n\n[278 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n grant, as would have been the case in Terrace v. Thompson, supra, had the business of farming been deemed an incident to the business of trading in farm products.\n The principle of liberal construction of treaties would be nullified if a grant of enumerated privileges were held not to include the use of the usual methods and instrumentalities of their exercise. Especially would this be the case where the granted privileges relate to trade and commerce and the use of land for commercial purposes. It would be difficult to select any single agency of more universal use or more generally recognized as a usual and appropriate means of carrying on commerce and trade than the business corporation. And it would, we think, be a narrow interpretation indeed, which, in the absence of restrictive language, would lead to the conclusion that the treaty had secured to citizens of Japan the privilege of engaging in a particular business, but had denied to them the privilege of conducting that business in corporate form. But here any possibility of doubt would seem to be removed by the clause which confers on citizens and subjects of the high contracting parties the right '... to do anything generally incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects, submitting themselves to the laws and regulations there established.'\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan. ...

Mahaffey, both of Texarkana, Tex., and S. W. Moore, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. S. P. Jones, of Marshall, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action under the Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51- 58; Comp. St.  8657 et seq.) for the death of one R. D. Ferguson who was a car inspector on the petitioner's road. No one saw the death but the body was found between the main track and a parallel track, and the probability is that Ferguson was killed by a train going north on the former. A freight train was being made up on the parallel track, and the hypothesis of the respondent, supported by little if anything except the place where the body and the lantern of the deceased were found, is that Ferguson was engaged in inspecting the cars, and so absorbed in his work that he did not hear the approaching train but was relying upon the ringing of the engine bell, which usually was rung but which the respondent's witnesses say was not rung on this occasion. The court below sustained the verdict on this ground. Ferguson was seen not later than a quarter before seven in the evening, so far as time can be fixed. The train passed at five minutes after seven, the time at which it was known by him to be due. His body was found at twenty-five minutes after seven. He was an experienced man. The indications are that there was nothing for him to inspect at the probable time of his death. At best it is a mere guess that he \n\n[276 U.S. 303, 305]\n\u00a0\n was so engaged, still more that he was absorbed in such work. The main track was straight and the train was making a great noise and showing a bright light as it approached. Nothing except imagination and sympathy warranted a finding that the death was due to the negligence of the petitioner rather than to that of the man himself. It is unnecessary to consider whether if the case for the plaintiff were stronger the principle of Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Nixon, \n271 \nU.S. 218\n, 463 S.

KIEFFER(1928)\nNo. 64\nArgued: October 25, 1928Decided: June 4, 1928\n\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n This case presents a controversy over the relative rights conferred by an oil and gas lease and by a homestead patent for the same lands-both issued by the United States and each containing a reservation of the rights conferred by the other.\n The lands in question are two adjoining 40-acre tracts within the Salt Creek oil field, in Natrona county, Wyoming, which became a producing field, widely known as such, before any step was taken to secure either the lease or the patent.\n By executive order issued July 2, 1910, under the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (43 USCA  141) these lands-being then public lands of the United States-were withdrawn from settlement, location, sale, or entry under the existing public land laws and were reserved as being valuable for oil to await further legislation respecting the disposal of lands of that character. The contemplated legislation came in part in the Act of July 17, 1914, c. 142, 38 Stat. 509 (30 USCA  122), and in part in the Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437 (30 USCA  181).\n The act of 1914 looks to the severance and separate disposal of the surface and the underlying minerals. It provides that lands of the United States withdrawn, classified, or reported as valuable for oil, gas, or other designated mineral deposits shall be subject to disposal under the nonmineral land laws, but that the disposal shall be with 'a reservation to the United States of the deposits on account of which the lands were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable, together with the right to prospect \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n for, mine, and remove the same,' and that such deposits shall be 'subject to disposal by the United States only as shall be hereafter expressly directed by law.' The act further provides:\n'Any person qualified to acquire the reserved deposits may enter upon said lands with a view of prospecting for the same upon the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a bond or undertaking to be filed with him as security for the payment of all damages to the crops and improvements on such lands by reason of such prospecting, the measure of any such damage to be fixed by agreement of parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any person who has acquired from the United Stated the title to or the right to mine and remove the reserved deposits, should the United States dispose of the mineral deposits in lands, may re-enter and occupy so much of the surface thereof as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining and removal of the minerals therefrom, and mine and remove such minerals, upon payment of damages caused thereby to the owner of the land, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking therefor in an action instituted in any competent court to ascertain and fix said damages.'\n\n The act of 1920 relates particularly to the disposal of oil, gas and other designated mineral deposits in the lands of the United States, including those specified in the act of 1914. In the main it provides that the disposal of such deposits shall be through leases entitling the lessees to extract and remove the deposits and to make such use of the surface as may be necessary for that purpose, and requiring the lessees to pay fixed royalties, and in some instances a further compensation, to the United States. The parts of the act having a present bearing are as follows:\n'Sec. 17. That all unappropriated deposits of oil or gas situated within the known geologic structure of a pro- \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n ducing oil or gas field, ... not subject to preferential lease, may be leased by the Secretary of the Interior to the highest responsible bidder by competitive bidding, ... such leases to be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of such bonus as may be accepted and of such royalty as may be fixed in the lease. ... Leases shall be for a period of twenty years, with the preferential right in the lessee to renew the same for successive periods of ten years upon such reasonable terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, unless otherwise provided by law at the time of the expiration of such periods. ...' 30 USCA  226.\n\n'Sec. 29. ... Provided, that said Secretary, in his discretion, in making any lease under this act, may reserve to the United States the right to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the surface of the lands embraced within such lease under existing law or laws hereafter enacted, in so far as said surface is not necessary for use of the lessee in extracting and removing the deposits therein: Provided further, that if such reservation is made it shall be so determined before the offering of such lease. ...' 30 USCA  186.\n\n'Sec. 32. That the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to prescribe necessary and proper rules and regulations and to do any and all things necessary to carry out and accomplish the purposes of this act, also to fix and determine the boundary lines of any structure, or oil or gas field, for the purposes of this act. ...' 30 USCA  189.\n\n'Sec. 34. That the provisions of this act shall also apply to all deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, oil, oil shale, or gas in the lands of the United States, which lands may have been or may be disposed of under laws reserving to the United States such deposits, with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same, subject to such conditions as are or may hereafter be provided by such laws reserving such deposits.' 30 USCA  182. \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n April 2, 1920, the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to section 32 of the act of 1920, determined the boundary lines of the known oil structure or deposit in the Salt Creek field. The lines so determined included the two 40 acre tracts in question.\n\n December 29, 1921, as a result of competitive bidding invited under section 17 of that Act, and in consideration of a bonus of $51,750 paid to the United States, the Secretary of the Interior, conformably to existing regulations, 1 awarded and issued to Oscar W. Rohn a lease of the oil and gas in these tracts and in another 40-acre tract in the same field. The lease was given for a term of 20 years, with a conditional privilege of renewal under section 17, and granted to the lessee the exclusive right to drill for, extract and remove the oil and gas deposits in the three tracts, together with the right to construct and maintain on the surface 'all works, buildings, plants, waterways, roads, telegraph or telephone lines, pipe lines, reservoirs, tanks, pumping stations or other structures' needed in such mining operations. It required the lessee to exercise reasonable diligence in drilling and operating wells for oil and gas and to pay to the United States a royalty of 25 per cent. on the oil produced and a royalty varying from 12 1\/2 per cent. to 16 2\/3 per cent. on the gas; and it reserved to the United States the right to dispose of 'the surface of the lands' under existing or future laws 'in so far as said surface is not necessary for the use of the lessee in the extraction and removal of the oil and gas.' It also required the lessee-\n'to comply with all statutory requirements and regulations thereunder, if the lands embraced herein have been or shall hereafter be disposed of under the laws reserving to the United States the deposits of oil and gas therein, subject to such conditions as are or may hereafter be provided by the laws reserving such oil or gas.' \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n At the time the lease was issued the lessee, pursuant to the existing regulations,2 executed, with approved surety, a bond to the United States in the amount of $5,000-'for the use and benefit of the United States and of any entryman or patentee of any portion of the land ... heretofore entered or patented with a reservation of the oil and gas deposits to the United States'-conditioned on the lessee's faithful compliance with 'all the provisions' of the lease.\n\n August 9, 1922, that lease was consolidated with others into a new lease of like character and tenor issued by the Secretary of the Interior to the Kinney-Coastal Oil Company, and a bond like that above described was gived by the company, with approved surety, to secure its faithful compliance with all the provisions of the consolidated lease.\n In 1918 Michael F. Kieffer made application at the local land office to make a preliminary homestead entry of the two 40-acre tracts in question and other contiguous lands. He knew the lands were within the executive withdrawal of July 2, 1910, and the Salt Creek oil field, and he assented that, if his application was granted, the oil and gas deposits should be reserved by the United States for disposal under future laws as contemplated in the act of 1914. The preliminary homestead entry was allowed with that reservation (see Regulations of March 20, 1915, paragraphs 5-8, 44 L. D. 32, 34) and in due course was carried to a final entry, on which a homestead patent was issued to Kieffer October 12, 1923. The patent was for 320 acres, including the two 40-acre tracts in question, and contained the following exception and reservation:\n'Also excepting and reserving to the United States all the oil and gas in the lands so patented, and to it, or persons authorized by it, the right to prospect for, mine \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n and remove such deposits from the same upon compliance with the conditions and subject to the provisions and limitations of the Act of July 17, 1914.'\n\n After his preliminary homestead entry was allowed, Kieffer constructed a residence and several outbuildings on part of the lands included therein other than the tracts in question, and resided there with his family. He inclosed the tracts in question with a barbed wire fence and in each of two years planted and harvested about 7 acres of oats thereon; but in no other way did he improve or cultivate these tracts.\n The Kinney-Coastal Oil Company, soon after receiving its lease, entered on one of the tracts in question, stored thereon equipment and supplies required in operations under the lease, erected buildings needed for its employees, and began drilling for oil and gas. Kieffer knew of the lease and acquiesced in these operations under it. One well was completed in the latter part of 923 at a cost of $32,152.66, and oil and gas were produced therefrom in paying quantities. The company proceeded with the extraction of oil and gas from that well, and also made preparation for drilling others. Stakes were driven marking places for eight more, distributed over the tract in accordance with applicable regulations.\n In January 1924, Kieffer, without any concurrence by the United States or by the company, platted that tract as a townsite-with blocks, lots, streets, and alleys-and caused the plat to be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the county. Although knowing of the producing well and that the company was intending to proceed with further drilling and operations under the lease, Kieffer began selling and contracting to sell lots in the townsite and encouraging purchasers to build thereon. Several lots were sold or contracted to be sold, and the purchasers began hastily to place buildings thereon for residential and business purposes. \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 496]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon the lessee company and another company which had acquired an interest in the lease-one a corporate citizen of Maine and the other of Colorado-brought a suit in the federal District Court for Wyoming against Kieffer and others-all citizens of that state-to prevent the sale and use for townsite purposes of the tract on which operations under the lease were proceeding, to prevent a contemplated platting and disposal of the other tract as a townsite, and to enforce the plaintiffs' right to use all the surface of both tracts in the operations under the lease-the use of all being alleged to be necessary. There was also a prayer for general relief. The prayers for specific relief were limited to the term of the lease.\n The defendants answered jointly. The material portions of the answer were to the effect (a) that the court was without jurisdiction, in that the value of the matter in controversy was less than the jurisdictional requisite; (b) that the bill was without equity, in that there was an adequate, if not exclusive, remedy at law; (c) that a large portion of the lands in question was without oil or gas content; (d) that the platting, sale, and use of the lands for townsite purposes would not interfere with the full enjoyment of the plaintiffs' rights or operations under the lease; and (e) that the defendants-\n'have at all times been ready and willing that plaintiffs have the full, beneficial use of their lease upon their complying with the law, and defendants are now ready and willing to enter into negotiations with plaintiffs with the view of fixing the amount of damages which may be done by plaintiffs to defendants' improvements, or submit said question to a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in the Act of July 17, 1914.'\n\n The District Court, after a full hearing on the issues, gave a decree awarding the plaintiffs, by way of injunction, most of the relief sought in their bill. 1 F.(2d) \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 497]\n\u00a0\n 795. The court found, as recited in the decree, that the value of the matter in controversy was in excess of the jurisdictional requisite; that the lands in question 'are practically all within the producing structure of the Salt Creek oil field'; that use of 'practically the entire surface' is necessary 'for the full development' of the underlying oil and gas deposits and for 'reasonably economical, efficient operations' under the lease; that the buildings constructed and intended to be constructed as part of the townsite venture will 'take up space required by plaintiffs in their lawful operations'; that the occupancy and use of the lands as a townsite will interfere with such operations, will increase the expense of conducting them, and will enhance the danger of explosion and fire which otherwise attends the production of oil and gas, and that the plaintiffs will thus be subjected to continuing and irreparable injury and damage.\n On an appeal by the defendants the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'There is substantial evidence in support of the court's finding that the tract is within the producing structure of the oil field, and that the entire surface will be necessary for the use of plaintiffs in its development and in the production and removal of the oil and gas that will be found. There was testimony to the contrary, but the court's findings of fact have ample support. It had better opportunity to weigh the evidence than we have, and we accept those findings.'\n\n Then, coming to the equitable remedy invoked by the plaintiffs, that court held that the act of 1914 prescribes a mode of procedure for enforcing the lessee's right to use the surface; that this procedure is intended to be exclusive and in the nature of a condemnation proceeding, which is regarded as a proceeding at law rather than in equity; and that by the course taken in the District Court Kieffer \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 498]\n\u00a0\n and his grantees were denied a constitutional right to have the issues tried by a jury. Accordingly the decree was reversed, with a direction to dismiss the bill and leave the plaintiffs to their statutory remedy. Kieffer v. Kinney-Coastal Oil Co. (C. C. A.) 9 F.(2d) 260.\n Messrs. Edward M. Freeman and Paul P. Prosser, both of Denver, Colo., for petitioners.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 488, 500]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. D. Murance, of Casper, Wyo., for respondents.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 488, 503]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after making the foregoing statement of the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The findings of fact by the District Court before described have such support in the evidence that they should \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 504]\n\u00a0\n be accepted by us. Two were accepted by the Circuit Court of Appeals, as shown in the quotation before made from its opinion, and the others were not considered. Those not considered are equally well supported.\n The chief question presented is whether the act of 1914 prescribes an exclusive remedy at law applicable to the situation disclosed and thus prevents the plaintiffs from suing in equity, as held by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The acts of 1914 and 1920 are to be read together-each as the complement of the other. So read they disclose an intention to divide oil and gas lands into two estates for the purposes of disposal-one including the underlying oil and gas deposits and the other the surface-and to make the latter servient to the former, which naturally would be suggested by their physical relation and relative values. The act of 1914, in providing for the disposal of the surface, directs that there be a reservation of the oil and gas deposits, 'together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same,' meaning, of course, the right to use so much of the surface as may be necessary for such operations. And the act of 1920, in providing for the leasing of the oil and gas deposits, provides (section 29) for a reservation of the surface 'in so far as said surface is not necessary for the use of the lessee in extracting and removing the deposits.' In effect therefore a servitude is laid on the surface estate for the benefit of the mineral estate to the end, as the acts otherwise show, that the United States may realize, through the separate leasing, a proper return from the extraction and removal of the minerals.\n The lease held by the plaintiffs and the homestead patent issued to Kieffer were drafted in keeping with the acts thus understood. In both the required reservations are plainly expressed. Under the lease the plaintiffs have the right to extract and remove the oil and gas as also the appurtenant right to use the surface so far as may \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 505]\n\u00a0\n be necessary. In the homestead patent these rights are distinctly excepted and reserved from the estate thereby granted. Their exercise involves no taking of anything granted by the patent. Nor is the one who under the patent owns the surface, with those rights reserved, entitled to compensation for the minerals taken or the use made of the surface. The only compensation which he rightfully may demand is, as the act of 1914 says, for 'damages caused' by the mining operations. The sentence next preceding that in which these words occur makes it fairly plain that they refer to damages to 'crops and improvements,' and the title to the act, coupled with the reference to 'crops' shows that 'agricultural' improvements are the kind intended. Certainly it is not intended to include improvements placed on the land, after the mining operations are under way, for purposes plainly incompatible with the right to proceed with those operations until the oil and gas are exhausted. It well may be that, if the operations are negligently conducted and damage is done thereby to the surface estate, there will be liability therefor. But such liability will ensue, not from admissible mining operations and use of the surface, but from the inadmissible negligence causing the damage.\n By this suit the plaintiffs are not seeking to acquire a right to use the surface, but to protect from wrongful obstruction and impairment the right which they already have. Nor are they seeking to enforce their right to enter and begin mining operations. More than a year before the suit was begun they entered, took in mining equipment and supplies, erected houses for their workmen, began drilling for oil and gas, and at large cost completed a producing well-all with the knowledge and acquiescence of Kieffer, then the sole surface claimant. After their operations were thus under way, Kieffer platted as a townsite the 40 acres where they were operating, and began \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 506]\n\u00a0\n actively to sell and contract to sell the lots as platted, and the purchasers began to erect buildings thereon for residential and business purposes. Kieffer was also contemplating taking like action as to the other 40 acres. It was then that the suit was begun. It is directed chiefly against the sale and use of the surface for townsite purposes, and is based on the theory-sustained by the findings made on the proofs submitted at the trial-that practically the whole 80 acres is within the producing structure of the oil field, that use of practically the entire surface is necessary for conducting reasonably efficient operations under the lease, and that the sale and occupancy of the surface for townsite purposes will seriously interfere with the plaintiffs' right to use the same in their mining operations and will obstruct and impede the further prosecution of those operations and thereby subject the plaintiffs to continuing and irreparable injury.\n With this understanding of the situation and of the chief object of the suit, we think it plain that the plaintiffs were entitled to the interposition and aid of a court of equity to prevent the threatened occupancy and use of the surface for purposes incompatible with their right to continue the mining operations under the lease and to make any necessary use of the surface. Certainly they were without the plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law which, under section 267 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  384), precludes resort to a suit in equity.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals based its decision on the part of the act of 1914 which-after directing that the patent for the surface estate shall contain a reservation of the underlying oil and gas deposits, with the right to prospect for, mine and remove the same-provides that lessees of the United States may enter, occupy so much of the surface as may be required, and mine and remove the minerals, 'upon payment of damages caused thereby to the owner of the land, or upon giving a good and suffi- \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 507]\n\u00a0\n cient bond or undertaking therefor in an action instituted in any competent court to ascertain and fix said damages.'\n The plaintiffs take the position that the bond given by the lessee and approved by the Secretary of the Interior when the lease was issued satisfied that provision. In this the plain words of the provision are neglected. They call for a bond to be given in a judicial proceeding wherein the damages may be ascertained and fixed. The Circuit Court of Appeals so regarded them.\n But we are unable to agree with that court's ruling that the provision requires that the bond be given and the damages assessed only in an action at law. The words of the provision are 'an action instituted in any competent court,' and we think the matter is one which the District Court was and is competent to deal with in this suit.\n It is a general rule that a court of equity, in a suit of which it has and takes cognizance, may administer complete relief between the parties, even though this involves the determination of legal rights which otherwise would not be within the range of its authority. Camp v. Boyd, \n229 \nU.S. 530, 552\n, 33 S. Ct. 785 (57 L. Ed. 1317); McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 296\n, 35 S. Ct. 543 (59 L. Ed. 955); United States v. Union Pacific Ry. Co., \n160 U.S. 1\n, 50, et seq., 16 S. Ct. 190 (40 L. Ed. 319). And under that rule a court of equity in awarding relief to one party may impose conditions protecting and giving effect to correlative rights of the other. Walden v. Bodley, 14 Pet. 156, 164 (10 L. Ed. 398); Lynch v. Burt (C. C. A.) 132, F. 417, 432; Burnes v. Burnes (C. C. A.) 137 F. 781, 791.\n So, while the provision on which the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals rests cannot be held to be an obstacle to the maintenance of this suit in a court of equity, we think it shows a need for modifying the decree of the District Court by providing therein for an ascertainment in this suit of any damages which the plaintiffs' entry and operations under the lease may have caused to the agricultural improvements or crops of the owner of the surface estate, and also by conditioning the relief awarded \n\n[277 U.S. 488, 508]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiffs upon their giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking to pay such damages within a limited time after the same are ascertained.\n The evidence appears not to have been taken with a view to an ascertainment of the damages; but there is testimony tending to show that the owner of the surface is asserting a claim for damages done at the time the plaintiffs entered or soon thereafter. It of course is admissible to fix the damages by agreement. But if this be not done there will be need for a hearing on that question.\n We conclude that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, and that the cause should be remanded to the District Court, with directions to modify its decree in accordance with what is said in this opinion.\n Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Decree of District Court modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Regulations of March 11, 1920,  13-17, 47 L.

UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 162\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 145, 146]\n\u00a0\n Mr. L. L. Hamby, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 145, 147]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Messrs. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., and Sewall Key, both of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner sued in the Court of Claims to recover $1,126.15, the amount by which his income tax for the year 1918 was increased by reason of the refusal of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to allow a deduction from petitioner's gross income of the sum of $10,000 claimed as a business expense for that year. The petition alleges that the latter sum was paid by petitioner for attorney's fees incurred in the defense of a suit against him for an accounting instituted by his former copartner, said suit growing directly out of the conduct of the partnership business, it being alleged by the copartner that petitioner had collected fees or compensation for professional services performed during the existence of the partnership to a division of which the copartner was entitled; that the alleged fees in fact consisted of stock in a corporation acquired subsequently to the dissolution of the partnership and not for services performed during its existence; that the defense to the suit was successful and the amount paid was a necessary expense incurred in connection with petitioner's business within the meaning of section 214(a), subd. 1, of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 g), or a loss within the meaning of subdivision 4 of the same section; that a claim for refund of the excessive tax was duly made to the Commissioner and by him rejected. To this peti- \n\n[276 U.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n tion a demurrer was interposed and by the court below sustained, and the petition dismissed, on the ground that the expenditure was not an allowable deduction under either provision of the statute, but was a personal expense under section 215(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Comp. St .  6336 1\/8 gg). 62 Ct. Cl. 647.\n We think it is obvious that the expenditure is not a loss; and the only provisions of the Revenue Act (40 Stat. 1057, 1066, 1069, c. 18), which need be considered, are section 214(a), subd. 1, which reads:\n'Sec. 214. (a) That in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n'(1) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, ...'\n\n -and section 215(a) which provides:\n'Sec. 215. That in computing net income no deduction shall in any case be allowed in respect of-\n\n'(a) Personal, living, or family expenses.'\n\n On the case made by the petition the expenditure in question was either a personal expense or a business expense; it was not a living or family expense. And it was an 'ordinary and necessary' expense, since a suit ordinarily and, as a general thing at least, necessarily requires the employment of counsel and payment of his charges. The petition is not as definite as it might have been, but from its allegations, interpreted as the Solicitor General concedes they may be, it appears that the accounting suit presented the question whether the compensation in respect of which the copartner sought an accounting was for professional services performed by petitioner during the existence of the partnership or after its termination, the defense to that suit being based upon the latter alternative. In either view, the compensation constituted business earnings. \n\n[276 U.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n The Solicitor of Internal Revenue in a recent opinion has held that legal expenses incurred by a doctor of medicine in defending a suit for malpractice were business expenses within the meaning of the statute. In the course of the opinion it was said that such expenditures were as much ordinary and necessary business expenses as they would be if made by a merchant in defending an action for personal injuries caused by one of his delivery automobiles, and that in the latter case the deduction would be allowed without question. C. B. V. 1, p. 226.\n Another departmental ruling is to the effect that legal expenses incurred in defending an action for damages by a tenant injured while at work on the taxpayer's farm are deductible as a business expense. C. B. 5, p. 121.\n In the Appeal of F. Meyer & Brother Co., 4 B. T. A. 481, the Board of Tax Appeals held that a legal expenditure made in defending a suit for an accounting and damages resulting from an alleged patent infringement was deductible as a business expense.\n The basis of these holdings seems to be that where a suit or action against a taxpayer is directly connected with, or, as otherwise stated ( Appeal of Backer, 1 B. T. A. 214, 216), proximately resulted from, his business, the expense incurred is a business expense within the meaning of section 214(a), subd. 1, of the act. These rulings seem to us to be sound and the principle upon which they rest covers the present case. If the expense had been incurred in an action to recover a fee from a client who refused to pay it, the character of the expenditure as a business expense would not be doubted. In the application of the act we are unable to perceive any real distinction between an expenditure for attorney's fees made to secure payment of the earnings of the business and a like expenditure to retain such earnings after their receipt. One is as directly connected with the business as the other.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKRAUSS BROS. LUMBER CO. v. MELLON(1928)\nNo. 342\nArgued: March 7, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. Brenton K. Fisk, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Alex M. Bull, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered and opinion of the Court.\n Krauss Bros. Lumber Company is a corporation engaged in the wholesale lumber business, to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission, on the complaint of the company, ordered the respondent railroad companies, the Mobile & Ohio Railroad and the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, to pay reparation in the amount of $10,356 because of unlawful demurrage charges illegally collected. The sole issue was whether any such power had been vested in the Commission as would give it juris- \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n diction to decide that the charges should be refunded. Upon the Commission's decision that it had such power, the parties, following its suggestion, filed formal stipulations under Rule V of the Commission's practice admitting the amounts of the charges, the illegality of which had been declared by the Commission, and thereupon the reparation order was made.\n The view of the defendants was that the Commission had no power to order a return of these demurrage charges, since by the common law, quite outside the functions and powers of the Commission, a carrier could reject a tender of goods for initial transportation while there were existing embargoes, and in the same way could reject a demand for reconsignment to points embargoed at the time of initial acceptance for shipment, and so demurrage had accrued until the consignees accepted actual delivery of the goods. Payment not having been made on or before December 28, 1922, as directed by the Commission the present suit was filed by the petitioner as plaintiff against the respondents as defendants on March 20, 1923, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint conformed to the provisions of section 16, of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  16; Comp. St.  8584), and contained the findings and order of the Commission as a part thereof.\n The case came on for trial, demurrers to the complaint were overruled, additional counts were inserted by amendment and a demurrer to them was also overruled. Thereupon the shipper, as plaintiff, duly introduced into the evidence the Commission's original finding and other Commission proceedings and closed its case. The respondents, over the shipper's objection that the same were incompetent, were permitted to put in evidence the original pleadings before the Commission, and the testimony and other exhibits taken and filed in the Commis- \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n sion's proceedings. Thereupon the respondents closed their case, and the shipper duly moved for a directed verdict, which motion was overruled by the District Court and an exception noted. The respondents thereupon moved for a directed verdict, which motion was granted, and the shipper duly excepted.\n A writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was then duly taken. The exhibits filed by the respondents were exceedingly voluminous, there being, among other things, a complete file of embargo circulars included as a part of the evidence which had been placed before the Commission in the hearings before it. The defeated party was anxious to avoid the printing of exhibits which it did not deem of use to the reviewing court in passing on what it considered the only issue in the case and attempted to secure this through stipulation of counsel and by an order of court. When the case reached the Circuit Court of Appeals, it declined to pass upon the merits of the case, for the following reason:\n'From the above it is plain that all of the evidence upon which the case was tried is not in the bill of exceptions. The order of court sending up the documents in the original does not purport to make them a part of the bill of exceptions, the rule of this court could not incorporate them therein, and the agreement of counsel expressly excludes them.\n\n'As applicable to the deficiency of the record here shown, the well- settled rule is this. Depositions, exhibits, or certificates not contained in the bill of exceptions cannot be considered even though found in the printed transcript. The parties by their affidavits or agreements cannot cause that to become a bill of exceptions which is not such in a legal sense Where instructions of the court are assigned as error on a motion to direct a verdict or otherwise, unless the entire evidence pertinent to the \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n question is in the bill, the appellate court must presume that the omitted evidence justified the instruction.'\n\n Except as modified by statute, the rules as to bills of exceptions in the federal courts are the same as they were at common law. By section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (chapter 20, 1 Stat. 73, 83 (28 USCA  391)), all the courts of the United State were given power to grant new trials in cases where there had been a trial by jury, for reasons for which new trials had usually been granted in the courts of law. This was held to adopt the common-law rule on the subject. Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433. Prior to the statute of Westminster, II (13th Edw. I, c. 31), a writ of error at common law could be had only for an error apparent on the face of the record or for an error in fact, such as the death of a party before judgment, but by that old statute, which is now to be treated as common law, it was provided that exceptions might, by bills of exceptions, be made a part thereof and so be reached by the writ of error. In this way so much of the facts of the case as were necessary to make plain the question of law on which the exception was founded were incorporated in the record, but the trial justice, as a witness to the bill, had to put his seal to the instrument and in the reviewing court might be commanded to appear at a certain date either to confess or deny his seal, and then, if he could not deny his seal, the court of review proceeded to judgment according to the same exception as it ought to be allowed or disallowed. Nalle v. Oyster, \n230 \nU.S. 165, 176\n, 177 S., 33 S. Ct. 1043; Duncan v. Landis (C. C. A.) 106 F. 839, 844; Defiance Fruit Co. v. Fox, 76 N. J. Law, 482, 489, 70 A. 460.\n By the Act of June 1, 1872 (chapter 255, 17 Stat. 196, 197), it was provided that a bill of exceptions allowed in any cause should be deemed sufficiently authenticated if signed by the judge of the court in which the cause was tried or by the presiding judge thereof, if more than one judge sat \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n at the trial of the cause, without any seal of the court annexed thereto, and this became section 953 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA  776; Comp. St.  1590). Since the passage of that act, it is not necessary to seal a bill of exceptions (Herbert v. Butler, \n97 U.S. 319\n, 320; Malony v. Adsit, \n175 \nU.S. 281, 285\n, 20 S. Ct. 115, 44 L. Ed 163), but the signature is still necessary (Origet v. United States, \n125 \nU.S. 240\n, 8 S. Ct. 846. United States ex rel. Kinney v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n222 \nU.S. 283\n, 32 S. Ct. 101)\n Strict requirements are thus insisted on so as to make certain that the reviewing court shall have before it an accurate account of the evidence or exhibits, which were before the trial court in the original hearing of the issues of the case, properly certified.\n The same strictness prevails as to including in the bill the evidence upon which reliance is had to justify the exception, if not included in the original record. In many cases the error complained of rests on a negative showing that there was no evidence adduced at the trial upon which the ruling of the court complained of could be predicated. If a motion is made in the trial court to take the case from a jury, or other fact-finding tribunal, and direct a verdict or give judgment on the ground that, as a matter of law, only one verdict or judgment can be reached, it must appear that in the bill of exceptions is contained all the evidence actually adduced before the trial court. It has always been ruled in such a case that, if the bill of exceptions does not contain all the evidence, it will be presumed that the evidence omitted was sufficient to justify a refusal to grant the motion. Russell v. Ely, 2 Black, 575, 580; City of Providence v. Babcock, 3 Wall. 240, 244; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Cummings, \n106 \nU.S. 700, 701\n, 1 S. Ct. 493; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v.

By \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n this it is not meant that the evidence shall be set forth at length in the words of the witnesses, and of the writings and documents admitted, but only that the purport and substance of all of it be included. In setting it forth, regard should be had to the requirements of paragraph 2 of Rule 7 of the Rules prescribed by this court. \n266 U.S. 653\n. Lincoln v. Claflin, 7 Wall. 132, 136; Zellers' Lessee v. Eckert, 4 How. 289, 297, 298.\n The question here arises because of the alleged omission of certain exhibits from the bill of exceptions, which the petitioner contended were not relevant to the issue between them. Because of this, the Circuit Court of Appeals, of its own motion, and not by request or consent of either party, applied the rule above stated. We do not think, however, that the bill of exceptions can be said to have omitted these exhibits or to have prevented the Circuit Court of Appeals from considering them with all the evidence. The bill of exceptions recites that in the trial both parties appeared by counsel, the jury was impaneled, and that there were introduced in evidence by the plaintiff Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all as described; that they were admitted subject to objection and exception as irrelevant, and the objection was overruled, and that the defendants offered Exhibits No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, No. 10, No. 11, and No. 12, all as described, and as containing all the testimony and also exhibits offered at the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that the plaintiff objected to the introduction of all those exhibits from No. 7 to No. 12, and that this objection was overruled and an exception noted. The bill of exceptions then concluded as follows:\n'The plaintiff's exhibits referred to as Exhibit No. 1, Exhibit No. 2, Exhibit No. 3, Exhibit No. 4, Exhibit No. 5, and the Defendants' Exhibit No. 12 are hereinafter set forth fully as a part of this bill of exceptions. By virtue of an order of the presiding judge, W. I. Grubb, Plaintiff's \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n Exhibit No. 6 and the Defendants' Exhibits Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively, are omitted from this bill of exceptions in order that they may be sent by the clerk of the lower court, in compliance with the said order of the presiding judge, direct to the Court of Appeals.\n\n'This was all the evidence in the case.\n\n'(Signed) W. I. Grubb.'\n\n This was followed by the stipulation signed by the attorneys for both plaintiff and defendants, and the order of the court; the latter being that referred to in the bill of exceptions, as follows:\n'It appearing to the court that in this cause it is necessary and proper in the opinion of the court that certain original papers and documents should be inspected in the Circuit Court of Appeals upon writ of error by said court:\n\n'It is therefore ordered that the following papers, to wit, Exhibits 6 to 11, inclusive, referred to and described in the bills of exceptions, be transmitted by the clerk of this court to the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals at New Orleans, La., and returned after the disposition of the writ of error to the clerk of this court.\n\n'The parties to this cause by their respective counsel do hereby stipulate and agree as follows:\n\n'That the Plaintiff Exhibit No. 6 and that the Defendants' Exhibits 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, may be omitted from the bill of exceptions, and sent by the clerk of the trial court direct to the Court of Appeals in their original form, and further that the exhibits need not be printed in the record. This agreement is made in conformity with an order of the trial court by the presiding judge that said exhibits, viz. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, shall be omitted from the record, and sent directed by the clerk of the trial court to the Court of Appeals.'\n\n While the rule as we have shown by its history in respect to the inclusion of all the evidence in the bill of \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n exceptions must be respected, we must give the recitals of the bill a reasonable construction. Kleinschmidt v. McAndrews, \n117 \nU.S. 282, 286\n, 6 S. Ct. 761; Waldron v. Waldron, \n156 \nU.S. 361\n, 15 S. Ct. 383. While it may be said that the form in which this bill of exceptions is sent up is in its parts slightly inconsistent in itself and apparently self-contradictory, it is clear that the bill as signed by the trial court, and read in the light of the order which is referred to and identified in the bill, brought and was intended to bring to the appellate court all of the evidence heard in the court below, and all the exhibits, even those said in it to be omitted therefrom which were ex industrial sent by order of the court to the court above for that court's examination. We think the references in the bill to the exhibits separately sent by order of the trial court to the Circuit Court of Appeals are sufficiently identified as part of the bill. They were omitted from the bill in the sense only that they were to be sent separately from the rest of the bill to the reviewing court, perhaps with a view, rightly or wrongly, to avoiding the necessity of printing them. But the certificate of the judge certainly included them in the bill when, after expressly referring to them, he said, 'This was all the evidence in the case.' To be sure, it is well settled that exhibits found in the record or even annexed to a bill of exceptions when not attached to it by way of identifying them as intended to be part of it, cannot be treated as such. National Bank v. Kennedy, 17 Wall. 19, 29; Reed v. Gardner, 17 Wall. 409, 411; Jones v. Buckell, \n104 U.S. 554\n; Hanna v. Maas, \n122 \nU.S. 24\n, 7 S. Ct. 1055\n\n\n But in Leftwitch v. Lecanu, 4 Wall. 187, on page 189, Mr. Justice Miller, while exemplifying this principle, said, in rejecting a bill of exceptions:\n'If a paper which is to constitute a part of a bill of exceptions, is not incorporated into the body of the bill, \n\n[276 U.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n it must be annexed to it, or so marked by letter, number, or other means of identification mentioned in the bill, as to leave no doubt, when found in the record, that it is the one referred to in the bill of exceptions.\n\n And again, in Jones v. Buckell, supra, at 556, Chief Justice Waite, in making a similar ruling, said:\n'Of course, evidence may be included in a bill of exceptions by appropriate reference to other parts of the record, and, if that had been done here, it might have been enough.'\n\n As we have said, we think the identifying references, in the bill, to the exhibits are sufficient.\n The result is that the Circuit Court of Appeals should have considered the issues before it on the bill of exceptions as containing all the evidence below, and that the dismissal for lack of it was erroneous.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL. P. LARSON, JR., CO. v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.(1928)\nNo. 603\nArgued: April 26, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles H. Aldrich and George I. Haight, both of Chicago, Ill ., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Isaac H. Mayer and Wallace R. Lane, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n There has been long litigation between the parties in this suit, the last stage of which appears in 20 F.(2d) 830. The Wrigley Company was ordered to account for net profits on sales of its 'Doublemint' gum in a package dress that infringed the Larson Company's 'Wintermint' gum package. During the accounting questions arose that were decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals. To review one of these questions a writ of certiorari was granted by this court. \n275 \nU.S. 521\n, 48 S. Ct. 157, 72 L. Ed. -. That question is whether, as held below with modifications that need not be mentioned, the Wrigley Company should be allowed to deduct the federal income and excess profits taxes from the profits with which it is to be charged.\n No doubt there are cases in which such a deduction would be proper. But the question cannot be answered by the merely formal reply that if the Larson Company chooses to make the Wrigley Company its agent or trustee ex maleficio and to demand the profits made by the agent it must take the burden with the benefit and can have no more than the agent made in fact. To call the infringer an agent or trustee is not to state a fact but merely to indicate a mode of approach and an imperfect analogy by which the wrongdoer will be made to hand over the pro- \n\n[277 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n ceeds of his wrong. Circumstances will affect the conclusion, including in them the knowledge and the conduct of the party charged. It would be unjust to charge an infringer with the gross amount of his sales without allowing him for the materials and labor that were necessary to produce the things sold, but it does not follow that he should be allowed what he paid for the chance to do what he knew that he had no right to do. That is the position of the Wrigley Company as we understand the findings in the successive stages of this suit. (C. C. A.) 253 F. 914, 916; (C. C. A.) 275 F. 535, 537, 538; (D. C.) 5 F.(2d) 731, 739; (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 830, 831. Even if the only relief that the Wrigley Company can get is a deduction from gross income when the amount of its liability is finally determined the Larson Company will have to pay a tax on the Wrigley profits when it receives them, and in a case of what has been found to have been one of conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, we think it just that the further deduction should not be allowed.\n Decree as to allowance of federal taxes reversed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAMBORN v. NATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE(1928)\nNo. 163\nArgued: January 12, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis O. Van Doren, of New York City, Edward R. Baird, Jr., of Norfolk, Va., H. G. Connor, Jr., of Wilson, N. C., and Edward S. Bentley, of Lawrence, N. Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Tazewell Taylor, of Norfolk, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the federal court for eastern Virginia by Lamborn & Company, of New York City, against the National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk. The jurisdiction of the District Court rested upon diversity of citizenship. The plaintiffs sought damages for the refusal to honor a sight draft drawn against a letter of credit, given pursuant to a contract of T. S. Southgate & Co. to buy 1,000 bags of Java white sugar at 22 cents per pound less 2 per cent., duty paid, f. o. b. Philadelphia, landed weights. Payment was to be made in New York City upon presentation of sight draft with invoice and railroad order notify bill of lading attached. The letter of credit provided:\n'Shipment to be made during August\/September, 1920, at option of the sellers from Java by Steamer or Steamers to Philadelphia.'\n\n The sugar tendered had been shipped on the West Cheswald, a steamer which sailed from Java on September 30, \n\n[276 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n and by a continuous voyage arrived in Philadelphia on December 16. Then followed promptly the discharge of 1,000 bags of sugar; the ascertainment of the net landed weight; the payment of the duty; the shipment free on board railroad cars at Philadelphia of the specified quantity of sugar to T. S. Southgate & Co.; the drawing against the letter of credit of a sight draft for the purchase price, $48,009.81, its presentation, together with the appropriate shipping documents, for payment; and the refusal to honor. All this was done long before the expiration of the letter of credit. Between April 23, 1920, the date of the contract, and the tender of the sugar, the market price had fallen 11 cents.\n The bank claimed that the sugar tendered failed to satisfy the requirements of the contract, because it had come, not on a steamer which had been continuously destined from Java to Philadelphia, but upon one which, originally destined from Java 'to Port Said, option New York,' was diverted by the charterers to Philadelphia, while on the high seas. The West Cheswald had sailed by a direct route from Java to Philadelphia, the diversion having been made while she was near Bermuda, about three days from port, so that she could pursue the same route to Philadelphia as if she had at all times been destined for that port. In fact, another steamship bearing sugar shipped by plaintiffs-the Washington Maru-which sailed from Java two days earlier, and had at all times been destined to Philadelphia, arrived there three days after the West Cheswald. The case was tried twice before a jury. The only question in serious controversy was one of contruction-the meaning to be given to the clause in the letter of credit quoted above. At the first trial both parties requested a directed verdict. The verdict was directed for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment entered thereon and ordered a new trial. National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk v. Lamborn, 2 F.(2d) 23, 36 A. L. R. 509. At the second trial, the presiding \n\n[276 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n judge, applying the rule declared by the appellate court, directed a verdict for the defendant. The judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 15 F.(2d) 473. This court granted a writ of certiorari (\n273 \nU.S. 688\n, 47 S. Ct. 457), because of conflict with cases decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Matthew Smith Tea, Coffee & Grocery Co. v. Lamborn (and other cases), (D. C.) 276 F. 325, 10 F.(2d) 697, certiorari denied, Kines v. Lamborn, \n271 \nU.S. 683\n, 46 S. Ct. 634; Brenner v. Lamborn, \n271 \nU.S. 685\n, 46 S. Ct. 638; Matthew Smith Tea, Coffee & Grocery Co. v. Lamborn, \n271 \nU.S. 686\n, 46 S. Ct. 638).\n The defendant is obviously not liable, unless there was a tender of sugar which met the requirements of the letter of credit as to amount and quality of the sugar, as to the time (Norrington v. Wright, \n115 \nU.S. 188\n, 6 S. Ct. 12), and the place (Filley v. Pope, \n115 \nU.S. 213\n, 6 S. Ct. 19) of shipment; and as to the manner of shipment and the ultimate destination. \n1\n The clause 'shipment by steamer or steamers to Philadelphia' states the manner of shipment and the ultimate destination. Compliance with its provisions was confessedly a condition of liability. The bank contends that there was not a compliance because the sugar tendered did not come by a steamer which at all times leaving Java was destined to Philadelphia.\n We find nothing either in the words of the letter of credit, in the custom of the trade, or in reason, which justifies implying the condition that, from the inception of the voyage, Philadlphia must have been the destination intended. The transaction is not like the ordinary contract for goods to be shipped. It is not like the common c. i. f. contract for shipment from a foreign to an American port, where delivery to the ship at the port \n\n[276 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n of lading is delivery to the purchaser. Nor is it like those contracts where shipment is to be made by a named vessel. Here, the contract was for a sale f. o. b. cars Philadelphia-and the buyer was not to acquire any interest in the sugar, legal or equitable, until so delivered. Thus the contract resembles that involved in Filley v. Pope, \n115 \nU.S. 213\n, 6 S. Ct. 19, upon which the bank relies. But the question for decision here is an entirely different one. There the contract of sale provided for a 'shipment from Glasgow.' The meaning of the words used was clear; the question was as to their legal effect. Was shipment from Glasgow a condition? This Court held that it was. Here it is admitted that the term 'shipment from Java by steamer or steamers to Philadelphia' is a condition. The only question is whether that phrase means, not merely that the sugar must be shipped by steamer from Java to Philadelphia, but also that the steamer which carried it must, from the inception of the voyage from Java, have been continuously destined to Philadelphia. No such requirement is stated in the contract. While the original letter of credit had required the seller to furnish a copy of the 'Ocean bill of lading covering shipment Java to Philadelphia,' that requirement had been eliminated on the seller's representation that compliance with it would be impracticable under the form of shipment contemplated; and its inclusion in the letter must be deemed to have been inadvertent. As was said in Harrison v. Fortlage, \n161 \nU.S. 57, 63\n, 16 S. Ct. 488, 489 (40 L. Ed. 616):\n'The court is not at liberty, either to disregard words used by the parties, descriptive of the subject matter, or of any material incident, or to insert words which the parties have not made use of.'\n\n The plaintiffs were entitled to a directed verdict. The conclusion which we have reached is in accord, not only with that reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but also with that of the state courts which have had occasion to construe the same provision \n\n[276 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n in other contracts of Lamborn & Company made under like circumstances. \n2\n As the letter of credit is complete in itself, we have no occasion to consider the terms of the contract between Lamborn & Co. and T. S. Southgate & Co., or the circumstances which led to the diversion of the West Cheswald to Philadelphia, which counsel have discussed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I think the judgment below should be affirmed. I cannot agree that a condition in a commercial letter of credit, that drafts are to be drawn against merchandise 'shipment ... from Java by steamer or steamers to Philadelphia' is satisfied by a shipment 'from Java to Port Said, option New York,' even though the cargo ultimately reaches Philadelphia. I had supposed, as the opinion below seems to me to show, that the character of a shipment is fixed at the time it is made, and hence that language in a mercantile contract indicating that a shipment is to be made from one point to another could only mean that the point of destination is to be known and specified at the time of shipment. Hansson v. Hamel & Horley, Ltd., (1922) 2 A. C. 36; Landauer & Co. v. Craven & Speeding Brothers, ( 1912) 2 K. B. 94; Mora y Ledon v. Havemeyer, 121 N. Y. 179, 24 N. E. 297, 8 L. R. A. 245, Iasigi v. Rosenstein, 141 N. Y. 414, 417, 36 N. E. 509.\n But even if this were doubtful as a general proposition, there would seem to be no room for doubt in the present \n\n[276 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n case. Here the letter of credit specified that drafts when presented should be accompanied by 'copy of ocean bill of lading covering shipment Java to Philadelphia.' Obviously such a bill of lading would be impossible unless the shipment were continuously destined for Philadelphia. It is true that, for the convenience of the seller the bank, at the buyer's direction, later waived physical presentation of a copy of the ocean bill of lading. But the record does not show that the bank had any reason to suppose that the requirement had originally been inserted in the letter of credit by mere inadvertence; so far as it was aware, there was still to be an 'ocean bill of lading covering shipment Java to Philadelphia,' but the seller was to be excused from presenting it. The clause 'shipment ... from Java by steamer or steamers to Philadelphia' was not waived, and its meaning on the date of presentation of the draft remained the same as when the credit was issued. The provision in the letter of credit that 'conditions embodied in this credit must be adhered to, otherwise payment will not be effected.' only expresses the rule, with which we all agree, that liability upon a mercantile contract may be established only by strict compliance with its conditions.

Larkin, of Sioux Falls, S. D., pro se.\n Mr. Karl J. Knoepfler, of Sioux City, Iowa, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controversy over the title to land which in 1901 was allotted to Lewis Greyhair, a Winne- \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 433]\n\u00a0\n bago Indian, and for which in 1902 he received a trust patent. The suit was brought in the district court of Thurston county, Neb., where the land lies. The plaintiff claimed under a deed from the allottee's heirs, and the defendants under a deed from his administrator. In the district court the plaintiff prevailed, but in the Supreme Court of the state the decision was for the defendants. The case was brought here on writ of error; but we dismissed that writ and granted a writ of certiorari, because the only federal questions involved relate to the construction and operation of certain congressional statutes, rather than to their validity. Judicial Code,  237, as amended February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936 ( 28 USCA  344).\n The land was allotted to Greyhair under the act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, which provided in section 5 (25 USCA  348) that the trust patent should declare, as in fact it did, that the United States would hold the land for the period of 25 years in trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state, and at the expiration of that period would convey the same by patent to the allottee, or his heirs, in fee, discharged of such trust and free from all charge or incumbrance. The act further provided in the same section that any conveyance of the land, or contract touching the same, made before the termination of the trust period, should be absolutely null and void.\n These provisions were qualified by a later one in the act of May 8, 1906, c. 2348, 34 Stat. 182 (25 USCA  349) authorizing the Secretary of the Interior, 'whenever he shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs,' to terminate the trust period and the incidental restriction against alienation by issuing to such allottee a patent in fee simple; and they were further qualified by a provision in the act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1018 (25 USCA  405), permitting an allottee to sell all or \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 434]\n\u00a0\n any part of his allotment during the existence of the restriction against alienation, if the Secretary of the Interior approved.\n March 12, 1916, Greyhair made written application for the issue to him of a fee-simple patent under the provision in the act of 1906, and as reasons therefor he set forth with some corroborative detail that in point of education, experience and habits he was well able to manage his own affairs; that he was in poor health and in need of money; that the land was worth $3,600 and was the only property owned by him which readily could be sold; and that he was not residing on it but on other property belonging to him. The superintendent of the Winnebago Agency approved the application and forwarded it to the Indian Office in Washington with a statement giving the value of the land as $3,200, confirming what Greyhair said of himself, and adding:\n'Greyhair is a very sick man in need of hospital care and special medical attention that we are not able to give him. He needs money and needs it at once. The quickest way we know to get it is to ask the office to grant a patent in fee on his allotment.'\n\n A month later Greyhair, being without response to his application, sent a telegram to the Indian Office saying:\n'Am sick. Need hospital attention. Am without means until I get patent to allotment. Superintendent informs me that he has asked for quick approval of application that I may get treatment. Please hasten and answer by wire.'\n\n The Assistant Commissioner then wrote to the superintendent stating that the Indian Office had submitted the application to the Secretary of the Interior with favorable recommendation; that when it was returned by the Secretary the Indian Office would give it immediate attention; and that-\n'Meanwhile you may make such arrangements as your acquaintance with all the facts in the case justify looking to sale of the allotment \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n and the assistance of Greyhair to such extend as his necessities may require.'\n\n The superintendent received that letter April 29 and immediately informed Greyhair of its contents. Later in the same day Greyhair and his wife, with the approval of the superintendent, entered into a written contract with one Osborn to sell the land to him for $3,520 and to give a deed promptly after the issue of a fee-simple patent. Of the agreed purchase price $2,120 was paid when the contract was signed and $1,400 was to be paid when the deed was given. The contract recited that it was made in conformity with the instructions given to the superintendent in the letter of the Assistant Commissioner; and the superintendent indorsed his approval on the contract.\n Greyhair died intestate the next day, April 30, leaving as his only heirs his widow and three minor children. A few days later the Secretary of the Interior found from the application and accompanying papers that Greyhair was competent and capable of managing his affairs, and accordingly directed that he be given a fee-simple patent as prayed in the application. The patent was issued May 19, 1916\n\n\n August 3, 1916, the county court appointed an administrator of Greyhair's estate; and later in that month the administrator brought a suit in equity in a local court of general jurisdiction against the heirs and Osborn, conformably to a local statute,1 to accomplish specific performance of the contract. Among other things the petition in that suit set forth the contract, disclosed that Greyhair had died the day after making it and showed that a fee-simple patent to him was issued after his death. The heirs and Osborn were all brought in by both personal \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 436]\n\u00a0\n service and public notice. The widow and Osborn answered and consented that the prayer of the petition be granted. The children answered through a guardian ad litem and called for full proof. A hearing resulted in the entry of a decree authorizing and directing the administrator, on receiving from Osborn the unpaid balance of the purchase price, to execute and deliver to him a deed in fulfillment of the contract. An appeal to the Supreme Court was admissible under the local law, but none was taken. The balance of the purchase price was duly paid and on April 9, 1917, the administrator executed and delivered the deed to Osborn. The latter then entered into possession, and he and his grantees have been in possession ever since.\n May 31, 1922, the heirs of Greyhair-the minors then having attained their majority-made a deed purporting to convey the land to the plaintiff, an attorney at law, who knew of the administrator's deed and of the defendants' claim under it. The deed to the plaintiff recited a consideration of $1,000 'in hand paid'; but the real consideration was $80 paid in cash and a conditional promise to pay $920 more-if and when the plaintiff was adjudged by the 'court of final jurisdiction' to have the title.\n After receiving the deed from the heirs, the plaintiff brought the present suit to cancel the administrator's deed and some later conveyances passing all title under it to the defendants. The plaintiff took the position that Greyhair's contract to sell was void because made without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and in violation of the restriction against alienation imposed by the act of 1887; that under that act and other congressional statutes the title was held in trust by the United States up to the time of Greyhair's death and then passed to his heirs unaffected by any act of his; and that his administrator had \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n no authority over the land, and the local court was without jurisdiction to render the decree for the performance of the contract to sell. The trial court sustained that position and accordingly entered a decree of cancellation.\n The Supreme Court was of opinion that the fee-simple patent, although actually issued after Greyhair's death, should be regarded as if issued during his life, and that, so regarding it, 'there could be no question' that the local court 'had jurisdiction' to render the decree for the performance of the contract or that the administrator's deed given under the decree 'passed a valid title.' On these grounds the decree of cancellation was reversed.\n It was plainly implied in this decision that the administrator's suit to accomplish performance of the contract was sanctioned by the local statute, and also that, there being full jurisdiction, the decree therein was not open to collateral attack and was conclusive on the parties and their privies, including the plaintiff in the present suit who claims under a subsequent deed from the heirs. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The court's conclusion that the patent should be regarded as if issued during the life of Greyhair was rested on the equitable doctrine of relation. We think there is no need to consider that doctrine; for the operation of the patent is controlled by an early congressional statute,3 still in force, which provides:\n'Where patents for public lands have been or may be issued, in pursuance of any law of the United States, to a person who had died, or who hereafter dies, before the date of such patent, the title to the land designated therein \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n shall inure to and become vested in the heirs, devisees, or assignees of such deceased patentee as if the patent had issued to the deceased person during life.'\n\n The court noticed this statute, but was of opinion that it 'applies to homestead entries and not to Indian allotments.' This, we hold, is a mistaken view. The statute was in force long before homestead entries were permitted; and it has been held by this Court to be applicable to patents for Indian selections made under an Indian treaty (Crews v. Burcham, 1 Black, 352, 356), and to patents for Indian allotments made under an Act of Congress (United States v. Chase, \n245 \nU.S. 89, 101\n, 38 S. Ct. 24). True, it uses the term 'public lands,' which seldom is employed as including lands selected for or allotted to Indians. But the term sometimes is used in a sense which includes such lands where the United States has retained the title. This is illustrated in Kindred v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 582, 596\n, 32 S. Ct. 780, and Nadeau v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 442, 444\n, 40 S. Ct. 570. The question usually is one of intention, considering the nature and object of the particular statute. Here the statute is highly remedial, in that it is designed to relieve from the prior rule that a patent issued after the death of the grantee is inoperative and void. Davenport v. Lamb, 13 Wall. 418, 427. Patents to Indians are not less within the reason for the statute than patents to white men; and we think its letter may and should be taken as including both, as was done in Crews v. Burcham and United States v. Chase.\n We conclude that by reason of this statute the fee-simple patent to Greyhair, although issued 19 days after his death, operated to invest his 'heirs, devisees or assignees' with the title, and to divest the United States of it, 'as if' the patent had been issued to him 'during life.' Of course those who received the title, whether heirs, devisees or assignees, took it as though it came \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 439]\n\u00a0\n from him, and not as if they were the immediate grantees of the United States. See Harris v. Bell, \n254 \nU.S. 103, 108\n, 41 S. Ct. 49. The statute leaves no room for doubt on this point.\n With the issue of the patent, the title not only passed from the United States, but the prior trust and the incidental restriction against alienation were terminated. This put an end to the authority theretofore possessed by the Secretary of the Interior by reason of the trust and restriction-so that thereafter all questions pertaining to the title were subject to examination and determination by the courts, appropriately those in Nebraska, the land being there. Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 \nU.S. 473\n, 19 S. Ct. 485; Lane v. Mickadiet, \n241 U.S. 201\n, 207, et seq., 36 S. Ct. 599.\n Under the statute the title did not necessarily go to the heirs. Devisees or assignees, if having a lawful claim, would come first; and there well might be a question as to who were the heirs, or whether there were devisees or assignees having a better right. Such questions would be among those which might be taken into the courts. The contention to the contrary is without support in the congressional statutes to which our attention is invited. They all relate to lands held under trust patents or subject to restriction against alienation, and not to such as have been freed from the trust and restriction, as here, by the issue of a fee- simple patent.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that there was nothing in the congressional statutes to prevent the local court from taking and exercising jurisdiction of the administrator's suit for specific performance, brought after the issue of the fee-simple patent. Of course we accept the ruling of the Supreme Court that there was no want of jurisdiction under the state laws.\n As the local court had jurisdiction, that enabled it to decide every question of fact or law arising in the suit, including the questions whether Greyhair's contract to \n\n[276 U.S. 431, 440]\n\u00a0\n sell to Osborn was valid or invalid in the circumstances in which it was made, and whether by reason of its partial performance while Greyhair was living Osborn became an assignee in such a sense that the contract legally and equitably might be enforced as against the heirs. These questions inhered in the suit, and necessarily were resolved against the heirs by the decree for enforcement. No effort was made to have the decree reviewed or vacated in any direct proceeding. The attack made on it in the present suit was collateral. Certainly there was no federal right to have it re- examined or vacated on such an attack.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp. St. Neb. 1922, c. 15, art. IX; Solt v.

BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COM'RS(1928)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Duane E. Minard and George S. Hobert, both of Newark, N. J., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n John O. Bigelow, of Newark, N. J., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two appeals from orders of a Circuit Judge and two District Judges of the United States sitting in the District Court of New Jersey, denying to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company injunctions sought by it in that court under section 380, United States Code, title 28 (section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) 33 F.(2d) 780. The defendants were the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, the Attorney General, and Francis L. Bergen, prosecutor of the pleas of Somerset county, all of New Jersey. The order sought to be enjoined was one made by the Board of Public Utility \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n Commissioners, requiring the railroad company to eliminate two railroad grade crossings in Hillsborough township, Somerset county, New Jersey, and to substitute for both of them one overhead crossing, to cost the railroad company $324,000. It was alleged that the change would involve unreasonable expenditure and thereby violate section 15a of the act of Congress to regulate commerce, as added by the Transportation Act of 1920, c. 91,  422, 41 Stat. 488 (49 USCA  15a), by interposing a direct interference with interstate commerce and imposing a direct burden thereon; that it would confiscate the property of the railroad company, deny it the equal protection of the laws, and impair the obligation of a contract between the company and the state highway commission. The three federal judges heard the application for a temporary injunction and denied it, and on final hearing entered a decree dismissing the bills.\n The state highway involved is route No. 16, and crosses the Lehigh Valley Railroad in a direction northeasterly and southwesterly, at an angle of 29 degrees, with approaches on either side at the grade of 5 per cent. for a distance of 125 feet from the tracks. The right of way of the railroad company at this crossing is 100 feet wide and is occupied by four main operating tracks and various railroad appurtenances; 230 feet east of the center line of the crossing is a station on the west-bound side of the railroad known as 'Royce Valley.'\n At a point 1,400 feet easterly there is another grade crossing on what is called the Camp Lane road, branching off from the highway in a southeasterly direction across the railroad at a practically level grade. The order of the board would eliminate this crossing also.\n In December, 1922, negotiations were opened between the railroad company and the state highway commission for the purpose of considering a plan for these eliminations. The negotiations continued until March 11, \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n 1924, when the state highway commission adopted a resolution approving a plan of their engineer. There was public objection to it, and the negotiations continued, until finally the engineering staff of both the company and the highway commission agreed on plan C, to cost $109,000. The highway commission expended some $5,000 in preliminary preparation for its execution.\n No contract was ever signed, either by the railroad or the commission. The highway commission had statutory power to make such a contract, but none was made, other than the informal agreement between the engineering staffs.\n The matter was then taken up in 1926 by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, which was vested with authority to order railroad companies to eliminate grade crossings and to direct how they should be constructed. On November 24, the Board of Public Utilities issued an order to the railroad company providing for a different plan from that considered by the highway commission, to cost $324,000.\n The railroad company sought to restrain the enforcement of this order by application for certiorari to a judge of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. He heard the preliminary application and an argument on the subject, together with evidence in the form of affidavits on the issue made, denied the application for a restraining order, and ordered the certiorari presented before the full Supreme Court en banc. The application was there presented on briefs and was denied. (137 A. 442, 923.)\n A preliminary question is whether there was a contract made between the railroad company and the board of highway commission, so that the order by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners would be an impairment of it and a violation of the Federal Constitution. There was certainly no legal contract completed between the highway commission and the railroad company. Plans were only \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n tentatively agreed upon. The expenditure of $5,000 in anticipation of the execution of the contract to move some tracks did not constitute an estoppel equivalent to making it or agreeing to it.\n It is objected by the railroad company that the expense of the crossing of $324,000 is unreasonable, when it might have been constructed by an expenditure of at least $100,000 less.\n The state of New Jersey, lying between New York and Philadelphia and the West, has always been a throughfare for intrastate and interstate commerce. The state has issued bonds to the extent of $70,000,000 for the improvements of its roads, and they now aggregate 1,500 miles in length. The highway with which we are concerned is known as route 16, and is one of the chief arteries of travel between central New Jersey and the lake and mountain regions of the northern part of the state, northeastern Pennsylvania, and the lower counties of New York. In connection with two other highway routes, it has become one of the principal roads between New York and Philadelphia. The traffic diagonally across the state is so heavy and so constantly growing that no one road can carry it all. So another route, No. 29, was authorized by the Legislature in 1927 (Laws 1927, c. 319), and, when it is completed, the traffic at Royce Valley crossing, already heavy, will be much increased. The highway here in question was an ancient county road, laid out in 1811. It has always been a road at this point, running straight 2,000 feet north of the railroad and 2,500 feet south of it.\n Two plans for elimination of the two crossings were finally presented, one by the chief engineer of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, and one, called plan C, by the railroad company. The plan of the board provided for keeping the highway straight, carrying it under a bridge of the railroad tracks with a width of 66 feet, elevating the tracks for clearance, and dividing the high \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n way by a central pier of 5 feet, two roadways of 20 feet each, and two sidewalks of 10 feet 6 inches each.\n Plan C provided for the vacation and abandonment of the highway where it crosses the railroad right of way, so that route 16 would come to a dead end both north and south of the railroad. It provides further for the laying out and establishing of a new stretch of highway which would cross the railroad about 400 feet east of the present crossing. It would first have a 6-degree curve to the east. It would then have a straight course of about 250 feet to the entrance of the tunnel under the railroad tracks. A short distance beyond the tunnel a second 6-degree curve to the west would begin, and then a third 6-degree curve to the east and the roadway would join route 16 at a point about 1,000 feet south of the intersection of the route with the center line of the railroad. It would thus have three 6- degree curves in it in about half a mile, with cuts, which at stations 100 feet apart would have 7 feet of depth at one, 10 feet of depth at another, 7 1\/2 feet of depth at a third, and 5 feet at a fourth.\n Plan C provided for two roadways, each 18 feet wide and a center pier 5 feet wide, making a total width of 41 feet, and would create an angle of divergence of 54 . It would make the tunnel under the railroad, measured along the center pier, about 75 feet long, as against 105 feet by the board plan. The original cost as proposed by the railroad plan was $109, 000, but by including the Camp Lane elimination, and the two sidewalks on the roadway in the tunnel, both of which were plainly needed, and the increase in the width of the tunnel roadways, the cost was increased to $ 205,000, and to these additions and others the company ultimately acceded.\n The chief increases in the cost of the board plan over plan C, as modified, are in the requirement that the highway shall remain straight, and in the circumstance that \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n under the board plan the bridge of the railroad tracks must be raised to secure sufficient clearance for the use of the straight highway beneath. The tunnel and the bridge over it, if straight, must be 105 feet long, while under the railroad plan, with the three curves, and the cuts below the surface, the bridge would be only 75 feet, or shorter by one-third.\n The witnesses for the railroad testify that 6-degree curves are not dangerous, and that the additional cost of $100,000 for preserving the straight road is not within the limit of reasonableness. The advantage of straightness in such a road through a tunnel is clear. The curves in the cuts of from 5 to 10 feet in the railroad plan would tend to increase the embarrassment of driving and to obscure the clearness with which the drivers can see those ahead in and through the tunnel and the curves. This highway is not infrequently crowded with vehicles. When route No. 29 is completed, it will certainly be more crowded. The immediate prospect of using new route 29 makes greater room in the roadways most desirable. The large expenditure to secure such advantages does not seem to be arbitrary or wasteful, when made for two busy highways, instead of one.\n It is not for the court to cut down such expenditures, merely because more economical ways suggest themselves. The board has the discretion to fix the cost. The function of the court is to determine whether the outlay involved in the order of the board is extravagant, in the light of all the circumstances, in view of the importance of the crossing, of the danger to be avoided, of the probable permanence of the improvement and of the prospect of enlarged capacity to be required in the near future and other considerations similarly relevant.\n An increase from $200,000 to $300,000 for a railroad crossing might well, under different circumstances from \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n those here, be regarded as so unreasonable as to make the order a violation of the company's constitutional rights and to be in the nature of confiscation. The protection of the Fourteenth Amendment in such cases is real, and is not to be lightly regarded. A railroad company, in maintaining a path of travel and transportation across a state, with frequent trains of rapidity and great momentum, must resort to reasonable precaution to avoid danger to the public. This court has said that, where railroad companies occupy lands in the state for use in commerce, the state has a constitutional right to insist that a highway crossing shall not be dangerous to the public, and that, where reasonable safety of the public requires abolition of grade crossings, the railroad cannot not prevent the exercise of the police power to this end by the excuse that such change would interfere with interstate commerce or lead to the bankruptcy of the railroad. Erie Railroad v. Board, \n254 \nU.S. 394\n, 41 S. Ct. 169. This is not to be construed as meaning that danger to the public will justify great expenditures, unreasonably burdening the railroad, when less expenditure can reasonably accomplish the object of the improvements and avoid the danger. If the danger is clear, reasonable care must be taken to eliminate it, and the police power may be exerted to that end. But it becomes the duty of the court, where the cost is questioned, to determine whether it is within reasonable limits.\n This follows from principles clearly established by this court. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Oklahoma, \n271 \nU.S. 303\n, 46 S. Ct. 517; Mo. Pac. Ry. v. Omaha, \n235 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 131 S., 35 S. Ct. 82; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 137\n, 14 S. Ct. 499; Norfolk Ry. v. Commission, \n265 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 44 S. Ct. 439; Commission v. Mobile R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 391 S., 37 S. Ct. 602; Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 \nU.S. 223\n, 25 S. Ct. 18. We emphasize this, not because there is doubt about it, but because we depreciate the impression, apparently entertained by some, that in the safeguarding of railroad \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n crossings by order of state or local authority the exercise of police power escapes the ordinary constitutional limitation of reasonableness of cost. This is apt to give to local boards a sense of freedom which tempts to arbitrariness and extravagance. The case before us is one which is near the line of reasonableness, but for the reasons given we think it does not go beyond the line.\n An elaborate argument is made by counsel for the railroad company to impeach the validity of the order of the Board of Public Utilities in this case because of the amendment to the Interstate Commerce Law contained in the Transportation Act of 1920, c. 91,  416, 422, 41 Stat. 484, 488 (49 USCA  13, 15a). Based on this, it is said that the board has no right to order these unreasonable expenditures for construction, because they exceed the legal duties of the carrier and the reasonable requirements of public safety and convenience. It is not necessary for us to controvert the proposition that unreasonably extravagant grade crossings are to be enjoined, not only as violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also as forbidden by the Transportation Act.\n But we cannot see that the rule invoked from either will be violated by the order now made. The care of grade crossings is peculiarly within the police power of the states (Commission v. Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331, 341\n, 44 S. Ct. 376), and, if it is seriously contended that the cost of this grade crossing is such as to interfere with or impair economical management of the railroad, this should be made clear. It was certainly not intended by the Transportation Act to take from the states or to thrust upon the Interstate Commerce Commission investigation into parochial matters like this, unless by reason of their effect on economical management and service, their general bearing is clear. Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376. The latter case makes a distinction between the local character of \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 36]\n\u00a0\n the usual elimination of grade crossings and the vital character from the standpoint of finance of the investment of large sums in the erection of a union station.\n The final objection to the order is that the statute providing for the elimination of grade crossings by the board of Public Utilities impinges on the constitutional rights of the company, because it makes no provision for appeal from the decision of the Board of Public Utilities to a court with jurisdiction judicially to determine independently on the law and facts whether the property of the company is being confiscated in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S. Ct. 527. In that case the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania instituted an investigation and took evidence upon a complaint charging a water company with demanding unreasonable rates. The commission fixed the valuation of the company's property and established rates on that basis. The company contended that the valuation upon which the income was calculated was much too low and deprived it of a reasonable return and therefore confiscated its property. On appeal to the Superior Court, that court reviewed the certified record, appraised the property, reversed the order, and remanded the proceedings with directions to authorize rates sufficient to yield 7 per centum of the sum. The Supreme Court reversed the decree, saying that there was competent evidence tending to sustain the commission's conclusion, and, as no abuse of discretion appeared, the Superior Court could not, under the Pennsylvania statute, interfere. This court held on error that, because the plaintiff in error had not had proper opportunity for an adequate independent judicial hearing as to confiscation on the law and the facts, the challenged order was invalid, and that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the state must be reversed. \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 37]\n\u00a0\n We do not think the Ben Avon Case applies here. In this case chapter 195 of the Laws of 1911 of New Jersey created a Board of Public Utility Commissioners and prescribed its duties and powers. By sections 21 and 22 of that act, the board is vested with authority to protect the traveling public at grade crossings by directing the railroad company to install such protective device or devices and adopt such other reasonable provision for the protection of the traveling public at such crossing as in the discretion of the board shall be necessary.\n Section 38 of this act, as amended by chapter 130 of the Laws of 1918, provides that any order made by the board may be reviewed upon on certiorari after notice, and the Supreme Court is given jurisdiction to review the order, and to set it aside when it clearly appears that there was no evidence before the board reasonably to support the same, or that the same was without the jurisdiction of the board. If it should appear equitable and just that a rehearing be had before the board, the Supreme Court may determine that such hearing be had, upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.\n The language of section 38 in respect to the appeal to the Supreme Court is much broadened by the construction of that court. It has been established by its decisions that the Legislature of New Jersey may not impair the powers of the Supreme Court and the Court of Chancery as they existed when the state Constitution was adopted, and there is much latitude in their jurisdiction growing out of this. Traphagen v. West Hoboken, 39 N. J. Law, 232; Flanigan v. Guggenheim Smelting Co., 63 N. J. Law, 647, 44 A. 762; In re Prudential Insurance Co., 82 N. J. Eq. 335, 88 A. 970.\n The case of Public Service Gas Co. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, 84 N. J. Law, 463, 87 A. 651, L. R. A. 1918A, 421; Id., 87 N. J. Law, 581, 92 A. 606, 94 A. 634, 95 A. 1079, L. R. A. 1917B, 930, L. R. A. 1918A, 421, construing section 38, as amended, is an illustration. It came before the Supreme Court on certiorari for consideration whether rates \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 38]\n\u00a0\n fixed by the board for a public service gas company of Passaic were unjust, discriminatory, and unreasonable. The Supreme Court said of section 38:\n'If this language is taken literally, we should be powerless in any case within the jurisdiction of the board to set aside its order if there was any evidence to support it, no matter how overwhelming the evidence to the contrary might be. It is needless to say that such a literal construction of section 38 would bring it into conflict with our Constitution. It needs no act of the Legislature to confer on us the power to review the action of an inferior tribunal, and the Legislature cannot limit us in the exercise of our ancient prerogative. That the Legislature did not intend to do so is made clear by a consideration of the whole act. We are, by the express terms of section 38, authorized to set aside the order when it is without the jurisdiction of the board. The jurisdiction of the board to fix rates is, by section 16c, limited to cases where the existing rate is unjust, unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory or preferential. The only words important for the present case are 'unjust' and 'unreasonable,' since the commissioners themselves went no further in their adjudication. To determine then whether the commissioners had jurisdiction, we must first determine whether the existing rate was unjust and unreasonable, and in determining that fact we are not limited to the question whether it clearly appears that there was no evidence before the board to support reasonably its order; section 16c does not purport to limit the scope of our inquiry into the fact, and we must therefore determine it in the usual way, according to the whole of the evidence.'\n\n The Supreme Court proceeded itself to consider all the evidence in the case, and to find whether the old rate was unreasonably high and the new rate reasonable. It said:\n\n\n[278 U.S. 24, 39]\n\u00a0\n 'All these considerations lead us to the conclusion that if there is any presumption in favor of the order of the commissioners, it depends, like the opinion of the court of another state, upon the strength of the reasoning by which it is supported. This is subject, however, to the qualification that in legislative action the courts will not merely substitute their judgment for that of a legislative body. We must, therefore, determine for ourselves upon all the evidence whether the former rate for gas in the Passaic district was unjust and unreasonable, and whether the new rate is just and reasonable.'\n The case went to the Court of Errors and Appeals, and the action was affirmed on that opinion. There may be some confusion in a review of cases on certiorari by the Supreme Court of New Jersey; but the Passaic Case has never been overruled, and under it there is an appeal to a court which may examine the facts and the law independently as to the justice and reasonableness of the order. It is true that the court said that the case before it was not technically a confiscation case, but it resembled it so much that it used cases from this court on confiscation to guide its rulings, and said:\n'Since all cases of the kind may come before that tribunal ... and its decisions upon the constitutional question would be binding upon us, we ought to adopt the same rule.'\n\n The Passaic Case was followed in the consideration of the same section 38 in Erie Railroad v. Board, 89 N. J. Law, 57, 98 A. 13, and 90 N. J. Law, 672, 103 A. 1052, a grade crossing case, in which the Supreme Court said:\n'The next ground of attack is that the evidence taken before the Board of Public Utility Commissioners does not justify, nor reasonably support, the board's conclusion or findings. To that end, the insistence is that this court \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 40]\n\u00a0\n has power and should review the board's findings of fact. We understand such to be the power of this court.'\n\n Objection is further made to this remedy before the Supreme Court that it is by certiorari, and is within the discretion of the court. That, however, is hardly a serious obstacle. As Chief Justice Kinsey, in State v. Anderson, 1 N. J. Law, 318, 1 Am. Dec. 207, said:\n'As upon a certiorari the court has by law a discretionary power, I do not mean by this a power to do what they please, not directed by law and precedents, but, to employ the language of a great judge, to be confined to those limits, within which an honest man competent to the discharge of the duties of his office ought to be confined.'\n\n This court said of provisions for certiorari in a California statute like this; i. e., Napa Valley Electric Co. v. Board, \n251 \nU.S. 366\n, 40 S. Ct. 174:\n'In those cases the applications for writs of certiorari were denied, which was tantamount to a decision of the court that the orders and decisions of the commission did not exceed its authority or violate any right of the several petitioners under the Constitution of the United States or of the state of California.'\n\n But, if for any reason that remedy, as defined in those decisions, should not be available, or be inadequate, it would seem to be clear that resort then might be had to the Court of Chancery. In Allen v. Distilling Co., 87 N. J. Eq. 531, 100 A. 620, the Court of Chancery in New Jersey used this language:\n'So long as courts of equity are to serve the purpose of the creation of the Court of Chancery of England-and in this state the Court of Chancery is the successor, in all that such term implies, of that court-jurisdiction must depend only upon the existence of, or a threatened, wrong, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. ... Due to our habit of endeavoring to find decided cases to fit each \n\n[278 U.S. 24, 41]\n\u00a0\n situation, we too often overlook the fundamental reasons for the creation or evolution of the court. It received no grant of express powers, nor were express duties imposed upon it. The law courts were left to deal with the violation of all rights for which they could give an adequate remedy. The duty of relieving against any remaining wrongs was imposed upon the Court of Chancery.'\n\n We are of opinion that the infirmity in the Pennsylvania statute, which was pointed out in Ohio Valley Co. v.

( 2d) 769. In view of a conflict between this decision and In re Applebaum, 11 F. (2d) 685, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n274 \nU.S. 731\n, 47 S. Ct. 659. The conflict concerns the construction of section 14b(3) of the Bankruptcy Act. Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 550; Act June 25, 1910, c. 412,  6, 36 Stat. 838, 839 (11 USCA  32). By that section 'the judge shall ... discharge the applicant unless he has ... (3) obtained money or property on credit upon a materially false statement in writing, made by him to any person or his representative for the purpose of obtaining credit from such person.' The facts that raise the question are found to be as follows. The bankrupt was president of the American Home Furnishers Corporation, had the general management and control of it, had made large advances to it, and with his sister-in-law owned more than two-thirds of the stock; he obtained a loan of $1,500,000 to the corporation from the objectors and in order to obtain it made to them a statement in writing, known by him to be false, which very materially overstated the assets of the corporation. There is no doubt of his pecuniary interest in the result of the fraud found to have been practiced by \n\n[276 U.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n him, but it is said that he did not obtain money by this fraud inasmuch as the money went to the corporation and not to him.\n A man obtains his end equally when that end is to induce another to lend to his friend and when it is to bring about a loan to himself. It seems to us that it would be a natural use of ordinary English to say that he obtained the money for his friend. So when the statute speaks simply of obtaining money, the question for whom the money must be obtained depends upon the context and the policy of the act. It would seem that so far as policy goes there is no more reason for granting a discharge to a man who has fraudulently obtained a loan to a corporation which is owned by him and in which his interests are bound up than for granting one to a man who has got money directly for himself. In re Dresser & Co. (D. C.) 144 F. 318. It is true that the narrower construction is somewhat helped by the words 'for the purpose of obtaining credit from such person,' which naturally would be taken to mean for the purpose of obtaining credit for himself and so would fortify the interpretation that only immediate benefit was contemplated. But we cannot think it possible that the statute should be taken to allow an escape from its words, fairly read, by the simple device of interposing an artificial personality between the bankrupt and the lender. We go no farther than the facts before us, and without intimating that our decision would be different, we express no opinion as to how it would be if the bankrupt had no substantial pecuniary interest in the borrower's obtaining the loan. The later amendment by the Act of May 27, 1926, c. 406,  6, 44 Stat. 662, 663 (11 USCA  32), serves to limit the bars to a discharge more narrowly and by indirection to favor the defendant's position by a change of the words to 'a materially false statement ... respecting his financial con- \n\n[276 U.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n dition.' But that statute did not govern this case and cannot be invoked for the construction of the earlier law. As to the suggestion in In re Applebaum that the language before us may have been drawn from the original statute of false pretenses (referring we presume to St. 30 Geo. II, c. 24), and that the words should be taken with the construction first given to them, it is enough to reply with the Court below that it is equally likely that they were taken from a more modern source, and were used with knowledge of the broader interpretation of later days.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIBERTY NAT. BANK OF ROANOKE, VA. v. BEAR(1928)\nNo. 218\nArgued: October 7, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. James D. Johnston, of Roanoke, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. B. Apperson, of Salem, Va., for respondents. \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is the bankruptcy proceeding which was before us at an earlier stage in Liberty Nat. Bank v. Bear, \n265 \nU.S. 365\n, 44 S. Ct. 499\n\n\n In July, 1920, the Liberty National Bank brought suit in a Virginia court against the Roanoke Provision Company, a partnership composed of W. L. Becker, Sr., and W. L. Becker, Jr., and against the Beckers individually, and in the same month recovered a judgment against the Provision Company and the two Beckers individually, which being duly docketed, became, under the laws of Virginia, \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n a lien upon the real estate of the judgment debtors. \n1\n In August an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed in the Federal District Court against the Provision Company, as a partnership composed of the two Beckers; alleging that it had committed an act of bankruptcy by executing a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and was insolvent. There was no allegation that the Beckers were individually insolvent, or had executed general assignments of their individual properties or committed any acts of bankruptcy; and there was no prayer that they be adjudged bankrupt individually. They filed a joint answer admitting the allegations of the petition; and the Company, as a partnership composed of the two Beckers, was adjudged a bankrupt by the District Judge, but without adjudging the bankruptcy of the Beckers as individuals.\n In April, 1921-more than eight months after the partnership had been adjudged a bankrupt-the Beckers filed separate voluntary petitions in bankruptcy; and each was adjudged a bankrupt. The respondent Bear was then elected trustee for the partnership estate by the partnership creditors, and trustee for the individual estates by the individual creditors.\n Thereafter the Bank filed proofs of claim on the judgment against the separate estates of the Beckers, alleging that it constituted a lien upon their individual real estate and was entitled to priority as such. The trustee filed objections on the ground that he had been vested with title to the property of the individual partners, as well as that of the partnership, as of the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy against the Company in August, 1920; and contended that as the judgment had been recovered within four months prior to the filing of that petition, the lien upon the individual properties was annulled by \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act. \n2\n The referee disallowed the claims of the Bank as secured claims, and allowed them as unsecured claims merely. \n3\n This order was reversed by the District Judge, on the ground that as the order adjudging the bankruptcy of the Company had not adjudged the bankruptcy of the Beckers individually, the lien of the judgment upon their individual properties had not been nullified. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decree upon the ground that the 'adjudication of the partnership was necessarily an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the individuals composing it, and that ... the lien of a judgment obtained within four months of the filing of the petition against the partnership was lost by the adjudication.' 285 F. 703. This Court-without determining whether the adjudication of the bankruptcy of the Company operated as an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the Beckers individually-held that as there was no pleading or proof as to the insolvency of the Beckers when the Bank recovered its judgment, there was no ground under section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act for annulling the lien thereby acquired upon their individual properties, and reversed the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and remanded the cause of the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion. Liberty Nat. Bank v. Bear, supra, 368 (44 S. Ct. 499).\n The trustee, by leave of the District Court, then amended his objections to the claims of the Bank by alleging that the Beckers were insolvent when the judgment was recovered, and that if enforced as a secured claim against the individual estates the judgment would result \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n in preferences,4 and contended that the lien upon the individual properties was also annulled by section 67c of the Bankruptcy Act. It was then stipulated that the Beckers were insolvent when the judgment was obtained, and that the enforcement of the judgment as a secured claim against the individual properties would enable the Bank to obtain a greater percentage of its debt from such assets than other individual creditors-there being no surplus from individual assets to be applied to partnership debts, and none from partnership assets to be applied to individual debts. The referee again disallowed the claims of the Bank as secured claims against the individual estates of the Beckers. This was affirmed by the District Court, without opinion, and by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which adhered to its original ruling as to the effect of the order adjudicating the bankruptcy of the partnership. 18 F.(2d) 281.\n The controversy here is solely between the Bank and the trustee as the representative of the other individual creditors of the Beckers; the partnership creditors having no interest therein as there is no surplus of the individual estates to be applied to partnership debts.\n The trustee relies upon both sections 67c and 67f of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  107). Section 67c provides that:\n'A lien created by or obtained in or pursuant to any suit ... which was begun against a person within four months before the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against such person shall be dissolved by the adjudication of such person to be a bankrupt if ... it appears that said lien was obtained and permitted while the defendant was insolvent and that its existence and enforcement will work a preference. ...'\n\n Section 67f provides:\n'That all levies, judg- \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n ments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him,5 shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the ... lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt. ...'\n\n It is indisputable that under these provisions the judgment liens upon the real estate of the Beckers cannot be annulled unless they were adjudged bankrupts under petitions in bankruptcy filed within four months after the suit against them was commenced, section 67c, or the judgment liens obtained, section 67f. This being unquestioned, the trustee does not claim that the liens were annulled under the voluntary petitions of the Beckers which were filed after the expiration of the prescribed periods. His sole contention is that they were annulled by the proceedings under the involuntary petition filed against the Provision Company within such periods. As to this he insists that-although the petition was filed against the partnership alone and the partnership alone was adjudged a bankrupt-the petition was, in effect, a petition against the individual partners, as well as the partnership, and the adjudication was, in effect, an adjudication that the individual partners as well as the partnership were bankrupts; that is, that the adjudication that the partnership was a bankrupt necessarily imported an adjudication that the individual partners were also bankrupts.\n This contention disregards entirely the principle established by the Bankruptcy Act that a partnership may be adjudged a bankrupt as a separate entity without refer- \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n ence to the bankruptcy of the partners as individuals. In this respect the Act makes a complete change from the earlier Bankrupt Law of 1867, which did not permit the partnership entity to be adjudged a bankrupt, but merely provided that when two or more persons who were partners in trade were adjudged bankrupt, the property of the partnership, as well as that of the partners, should be taken over by the bankruptcy court for administration. 6 The present Act not only omits this provision of the law of 1867, but-after providing generally that the word 'persons' when used in the Act shall include 'partnerships,' section 1(19), and that a petition in bankruptcy may be filed against a 'person' who is insolvent and has committed an act of bankruptcy, section 3b (11 USCA  21)- specifically declares in section 5a (11 USCA  23) that:\n'A partnership, during the continuation of the partnership business, or after its dissolution and before the final settlement thereof, may be adjudged a bankrupt.'7\n\n Under this provision, as was \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 222]\n\u00a0\n said in Meek v. Centre County Banking Co., \n268 \nU.S. 426, 431\n, 45 S. Ct. 560, 562 (69 L. Ed. 1028), there 'can be no doubt that a partnership may be adjudged a bankrupt as a distinct legal entity.' And if proceeded against as a distinct legal entity, without reference to the individual partners, it may, as such, under section 12a (11 USCA  30), offer terms of composition to the partnership creditors alone. Myers v. Internat. Trust Co., \n273 \nU.S. 380, 383\n, 47 S. Ct. 372.\n It has long been the established rule in the Circuit Courts of Appeals and District Courts that under section 5a of the Act a partnership may be adjudged a bankrupt as a separate entity, under a voluntary or involuntary petition, irrespective of any adjudication of bankruptcy against the individual partners.

C.) 177 F. 299, 305; In re Lenoir-Cross & Co. (D. C.) 226 F. 227, 229.8 This rule has been applied not only where the petition in bankruptcy sought merely the adjudication of the partnership as a bankrupt, but where the adjudication of the individual partners was also sought. Thus in some cases the partnership was adjudged a bankrupt, although the court refused to adjudge the bankruptcy of the individual partners, either because they had not committed individual acts of bankruptcy, or because, being wage earners or tillers of the soil, they were exempt from \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 224]\n\u00a0\n involuntary bankruptcy, or because they were insane, or minors. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n This rule, often announced, is based upon the plain words of the Bankruptcy Act. The specific provision in section 5a that a partnership-a person within the meaning of the Act-'may be adjudged a bankrupt,' distinctly implies that it may be adjudged a bankrupt as a separate entity without reference to the bankruptcy of the individual partners. This implication is strengthened by the fact that there is no requirement in section 5 that the partners shall be joined as defendants in a petition filed against the partnership, and no provision that the partners shall be adjudged to be bankrupts under such a petition or that such individual adjudications shall be a prerequisite to the adjudication of the bankruptcy of the partnership; as well as by the fact that while section 5 of the Act incorporated most of the administrative provisions in the corresponding section of the Bankrupt Law of 1867, it omitted the provision for granting discharges to the individual partners. That is, the adjudication of the bankruptcy of the individual partners was left solely to the general provisions of the Act, under which no person could be adjudged a bankrupt in involuntary bankruptcy unless he was not only insolvent but had committed an act of bankruptcy, and not even then if he were a wage earner or tiller of the soil. Section 3a, 3b, and 4b (11 USCA  21, 22).\n We cannot believe that Congress intended to limit and weaken the broad provision of section 5a permitting a partnership to be adjudged a bankrupt, by making it essential to \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 225]\n\u00a0\n such an adjudication that the partners should also be adjudged bankrupts individually. So to hold would make it impossible, in an involuntary proceeding, to adjudge bankrupt a partnership as a separate entity, although it was insolvent and had committed an act of bankruptcy, if any of the partners could not be adjudged a bankrupt because he had not committed an individual act of bankruptcy or was a person exempt from such an adjudication, or for any other adequate reason. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The conclusion stated is not in conflict with the decision in Francis v. McNeal, \n228 \nU.S. 695\n, 33 S. Ct. 701, L. R. A. 1915E, 706, upon which the trustee relies. That decision, as we have heretofore pointed out in Liberty Nat. Bank v. Bear, supra, 368 (44 S. Ct. 499), and Meek v. Centre County Banking Co., supra, 432, did not involve the question whether an adjudication of the bankruptcy of a partnership involved the adjudication of the bankruptcy of the partners, but merely involved the question whether a bankruptcy court in which an insolvent partnership had been adjudged a bankrupt might under the administrative provisions of section 5 require a partner who had not been adjudged a bankrupt to surrender his individual property to the trustee of the partnership estate for the purpose of paying the partnership debts. There was no claim or suggestion that the adjudication of the bankruptcy of the partnership had involved an adjudication of the bankruptcy of the partner as an individual, or that under that adjudication he could be deemed a bankrupt individually or a trustee could be appointed of his individual estate for the purpose of administering it as that of a bankrupt. \n\n[276 U.S. 215, 226]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that the involuntary petition filed against the Provision Company, which did not in terms seek an adjudication that the Beckers were bankrupts as individuals, nor allege that as individuals they were insolvent or had committed any acts of bankruptcy, was not in legal effect a petition filed against them individually, and the adjudication under that petition that the partnership was a bankrupt, was not in legal effect an adjudication that they were bankrupts individually. There is hence no ground, under either section 67c or section 67f of the Act, for annulling the judgment liens obtained upon their individual real estate more than eight months prior to the filing of their voluntary petitions.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Code of 1919,  6470, 6471. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 30 Stat. 544, c. 541; U.

Should any surplus remain of the property of any partner after paying his individual debts, such surplus shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to the payment of the partnership debts. Should any surplus of the partnership property remain after paying the partnership debts, such surplus shall be added to the assets of the individual partners in the proportion of their respective interests in the partnership. \n\n'g The court may permit the proof of the claim of the partnership estate against the individual estates, and vice versa, and may marshal the assets of the partnership estate and individual estates so as to prevent preferences and secure the equitable distribution of the property of the several estates.\n\n'h In the event of one or more but not all of the members of a partnership being adjudged bankrupt, the partnership property shall not be administered in bankruptcy, unless by consent of the partner or partners not adjudged bankrupt; but such partner or partners not adjudged bankrupt shall settle the partnership business as expeditiously as its nature will permit, and account for the interest of the partner or partners adjudged bankrupt.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] And even in Re Forbes, 128 F. 137, 139, in which the District Court for Massachusetts held that there could be no bankruptcy of a partnership without the bankruptcy of all the partners, it was recognized that this would not apply in 'exceptional cases such as In re Dunnigan (D. C.) 95 F. 428,' supra, in which it had been held, in the same district, that a partnership might be adjudged a bankrupt although one partner, being a minor, could not be so adjudged. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Neither of two incidental questions upon which the lower Federal courts have differed in opinion-whether a partnership can be deemed insolvent as an entity when the individual partners are solvent, and whether a bankruptcy court which has adjudged a partnership a bankrupt may take possession of the individual property of a partner who has not been adjudged a bankrupt so far as is necessary to pay the partnership debts-is here involved. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] As was said by the late Judge Hough, section 5a 'sympathetically interpreted secures to the creditor a prompt seizure of firm assets,- without regard to dead, insane, absent, dormant or secret partners, who as experience shows, are commonly used by the active members to harass and obstruct those holding just demands against the firm.' 8 Columb.

The Burley Tobacco Growers' Co- operative Marketing Association, incorporated under the Bingham Co- operative Marketing Act (chapter 1, Acts Ky. 1922), commenced this proceeding against the warehouse company in the Mason county circuit court. It charged the warehouse company with willful violation of the act by selling pledged tobacco, and asked judgment for the prescribed penalty ($ 500) and attorney's fees.\n The Bingham Act (32 sections) authorizes the incorporation of nonprofit co-operative associations for the \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 84]\n\u00a0\n orderly marketing of agricultural products, and provides only producers may become members and that the corporation may contract only with them for marketing such products. It declares that these contracts shall not be illegal, prescribes penalties for interfering therewith, and further provides that the association shall not be deemed a conspiracy, illegal combination, or monopoly. Three pertinent sections follow:\n'Sec. 26. Misdemeanor to Induce Breach of Marketing Contract of Co- operative Association-Spreading False Reports about the Finances or Management Thereof.\n'Any person or persons or any corporation whose officers or employees knowingly induce or attempt to induce any member or stockholder of an association organized hereunder to breach his marketing contract with the association, or who maliciously and knowingly spreads false reports about the finances or management thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred ($ 100.00) dollars and not more than one thousand ($1,000) dollars for each such offense, and shall be liable to the association aggrieve in a civil suit in the penal sum of five hundred ($500) dollars for each such offense.\n\n'Sec. 27.

In addition, said warehouseman shall pay to the association a reasonable attorney's fee and all costs involved in any such litigation or proceedings at law.\n\n'This section is enacted in order to prevent a recurrence or outbreak of violence and to give marketing associations an adequate remedy in the courts against those who encourage violations of co-operative contracts.\n\n'Sec. 28. Associations are Not in Restraint of Trade.\n'Any association organized hereunder shall be deemed not to be a conspiracy nor a combination in restraint of trade nor an illegal monopoly; nor an attempt to lessen competition or to fix prices arbitrarily or to create a combination or pool in violation of any law of this state; and the marketing contracts and agreements between the association and its members and any agreements authorized in this act shall be considered not to be illegal nor in restraint of trade nor contrary to the provisions of any statute enacted against pooling or combinations.'\n\n The petition (filed Dec. 14, 1923) alleges:\n That the association was organized to provide means for orderly marketing of tobacco grown or acquired by members and no others. Identical contracts (the standard form is exhibited) with many growers obligate them to deliver to it all of their tobacco during five years. Tobacco received under these contracts is sold to manufacturers and dealers as market conditions permit and the proceeds less expenses are distributed among the members, according to quality and quantity of their deliveries.\n That one Mike Kielman joined the association and executed the standard contract. Notwithstanding this he delivered two thousand pounds of the 1923 crop to the warehouse company and it sold the same, with full \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 86]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the circumstances. Before the sale the association notified the warehouse company of Kielman's membership and of his marketing contract, requested it not to sell his tobacco and called attention to the prescribed penalties.\n'Plaintiff says that after service of said notice and with the full knowledge that said tobacco had been sold to this plaintiff, the defendant knowingly persuaded and permitted the said Mike Kielman to breach his marketing contract with the plaintiff association by accepting and receiving the said member's product for sale and for auction and selling same contrary to the terms of said marketing agreement, contrary to the provisions of section 27 of the Bingham Co- operative Marketing Act.'\n\n The standard contract provides:\n'The association agrees to buy and the grower agrees to sell and deliver to the association all of the tobacco produced by or for him or acquired by him as landlord or lessor, during the years 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926. ... The association agrees to resell such tobacco, together with tobacco of like type, grade and quality delivered by other growers under similar contracts, at the best prices obtainable by it under market conditions, and to pay over the net amount receive therefrom (less freight, insurance and interest), as payment in full to the grower and growers named in contracts similar hereto, according to the tobacco delivered by each of them,' etc.\n\n'Inasmuch as the remedy at law would be inadequate; and inasmuch as it is now and ever will be impracticable and extremely difficult to determine the actual damage resulting to the association should the grower fail so to sell and deliver all of his tobacco the grower hereby agrees to pay to the association for all tobacco delivered, consigned or marketed or withheld by or for him, other than in accordance with the terms hereof, the sum of five cents per pound as liquidated damages averaged for all types \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 87]\n\u00a0\n and grades of tobacco, for the breach of this contract; all parties agreeing that this contract is one of a series dependent for its true value upon the adherence of each and all of the growers to each and all of the said contracts.\n\n'The grower agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by him of any provision, regarding delivery of tobacco the association shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breach or further breach thereof and to a decree for specific performance and sale of personal property under special circumstances and conditions, and that the buyer cannot go to the open markets and buy tobacco and replace any which the grower may fail to deliver.'\n\n The warehouse company presented an amended answer and counterclaim in three sections.\n The first sets up 'in estoppel and in bar' of the alleged action that the association since January 13, 1922, has been a trust or combination of the capital, skill and acts of divers persons and corporations doing commercial business in Kentucky and between that state and other states and foreign countries 'organized and conducted for the express purpose of unlawfully and contrary to the common law, creating and carrying out restrictions in trade' under the guise of stabilizing prices.\n The second asserts that sections 26 and 27, Bingham Act, conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, abridge defendant's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States, deprive it of corporate life, liberty, and property without due process of law and deny it equal protection of the laws.\n The third seems to be based upon the Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Law. It advances a counterclaim; also asks the court to determine whether the Bingham Act is valid and for a declaration of rights and duties.\n The trial court struck section 3 'from the records' and sustained demurrers to sections 1 and 2. The \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 88]\n\u00a0\n warehouse company elected to plead no further. Trial by jury was waived, 'the petition being submitted to the court on the law and facts.' Judgment for $500-the prescribed penalty-and $100 attorney's fees went for the association, and was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n In order to prevail here, the warehouse company must show that enforcement of the challenged judgment would deprive it-not another-of some right arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States properly asserted below. Southern Railway Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524\n, 30 S. Ct. 594; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540\n, 32 S. Ct. 754; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 621\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Ct. 167; Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S. Ct. 106.\n No federal right was impaired by striking section 3 from the amended answer and counterclaim. Proceedings in state courts must conform to the reasonable requirements of local law. Whether they do is primarily for those courts to determine. Here we find no abuse of that power.\n Section 3 asserts:\n'Defendant now makes its application to this court, upon its counterclaim, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 83 of the Acts of 1922 of the General Assembly of Kentucky, known as the Declaratory Judgment Law, for the purpose of securing a declaration of its rights and duties under said Bingham Co-operative Marketing Act, in relation to the common law and the state and federal Constitutions, as well as the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, and for the purpose of having this court determine whether in the conduct of its business it will be necessary for it to comply with the provisions of said Bingham Co-operative Marketing Act, or whether it is invalid in whole or part, and, if so, in what part.'\n\n Apparently the declaratory judgment statute authorizes plaintiffs only to ask for judgments. It also provides:\n\n\n[276 U.S. 71, 89]\n\u00a0\n 'The court may refuse to exercise the power to declare rights, duties or other legal relations in any case where a decision under it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise to the action, or in any case where the declaration or construction is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances. Section 6.'\n This court has no jurisdiction to review a mere declaratory judgment. Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70\n, 47 S. Ct. 282.\n Section 1 presents no federal question. It does not mention the Constitution or any statute of the United States, but claims that the association is an unlawful trust or combination under common-law rules. But the present controversy concerns a statute, and a state may freely alter, amend, or abolish the common law within its jurisdiction. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 378\n, 13 S. Ct. 914.\n Section 2 challenges sections 26 and 27 of the Bingham Act, because they offend the Fourteenth Amendment, 'in that said sections and each of them abridges defendant's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States and deprives defendant of its corporate life, liberty and property without due process of law and denies to it the equal protection of the laws.' This suggests the only federal questions open for our consideration. The pleadings allege no burden upon interstate commerce amounting to regulation, nor do they property and definitely advance any claim under a federal statute.\n A corporation does not possess the privileges and immunities of a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the Constitution. Western Turf Ass'n v. Greenberg, \n204 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 27 S. Ct. 384; Selover v. Walsh, \n226 \nU.S. 112\n, 33 S. Ct. 69. The allegation concerning deprivations of corporate life is unimportant.\n Certainly the statute impaired no right of the warehouse company guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amend- \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 90]\n\u00a0\n ment, by merely authorizing corporations with membership limited to agriculturists and permitting contracts for purchase and resale of farm products. This also is true of the declaration that such associations shall not be deemed monopolies, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, and that contracts with members shall not be illegal. The state may declare its own policy as to such matters.\n Sections 26 and 27 prohibit interference with contracts permitted by local law and not alleged to conflict with federal law. Section 26 declares any person or corporation who knowingly induces a member to break his marketing contract guilty of a misdemeanor and subjects him to a fine; also to suit for the penal sum of $500. Section 27 hits warehousemen who solicit, persuade, or permit a member to break his marketing contract by accepting or receiving pledged products for sale and subjects them to penalties. It was under the latter section that judgment went against the warehouse company.\n The court below affirmed:\n'There is no statute at present in this state, nor was there any when the cause of action herein arose, against pools, trusts, and monopolies.'\n\n Considering this and further declarations in the same opinion, we cannot say that any common-law rule recognized in the state of Kentucky forbade associations or contracts similar to those before us when intended to promote orderly marketing. Undoubtedly the state had power to authorize formation of corporations by farmers for the purpose of dealing in their own products. And there is nothing to show that since the Bingham Act producers may not form voluntary associations and through them make and enforce contracts like those expressly authorized.\n Do the provisions of the Bingham Act which afford peculiar protection to marketing contracts with members of the association deprive the warehouse company of \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 91]\n\u00a0\n equal protection of the laws, or conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because without reasonable basis and purely arbitrary? These questions may be fairly said to arise upon the present record.\n The statute penalizes all who wittingly solicit, persuade, or induce an association member to break his marketing contract. It does not prescribed more rigorous penalties for warehousemen than for other offenders. Nobody is permitted to do what is denied to warehousemen. There is no substantial basis upon which to invoke the equal protection clause.\n Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540\n, 22 S. Ct. 431, is much relied upon. But there the circumstances differed radically from those here presented, and always to determine whether equal protection is denied there must be consideration of the peculiar facts. Connolly resisted judgment for the purchase price of pipe upon the ground that the Union Company, the vendor, belonged to a combination or trust forbidden by an Illinois statute. The statute defined a trust, made participation therein criminal, and directed that those who purchased articles from an offending member should not be held liable for the price. Section 9 declared:\n'The provisions of this act shall not apply to agricultural products or live stock while in the hands of the producer or raiser.' Laws Ill. 1893, p. 184.\n\n This court held that because of the exemption the Union Company was denied the equal protection of the law. It was forbidden to do what others could do with impunity. Here the situation is very different. The questioned statute undertakes to protect sanctioned contracts against any interference-no one could lawfully do what the warehouse company did.\n Counsel maintain that the Bingham Act takes from the warehouse company the right to carry on business in the usual way by accepting and selling the tobacco of those \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 92]\n\u00a0\n who voluntarily seek its services and thus unduly abridges its liberty. Undoubtedly the statute does prohibit and penalize action not theretofore so restricted and to that extent interferes with freedom. But this is done to protect certain contracts which the legislature deemed of great importance to the public and peculiarly subject to invasion. We need not determine whether the liberty protected by the Constitution includes the right to induce a breach of contract between others for the aggrandizement of the intermeddler-to violate the nice sense of right which honorable traders ought to observe.\n In Minnesota, etc., Marketing Association v. Radke (1925) 163 Minn. 403, 204 N. W. 314, provisions of the Co-operative Marketing Act of Minnesota (Laws 1923, c. 264) substantially like section 27 were declared invalid. The Supreme Court said:\n'It seems clear to us that it is beyond the power of the Legislature to make it a tort to purchase, in the ordinary course of a legitimate business, from the true owner a wholesome staple commodity upon which there is no lien and which is not under any ban or regulation because of inherent qualities or use. Liberty of contract is assured by both state and federal Constitutions.'\n\n On the other hand, in Commonwealth v. Hodges (1910) 137 Ky. 233, 125 S. W. 689, the Kentucky Court of Appeals sustained a statute which made it a criminal offense knowingly to purchase a crop pledged to an unincorporated marketing association. The same doctrine is accepted by the opinion below.\n It is stated without contradiction that co-operative marketing statutes substantially like the one under review have been enacted by 42 states. Congress has recognized the utility of co-operative association among farmers in the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 731 (15 USCA  17), the Capper- Volstead Act (42 Stat. 388 (7 USCA  291-292), and the Co-operative Marketing Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 802 (7 USCA  451-457)). These statutes reveal widespread legislative approval of the plan for protection \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 93]\n\u00a0\n scattered producers and advancing the public interest. Although frequently challenged, we do not find that any court has condemned an essential feature of the plan with the single exception of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in the above-cited case.\n In the court below it was said:\n'We take judicial knowledge of the history of the country and of current events, and from that source we know that conditions at the time of the enactment of the Bingham Act were such that the agricultural producers was at the mercy of speculators and others who fixed the price of the selling producer and ... the final consumer through combinations and other arrangements, whether valid or invalid, and that by reason thereof the former obtained a grossly inadequate price for his products. So much so was that the case that the intermediate handlers between the producer and the final consumer injuriously operated upon both classes and fattened and flourished at their expense. It was and is also a well-known fact that, without the agricultural producer, society could not exist, and the oppression brought about in the manner indicated was driving him from his farm, thereby creating a condition fully justifying an exception in his case from any provision of the common law, and likewise justifying legislative action in the exercise of its police power.'\n\n The Supreme Court of Alabama declared in Warren v. Alabama Farm Bureau Cotton Association (1925) 213 Ala. 61, 104 So. 264:\n'So far as we are advised, no American court has condemned a co- operative marketing contract of the character of this complainant association as injurious to the public interest, or in any way violative of public policy. On the contrary, such contracts have been everywhere upheld as valid, if not positively beneficial to the public interest.' \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 94]\n\u00a0\n In Arkansas Cotton Growers' Co-op. Ass'n v. Brown (1925) 168 Ark. 504, 270 S. W. 946, 1119, the court sustained a Co-operative Marketing Act ( Acts 1921, p. 153):\n\n'The statute seems to be in a form which has become standard, and has been enacted in many of the states, the enactment of such legislation being manifestly prompted by the universal urge to promote prosperity in agricultural pursuits. There has been much discussion of the plan in the decisions of the courts of the various states where it has been adopted, and the general view expressed is that the statute should be liberally construed in order to carry out the design in its broadest scope.'\n\n In Manchester Dairy System, Inc., v. Hayward (1926) 132 A. 12, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire said:\n'Co-operative marketing agreements, containing the essential features of the contract here considered, have been recognized in many of our states as a legitimate means of protecting its members against oppression, of avoiding the waste incident to the dumping of produce upon the market with the consequent wide fluctuations in prices and of securing to the producer a larger share of the price paid by the consumer for his products. Associations of the character here exist in practically all of our states and deal in nearly every form of agricultural product. From year to year the co-operative idea in marketing has been assuming wider scope and greater economic importance. Public approval of such co-operative organizations is evidenced by the adoption of enabling legislation in more than two- thirds of the states including our own. ... Such legislation has received liberal construction by the courts. Minn. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Huggins (162 Minn. 471) 203 N. W. 420 et seq. ... No sufficient ground appears from the record for holding that the contract here under consideration is contrary to public policy.' \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 95]\n\u00a0\n Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Ass'n v. Jones, 185 N. C. 265, 117 S. E. 174, 33 A. L. R. 231;\n\n'In view of the necessity of protecting those engaged in raising tobacco against the combination of those who buy the raw product at their own figures and sell it to the public at prices also fixed by themselves, this movements has been organized. By a careful examination of all the provisions of the act under which the association is acting, it will be seen that every precaution has been taken to insure that it will not be used for private gain, and can operate only for the protection of the producers.'\n\n Northern Wisconsin Co-operative Tobacco Pool v. Bekkedal, 182 Wis. 571, 197 N. W. 936:\n'The reasons for promoting such legislation are generally understood. It sprang from a general, if not well-nigh universal, belief that the present system of marketing is expensive and wasteful, and results in an unconscionable spread between what is paid the producer and that charged the consumer. It was for the purpose of encouraging efforts to bring about more direct marketing methods, thus benefiting both producer and consumer, and thereby promoting the general interest and the public welfare, that the legislation was enacted.'\n\n The purpose of the penalty clause (section 27) was pointed out by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in Dark Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Ass'n v. Dunn ( 1924) 150 Tenn. 614, 266 S. W. 308:\n'The complainant could not do business without tobacco. When it contracts to sell, it must fill its contracts with tobacco delivered by its members. It cannot replace defendant's tobacco by purchasing upon the open market. Its charter prohibits it from so doing. For each pound of tobacco which is not delivered to the association by a member, there is a pro rata increase in the operating costs of the association; and that increase cannot be estimated in terms of money with definite exactness. For every deflection of one member, there is a certain amount \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 96]\n\u00a0\n of dissatisfaction engendered among other members; indeed, other members are encouraged not to deliver their tobacco, and the normal increase of the association's members is prevented. All of these things result in damage, but the amount of damage cannot possibly be computed.'\n\n Other pertinent cases are assembled in margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The opinion generally accepted-and upon reasonable grounds, we think- is that the co-operative marketing statutes promote the common interest. The provisions for protecting the fundamental contracts against interference by outsiders are essential to the plan. This court has recognized as permissible some discrimination intended to encourage agriculture. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 21 S. Ct. 43; Cox v. Texas, \n202 \nU.S. 446\n, 26 S. Ct. 671. And in many cases it has affirmed the general power of the states, so to legislate as to meet a definitely threat- \n\n[276 U.S. 71, 97]\n\u00a0\n ened evil. International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, \n234 \nU.S. 199\n, 34 S. Ct. 859, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 525; Jones v. Union Guano Co., \n264 \nU.S. 171\n, 44 S. Ct. 280. Viewing all the circumstances, it is impossible for us to say that the Legislature of Kentucky could not treat marketing contracts between the association and its members as of a separate class, provide against probable interference therewith, and to that extent limit the sometime action of warehousemen.\n The liberty of contract guaranteed by the Constitution is freedom from arbitrary restraint-not immunity from reasonable regulation to safeguard the public interest. The question is whether the restrictions of the statute have reasonable relation to a proper purpose. Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 380\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160. A provision for a penalty to be received by the aggrieved party as punishment for the violation of a statute does not invalidate it. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v.

CO.(1928)\nNo. 171\nArgued: January 11, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Cowell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank M. Tracy, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59; Comp. St.  8657-8665) against the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Com- \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n pany, of Virginia, by Katherine Linstead, as executrix, to recover damages for the death of her husband, who was a conductor in the employ of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Company, known as the 'Big Four,' but who was working upon a freight train running upon the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company's tracks between Stevens, Ky., and Riverside, Ohio, near Cincinnati. The question in the case is, for whom he was working when he was killed, whether for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, the respondent, or the Big Four Company. He was one of a train crew of the Big Four Company, composed of an engineer, a conductor, and two brakemen. The Chesapeake & Ohio Company comes from the East to Cincinnati along the southern bank of the Ohio river, and crosses that river at Cincinnati. The Big Four Company has no line in Kentucky, but receives traffic and business from the Chesapeake & Ohio Company at Cincinnati, or near thereto on the north side of the river, delivering the traffic to the Northwest. The terminal yard, so called, of the Chesapeake & Ohio reaches from a station called Stevens, in Ky., for some 12 or 13 miles to Riverside, near Cincinnati, on the Ohio side, and in this 12 or 13 miles the Chesapeake & Ohio line passes five stations, called Brent, Altamont, Newport Waterworks, Brick House, and Cold Haven, and over an Ohio river bridge. It is convenient for both railroads in the interchange of traffic to make an arrangement by which the Big Four lends to the Chesapeake & Ohio a locomotive and caboose and a train crew to take the freight trains that come into Stevens, Ky., from the East, to the Big Four Company at Riverside, Ohio, over the rails of the Chesapeake & Ohio. The Chesapeake & Ohio does not pay the Big Four Company any rental for the lending of its locomotive and caboose and crew in this matter, but it pays the consideration by a reciprocal service rendered to the Big Four by a train \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n crew and locomotive and caboose of the Chesapeake & Ohio. When the Big Four train crew and locomotive and caboose run on the track of the Chesapeake & Ohio between Stevens and Riverside, near Cincinnati, they are furnished with time-tables and rule books of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. They are under the supervision and control, so far as their work is concerned, of the trainmaster of the Chesapeake & Ohio Company, whose jurisdiction reaches from Stevens to Riverside in the operation of the Chesapeake & Ohio road. The Big Four crew is not subject to discharge by any officer of the Chesapeake & Ohio road. In the operation of the train over the Chesapeake & Ohio line, they obey the signals of the switch tenders of that company and comply with the rules for operation on its line. The Big Four crew attends to nothing while on the Chesapeake & Ohio line but the train which it is sent over to Stevens to bring to the junction point at Riverside on the Ohio side. All of the members of the train crew, including the deceased, were paid by the Big Four Company.\n On the morning of the accident, Linstead, the deceased, as conductor, had brought over his crew with the Big Four locomotive and caboose to Stevens, had attached the locomotive and caboose to a train of cars containing 22 loads and 18 empties, and was proceeding to take them to Cincinnati and the junction with the Big Four road. The train had proceeded only a few miles on the Chesapeake & Ohio track, when it was overtaken and run into by a commutation passenger train of the Chesapeake & Ohio Company, running from Stevens to Cincinnati and back again. It was a train operated by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway for the convenience of early morning passengers, and was not on the timetable. It was called the 'Chippy.' Linstead was in the caboose at the rear of his freight train. The caboose was shattered to pieces and Linstead was killed. \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n The trial was had in the District Court in Kentucky, held at Covington, and in the charge the court used this language, which was duly excepted to:\n'First, under the evidence here, you are authorized to believe-you couldn't find otherwise-that the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway is a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce, carrying freight and passengers between the states.\n\n'Second, under the evidence you would be authorized to find-you couldn't find otherwise-that the defendant, her husband, on the occasion of the injury, was in the employ of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and engaged in interstate commerce work.'\n\n The result of the trial was a verdict for $16,500, upon which judgment was entered.\n By writ of error, the case was carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court, by per curiam, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The language of the court was:\n'We are unable effectively to distinguish the facts of this case from those of Hull v. Philadelphia, etc., Ry., \n252 \nU.S. 475\n, 40 S. Ct. 358, an opinion which apparently was not brought to the attention of the trial court.'\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was brought here by certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 690\n, 47 S. Ct. 472. The legal consequences of the relation between one in the general service of another who is in the special service of a third person are set forth in the case of Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, \n212 \nU.S. 215, 221\n, 29 S. Ct. 252. In that case the plaintiff was employed as a longshoreman by a master stevedore, who under contract with the defendant was engaged in loading a ship. The plaintiff was working in the hold, where, without fault on his part, he was struck and injured by a draft or load of cases containing oil, which was unexpectedly lowered from a winch, and the question presented was whether the winchman whose negligence \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n probably produced the injury was the servant of the owner of the ship or of the stevedore. After reference to the opinion of Chief Justice Shaw in the case of Farwell v. Boston & Worcester Railroad Corporation, 4 Metc. ( Mass.) 49, 38 Am. Dec. 339, this court said that the master was answerable for the wrongs of his servant, not because he had authorized them, nor because the servant in his negligent conduct represented the master, but because he was conducting the master's affairs, and the master was bound to see that his affairs were so conducted that others were not injured, and that this principle rested on the great principle of social duty adopted from general considerations of policy and security. The opinion continues:\n'The master's responsibility cannot be extended beyond the limits of the master's work. If the servant is doing his own work or that of some other, the master is not answerable for his negligence in the performance of it.\n\n'It sometimes happens that one wishes a certain work to be done for his benefit and neither has persons in his employ who can do it nor is willing to take such persons into his general service. He may then enter into an agreement with another. If that other furnishes him with men to do the work and places them under his exclusive control in the performance of it, those men became pro hac vice the servants of him to whom they are furnished. But, on the other hand, one may prefer to enter into an agreement with another that that other, for a consideration, shall himself perform the work through servants of his own selection, retaining the direction and control of them. In the first case, he to whom the workmen are furnished is responsible for their negligence in the conduct of the work, because the work is his work and they are for the time his workmen. In the second case, he who agrees to furnish the completed work through servants over whom he retains control is responsible for their negligence in the conduct of it, because, though it is \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 34]\n\u00a0\n done for the ultimate benefit of the other, it is still in its doing his own work. To determine whether a given case falls within the one class or the other we must inquire whose is the work being performed, a question which is usually answered by ascertaining who has the power to control and direct the servants in the performance of their work. Here we must carefully distinguish between authoritative direction and control, and mere suggestion as to details or the necessary cooperation, where the work furnished is part of a larger undertaking.'\n\n Now the work which was being done here by Linstead and his crew was the work of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. It was the transportation of cars, loaded and empty, on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway between Stevens and Cincinnati. It was work for which the Chesapeake & Ohio road was paid according to the tariff approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission; it was work done under the rules adopted by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company; and it was done under the immediate supervision and direction of the trainmaster in charge of the trains running from Stevens to Cincinnati, and that trainmaster was a superior employee of the Chesapeake & Ohio road. We do not think that the fact that the Big Four road paid the wages of Linstead and his crew, or that they could only be discharged or suspended by the Big Four, prevented their being the servants of the Chesapeake & Ohio Company for the performance of this particular job.\n The case of Hull v. Philadelphia & Reading Railway Co., \n252 \nU.S. 475\n, 40 S. Ct. 358, which controlled the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals, is to be distinguished from this. In that case, Hull, the plaintiff's deceased, was in the employ of the Western Maryland Railway Company as a brakeman and was killed. The Western Maryland Company was an interstate carrier operating a railway from Hagerstown, Md., to Lurgan, Pa., \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 35]\n\u00a0\n at which point it connected with a railway owned and operated by the defendant, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, which extended from Lurgan to Rutherford, in Pennsylvania. By arrangement between the two companies, through freight trains were operated from Hagerstown to Rutherford, one half over one line, and one half over the other, and each company ran its own locomotives and freight trains over the united line from Hagerstown to Rutherford, observing the rules of each company on its respective line. It was held that Hull was not a servant of the Philadelphia & Reading Company, by which he was killed, but only the servant of the Western Maryland Company. That was because the work which Hull was doing was the work of the Western Maryland Company, even though it was carried on for a part of the way over the rails of the Philadelphia & Reading Company. The locomotive belonged to the Western Maryland Company, the cars belonged to the Western Maryland Company and the loads that were carried were being carried for the Western Maryland Company, and presumably the rates which were received for the transportation were the receipts of the Western Maryland Company. In other words, the whole line between Hagerstown and Rutherford was exactly as if it had been jointly owned by the two companies, and jointly used by them for their freight trains. Therefore the work was done by the Western Maryland for itself and the mere transfer of the train owned by the Western Maryland and operated by it on to the rails of the Philadelphia & Reading Railway did not transfer the relation of the deceased from the general employment of the Western Maryland to a special employment by the Philadelphia & Reading as another master.\n In the present case there was such a transfer and the line over which the transportation was effected and on which the work of transportation was done by the de- \n\n[276 U.S. 28, 36]\n\u00a0\n ceased was the line of the Chesapeake & Ohio, which was master and remained in charge of the operation, with the immediate supervision of the Big Four crew which was lent for the very purpose of doing the work of the Chesapeake & Ohio.\n For these reasons, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the judgment of the District Court of Kentucky restored. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLONG v. ROCKWOOD(1928)\nNo. 201\nArgued: January 20, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. F. Delano Putnam, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.[ Long v. Rockwood \n277 U.S. 142\n (1928) ]\n\n\n[277 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Merrill S. June and Thomas H. Gage, both of Worcester, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes present the question whether the state of Massachusetts may tax, as income, royalties received by one of her citizens for the use of patents issued to him by the United States. The Supreme Judicial Court of that state held such an imposition would amount to a tax upon the patent right itself, and was prohibited by the Federal Constitution. 257 Mass. 572, 154 N. E. 182. We agree with that conclusion.\n The Constitution (article 1,  8) empowers Congress 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. ...' The first Congress provided for issuance, in the name of the United States, of letters patent granting 'for any term not exceeding fourteen years, the sole and exclusive right and liberty of making, constructing, using and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery. ...' Act April 10, 1790,  1, c. 7, 1 Stat. 110.\n Chapter 230, Act July 8, 1870, 16 Stat. 201 (Rev. Stat.  4884; section 40, Title 35, U. S. Code (35 USCA  43; Comp. St.  9428)):\n'Sec. 22. And be it further enacted, that every patent shall contain a short title or description of the invention or discovery, correctly indicating its nature and design, and a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for the term of seventeen years, of the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the said invention or discovery throughout the United States and the territories thereof. ...'\n\n Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 220, 241, 242 (8 L. Ed. 376), stated the general purpose for which patents issue-\n'To promote the progress of useful arts, is the interest and policy of every englightened government. ... The subject was among the first which followed the organization of our government. It was taken up by the first congress. ... The amendatory act of 1793 (1 Stat. 318) contains the same language, and it cannot be doubted, that the settled purpose of the United States has ever been, and continues to be, to confer on the authors of useful inventions an exclusive right in their inventions, for the time mentioned in their patent. It is the reward stipulated for the advantages derived by the public for the exertions of the individual, and is intended as a stimulus to those exertions. The laws which are passed to give effect to this purpose ought, we think, to be construed in the spirit in which they have been made. ... The public yields \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n nothing which it has not agreed to yield; it receives all which it has contracted to receive. ...'\n\n Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 327, 328 (16 L. Ed. 165):\n'It is undeniably true, that the limited and temporary monopoly granted to inventors was never designed for their exclusive profit or advantage; the benefit to the public or community at large was another and doubtless the primary object in granting and securing that monopoly.'\n\n Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549 (14 L. Ed. 532):\n'The franchise which the patent grants, consists altogether in the right to exclude every one from making, using, or vending the thing patented, without the permission of the patentee. This is all that he obtains by the patent.'\n\n See, also, Paper Bag Patent Case, \n210 \nU.S. 405, 423\n, 28 S. Ct. 748; Bauer v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 33 S., S. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150.\n The power to exclude others, granted by the United States to the patentee, subserves a definite public purpose-to promote the progress of science and useful arts. The patent is the instrument by which that end is to be accomplished. It affords protection during the specified period in consideration of benefits conferred by the inventor. And the settled doctrine is that such instrumentalities may not be taxed by the states.\n In California v. Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1\n, 8 S. Ct. 1073, the state sought to sustain a tax laid upon a franchise granted by the United States; but its power therein was denied. Through Mr. Justice Bradley this court said:\n'Recollecting the fundamental principle that the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States are the supreme law of the land, it seems to us almost absurd to contend that a power given to a person or corporation by the United States may be subjected to taxation by a state.'\n\n The same general doctrine was approved by McCullouch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503\n, 27 S. Ct. 571; Farmers, etc., Bank v. Min- \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n nesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516\n, 34 S.

Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S. Ct. 243; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S.

Wisconsin (November 21, 1927) \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55.\n The courts of last resort in Pennsylvania and New York have held that a state may not tax patents granted by the United States. Commonwealth v. Westinghouse Elec. Mfg. Co., 151 Pa. 265, 24 A. 1107, 1113; People, etc., v. Assessors, 156 N. Y. 417, 51 N. E. 269, 42 L. R. A. 290. And no opinion to the contrary has been cited.\n As United States patents grant only the right to exclude, our conclusion is not in conflict with those cases which sustain the power of the states to exercise control over articles manufactured by patentees, to regulate the assignment of patent rights, and to prevent fraud in connection therewith. Patterson v. Kentucky, \n97 U.S. 501\n; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n; Allen v. Riley, \n203 \nU.S. 347\n, 27 S. Ct. 95, 8 Ann. Cas. 137; John Woods & Sons Co. v. Carl, \n203 \nU.S. 358\n, 27 S. Ct. 99; Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County National Bank, \n207 \nU.S. 251\n, 28 S. Ct. 89.\n The challenged judgments are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n These are complaints brought by the respondent against the commissioner of corporations and taxation of Massachusetts, for the abatement of income taxes for the years 1921 and 1922. The question raised, as stated by the Supreme Judicial Court of the state, is whether the commonwealth has the right to tax the income received from royalties for the use of patents issued by the United States. That court held that the commonwealth had no such right under the Constitution of the United States, \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n and the commissioner obtained a writ of certiorari from this court.\n The reasoning of the court is simple. If the state 'cannot tax the patent, it cannot tax the royalties received from its use.' The postulate is founded on the casual intimation of Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 432, and is said to have been conceded below by the commissioner. It hardly is conceded here, and whether it is or is not, if this court should be of opinion that the conclusion urged by the commissioner can be supported upon broader grounds than he felt at liberty to take, the court is not estopped by his doubts. Why then cannot a state tax a patent by a tax that in no way discriminates against it? Obviously it is not true that patents are instrumentalities of the government. They are used by the patentees for their private advantage alone. If the government uses them, it must pay like other people. Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States (Jan. 3, 1928) \n275 \nU.S. 331\n, 48 S. Ct. 194. The use made by the patentee may be not to make and sell the patented article, but simply to keep other people from doing so in aid of some collateral interest of his own. Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., \n210 \nU.S. 405, 422\n, 424 S., 28 S. Ct. 748. National banks really are instrumentalities of the government and directly concern the national credit. Indians are wards of the nation. Interstate commerce is left expressly to regulation by Congress, and the states can intermeddle only by its consent. In this case the advantages expected by the government are mainly the benefits to the public when the patent has expired, and, secondarily, the encouragement of invention. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 19. The most that can be said is that a tax is a discouragement so far as it goes, and to that extent in its immediate operation runs counter to the government intent. But patents would be valueless to their owner without the organized societies constituted by the \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n states, and the question is why patents should not contribute as other property does to maintaining that without which they would be of little use.\n Most powers conceivably may be exercised beyond the limits allowed by the law. Rights that even seem absolute have these qualifications. American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, \n256 \nU.S. 350, 358\n, 41 S. Ct. 499. But we do not on that account resort to the blunt expedient of taking away altogether the power or the right. Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 247\n, 248 S., 25 S. Ct. 637. The power to tax is said to be the power to destroy. But, to repeat what I just now have had occasion to say in another case, this court, which so often has defeated the attempt to tax in certain ways, can defeat an attempt to discriminate or otherwise to go too far without wholly abolishing the power to tax. The power to fix rates is the power to destroy, but this court, while it endeavors to prevent confiscation, does not prevent the fixing of rates. Even with regard to patents some laws of a kind that might destroy the use of them within the state have been upheld. Patterson v. Kentucky, \n97 U.S. 501\n; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 \nU.S. 296\n, 15 S. Ct. 367. They must be reasonable, or they will be held void, but, if this court deems them reasonable, they stand. Allen v. Riley, \n203 \nU.S. 347, 355\n, 27 S. Ct. 95, 8 Ann. Cas. 137.\n The fact that the franchise came from a grant by the United States is no more reason for exemption, standing by itself, than is the derivation of the title to a lot of land from the same source. Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527. In Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 50, the land was conveyed subject to a condition that a dry dock should be built upon it which the United States was to have the right to use free from charge for docking, and which was to revert to the United States on a diversion of the land to any other use or on \n\n[277 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n the dry dock being unfit for use for six months, certainly a case in which the United States was much more clearly interested that in an ordinary patent. Yet there it was held that neither the company nor the land was an instrumentality of the United States, and that there was nothing to hinder the right of the state to tax. See further Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice STONE agree with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLONGEST v. LANGFORD(1928)\nNo. 52\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. H. A. Ledbetter, of Ardmore, Okl., for petitioner.\n Messrs. S. R. Bowen, of Washington, D. C., and W. F. Semple, of Durant, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A claim to an estate by the curtesy in lands allotted and patented in the name and right of a Choctaw woman then deceased is here in controversy. It was sustained by the state court. 114 Okl. 50, 242 P. 569. The allotment was made and the patent issued under two agreements between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes. Act June 28, 1898, c. 517,  29, 30 Stat. 505; Act July 1, 1902, c. 1362, 32 Stat. 641.\n The agreements set forth a comprehensive scheme for allotting the lands of the two tribes in severalty among \n\n[276 U.S. 69, 70]\n\u00a0\n their members, distributing the tribal funds and dissolving the tribes. There were also many other related provisions. Nothing was said about curtesy. The agreements were strictly special laws for the Choctaws and Chickasaws.\n By prior enactments couched in general terms Congress had put in force in the Indian Territory, and made applicable to the people therein irrespective of race, several statutes of Arkansas. \n1\n One of these Arkansas statutes-chapter 20 of Mansfield's Digest-had been construed as recognizing a form of curtesy consummate attaching on the death of the wife intestate where she was then seized of the land. Another-chapter 49 of the same publication-related to descent and distribution. The Choctaw and Chickasaw lands were in the Indian Territory, and so were the lands of several other Indian tribes. The claim in this case is rested on the adopted Arkansas law of curtesy.\n The second of the two agreements-it largely superseded the first- required that the lands of the two tribes be allotted among the enrolled members who were living at the date of its ratification. Anticipating that some of these might die before the allotments were made, the agreement provided in section 22 (32 Stat. 643):\n'If any person whose name appears upon the rolls, prepared as herein provided, shall have died subsequent to the ratification of this agreement and before receiving his allotment of land the lands to which such person would have been entitled if living shall be allotted in his name, and shall, together with his proportionate share of other tribal property, descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution as provided in chapter forty-nine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas.' \n\n[276 U.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n The lands in dispute were allotted under that section, and the real controversy here is over its construction. It is part of a special law put in force with the solicited assent of the Choctaws and Chickasaws and applicable only to them. We think it would be understood by the Indians as meaning that lands allotted under it in the name of a deceased member should pass to those who would be his or her heirs according to chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest. With that chapter specially designated and chapter 20-the sole basis of the Arkansas law of curtesy-not mentioned the Indians certainly would not understand that curtesy was intended. It follows that section 22 must be construed as intended to pass the full title free from any claim to curtesy. Marlin v. Lewallen, \n276 \nU.S. 58\n, 48 S.

St. Supp. 1928,  9377as-1, 9377a-2, a copy of which will be found in the margin. \n1\n The act provides that every pharmacy or drug store shall be owned only by a licensed pharmacist, and, in the case of corporations, associations and co- \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n partnerships, requires that all the partners or members thereof shall be licensed pharmacists, with the exception that such corporations as are already organized and existing and duly authorized and empowered to do business in the state and own and conduct drug stores or pharmacies, and associations and partnerships, which, at the time of the passage of the act, still own and conduct drug stores or pharmacies, may continue to own and conduct the same.\n The appellant is a Massachusetts corporation authorized to do business in Pennsylvania. At the time of the passage of the act, appellant was empowered to own and conduct and owned and thereafter continued to own and operate a number of pharmacies or drug stores at various places within the latter state. After the passage of the act, appellant purchased and took possession of two addi- \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n tional drug stores in that state and carried on and continues and intends to continue a carry on a retail drug business therein under the title of 'drug store' or 'pharmacy,' including the compounding, dispensing, preparation and sale at retail of drugs, medicines, etc. The business was and is carried on through pharmacists employed by appellant and duly registered in accordance with the statutes of the state. All of the members (stockholders) of the appellant corporation are not registered pharmacists, and, in accordance with the provisions of the act, the Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy has refused to grant appellant a permit to carry on the business. It further appears that the state Attorney General and the district attorney of the proper county have threatened and intend to and will prosecute appellant for its violation of the act, the penalties for which are severe and cumulative. Suit was brought to enjoin these officers from putting into effect their threats, upon the ground that the act in question contravenes the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is clear from the pleadings and the record, and it is conceded, that if the act be unconstitutional as claimed, appellant is entitled to the relief prayed. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 215\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764.\n The court below, composed of three judges, heard the case upon the pleadings, affidavits and an agreed statement of facts, and rendered a decree denying a preliminary injunction and, upon the agreed submission of the case, a final decree dismissing the bill for want of equity. (D. C.) 22 F.(2d) 993. The statute was held constitutional upon the ground that there was a substantial relation to the public interest in the ownership of a drug store where prescriptions were compounded. In support of this conclusion, the court said that medicines must be in the store before they can be dispensed; that what is there is dic- \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 111]\n\u00a0\n tated not by the judgment of the pharmacist buy by those who have the financial control of the business; that the Legislature may have thought that a corporate owner in purchasing drugs might give greater regard to price than the quality, and that if such was the thought of the Legislature the court would not undertake to say that it was without a valid connection with the public interest and so unreasonable as to render the statute invalid.\n That appellant's business is a property right (Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375), and as such entitled to protection against state legislation in contravention of the federal Constitution, is, of course, clear. That a corporation is a 'person' within the meaning of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that a foreign corporation permitted to do business in a state may not be subjected to state statutes in conflict with the federal Constitution, is equally well settled. Kentucky Co. v. Paramount Exch., \n262 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 43 S. Ct. 636; Power Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 496 S., 497, 47 S. Ct. 678; Frost Trucking Co. v. R. R. Com., \n271 U.S. 583\n, 594 et seq., 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457. And, unless justified as a valid exercise of the police power, the act assailed must be declared unconstitutional because the enforcement thereof will deprive appellant of its property without due process of law.\n The act is sought to be sustained specifically upon the ground that it is reasonably calculated to promote the public health; and the determination we are called upon to make is whether the act has a real and substantial relation to that end or is a clear and arbitrary invasion of appellant's property rights guaranteed by the Constitution. See Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 173\n, 174 S., 28 S. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S. Ct. 273. The police power may be exerted in the form of state legislation where otherwise the effect may be to invade rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment only when such legislation bears \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 112]\n\u00a0\n a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare. Here the pertinent question is: What is the effect of mere ownership of a drug store in respect of the public health?\n A state undoubtedly may regulate the prescription, compounding of prescriptions, purchase and sale of medicines, by appropriate legislation to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the public health. And this the Pennsylvania Legislature sought to do by various statutory provisions in force long before the enactment of the statute under review. Briefly stated, these provisions are: No one but a licensed physician may practice medicine or prescribe remedies for sickness;2 no one but a registered pharmacist lawfully may have charge of a drug store;3 every drug store must itself be registered, and this can only be done where the management is in charge of a registered pharmacist;4 stringent provision is made to prevent the possession or sale of any impure drug or any below the standard, strength, quality and purity as determined by the recognized pharmacopoeia of the United States;5 none but a registered pharmacist is permitted to compound physician's prescriptions;6 and finally, the supervision of the foregoing matters and the enforcement of the laws in respect thereof are in the hands of the State Board of Pharmacy, which is given broad powers for these purposes.\n It therefore, will be seen that without violating laws, the validity of which is conceded, the owner of a drug store, whether a registered pharmacist or not, cannot purchase or dispense impure or inferior medicines; he cannot, \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 113]\n\u00a0\n unless he be a licensed physician, prescribe for the sick; he cannot unless be he a registered pharmacist, have charge of a drug store or compound a prescription. Thus, it would seem, every point at which the public health is likely to be injuriously affected by the act of the owner in buying, compounding, or selling drugs and medicines is amply safeguarded.\n The act under review does not deal with any of the things covered by the prior statutes above enumerated. It deals in terms only with ownership. It plainly forbids the exercise of an ordinary property right and, on its face, denies what the Constitution guarantees. A state cannot, 'under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them'. Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 \nU.S. 504, 513\n, 44 S. Ct. 412, 413 (68 L. Ed. 813, 32 A. L. R. 661). See, also, Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 400 S., 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A. L. R. 1446; Norfolk Ry. v. Public Serv. Comm., \n265 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 44 S. Ct. 439; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 534\n, 535 S., 45 S. Ct. 571, 39 A. L. R. 468; Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., \n270 U.S. 402\n, 412-415, 46 S. Ct. 320; Fairmont Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 U.S. 1\n, 9-11, 47 S. Ct. 506, 52 A. L. R. 163.\n In the light of the various requirements of the Pennsylvania statutes, it is made clear, if it were otherwise doubtful, that mere stock ownership in a corporation, owning and operation a drug store, can have no real or substantial relation to the public health; and that the act in question creates an unreasonable and unnecessary restriction upon private business. No facts are presented by the record, and, so far as appears, none was presented to the Legislature which enacted the statute, that properly could give rise to a different conclusion. It is a matter of public notoriety that chain drug stores in great numbers, owned and operated by corporations, are to be found throughout the United States. They have been in operation for many years. We take judicial notice of the fact \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 114]\n\u00a0\n that the stock in these corporations is bought and sold upon the various stock exchanges of the country and, in the nature of things, must be held and owned to a large extent by persons who are not registered pharmacists. If detriment to the public health thereby has resulted or is threatened, some evidence of it ought to be forthcoming. None has been produced, and, so far as we are informed, either by the record or outside of it, none exists. The claim, that mere ownership of a drug store by one not a pharmacist bears a reasonable relation to the public health, finally rests upon conjecture, unsupported by anything of substance. This is not enough; and it becomes our duty to declare the act assailed to be unconstitutional as in contravention of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n A standing criticism of the use of corporations in business is that it causes such business to be owned by people who do not know anything about it. Argument has not been supposed to be necessary in order to show that the divorce between the power of control and knowledge is an evil. The selling of drugs and poisons calls for knowledge in a high degree, and Pennsylvania after enacting a series of other safeguards has provided that in that matter the divorce shall not be allowed. Of course, notwithstanding the requirement that in corporations hereafter formed all the stockholders shall be licensed pharmacists, it still would be possible for a stockholder to content himself with drawing dividends and to taken no hand in the company's affairs. But obviously he would be more likely to observe the business with an intelligent eye than a casual investor who looked only to the standing of the \n\n[278 U.S. 105, 115]\n\u00a0\n stock in the market. The Constitution does not make it a condition of preventive legislation that it should work a perfect cure. It is enough if the questioned act has a manifest tendency to cure or act least to make the evil less. It has been recognized by the professions, by statutes and by decisions that a corporation offering professional services is not placed beyond legislative control by the fact that all the services in question are rendered by qualified members of the profession. See People v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co., 227 N. Y. 366, 125 N. E. 666; Tucker v. New York State Board of Pharmacy, 127 Misc. Rep. 538, 217 N. Y. S. 217, 220; Matter of Co-operative Law Co., 198 N.

Carl Schonert & Sons, 95 N. J. Eq. 12, 122 A. 307; Hodgen v. Commonwealth, 142 Ky. 722, 135 S. W. 311.\n But for decisions to which I bow I should not think any conciliatory phrase necessary to justify what seems to me one of the incidents of legislative power. I think however that the police power as that term has been defined and explained clearly extends to a law like this, whatever I may think of its wisdom, and that the decree should be affirmed.\n Of course the appellant cannot complain of the exception in its favor that allows it to continue to own and conduct the drug stores that it now owns. The Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have to beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and those of a later time. Sperry & Hutchinson Co. v. Rhodes, \n220 \nU.S. 502, 505\n, 31 S. Ct. 490.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1.

COLEMAN(1928)\nNo. 70\nArgued: February 29, 1928Decided: April 30, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Matthew O'Doherty, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Clifford E. Smith, of Frankfort, Ky., and Swager Sherley, of Washington, D. Cl., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, a Kentucky corporation, executed a deed of trust of property in that state to secure bonds amounting in the aggregate to $150,000,000, of which $18,805,000 were issued, bearing date November 1, 1922, and maturing November 1, 1952. The deed was presented to the clerk of the Jefferson county court for record and payment made of the lawful recording fee required by the state statute, but the clerk refused to record the deed unless plaintiff in error paid to him a tax of 20 cents on each $100 of the $18,805,000, as required by section 4019a9 of the Kentucky Statutes, Carroll's Edition 1922, the pertinent portions of which follow:\n'A tax of twenty cents (20) is hereby imposed upon each one hundred dollars ($100.00) or fraction thereof of indebtedness which is, or may be, in any contingency secured by any mortgage of property in this state, which mortgage shall be lodged for record after this act goes into effect where the indebtedness does not mature within five years. ...\n\n'... Provided, however, the provisions of this section shall not apply to mortgages executed to building and loan associations.'\n\n It is provided by another Kentucky statute that no deed or deed of trust or mortgage shall be valid against a purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice thereof or against creditors until such deed or mortgage shall be lodged for record. Ky. Stats.  496. In view of this statute, plaintiff in error concluded that it was absolutely necessary to place the deed of trust of record, \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n and thereupon, unwillingly and under protest, paid the amount demanded in addition to the lawful recording fee.\n Subsequently, plaintiff in error brought this action in the proper state court to recover the amount of the tax so paid upon the ground that the quoted provisions of section 4019a9 were contrary to the Kentucky Constitution requiring uniformity of taxes upon all property of the same class, and upon the further ground that these provisions denied the equal protection of the law and deprived plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution. A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the court of first instance, and the petition dismissed. Upon appeal to the state Court of Appeals, the judgment was affirmed, sub nom. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Shanks, Auditor, 213 Ky. 762, 281 S. W. 1017. upon the authority of Middendorf v. Goodale, 202 Ky. 118, 259 S. W. 59.\n The state Court of Appeals, in disposing of the contention that the statute violated the state Constitution, held that the tax imposed was not a property tax but a privilege tax; that is, a tax imposed upon the privilege of recording mortgages, etc., the payment of which, it was said, was entirely optional with the owners or holders thereof. This determination of the state court, in so far as it affects the challenge under the state Constitution, we accept as conclusive, in accordance with the well-settled rule. Merchants' & Mfrs. Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 462\n, 17 S. Ct. 829. But the state court further held that the statute was not in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and this presents a different question calling for our independent consideration and decision.\n The contention on behalf of plaintiff in error is that the equal protection clause is contravened by the provisions exempting from the operation of the tax, first, indebtedness which does not mature within five years; \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n and, second, mortgages executed to building and loan associations.\n The equal protection clause, like the due process of law clause, is not susceptible of exact delimitation. No definite rule in respect of either, which automatically will solve the question in specific instances, can be formulated. Certain general principles, however, have been established, in the light of which the cases as they arise are to be considered. In the first place, it may be said generally that the equal protection clause means that the rights of all persons must rest upon the same rule under similar circumstances, Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 337\n, 6 S. Ct. 57; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 18 S. Ct. 594, and that it applies to the exercise of all the powers of the state which can affect the individual or his property, including the power of taxation, County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pac. R. Co. (C. C.) 18 F. 385, 388-399; Railroad Tax Cases (C. C.) 13 F. 722, 733. It does not, however, forbid classification; and the power of the state to classify for purposes of taxation is of wide range and flexibility provided always that the classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 560, 561 (64 L. Ed. 989); Air-way Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 45 S. Ct. 12; Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224. That is to say, mere difference is not enough; the attempted classification 'must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.' Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 17 S. Ct. 255, 257 (41 L. Ed. 666). Discriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n provision. Compare Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 27 S. Ct. 440; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Ct. 533.\n While, for the purpose of determining whether the statute assailed violates the federal Constitution, we are not bound by the characterization of the tax by the state court, St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S. Ct. 125, the matter is here of little importance. The application of the equal protection clause does not depend upon what name is given to the tax. Whether the tax now in question be called a privilege tax or a property tax, it falls in effect upon one indebtedness and not upon another where the sum of each is the same; where both are incurred by corporations or both by natural persons; where the percentage of interest to be paid is the same; where the mortgage security is identical in all respects; where, in short, the only difference well may be that one is payable in 60 months and the other in 59 months. No doubt the state may take into consideration as an element in fixing the amount of the as an element in fixing the amount of the to be paid; for, since the tax is a flat sum covering the entire life of the lien, the privilege of recording the short-time lien and that of recording the long-time lien have different taxable values. But classification good for one purpose may be bad for another; and it does not follow that, because the state may classify for the purpose of proportioning the tax it may adopt the same classification to the end that some shall bear a burden of taxation from which others under circumstances identical in all respects save in respect of the matter of value, are entirely exempt.\n Here it seems clear that a circumstance which affects only taxable values has been made the basis of a classification under which one is compelled to pay a tax for the enjoyment of a necessary privilege which, aside from the amount of the recording fee which is paid by each, is \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n furnished to another as a pure gratuity. Such a classification is arbitrary. It bears no reasonable or just relation to the intended result of the legislation. The difference relied upon is no more substantial, as the sole basis for the present classification, than a difference in value between two similar pieces of land would be if invoked as the sole basis for a like classification in respect of such property. Certainly one who is secured by the state in the priority of his lien for a period less than five years enjoys a privilege which in kind and character fairly cannot be distinguished from a like privilege enjoyed by another for a longer period of time. The former reasonably may be required to pay proportionately less than the latter; but to exact, as the price of a privilege which, for obvious reasons neither safely can forego, a tax from the latter not imposed in any degree upon the former produces an obvious and gross inequality. If the state, upon the same classification, had reversed the process and taxed indebtedness maturing within a shorter period than five years, and exempted such as matured in a longer period, the inequality probably would be readily conceded, but the constitutional infirmity, though more strikingly apparent, would have been the same.\n We are not dealing with a charge made for services rendered or a fee for regulation, but a tax in the strict sense of the term. It is said that it is a tax upon a privilege which the owner or holder of the instrument creating a lien is free to accept or reject. But for practical purposes there is not such option, for, as this court recently held, there is a practical necessity to record such instruments because, if not recorded, the statute overrides them in favor of purchasers without notice and creditors; and the choice is like one made under duress. 'The state is not bound to furnish a registry, but, if it sees fit to do so, it cannot use its control as a means to impose a liability that it cannot impose directly, any more than it can es- \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n cape its constitutional obligations by denying jurisdiction to its courts in cases which those courts are otherwise competent to entertain. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the World, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 371, 10 A. L. R. 716.' Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374, 377\n, 378 S., 43 S. Ct. 385, 386 (67 L. Ed. 703, 29 A. L. R. 1).\n The exemption of building and loan associations from the operation of the tax is a different matter. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude a state in imposing taxes from making exemptions, provided the power is not exercised arbitrarily. It may exempt the property of churches, charitable institutions, and the like; and it does not admit of fair doubt that, under the circumstances disclosed by the opinion of the court below in the Middendorf Case, it has lawfully exempted building and loan associations. That court points out that a building and loan association under the Kentucky statutes must receive payments from members only and make loans to members only, in pursuance of a plan set forth. Money accumulated is to be loaned to members according to a rule of priority. The essential principle of such an association is mutuality. The purpose of the statute, the court below says, was to provide the members of the associations with the means of borrowing money for the acquisition of homes, in recognition of the duty of the state to encourage the acquisition of homes by its citizens. Such associations are also placed by the state statute in a separate class for purposes of ad valorem taxation. It is made clear by the lower court that the purpose of the exemption was to enable these associations, by relieving them of a burden, more completely to carry out the quasi public purpose which the Legislature designed in providing for their creation. This exemption, therefore, must be upheld; but, since the effect of the exemption first considered is to deny plaintiff in error the equal protection of the law in violation of the \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n equality provision of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court below erred in sustaining the validity of the tax and affirming the action of the trial court in dismissing the petition.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n When a legal distinction is determined, as no one doubts that it may be, between night and day, childhood and maturity, or any other extremes, a point has to be fixed or a line has to be drawn, or gradually picked out by successive decisions, to mark where the change takes place. Looked at by itself without regard to the necessity behind it the line or point seems arbitrary. It might as well or nearly as well be a little more to one side or the other. But when it is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the Legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.\n There is a plain distinction between large loans secured by negotiable bonds and mortgages that easily escape taxation, and small ones to needy borrowers for which they give their personal note for a short term and a mortgage of their house. I hardly think it would be denied that the large transactions of the money market reasonably may be subjected to a tax from which small ones for private need are exempted. The Legislature of Kentucky after careful consideration has decided that the distinction is clearly marked when the loan is for so long a term as five years. Whatever doubt I may feel, I certainly cannot say that it is wrong. If it is right as to the \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n run of cases a possible exception here and there would not make the law bad. All taxes have to be laid by general rules.\n I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice SANFORD, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting.\n Pursuant to power conferred by the Constitution of Kentucky, its Legislature imposed a recording tax of 20 cents per $100 upon mortgages given to secure loans which do not mature within five years from the date of the mortgage. The statute discriminates between long and short term loans as subjects of taxation. A loan maturing in 60 months or more would be subject to the tax, whereas one maturing in 59 months or less, but otherwise similar in all respects would not be. The distinction between long-term and short-term loans-with differences in yield for securities otherwise identical in character-is one familiar to American investment bankers and their clients. Did the Kentucky Legislature, in adopting that classification for purposes of the mortgage recording tax, exceed the bounds of that 'wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation' which this court sanctions, as declared in Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, \n271 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 46 S. Ct. 627 (70 L. Ed. 1093), so long as the state 'refrains from clear and hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes'?\n Classifications based solely on factual differences no greater than that between a loan maturing in 59 months or less and one maturing in 60 months or more, have been sustained in many fields of legislation. \n1\n In Citizens' Tele- \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n phone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 329\n, 33 S. Ct. 833, it was said that in taxation there is a broader power of classification than in some other exercises of legislation. The cases dealing specifically with classification for purpose of taxation, on a basis similar to that here employed, are not discussed in the opinion of the court, and only one of them is cited. It seems desirable to call attention to some of them, as the rule which they declare is embodied in the tax systems of the nation and of many states. \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 44]\n\u00a0\n In Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 299\n, 300 S., 18 S. Ct. 594, the inheritance tax, in the case of strangers to the blood, exempted estates of $500, but did not allow that exemption to larger estates. \n2\n Moreover, it prescribed \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 45]\n\u00a0\n progressive rates, rising in steps with the amount of the gift and applying to the entire gift and not merely to the excess. \n3\n Under the law a legatee of $10,000 being subject to a 3 per cent. tax, would receive net $ 9,700, whereas a legatee of $10,001, being subject to a 4 per cent. tax on the entire legacy, would receive net only $9,600.96. The court held the classification reasonable, saying:\n'The condition is not arbitrary because it is determined by that value (of the inheritance); it is not unequal in operation because it does not levy the same percentage on every dollar; does not fail to treat 'all alike under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privilege conferred and the liabilities imposed.' The jurisdiction of courts is fixed by amounts. The right of appeal is. As was said at bar, the Congress of the United States has classified the right of suitors to come into the United States courts by amounts. Regarding these alone, there is the same inequality that is urged against classification of the Illinois law. All license laws and all specific taxes have in them an element of inequality, nevertheless they are universally imposed, and their legality has never been questioned.'\n\n The court has likewise sustained a statute which imposed an ad valorem tax upon telephone companies with annual earnings of $500 or more, while exempting others similarly situated whose earnings were less than $ 500, Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 329\n, 33 S. Ct. 833; a statute which imposed a license fee upon 'all persons' \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 46]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the laundry business, but exempted concerns employing not more than two women, and steam laundries, Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 32 S. Ct. 192;4 an ordinance under which a $5 tax was laid upon merchants whose gross sales were $1,000, and a tax of $10 upon those similarly situated whose sales were $1,001, Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329, 331\n, 22 S. Ct. 382;5 an ordinance which laid a tax of $1,000 upon theaters whose admission was $1 or more, but only $ 400 upon those similarly situated whose admission prices were less than $1 and more than 50 cents, Metropolis Theater Co. v. Chicago, \n228 U.S. 61\n, 69-70, 33 S. Ct. 441.6\n In the light of these decisions, I should have supposed the validity of the classification made by the Legislature of Kentucky to be clear. Recognizing that members of \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 47]\n\u00a0\n the Legislature of the state which made the classification, and members of the court which sanctioned it, necessarily possessed greater knowledge of local conditions and needs than is possible for us, I should have assumed that this classification, which obviously is not invidious, was a reasonable one, unless some facts were adduced to show that it was arbitrary. Compare Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 255\n, 43 S. Ct. 83; State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckbach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S. Ct. 630. No such facts have been adduced by the company. On the other hand, facts called to our attention by counsel for the Commonwealth, and of which we may take judicial notice, New Mexico ex rel. McLean v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 38, 50\n, 27 S. Ct. 1; Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 61\n, 35 S. Ct. 501, show that the classification was adopted by the Legislature of Kentucky in an effort to equalize the tax burden incident to loans.\n The mortgage recording tax is a feature of the revenue system of at least nine states. \n7\n Its purpose in all is substantially the same-to supply an effective means for reaching this form of intangible property, which is likely to evade taxation under the general property tax. The recording tax is commonly accompanied either by a complete exemption of mortgage securities from other property taxation or, as in Kentucky, by exemption of such \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 48]\n\u00a0\n securities from local taxation alone. As imposed in Alabama and New York, the states which first adopted it, the tax is levied at the same rate irrespective of the length of the loan. The obvious unfairness of such an arrangement, both to the short-term borrower and to the state, has been one of the chief objections to adoption of the tax. \n8\n Other states, impressed with the general efficiency of the tax, have attempted to eliminate the unfairness produced by the flat rate. Thus, in Oklahoma, the rates are 2 cents per $100 for loans of less than 2 years, 4 cents where the loan is for 2 years or more, 6 cents where for 3 or more, 8 cents where for 4 or more, and 10 cents where for 5 or more. \n9\n In South Dakota, the tax was 10 cents per $100 per year or fraction thereof, with a proviso that in no event should the tax be more than 50 cents per $100. 10 Such taxes obviate only in part the objection urged against the flat rate tax; namely, that mortgages for a long term are taxed proportionally at a lower rate than those for a short. In Minnesota, which had originally enacted the flat rate tax,11 a different expedient was devised. In 1913 it was provided that the tax should be 15 cents per $100 unless the loan was for more than 5 \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 49]\n\u00a0\n years, in which event the tax was to be 25 cents. \n12\n In Minnesota the discrimination between long and short term securities is thus 10 cents per $ 100; in Kentucky it is 20 cents. But the distinction and the reasons for it are substantially the same.\n The mortgage recording tax adopted in Kentucky only after the most serious consideration. It was part of the general system of taxation enacted in 1917 after investigations by two special tax commissions appointed to inquire into the particular needs of the state. In the reports of both commissions, the fact that theretofore mortgage loans had largely escaped taxation was a subject of much consideration. \n13\n The first commission, which was appointed in 1912, submitted a preliminary report recommending an amendment to the state Constitution so as to permit the classification of property for purposes of taxation and the application of different methods of taxation to different classes. The amendment proposed was submitted to the people and adopted. Kentucky Constitution,  171. In December, 1913, the commission submitted its final report. It recommended, among other things, that mortgages, bonds and other choses in action 'be taxed by a method which will bring them out of hiding.' \n14\n It submitted with the report a draft of a bill for the taxation of intangibles, but recommended that the bill should not be passed until the subject had received further study by another commission.\n The second commission filed its report in 1916. Like the first commission, it adverted to the fact that 'even in \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 50]\n\u00a0\n the case of mortgages numerous ingenious and decidedly reprehensible methods are resorted to, in order that the real owner of such securities may escape his lawful portion of the burden of taxes,' and it recommended, among other things, the imposition of a mortgage recording tax. 15 This was passed at an extraordinary session of the Legislature, called 'for the sole purpose of considering the subject of revenue and taxation,' which remained in session from February 14 to April 25, 1917. The legislation subjected different classes of intangible property to widely varying rates, and supplemented the property taxes by license fees, including the mortgage recording tax here in question. It subjected credits secured by mortgage to the annual general property tax of 40 cents per $100 for state purposes, but exempted them from local taxation, imposed the mortgage recording tax, and retained a statute then in force laying a flat recording tax of 50 cents on all mortgages (except chattel mortgages for less than $200). Kentucky Statutes, Carroll's 1922 Edition,  4238. We are told that the commission and the Legislature concluded that the taxes imposed by the several statutes would, in view of facts to be stated, approximately equalize the pro rata amount of taxes to be paid on loans secured by mortgage, taking account of the difference in the dates of maturity. In determining whether the equal treatment required by the federal Constitution has been afforded we must, of course, consider all the statutes operating upon the subject-matter. Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 34 S. Ct. 354; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, No. 197, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 230, October term, 1927\n\n\n In Kentucky, local reasons exist for treating long-term mortgage loans somewhat differently from those for a \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 51]\n\u00a0\n short term. There is among those loans which are secured by mortgages of real or personal property, and hence require registration, commonly a marked difference in the character of the short-term and the long-term loans. Probably 90 or 95 per cent. of the short-term loans are evidenced by promissory notes payable to the lender. The larger part are for amounts less than $300, many of them maturing within a few months and providing for the payment of interest in advance. Another large part consists of loans secured by mortgage upon the residence of the borrower and made for domestic purposes. On the other hand, the long-term loans are commonly evidenced by coupon bonds, are issued for large amounts, and represent borrowings for business purposes. The rate of interest on short-term mortgage loans is generally higher than that on long-term loans of equal safety, in part for the following reason: Because the short-term loans are usually evidenced by promissory notes payable to the lender, the registration of the mortgage discloses the identity of the holder of the notes; and he is commonly subjected to the tax of 40 cents per $100 imposed by law upon all mortgage loans. \n16\n Because the long-term loans are commonly represented by negotiable coupon bonds and are secured by a deed of trust, registration does not disclose to the assessors who the holders of the securities are, and they frequently escape taxation thereon. Laying the mortgage recording tax only upon the long-term loans tends in some measure to reduce the disadvantage under which the short-term borrower labors.\n At what point the line should be drawn between short-term and long- term loans is, of course, a matter on which even men conversant with all the facts may reasonably differ. There was much difference of opinion concerning this in the Kentucky Legislature. The bill, as recom- \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 52]\n\u00a0\n mended by the tax commission, and as introduced in the House, exempted from the tax here in question only such mortgages as secured indebtedness maturing within three years; and it imposed a tax of 25 cents for $100.17 In the House, the bill was amended so as to exempt loans maturing in less than five years. \n18\n In the Senate, the House bill was amended so as to reduce the period to three years. \n19\n The House refused to concur in the Senate amendment. \n20\n The Senate receded;21 and thereupon the bill was passed granting the exemption of loans maturing within five years, but with the rate reduced to 20 cents. \n22\n Thus we know that in making this particular classification there was in fact an exercise of legislative judgment and discretion. Surely the particular classification was not such as to preclude (in law) 'the assumption that (it) was made in the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion.' See Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 426 (69 L. Ed. 884, 44 A. L. R. 1454). Whether the exercise was a wise one is not our concern.\n That it was permissible for Kentucky, in levying its mortgage recording tax, to take account of the probability that certain types of mortgage would escape further taxation, is not open to doubt. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 125\n, 41 S. Ct. 43. There is abundant proof that the Legislature was justified in thinking that the bulk of the long-term loans would escape the general property tax, while most of those for a short-term would not. That the statute taxes certain long-term loans which, because of their similarity in other respects to those for a short-term, are likely to be subjected to the state property tax, \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 53]\n\u00a0\n would not render the statute invalid even as applied to them. Compare Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 332\n, 33 S. Ct. 833. Wherever the line might be drawn, the statute would sometimes operate unjustly. But such occasional instances of injustice would not render the classification arbitrary. As was said in Metropolis Theater Co. v. Chicago, \n228 \nU.S. 61, 69\n, 70 S., 33 S. Ct. 441, 443 (57 L. Ed. 730):\n'The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations-illogical, it may be, and unscientific.'\n\n Moreover, the deed of trust here in question is not similar to the Kentucky mortgages maturing within five years. It is a deed of trust given by a public service corporation to secure $150,000,000 in thirty-year 5 per cent. coupon bonds of $1,000 each, the bonds to be issued from time to time, the initial issue being $18,805,000. The equality clause would not prevent a state from confining the recording tax to deeds of trust given to secure bonds of a public service corporation. Compare Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 338\n, 6 S. Ct. 57; Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Ct. 533; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339, 351\n, 12 S. Ct. 250; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 92\n, 21 S. Ct. 43; New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 158\n, 27 S. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736. The characteristics of this deed of trust clearly furnish a basis for reasonable classification as compared with probably every mortgage exempted from the recording tax. If the statute as applied does not in fact discriminate in favor of any property of a like nature, there is not inequality in treatment. A 'tax is not to be upset upon hypothetical and unreal possibilities, if it would be good upon the facts as they are.' Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n235 \nU.S. 23, 26\n, 35 S. Ct. 2, 3 (59 L. Ed. 105). See Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129, 137\n, 138 S., 42 S. Ct. 42.\n As Kentucky might lawfully have levied the recording tax only on deeds of trust securing bond issues like that \n\n[277 U.S. 32, 54]\n\u00a0\n here involved and as there is no showing that there exist any similar deeds of trust securing loans for less than five years, no constitutional right of the plaintiff is invaded because the statute may also include loans actually similar to those exempted except in regard to their term, and which, because similar in fact, could not be treated differently from those exempt.

One who would strike down a statute must show not only that he is affected by it, but that as applied to him, the statute exceeds the power of the State. This rule, acted upon as early as Austin v. Boston, 7 Wall. 694, and definitely stated in Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 314, has been consistently followed since that time. In my opinion, it is sufficient alone to require affirmance of the judgment.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A statute which fixed the maximum rate of fare on railroads more than 75 miles long, at 3 cents but on railroads in all other respects similarly situated, at 5 cents if the line was between 15 and 75 miles \n long, and at 8 cents if the line was 15 miles or less in length.

U. S.(1928)\nNo. 27\nArgued: October 11, 1928Decided: October 22, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bruno V. Bitker, of Milwaukee, Wis., Louis Marshall, of New York City, and Edwin S. Mack, of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner obtained a certificate of naturalization by a decree of a District Court of the United States in February, 1924. In June, 1925, the United States filed a petition to have the certificate cancelled on the ground that it was illegally procured. The District Court dismissed the Government's suit, 13 F.(2d) 662. But this decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and an order cancelling the certificate of naturalization was directed. 21 F.(2d) 28. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on the 9th of January last. \n276 \nU.S. 609\n, 48 S. Ct. 208.\n The petition for naturalization was filed on November 13, 1923, but at that time there was not filed the certificate from the Department of Labor stating the date, place, and manner of arrival in the United States, and the declaration of intention of such petitioner, which the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592,  4, 34 Stat. 596 (Code, title 8,  380 (8 USCA  380)), required to be attached to and made part of the petition. It is said that the Department of Labor did not issue the certificate until November 24, 1923, and it was not mailed to the clerk of the Naturalization Court until December 3. The hearing on naturalization took place on February 11, 1924, and the District Court, against the objection of the United States, ordered the certificate filed and attached to the petition nunc pro tunc, as of the date when the petition was filed, and made the decree purporting to admit the petitioner to citizenship that has been annulled in the present proceeding. The petitioner says that the original decree made the question res judicata, and that it was right, or at least within the power of the Court.\n By section 15 of the Naturalization Act (Code,  405) it is made the duty of district attorneys upon affidavit showing good cause therefor to institute proceedings for cancellation 'on the ground that such certificate of citizenship \n\n[278 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n was illegally procured.' The first question is whether the certificate was illegally procured within the meaning of section 15. If the statute makes it a condition precedent to the authority of the Court to grant a petition for naturalization that the Department of Labor's certificate of arrival shall be filed at the same time, then, when it appears on the face of the record that no such certificate has been filed, a decree admitting to citizenship is bad. It is illegal in the sense that it is unauthorized by and contrary to the law. United States v. Ginsberg, \n243 \nU.S. 472, 475\n, 37 S. Ct. 422; United States v. Ness, \n245 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 325 S., 38 S. Ct. 118.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in holding that the filing with the petition of the certificate of arrival was a condition attached to the power of the Court. Although the proceedings for admission are judicial, Tutun v. United States \n270 \nU.S. 568\n, 46 S. Ct. 425, they are not for the usual purpose of vindicating an existing right but for the purpose of getting granted to an alien rights that do not yet exist. Hence not only the conditions attached to the grant, but those attached to the power of the instrument used by the United States to make the grant must be complied with strictly, as in other instances of Government gifts. By section 4 of the Act an alien may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States in the manner prescribed, 'and not otherwise.' And by the same section the certificate from the Department of Labor is to be filed 'at the time of filing his petition.' (Code,  372, 379). The form provided by section 27 (Code,  409) alleges that the certificate is attached to and made a part of the petition. The Regulations of the Secretary of Labor embodied our interpretation of the law, and would have warned the petitioner if she had consulted them. Rule 5, Ed. February 15, 1917; Ed. September 24, 1920. United States v. Ness, \n245 \nU.S. 319, 323\n, 38 S. Ct. 118. It already has been decided that the filing of the certificate is an essential prerequisite to a valid order of naturalization, United \n\n[278 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n States v. Ness, supra, and that a hearing in chambers adjoining the courtroom does not satisfy the requirement of a hearing in open Court, United States v. Ginsberg, \n243 \nU.S. 472\n, 37 S. Ct. 422. The reasoning that prevailed in those cases must govern this. A hearing in less than ninety days from the public notice required by section 6 (Code,  396) surely would have been as bad as a hearing in chambers. But as it has been decided that no valid decree could be made until the certificate was filed and as the hearing took place and the decree was entered in less than ninety days from the time when the certificate was received the want of power seems to us doubly plain. If after the certificate came the petition had been refiled, a new notice had been given and ninety days had been allowed to elapse before the hearing there would be a different case.\n It is said that the District Court had control of procedural matters and could cure formal defects. Very likely it had power to cure defective allegations but it had not power to supply facts. If, as we decide, the petitioner was required to file the Department of Labor's certificate at the same time that she filed her petition, the District Court could not cure her failure to do so and enlarge its own powers by embodying in an order a fiction that the certificate was filed in time.\n As the certificate of citizenship was illegally obtained, the express words of section 15 authorize this proceeding to have it cancelled. The judgment attacked did not make the matter res judicata, as against the statutory provision for review. The difference between this and ordinary cases already has been pointed and would be enough to warrant a special treatment. But it hardly can be called special treatment to say that a record that discloses on its face that the judgment transcends the power of the judge may be declared void in the interest of the sovereign who gave to the judge whatever power he had.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARLIN v. LEWALLEN(1928)\nNo. 40\nArgued: October 18, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 58, 59]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude A. Niles, of Checotah, Okl., and S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry B. Parris, of Eufaula, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controverted claim to an estate by the curtesy in lands allowed and patented to a Creek woman in the distribution of the tribal property. The district court of the county where the lands lay rejected the claim; but on appeal to the Supreme Court of the state the claim was upheld, three judges dissenting. Condren v. Marlin, 113 Okl. 259, 241 P. 826.\n The lands were allotted and patented under two agreements between the United States and the Creek Tribe which will be described later on. The allottee was a mar- \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n ried woman of Creek blood and was enrolled as a member of the tribe. Her husband was a white man without tribal enrollment or membership. She died intestate November 29, 1904, while seized of the lands, and was survived by her husband, by issue of her marriage with him and by issue of a former marriage, all of the issue being Creeks and capable of inheriting the lands.\n Two questions are pressed on our attention: Did the laws then applicable to the Creek lands provide for an estate by the curtesy? If so, did they extend it to a husband who was not a Creek where there were Creek descendants capable of taking the full title?\n For many years the Creeks maintained a government of their own, with executive, legislative and judicial branches. They were located in the Indian Territory and occupied a large district which belonged to the tribe as a community, not to the members severally or as tenants in common. The situation was the same with the Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles, who with the Creeks were known as the Five Civilized Tribes. All were under the guardianship of the United States and within territory over which it had plenary jurisdiction, thus enabling it to exercise full control over them and their districts whenever it perceived a need therefor. \n1\n In the beginning and for a long period, during which the districts were widely separated from white communities, the United States refrained in the main from exerting its power of control and left much to the tribal governments. Accordingly the tribes framed and put in force various laws which they regarded as adapted to their situations, including laws purporting to regulate descent and distribution2 and to exclude persons who were not members from sharing in \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n tribal lands or funds. \n3\n In time the tribes came, through advancing settlements, to be surrounded by a large and increasing white population, many of the whites entering their districts and living there-some as tenant farmers, stock growers and merchants, and others as mere adventurers. The United States then perceived a need for making a larger use of its power. \n4\n What it did in that regard has a bearing on the questions before stated.\n By an act of March 1, 1889, 25 Stat. 783, c. 333, a special court was established for the Indian Territory and given jurisdiction of many offenses against the United States and of certain civil cases where not wholly between persons of Indian blood. By an act of May 2, 1890,  29-31, 26 Stat. 93, c. 182, that jurisdiction was enlarged and several general statutes of the state of Arkansas, published in Mansfield's Digest, were put in force in the Territory so far as not locally inapplicable or in conflict with the laws of Congress; but these provisions were restricted by others to the effect that the courts of each tribe should retain exclusive jurisdiction of all cases wholly between members of the tribe, and that the adopted Arkansas statutes should not apply to such cases. By an act of March 3, 1893, 27 Stat. 645, c. 209,  16, a Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes was created and specially authorized to conduct negotiations with each of the tribes looking to the allotment of a part of its lands among its members, to some appropriate disposal of the remaining lands and to further adjustments preparatory to the dissolution of the tribe. By an act of June 7, 1897, 30 Stat. 83, 84, c. 3, the special court was given exclusive jurisdiction of all future cases, civil and criminal, and the laws of the United \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 62]\n\u00a0\n States and the state of Arkansas in force in the Territory were made applicable to 'all persons therein, irrespective of race,' but with the qualification that any agreement negotiated by the Commission with any of the Five Civilized Tribes, when ratified, should supersede as to such tribe any conflicting provision in the act. By an act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 495, c. 517  26 and 28, the enforcement of tribal laws in the special court was forbidden and the tribal courts were abolished.\n Thus the congressional enactments gradually came to the point where they displaced the tribal laws and put in force in the Territory a body of laws adopted from the statutes of Arkansas and intended to reach Indians as well as white persons, except as they might be inapplicable in particular situations or might be superseded as to any of the Five Civilized Tribes by future agreements.\n Of the adopted Arkansas laws, chapters 20, 49, and 104 are all that need be noticed. Chapter 20 made the common law, as far as applicable, the rule of decision where not changed by statute. Chapter 49 provided for the descent and distribution of property of intestates. Chapter 104 enabled married women to control, convey and devise their real property independently of their husbands. When first enacted, chapter 20 was regarded as recognizing the common-law estate by the curtesy with both its initiate and consummate gradations. But after the enactment of chapter 104, which was a later statute, chapter 20 was construed by reason thereof as no longer recognizing curtesy initiate, which at common law vested during coverture, and as recognizing curtesy consummate only where the wife died seized of the land and intestate. Neelly v. Lancaster, 47 Ark. 175, 1 S. W. 66, 58 Am. Rep. 752. Both chapters were adopted for the Indian Territory after that construction had become well settled; so, according to a familiar rule, the adoption included that construction. Joines v. Pat- \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 63]\n\u00a0\n terson, \n274 \nU.S. 544\n, 47 S. Ct. 706; Adkins v. Arnold, \n235 \nU.S. 417, 421\n, 35 S. Ct. 118; Gidney v. Chappel, \n241 \nU.S. 99, 102\n, 36 S. Ct. 492.\n In 1900 the Commission succeeded in negotiating with representatives of the Creek tribe an agreement such as was intended by the Acts of March 3, 1893, and June 7, 1897. That agreement-known as the Original Creek Agreement-was ratified by Congress March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861, c. 676, and became effective May 25, 1901, on its ratification by the tribal council. 32 Stat. 1971. A modifying agreement-known as the Supplemental Creek Agreement-was then negotiated. It was ratified by Congress June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500, c. 1323, and became effective August 8, 1902, through its ratification by the tribal council and the proclamation of that fact by the President. 32 Stat. 2021\n\n\n The Agreements, taken together, embodied an elaborate plan for terminating the tribal relation and converting the tribal ownership into individual ownership, and also many incidental provisions controlling descent and distribution, fixing exemptions from taxation, preventing improvident alienation and protecting the individual allottees and their heirs in the enjoyment of the property. It is apparent from the terms and scope of the agreements that they were in the nature of a comprehensive treaty rather than a mere supplement to the fragmentary legislation which preceded them; and it is apparent from their repealing provisions-section 41 of one and section 20 of the other-that they were to have full effect regardless of any inconsistency with that legislation, as was contemplated in the Act of June 7, 1897, which extended the adopted Arkansas laws to Indians.\n The Arkansas law of curtesy was among the laws so extended. But that did not make it presently applicable to the Creek lands, they being then in tribal ownership. Such applicability would come only if and when indi- \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 64]\n\u00a0\n vidual ownership was substituted for tribal ownership. The Agreements provided for such a change, and had they stopped there that law would have become applicable. But instead of stopping there they proceeded to deal, among other things, with the taxation, alienation and devolution of the lands. Whether these further provisions in effect excluded curtesy under that law is one of the questions in this case. Of course it is a question of construction.\n In taking up this question it must be remembered that the Agreements were between the United States and a dependent Indian tribe then under its guardianship, and therefore that they must be construed, 'not according to the technical meaning of their words to learned lawyers, but according to the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the Indians.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Neither Agreement contained any mention of curtesy. But they did provide to whom the land should go on the owner's death intestate. The Original Agreement, in sections 7 and 28, declared that it should 'descend to his heirs' according to the laws of descent and distribution of the tribe. Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 425\n, 35 S. Ct. 119. Curtesy was not recognized in those laws. They were crude and soon were found to be unsuited to the new situation. The Supplemental Agreement, in section 6, put them aside and substituted chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest, with two provisos declaring that members of the tribe and their Creek descendants, where there were such among those coming within the terms of that chapter, should 'take the descent' to the exclusion of others. \n6\n Grayson v. Harris, \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 65]\n\u00a0\n \n267 \nU.S. 352\n, 45 S. Ct. 317; chapter 20 of Manfield's Digest, on which the adopted Arkansas law of curtesy was based, was not mentioned. Chapter 49, which was particularly called into play, was the adopted Arkansas law of descent and distribution. It said nothing about curtesy.\n Plainly there was nothing in the Agreements which could have been understood by the Indians-or even by others-as providing for curtesy; and this is true of the tribal laws temporarily recognized by the Original Agreement and of chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest which was substituted for them by the Supplemental Agreement.\n Did the Agreements, rightly construed, exclude curtesy under chapter 20 of Mansfield's Digest on which the adopted Arkansas law of curtesy rested? That law was not a special one for the Creeks; nor was it more than prospectively applicable to their lands. The Agreements, on the other hand, were negotiated and put in force as special laws for the Creeks. They dealt particularly with the allotment in severalty, exemption from taxation, alienation and devolution of the Creek lands, and their provisions on these subjects were such that the Indians naturally would regard them as complete in themselves and not affected by other laws not brought into them by distinct reference. We have seen that the Arkansas law of curtesy was not thus brought in. Both Agreements provided that on the death of an individual owner the lands should 'descend' to the 'heirs' according to particular laws designated as controlling standards-the \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 66]\n\u00a0\n tribal laws of descent being designated in the Original Agreement and chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest being substituted by the Supplemental Agreement. In the absence of any restricting provision-and there was none- the Indians naturally would regard that provision as comprehending the full title and intended to effect its transmission to the persons who would be the heirs under the laws specially designated, and in the relative proportions there indicated. They further would understand that those persons were to take the title to the exclusion of others, and not that they were to take it subject to a life estate concurrently passing to another under a law which was not mentioned. We say 'concurrently passing' because the restricted form of curtesy recognized by the Arkansas law did not attach during coverture, but only on the wife's death and then only where she died seized of the land and intestate. Neelly v. Lancaster, supra. It has been described by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma as 'in the nature of an estate by descent,' and as passing to the surviving husband as an heir. Zimmerman v. Holmes, 59 Okl. 253, 256, 257, 159 P. 303.\n Some reliance is placed on the use of the words 'descend' and 'heirs' in the provision we are considering; but there can be little doubt that in the connection in which they were used the Indians would accept them in an untechnical and comprehensive sense. The decision last cited illustrates that their use in a broad sense is not unusual.\n Our construction of that provision had support in another closely related to it. The allotment of the tribal lands was to be made among the enrolled members, including children born to them up to and including May 25, 1901; and each of these was to receive with other lands a tract designated as a homestead. Section 16 of \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 67]\n\u00a0\n the Supplemental Agreement, closely copying a part of section 7 of the Original Agreement, provided:\n'The homestead of each citizen shall remain, after the death of the allottee, for the use and support of children born to him after May 25, 1901, but if he have no such issue then he may dispose of his homestead by will, free from the limitation herein imposed, and if this be not done the land empraced in his homestead shall descend to his heirs, free from such limitation, according to the laws of descent herein otherwise prescribed.'\n\n Of course the homestead of a wife could not remain after her death for the use and support of children, as this provision directed it should in certain instances, and also pass on her death to her husband for his life by way of curtesy. So it is at least inferable from that direction that both the United States and the Indians understood there was to be no curtesy.\n These considerations make it apparent, we think, that the Agreements- given their true status as special laws for the Creeks and rightly construed-excluded curtesy under the adopted Arkansas law-or, putting it in another way, withdrew the lands of the Creeks from the operation of that law.\n After the Agreements were put in force Congress included in an act of April 28, 1904, 33 Stat. 573, c. 1824, relating to the jurisdiction of the special courts for the Indian Territory, a provision reading as follows:\n'All the laws of Arkansas heretofore put in force in the Indian Territory are hereby continued and extended in their operation, so as to embrace all persons and estates in said Territory, whether Indian, freedman, or otherwise, and full and complete jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the district courts in said Territory in the settlements of all estates of decedents, the guardianships of \n\n[276 U.S. 58, 68]\n\u00a0\n minors and incompetents, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise.'\n\n It is contended that this provision subjected the lands of the Creeks to the Arkansas law of curtesy and modified the Agreements accordingly. We are of a different opinion. The provision was couched in general terms, did not refer to the Agreements, did not mention curtesy or the Creek lands, and contained no repealing clause. No doubt it was intended to extend the operation of the Arkansas laws in various ways; but it fell far short of manifesting a purpose to make them effective as against special laws enacted by Congress for particular Indians, such as the agreements with the Creeks. We have so construed it in other cases not distinguishable in principle. Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 427\n, 35 S. Ct. 119; Taylor v. Parker, \n235 \nU.S. 42, 44\n, 35 S. Ct. 22. And the Supreme Court of the state had taken a like view of it even before our decisions were given. In re Davis' Estate, 32 Okl. 209, 122 P. 547; Taylor v. Parker, 33 Okl. 199, 126 P. 573.\n We accordingly hold that at the time of the allottee's death-November 29, 1904-the laws applicable to the lands of the Creeks did not provide for an estate by the curtesy.\n The Supreme Court of the state, in holding otherwise in this and other cases cited in its opinion, passed in silence over the status of the Agreements as special laws and the exclusive nature of their provisions, and rested its decision on the other legislation adopting and extending the Arkansas laws. In this it departed from applicable decisions of this court and in effect put aside some of its own earlier rulings.\n As we hold there was no law providing for an estate by the curtesy, the fact that the surviving husband was not a Creek becomes immaterial.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Stephens v.

The court dismissed the suit on motion, for want of equity; and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, without consideration of the federal question, on the ground that under sections 9971 and 9973 of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921, the petitioner had a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy at law by paying the tax under protest and suing for its recovery.

GOULD(1928)\nNo. 85\nArgued: October 28, 1927Decided: March 5, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. William Wallace, Jr., of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This record presents a preliminary question as to our jurisdiction under the writ of certiorari.\n The petitioners brought an action in equity in the Supreme Court of New York against George J. Gould and others for an accounting of syndicate funds. Gould having died before the trial, the petitioners, proceeding under a rule to show cause, moved for an order substituting the respondents, the executors of his estate, as parties defendant, and reviving the action as against them. The court denied this motion and dismissed the rule to show cause; and this was affirmed by the Appellate Division, without opinion. 215 App. Div. 811, 213 N. Y. S. 850. The petitioners moved the Appellate Division 'for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals.' This was denied. The petitioners then took an appeal without leave. This was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, without opinion. 242 N. Y. 604, 152 N. E. 446.\n The petitioners contend that although the judgment of the Appellate Division does not finally and completely dispose of the entire action, it is nevertheless a 'final judgment' which may be reviewed under section 237b of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344), as it is a 'final' and complete judgment in an ancillary and 'independent proceeding' to revive the action against the respondents. The respondents contend that, even if this be so, it is not, under that section, \n\n[276 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n the judgment of the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had, since the petitioners did not apply to the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal.\n Section 588 of the New York Code of Civil Practice authorizes the taking of an appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment or order of the Appellate Division 'which finally determines an action or special proceeding.' Subdivision 1 provides that such an appeal may be taken 'as of right' in certain classes of cases. Subdivision 41 provides that where such an appeal does not lie as of right under Subdivision 1, it may be taken where the Appellate Division certifies that in its opinion a question of law is involved which ought to be reviewed, or where, in case of the refusal so to certify, an appeal is allowed by the Court of Appeals. To obtain such a discretionary appeal application may be made to the Appellate Division for leave to appeal, and in case of refusal, to the Court of Appeals. See section 591; Sultzbach v. Sultzbach, 238 N. Y. 353, 355, 144 N. E. 638. And when an appeal which is not a matter of right is taken without leave, it must be dismissed. People v. Trimarchi, 231 N. Y. 263, 268, 131 N. E. 910; Pillsbury Flour Mills Co. v. Nicotera, 234 N. Y. 534, 138 N. E. 436; Matter of Schmidt, 236 N. Y. 645, 646, 142 N. E. 318; Donovan v. Cunard Steamship Co., 236 N. Y. 651, 142 N. E. 320; Johnson v. Whaley, 239 N. Y. 570, 571, 147 N. E. 200.\n Assuming the correctness of the petitioners' contention that the judgment of the Appellate Division is a 'final' determination of an independent proceeding to revive the action against the respondents, the dismissal by the Court of Appeals of the appeal sued out without leave, must be taken, nothing else appearing, as a holding by that court that the case was not one in which an appeal lay as a matter of right. And since the petitioners, when the Appellate Division refused them leave to appeal, did not make an application to the Court of Appeals for such \n\n[276 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n leave, the judgment is not that of the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had. See Newman v. Gates, \n204 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 27 S. Ct. 220. In any respect we are without authority to review the judgment; and the writ is\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not sit in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Changed to Subdivision 5 by Laws 1926, c. 725. \n\n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMELLON v. ARKANSAS LAND & LUMBER CO.(1928)\nNo. 73\nArgued: October 27, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. J. Q. Mahaffey, of Texarkana, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr E. F. McFaddin, of Hope, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case relates to the construction and effect of the provision in section 206 of the Transportation Act, 1920,1 which permitted suits on causes of action that had arisen during the Federal control of railroads to be brought thereafter against an Agent designated by the President. This section, in so far as here material, pro- \n\n[275 U.S. 460, 461]\n\u00a0\n vided that actions at law based on causes of action arising out of the operation by the President of the railroad of any carrier, might, after the termination of Federal control, be brought against 'an agent designated by the President for such purpose ... within the periods of limitation now prescribed by State of Federal statutes,' and that a judgment 'rendered against the agent designated by the President' should be paid out of a revolving fund created by the Act.\n On July 23, 1918, a cause of action accrued in favor of the Arkansas Land & Lumber Company on account of the misdelivery of a carload of lumber shipped by it over the railroads of two carriers then being operated under Federal control. The Arkansas statute of limitations provided that suit 'shall be commenced within three years after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n No suit was brought during the period of Federal control, which terminated on March 1, 1920.3 Thereafter, on July 9, 1921-nearly three years after the cause of action accrued-the Company brought suit in an Arkansas circuit court against 'John Barton Payne, Director General, as Agent for' the railroad carriers, alleging that he then was 'the agent duly designated by the President' against whom suits might be brought. \n4\n At that time Payne was not the Agent designated by the President, having resigned as Director General and designated Agent more than three months before; and James C. Davis had been designated by the President has then was the Agent. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[275 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n In October, 1921-more than three years after the cause of action accrued- on a plea in abatement by Payne to the effect that he was not the designated Agent, the court dismissed the suit as to him; and, on motion of the plaintiff, Davis, the designated Agent, was substituted as the defendant. Davis, thereafter appearing, pleaded that under section 206 of the Transportation Act the suit could not be prosecuted against him as he had not been made a party within the period of limitation prescribed by the Arkansas statute. The circuit court sustained this plea and dismissed the suit. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment on the ground that the substitution of Davis was not the institution of a new action against him, but merely an amendment correcting the name of the defendant in furtherance f justice; and remanded the cause to the circuit court. Arkansas Land & Lumber Co. v. Davis, 155 Ark. 541, 244 S. W. 730. Davis there renewed his plea under the Transportation Act. This was overruled, and judgment was rendered against him. The Supreme Court-in which the petitioner, who meanwhile had succeeded Davis as the designated agent,6 was substituted as the appellant-adhered to its former ruling and affirmed the judgment. Davis v. Arkansas Land & Lumber Co., 170 Ark. 552, 280 S. W. 364.\n This, we find, was error. The United States had not consented to being sued after the termination of Federal control except as provided by section 206 of the Transportation Act, that is, by a suit brought against the Agent designated by the President for such purpose, within the period of limitation prescribed by the State statute. This plainly meant that the suit must be brought within the period of limitation against the person who was the designated Agent and alone had authority to represent the Government. The bringing of the suit against Payne, who was not the designated Agent, was not a compliance with this requirement and brought no representative of \n\n[275 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n the Government before the court. Davidson v. Payne (C. C. A.) 289 F. 69. The substitution of Davis, the designated Agent, was not the correction of an error in the name of the defendant, but the bringing in of a different defendant, and was in effect the commencement of a new and independent proceeding against him to enforce the liability of the Government. See Davis v. L. L. Cohen & Co., \n268 \nU.S. 638, 642\n, 45 S. Ct. 633; Mellon v. Weiss, \n270 \nU.S. 565, 567\n, 46 S. Ct. 378. And, as this substitution, being made more than three years after the cause of action had accrued, was not a compliance with the requirement of the Transportation Act that the action be brought against the designated Agent within the period of limitation prescribed by the State statute, the plea should have been sustained and the suit dismissed.\n This conclusion is substantially the same as that in United States ex rel. Rauch v. Davis, 56 App. D. C. 46, 8 F.(2d) 907; Vassau v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 69 Mont. 305, 221 P. 1069; Davis v. Griffith, 103 Okl. 137, 229 P. 499; and Natoli v. Davis, 75 Cal. App. 309, 242 P. 895; contra, Bailey v. Hines, 131 Va. 421, 109 S.

GOODYEAR(1928)\nNo. 131\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. Luther Burns, of Topeka, Kan., M. L. Bell and W. F. Dickinson, both of Chicago, Ill., T. P. Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., J. E. Du Mars, of Topeka, Kan., and W. D. Vance, of Belleville, Kan., for petitioner. \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin C. Brandenburg, of Washington, D. C., and John F. McClure, of Belleville, Kan., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While employed in interstate commerce by the Director General of Railroads at Belleville, Kan., July 31, 1919, Lewis Goodyear sustained serious personal injuries for which he claimed the right to recover damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65, c. 149 ( 45 USCA  51-59; Comp. St.  8657-8665); 36 Stat. 291 (45 USCA  56, 59; Comp. St.  8662, 8665)). On March 16, 1920, he settled with the employer, accepted the agreed sum, and executed a general release, which, among other things, recites:\n'I do hereby compromise said claim, and do respectively release and forever discharge said Director General of Railroads, operating Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad, and his successor or successors as such, the United States of America, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, the owner of said railroad, and all railway companies whose lines are leased to said railway company or have been operated by it, but are now oper- \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n ated by said Director General, and their respective agents and employees, from any and all liability for all claims and demands for all damages resulting from the injuries received by me at the time and place above stated, including such injuries as may hereafter develop, as well as those now apparent, and also do release and discharge them, and each of them, of all suits, actions, causes of action, and claims for damages on account of injuries to my person, as well as damages to my property, if any, which I have or might have arising from, growing out of, or in any wise connected with the accident above referred to, and do hereby acknowledge full satisfaction of all such liability and causes of action. ...\n\n'It is further expressly understood and agreed that this release shall be deemed to be and shall be a complete bar to any action which might otherwise be brought, either by law, or under any state or federal Workmen's Compensation Act, Employers' Liability Act, Labor Law, or any other statute, for the recovery of compensation or damages on account of said injuries (or of resulting death, if this be executed by an administrator or administratrix of the estate of said person), for the benefit of any person whomsoever or estate whatsoever.'\n\n May 4, 1920, Goodyear died. April 19, 1921, relying upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act, his widow, as administratrix and in behalf of herself and her children, brought this action for damages against the Director General in the district court, Republic county, Kan. She alleged that her husband's death resulted from the injuries suffered July 31, 1919. As a bar to the action, the answer set up the settlement and release above referred to; and the administratrix replied that the beneficiaries had a separate cause of action for their pecuniary damage which the decedent could not release.\n The cause was twice tried and twice considered by the Supreme Court of Kansas. At the first trial, the jury was \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n told:\n'You are instructed that the law favors a compromise and settlement of disputes, and, when parties in good faith enter into an agreement based on good consideration, neither is afterwards permitted to deny it.'\n\n Judgment for the Director General was reversed by the Supreme Court. It held the quoted instruction erroneous. The opinion shows care and research, and forcefully sets out the argument against the power of an injured employee to destroy the right of dependents to recover in event of his death. Goodyear v. Davis, 114 Kan. 557, 220 P. 282, 39 A. L. R. 563; Id., 115 Kan. 20, 220 P. 1049, 39 A. L. R. 563.\n At the second trial, the court instructed the jury:\n'The Federal Employers' Liability Act, under which plaintiff's action was brought, creates two separate and distinct rights of action resulting from an injury such as complained of by the plaintiff in this case; one right of action to the injured employee for his suffering and loss resulting from the injury, and one to his personal representative for the benefit of his surviving widow and children, in the event death results from the injury. And you are instructed that the latter cause of action could not be released by the deceased, Lewis Goodyear, by any action taken by him. It accrues solely to his personal representative for the benefit of the persons named, and Lewis Goodyear in his lifetime would have no control over same. In other words, it did not accrue until his death, and hence he could not release it by any act on his part.'\n\n Answering special questions, the jury found that no fraud attended the settlement; Goodyear was mentally capable of transacting business at the time; there was no mutual mistake as to his physical condition; the release was not given under the mistaken belief that the material results of his injuries had disappeared; and nothing was allowed for funeral expenses.\n Upon a verdict in her favor for $5,000, judgment went for the administratrix, which the Supreme Court af- \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 339]\n\u00a0\n firmed, definitely approving the instruction last quoted. Goodyear v. Davis, 121 Kan. 392, 247 P. 446. She died July 10, 1926, and Edward Goodyear was duly substituted by order of Supreme Court of Kansas.\n The question for our decision is whether the settlement between Goodyear and the employer, made advisedly and in good faith, barred an action by dependents for their pecuniary damages through his death.\n The Liability Act, approved April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. 65, c. 149, provided:\n'Section 1. That every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states or territories, or between any of the states and territories, or between the District of Columbia and any of the states or territories, or between the District of Columbia or any of the states or territories and any foreign nation or nations, shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.' 45 USCA  51; Comp. St.  8567\n\n\n\n The amending Act of April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. 291, c. 143, added the following:\n'Sec. 9. That any right of action given by this act to a person suffering injury shall survive to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee, and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 340]\n\u00a0\n of the next of kin dependent upon such employee, but in such cases there shall be only one recovery for the same injury.' 45 USCA  59; Comp. St.  8665.\n\n In Michigan Central Railroad Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 \nU.S. 59, 65\n, 67 S., 68, 69, 70, 33 S. Ct. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 176, an action by the administrator to recover for loss cuffered by the wife by reason of her husband's wrongful death, this court considered the original statute ( 1908) and held that the employee's right of action to recover such damages as would compensate for expenses, loss of time, suffering, and diminished earning power did not survive his death, also that the mere existence of such a right in the employee's lifetime did not destroy the dependent's right under the statute to recover for pecuniary damages consequent upon the death. By Mr. Justice Lurton, the court said:\n'We think the act declares two distinct and independent liabilities, resting, of course, upon the common foundation of a wrongful injury, but based upon altogether different principles. ... The act of 1908 does not provide for any survival of the right of action created in behalf of an injured employee. That right of action was therefore extinguished. ... The obvious purpose of Congress was to save a right of action to certain relatives dependent upon an employee wrongfully injured, for the loss and damage resulting to them financially by reason of the wrongful death. ... This cause of action is independent of any cause of action which the decedent had, and includes no damages which he might have recovered for his injury if he had survived. It is one beyond that which the decedent had-one proceeding upon altogether different principles. It is a liability for the loss and damage ... resulting to them and for that only.\n\n'The statute in giving an action for the benefit of certain members of the family of the decedent is essentially identical with the first act which ever provided for a cause \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 341]\n\u00a0\n of action arising out of the death of a human being, that of 9 and 10 Victoria, known as Lord Campbell's Act. ... But as the foundation of the right of action is the original wrongful injury to the decedent, it has been generally held that the new action is a right dependent upon the existence of a right in the decedent immediately before his death to have maintained an action for his wrongful injury. Tiffany, Death by Wrongful Act,  124; Louisville E. & St. L. R. R. Co. v. Clark, \n152 U.S. 230\n (14 S. Ct. 579); Read v. G. E. Ry., L. R. 3 Q. B. 555; Hecht v. O. & M. Ry., 132 Ind. 507 (132 N.

A. 694).\n\n'The distinguishing features of that act (Lord Campbell's Act) are identical with the act of Congress of 1908 before its amendment: First, it is grounded upon the original wrongful injury of the person; second, it is for the exclusive benefit of certain specified relatives; third, the damages are such as flow from the deprivation of the pecuniary benefits which the beneficiaries might have reasonably received if the deceased had not died from his injuries . ...\n\n'The word 'pecuniary' did not appear in Lord Campbell's Act, nor does it appear in our act of 1908. But the former act and all those which follow it have been continuously interpreted as providing only for compensation for pecuniary loss or damage.'\n\n In St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Craft, \n237 \nU.S. 648, 657\n, 658 S., 35 S. Ct. 704, an administrator sought to recover for the father's benefit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act as amended in 1910 (45 USCA  56; Comp. St.  8662). Damages were claimed on account of ( a) pecuniary loss to the father, and (b) conscious pain and suffering by the decedent. The railway company insisted that the recovery should be restricted either to the pecuniary loss to the father, or to the damages sus- \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 342]\n\u00a0\n tained by the injured person while alive; that the statute does not permit recovery for both. This court held otherwise, and said:\n'If the matter turned upon the original act alone it is plain that the recovery here could not include damages for the decedent's pain and suffering, for only through a provision for a survival of his right could such damages be recovered after his death. But the original act is not alone to be considered. On April 5, 1910, prior to the decedent's injuries the act was 'amended.' ... No change was made in section 1. ... It continues, as before, to provide for two distinct rights of action: One in the injured person for his personal loss and suffering where the injuries are not immediately fatal, and the other in his personal representative for the pecuniary loss sustained by designated relatives where the injuries immediately or ultimately result in death. Without abrogating or curtailing either right, the new section provides in exact words that the right given to the injured person 'shall survive' to his personal representative 'for the benefit of' the same relatives in whose behalf the other right is given. Brought into the act by way of amendment, this provision expresses the deliberate will of Congress. ... Although originating in the same wrongful act or neglict, the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being embraced in the other. One is for the wrong to the injured person and is confined to his personal loss and suffering before he died, while the other is for the wrong to the beneficiaries and is confined to their pecuniary loss through his death. One begins where the other ends, and a recovery upon both in the same action is not a double recovery for a single wrong but a single recovery for a double wrong. ...'\n\n In Frese, Adm'x, v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 44 S. Ct. 1, 2 (68 L. Ed. 131), an action under the liability Act for \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 343]\n\u00a0\n damages consequent upon death of the plaintiff's intestate, it was said:\n'If the engineer could not have recovered for an injury, his administratrix cannot recover for his death. Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 70 (33 S. Ct. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 176).'\n\n The injuries were due primarily to the default of the engineer, and the employer never became liable to him.\n In Reading Co. v. Koons, Adm'r, \n271 \nU.S. 58, 64\n, 46 S. Ct. 405, the administrator sought recovery by suit commenced seven years after the employee's death, but within two years after the granting of administration. This court declared the action was barred.\n In Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Oliver (C. C. A. 1919) 261 F. 1, 2, 3, 4, the employee received injuries March 31, 1912, and died August 11, 1915. The administrator sued, and the railway company resisted on the ground that, during his lifetime, the decedent had recovered a judgment for the damages sustained, which had been satisfied. The trial court overruled the defense and allowed recovery. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, and said:-\n'The defendant in error's lack of right to maintain his suit in such a situation as the one under consideration is due, not to the decedent's lack, immediately prior to his death, of an enforceable right of action for the injury he sustained, but to the fact that the cause of action counted on has been extinguished by payment of the judgment recovered by the decedent for the wrong he suffered.'\n\n Obviously, the settlement and release of March 16, 1920, satisfied and discharged any claim against the Director General for the personal loss and suffering of Goodyear. Immediately before his death he had no right of action, and nothing passed to the administratrix because of such loss and suffering. Hence it is that the administratrix must recover, if at all, under section 1, Act of 1908, which imposes liability for pecuniary loss sustained by dependents through death. \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 344]\n\u00a0\n Concerning that section, Vreeland's Case, supra, declares:\n'But as the foundation of the right of action is the original wrongful injury to the decedent, it has been generally held that the new action is a right dependent upon the existence of a right in the decedent immediately before his death to have maintained an action for his wrongful injury.'\n\n And no later opinion here has given expression to any other view.\n By the overwhelming weight of judicial authority, where a statute of the nature of Lord Campbell's Act in effect gives a right to recover damages for the benefit of dependents, the remedy depends upon the existence in the decedent at the time of his death of a right of action to recover for such injury. A settlement by the wrongdoer with the injured person, in the absence of fraud or mistake, precludes any remedy by the personal representative based upon the same wrongful act. Construing the statute of Kansas, the Supreme Court of that state seems to have accepted this generally approved doctrine. Fuller, Adm'x, v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 124 Kan. 66, 257 P. 971.\n The cases supporting this view, from courts of last resort in twenty- one states, Canada, and England, are collected in a note following the first opinion of the Supreme Court of Kansas in the present cause, reported in 39 A. L. R. 579. And in Tiffany on Wrongful Death (2d Ed.)  124, the rule (with supporting authorities) is thus broadly stated:\n'If the deceased, in his lifetime, has done anything that would operate as a bar to a recovery by him of damages for the personal injury, this will operate equally as a bar in an action by his personal representatives for his death. Thus, a release by the party injured of his right of action, or a recovery of damages by him for the injury, is a complete defense in the statutory action. But, while the courts have agreed in their decisions, they have had difficulty in reconciling them with the express declaration of \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 345]\n\u00a0\n the statute that the action may be maintained whenever the act, neglect, or default is such that the party injured, if death had not ensued, might have maintained an action. ...\n\n'It is hardly possible to place the general holding upon any very logical ground. The position taken by the courts is fairly enough summed up as follows: 'Whether the right of action is a transmitted right or an original right; whether it be created by a survival statute or by a statute creating an independent right, the general concensus of opinion seems to be that the gist and foundation of the right in all cases is the wrongful act, and that for such wrongful act but one recovery should be had, and that, if the deceased had received satisfaction in his lifetime, either by settlement and adjustment or by adjudication in the courts, no further right of action existed.\"\n\n See Strode v. Transit Co., 197 Mo. 616, 95 S. W. 851, 7 Ann. Cas. 1084. See, also, Edwards v. Chemical Co., 170 N. C. 551, 87 S. E. 635, L. R. A. 1916D, 121; Louisville R. Co. v.

St. Rep. 754.\n Considering the repeated holdings of many courts of last resort, the declarations by this court, and the probable ill consequences to both employees and employers which would follow the adoption of the contrary view, we must conclude that the settlement and release relieved the Director General from all liability for damages consequent upon the injuries received by Goodyear and his death.\n The statute of 1908 is entitled 'An act relating to the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees in certain cases.' Fifteen years ago this court affirmed that, in so far as it gives an action for the benefit of dependents, the statute is essentially identical with Lord Campbell's Act. Continued adherence to this view \n\n[277 U.S. 335, 346]\n\u00a0\n is emphasized by repeated holdings that dependents can recover only pecuniary damages. American Railroad Co. of Porto Rico v.

Neither statute defines the nature of the damages to be recovered; this was left for interpretation. We followed the construction given the earlier one when it became necessary to interpret and apply the later and similar act.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMIDLAND NAT. BANK OF MINNEAPOLIS v. DAKOTA LIFE INS. CO.(1928)\nNo. 425\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sigurd Ueland and Andreas Ueland, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. John B. Hanten, of Watertown, S. D., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Midland National Bank of Minneapolis brought this action, in 1923, in a state court of Minnesota. It sought to recover on a policy of life insurance for $10,000 issued by the Dakota Life Insurance Company in the year 1920. The defendant, a South Dakota corporation, removed the cause to the federal court. There the case was tried before a jury. It was alleged and proved that the policy had been issued in North Dakota on the life of Oscar Mosher, payable to his estate; that it was assigned to the plaintiff in 1923 in North Dakota by Mosher and one Jacobson, a prior assignee; that the assignment recited that it was given to secure payment to the bank of the sum of $10,000 according to the tenor and conditions of two promissory notes; that two demand notes for $5,000 each, signed by Mosher, had been given to the bank by Jacobson as collateral for the latter's indebtedness to it in a larger amount; that the assignment bearing the approval of the company was delivered to the bank about the same time that it received the collateral notes; that of these notes the bank became the absolute owner by foreclosure; that no part of them had been paid; that Mosher died soon after giving the notes, while the policy was in force; and that proofs of death had been duly furnished before this action was begun.\n The answer to the amended complaint alleged, among other things, that the policy had been obtained from the \n\n[277 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n company through a fraudulent conspiracy entered into by Mosher, Jacobson, and the Dazey State Bank, of which the latter was president; that the two collateral notes were obtained from Mosher by fraud and without consideration; and that the company, when it approved the assignment to the plaintiff, was unaware of these facts. On the plaintiff's motion, the court struck out the paragraphs of the answer alleging that the policy had been procured by fraud, on the ground that under the statutes of North Dakota the policy had become incontestible; and it struck out also certain other paragraphs making 'allegations in reference to equities of third parties in connection with the assignments of the policy in suit.' The company then filed an amended answer. This answer again set up the alleged invalidity of the assignments, the fraud on Mosher in obtaining the notes, and the want of consideration for the latter. It also alleged that in proceedings instituted by the company in North Dakota the policy had been canceled. Evidence in support of the latter allegation was excluded at the trial, on the ground that the bank had not been brought within the jurisdiction of the North Dakota court. The company then made an offer of proof in support of its allegation that the notes and the assignment had been obtained by Jacobson from Mosher by trickery and without consideration. On the bank's objection, all this evidence was excluded.\n At the close of the evidence, each party asked for a directed verdict. On admissions contained in the pleadings and on the evidence, the trial court found that the notes were taken by the bank as security for a pre- existing debt, and held that, since under the law of North Dakota and of Minnesota a pre-existing debt constitutes value, the plaintiff was a holder for value of the notes, and was entitled to recover on the policy assigned to secure their payment; and it assessed the damages for the full amount \n\n[277 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n claimed, that is, $10,000 (less an unpaid installment of premium) and interest. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the several offers of proof were properly rejected, and that the bank was entitled to recover on the policy. But it reversed the judgment and remanded the case on the ground that, when issued, the policy was a wagering contract except to the extent that it was reasonably required as security for a debt which it assumed that Mosher owed, in the amount of $5,686.08, at the time of the issue of the policy, to the local bank of which Jacobson was president. It said:\n'So we conclude on the facts stated that the policy was a good and valid contract to the extent of Mosher's indebtedness to the Dazey State Bank on May 14, 1920, and that the court erred in excluding the tendered proof. If the tender should be made a good and the case does not present a materially different aspect from the record before us, plaintiff should have judgment for that amount, with interest from service of summons.' 18 F.(2d) 903, 905.\n\n This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n275 \nU.S. 515\n, 48 S. Ct. 85, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The action of the Court of Appeals was unjustified on the record before it. While the original answer had alleged that the policy was taken out with a view to its assignment to the Dazey State Bank, and was so assigned some two months after its issue, these allegations were struck out by order of the court, to which the defendant took no exception. We may assume, though we do not so decide, that the defense of a want of insurable interest and the consequent illegality of the insurance contract is one that may be raised by the court, though not properly pleaded. See Coppell v. Hall, 7 Wall. 542, 558; Oscanyan v. Arms Co., \n103 U.S. 261\n, 267; Higgins v. McCrea, \n116 \nU.S. 671, 685\n, 6 S. Ct. 557. But here there is nothing, either in the admitted facts, or in the evidence received, or in that offered and excluded, which tends to show such illegality. \n\n[277 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n The policy was taken out by the insured, and was payable to his estate. It is true that the amended answer alleged that all the premiums were paid by the Dazey State Bank, but this was denied on information and belief in the reply, and no evidence was produced in its support. None of the evidence received or excluded had any bearing upon the circumstances under which the policy was issued. Whether if such evidence had been offered it should have been excluded because of the provisions of the North Dakota statutes making policies incontestible after two years, or for other reaons (compare Finnie v. Walker (C. C. A.) 257 F. 698), we have no occasion to consider. Plainly the assignment of the policy later would not render it void, whatever the lack of insurable interest on the part of the assignee. Grigsby v. Russell, \n222 \nU.S. 149\n, 32 S. Ct. 58, 36 L.

CO. v. BARKLEY(1928)\nNo. 375\nArgued: March 9, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas B. Pryor and Vincent M. Miles, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles I. Evans, of Booneville, Ark., for respondents. \n\n[276 U.S. 482, 483]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Barkley and Burnett operated a wagon coal mine in Arkansas located about a quarter of a mile from the line of the Midland Valley Railroad, a corporation of that state. They shipped their coal by that carrier, largely in interstate commerce. In the spring and summer of 1922 there was a widespread strike in bituminous coal mines throughout the United States. When mining was resumed in August, an acute car shortage developed. Coal is usually shipped in open top cars; and tipple mines, which are the largest producers of coal, can use only cars of that type. The supply of these being inadequate, the Midland, like other carriers, distributed the available open top cars among the tipple mines and its box cars among the wagon mines. Barkley and Burnett refused to accept box cars; and later brought, in an Arkansas court, this action against the Midland to recover damages for the alleged failure to furnish, during the period of the car shortage, an adequate supply of cars. By appropriate proceedings, the defendant objected to the maintenance of the action in the state court. It contended that the proper distribution of coal cars by interstate carriers in time of car shortage was an administrative question which Congress had committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission; and that the plaintiffs should have sought relief by application to that board. The trial court overruled the objection; the plaintiffs got a verdict; the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the state (172 Ark. 898, 291 S. W. 431); and this court granted a writ of certiorari (\n275 \nU.S. 514\n, 48 S. Ct. 37, 72 L. Ed. -). The only question for decision is whether the action lies.\n The plaintiffs contend, and the state court held, that the action lay because it was brought to enforce the common-law duty of the carrier to furnish cars (Midland Valley \n\n[276 U.S. 482, 484]\n\u00a0\n R. R. Co. v. Hoffman Coal Co., .1 Ark. 180, 189, 120 S. W. 380), a duty confirmed by the statutes of the State (Crawford & Moses' Arkansas Digest, 1921,  895), and recognized by the Interstate Commerce Act. They argue that the right to bring an action in the courts of a state for a breach of that duty has been specifically preserved to the shipper by section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  22; Comp. St.  8595) which declares that 'nothing in this act contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this act are in addition to such remedies'; that the plaintiffs made no attack, open or covert, upon any regulation or order of the Commission relating to the supply or distribution of cars (compare Lambert Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S. Ct. 349); that consequently no administrative question was involved (compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S. Ct. 250, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Loomis v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 43\n, 36 S. Ct. 228; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S. Ct. 477); and that the case is governed by Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 \nU.S. 121\n, 35 S. Ct. 484, and Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Sonman Shaft Coal Co., \n242 \nU.S. 120\n, 37 S. Ct. 46, rather than by Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Pitcairn Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 481\n, 30 S. Ct. 164, and Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 304\n, 33 S. Ct. 938\n\n\n The assertion that no administrative question is here involved rests upon a misapprehension. It may be assumed that there was no order of the Commission which required the Midland to distribute all available upon top cars among the tipple mines. But the reasonableness of the Midland's practice in doing so, and in allotting box cars to the wagon mines, was the substantial matter in controversy. The right of a shipper to cars is not an absolute right and the carrier is not liable if its failure to furnish cars was the result of sudden and great demands which it \n\n[276 U.S. 482, 485]\n\u00a0\n had no reason to apprehend would be made and which it could not reasonably have been expected to meet in full. The law exacts only what is reasonable from such carriers. The reasonableness of the rule adopted by the carrier is a matter for the Commission. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 \nU.S. 121, 133\n, 134 S., 35 S. Ct. 484. In the case at bar, the right of the plaintiffs to recover depended upon whether the defendant's practice of distributing its open top cars to tipple mines and its box cars to wagon mines was reasonable. The practice is one which was generally adopted in times of car shortage by rail carriers in the same territory; which had, under like circumstances, been prescribed by general orders of the Director General;1 which had been to some extent prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission;2 and the propriety of which in individual cases has been repeatedly the subject of consideration by the Commission on applications by shippers for relief. \n3\n It was clearly one of those questions which, as recognized in the Puritan Case, calls for 'the \n\n[276 U.S. 482, 486]\n\u00a0\n exercise of the regulating function of the Commission.' Page 133 (35 S. Ct. 488). Compare Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506\n, 32 S. Ct. 114.\n In the case at bar, the adequacy of the carrier's supply of open cars in normal times was not seriously questioned; there was no suggestion that the plaintiffs' mine had been discriminated against; and the only substantial complaint was that the Midland's practice in allotting the open top cars to the tipple mines was illegal. Thus the facts are unlike those in which actions at law for failure to furnish cars have been entertained. In Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 \nU.S. 121\n, 35 S. Ct. 484, and in Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Mulberry Hill Coal Co., \n238 \nU.S. 275\n, 35 S. Ct. 760, the claim was that, under a rule confessedly valid, the carrier had discriminated against the plaintiff. In Eastern Railway \n\n[276 U.S. 482, 487]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Littlefield, \n237 \nU.S. 140\n, 35 S. Ct. 489, the claim was that the carrier, knowing of the car shortage, had not only failed to notify the shipper, but had accepted the shipment. In Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Sonman Shaft Coal Co., \n242 U.S. 120\n, 125-127, 37 S. Ct. 46, the action was for failure to supply cars in confessedly normal times. Compare Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Stineman Coal Co., \n242 \nU.S. 298, 300\n, 301 S., 37 S. Ct. 118. In none of those cases was the reasonableness of the carrrier's practice in controversy.\n We have no occasion to consider whether the then existing orders of the Commission required the Midland to adopt the practice followed. Nor need we determine whether, by the amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act made in Transportation Act 1920, c. 91,  402, pars. 10-17, 41 Stat. 456, 476, and the Act of September 22, 1922, c. 413, 42 Stat. 1025 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St.  8563), Congress evinced the intention to occupy the field of regulating the distribution of coal cars; and thereby abrogated the pre-existing limited right to sue in a state court for failure to supply cars.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By an order dated June 17, 1918, the Regional Directors were instructed that 'open top cars suitable and available for loading at tipple mines should be first supplied to such mines and should not be supplied to wagon mines until the tipple mines have been supplied.' This modified an earlier order of March 20, 1918, which had directed that open top cars should not be furnished to wagon mines for loading on public team tracks if box cars were available for such loading. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] By notice of March 2, 1920, the Commission recommended that the rules as to the distribution of coal cars embodied in Railroad Administration Car Service Section Circular CS-31, issued September 12, 1918, revised December 23, 1919, be continued in effect. See in re Rules Governing Ratings of Coal Mines, 95 I. C. C. 309, 320. This recommendation appears to have been generally accepted by the carriers. Compare Winding Gulf Colliery Co. v. Virginian Ry. Co., 102 I. C. C. 41. From time to time, the Commission has issued emergency orders governing the distribution of coal cars, under the power conferred by paragraph 15 of section 402 of Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 476 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St .  8563). Several of these orders recognize the necessity of a distinction, in time of shortage, between wagon and tipple mines. By Service Order No. 14, issued August 25, 1920, the Commission directed that on any day when a carrier was unable to supply all mines on its line with the required open top cars, such cars should not be furnished to wagon mines which were unable to load on private tracks and from a tipple or like arrangement, until all tipple mines had been supplied. This was rescinded by Service Order No. 17, effective September 19, 1920, which, however, prohibited a carrier from furnishing open top cars in time of shortage to mines which did not customarily load cars within 24 hours of the time of placement, a prohibition which would include most wagon load mines. This order was vacated March 6, 1921. A similar requirement was incorporated into Service Order No. 25 by Amendment No. 1, effective October 17, 1922. Service Order No. 25 applied only to common carriers 'east of the Mississippi river, including the west bank crossings thereof'; it was vacated December 11, 1922. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Thompson v.

Tavenner, of Woodstock, Va., for defendant in error. \n\n[276 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Acting under the Cedar Rust Act of Virginia, Acts Va. 1914, c. 36, as amended by Acts Va. 1920, c. 260, now embodied in Va. Code (1924) as sections 885 to 893, defendant in error, the state entomologist, ordered the plaintiffs in error to cut down a large number of ornamental red cedar trees growing on their property, as a means of preventing the communication of a rust or plant disease with which they were infected to the apple orchards in the vicinity. The plaintiffs in error appealed from the order to the circuit court of Shenandoah county which, after a hearing and a consideration of evidence, affirmed the order and allowed to plaintiffs in error $100 to cover the expense of removal of the cedars. Neither the judgment of the court nor the statute as interpreted allows compensation for the value of the standing cedars or the decrease in the market value of the realty caused by their destruction whether considered as ornamental trees or otherwise. But they save to plaintiffs in error the privilege of using the trees when felled. On appeal the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the judgment. Miller v. State Entomologist, 146 Va. 175, 135 S. E. 813. Both in the circuit court and the Supreme Court of Appeals plaintiffs in error challenged the constitutionality of the statute under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the case is properly here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237a (28 USCA  344).\n The Virginia statute presents a comprehensive scheme for the condemnation and destruction of red cedar trees infected by cedar rust. By section 1 it is declared to be unlawful for any person to 'own, plant or keep alive and standing' on his premises any red cedar tree which is or may be the source or 'host plant' of the communicable plant disease known as cedar rust, and any such tree growing within a certain radius of any apple orchard is declared to be a public nuisance, subject to destruction. Section 2 makes it the duty of the state entomologist, 'upon the \n\n[276 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n request in writing of ten or more reputable freeholders of any county or magisterial district, to make a preliminary investigation of the locality ... to ascertain if any cedar tree or trees ... are the source of, harbor or constitute the host plant for the said disease ... and constitute a menace to the health of any apple orchard in said locality, and that said cedar tree or trees exist within a radius of two miles of any apple orchard in said locality.' If affirmative findings are so made, he is required to direct the owner in writing to destroy the trees and, in his notice, to furnish a statement of the 'fact found to exist whereby it is deemed necessary or proper to destroy' the trees and to call attention to the law under which it is proposed to destroy them. Section 5 authorizes the state entomologist to destroy the trees if the owner, after being notified, fails to do so. Section 7 furnishes a mode of appealing from the order of the entomologist to the circuit court of the county, which is authorized to 'hear the objections' and 'pass upon all questions involved,' the procedure followed in the present case.\n As shown by the evidence and as recognized in other cases involving the validity of this statute, Bowman v. Virginia State Entomologist, 128 Va. 351, 105 S. E. 141, 12 A. L. R. 1121; Kelleher v. Schoene (D. C.) 14 F . (2d) 341, cedar rust is an infectious plant disease in the form of a fungoid organism which is destructive of the fruit and foliage of the apple, but without effect on the value of the cedar. Its life cycle has two phases which are passed alternately as a growth on red cedar and on apple trees. It is communicated by spores from one to the other over a radius of at least two miles. It appears not to be communicable between trees of the same species, but only from one species to the other, and other plants seem not to be appreciably affected by it. The only practicable method of controlling the disease and protecting apple trees from its ravages is the destruc- \n\n[276 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n tion of all red cedar trees, subject to the infection, located within two miles of apple orchards.\n The red cedar, aside from its ornamental use, has occasional use and value as lumber. It is indigenous to Virginia, is not cultivated or dealt in commercially on any substantial scale, and its value throughout the state is shown to be small as compared with that of the apple orchards of the state. Apple growing is one of the principal agricultural pursuits in Virginia. The apple is used there and exported in large quantities. Many millions of dollars are invested in the orchards, which furnish employment for a large portion of the population, and have induced the development of attendant railroad and cold storage facilities.\n On the evidence we may accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Appeals that the state was under the necessity of making a choice between the preservation of one class of property and that of the other wherever both existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been none the less a choice if, instead of enacting the present statute, the state, by doing nothing, had permitted serious injury to the apple orchards within its borders to go on unchecked. When forced to such a choice the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another which, in the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public. It will not do to say that the case is merely one of a conflict of two private interests and that the misfortune of apple growers may not be shifted to cedar owners by ordering the destruction of their property; for it is obvious that there may be, and that here there is, a preponderant public concern in the preservation of the one interest over the other. Compare Bacon v. Walker, \n204 \nU.S. 311\n, 27 S. Ct. 289; Missouri, Kansas & Texas R. Co. v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267\n, 24 S. Ct. 638; Chicago, Terre Haute & Southeastern R. Co. v.

And where the public interest is involved \n\n[276 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n preferment of that interest over the property interest of the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects property.

For where, as here, the choice is unavoidable, we cannot say that its exercise, controlled by considerations of social policy which are not unreasonable, involves any denial of due process. The injury to property here is no more serious, nor the public interest less, than in Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, supra, Northwestern Laundry v. Des Moines, supra, Reinman v. Little Rock, supra, or Sligh v. Kirkwood, supra.\n The statute is not, as plaintiffs in error argue, subject to the vice which invalidated the ordinance considered by this court in Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137\n, 33 S. Ct. 76, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1123, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 192. That ordinance directed the committee on streets of the city of Richmond to establish a building line, not less than five nor more than thirty feet from the street line whenever requested to do so by the owners of two-thirds of the property abutting on the street in question. No property owner might build beyond the line so established. Of this the court said (page 143 (33 S. Ct. 77)):\n'It (the ordinance) leaves no discretion in the committee on streets as to whether the street (building, semble) line shall or shall not be established in a given case. The action of the committee is determined by two-thirds of the property owners. In \n\n[276 U.S. 272, 281]\n\u00a0\n other words, part of the property owners fronting on the block determine the extent of use that other owners shall make of their lots, and against the restriction they are impotent.'\n\n The function of the property owners there is in no way comparable to that of the 'ten or more reputable freeholders' in the Cedar Rust Act. They do not determine the action of the state entomologist. They merely request him to conduct an investigation. In him is vested the discretion to decide, after investigation, whether or not conditions are such that the other provisions of the statute shall be brought into action; and his determination is subject to judicial review. The property of plaintiffs in error is not subjected to the possibly arbitrary and irresponsible action of a group of private citizens.\n The objection of plaintiffs in error to the vagueness of the statute is without weight. The state court has held it to be applicable and that is enough when, by the statute, no penalty can be incurred or disadvantage suffered in advance of the judicial ascertainment of its applicability.

AEBY(1928)\nNo. 100\nArgued: December 1, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Merritt U. Hayden, of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n Mr. Patrick H. Cullen, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is a common carrier of interstate commerce by railroad. Respondent was its station agent at Magness, Ark., and, January 13, 1921, while employed in such commerce, fell on the station platform and was injured. She brought this action in the circuit court of St. Louis, Mo., claiming damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (U. S. C. tit. 45, c. 2,  51 (45 USCA  51; Comp. St.  8657)), on the ground that her injuries resulted by reason of a defect or insufficiency in the platform due to petitioner's negligence. The jury returned a verdict, and the court entered judgment thereon, in her favor. Petitioner took the case to the Supreme Court, and contended that the platform was not a part of its 'works,' within the meaning of the act, that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a finding that petitioner was guilty of actionable negligence, that respondent assumed the risk, and that her own negligence was the sole cause of her injuries. That court decided all these questions adversely to the petitioner and affirmed the judgment. 313 Mo. 492, 285 S. W. 965. Certiorari was granted. \n273 \nU.S. 679\n, 47 S. Ct. 108.\n The act makes the carrier liable for injuries resulting to its employe  by reason of any defect or insufficiency due \n\n[275 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n to its negligence in 'its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.' The language is broad and includes things and places furnished by the carriers to be used by their employees in the performance of their work. The platform was intended to be and was used by respondent to do station work. Having regard to the beneficent purposes of the act, it would be unreasonable to hold that, when so used, a station platform is not covered by the word 'works' in the above-quoted provision. The Supreme Court rightly held that the clause applied.\n Respondent had lived for years in that part of Arkansas. She was petitioner's ticket agent at Morefield from March 20, 1919, until July 2, 1920; then she became the station agent at Magness, and remained in that position until a few days after she was injured. She had charge of the station, did book work, sold tickets, handled mail, baggage, express, etc. She was the only person regularly performing station work, and for some time before the accident she lived in the station building. It was a one- story structure, 16 feet wide by 48 feet long, located south of, parallel to, and 10 feet from the track. The waiting room occupied the west end, and adjoining it there was an office having a bay window toward the track. The waiting room door, in front of which were two steps, was just west of the bay window. The platform was made of 'chat,' described as small gravel and crushed stone. It was something like a cinder path. There were no gutters on the eaves, and water falling from the roof made a depression or kind of ditch. The chat was loose, and sloped toward the building, and some of the rain falling on the platform, as well as the water from the roof, reached the depression under the eaves and drained past the steps to the west. The depression was about 4 inches deep, and, by reason of the slope, its bottom was about 12 inches lower than the highest part of the platform. The depres- \n\n[275 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n sion existed when respondent came to work at Magness, and in front of the steps it was about 4 feet square. That condition was caused by water and the passage of people going to and from the waiting room. When it rained, there accumulated in this and other depressions on the platform puddles of water, which gradually disappeared. By the time of the accident, the depression in front of the steps had become somewhat larger and deeper, by reason of rains and constant use. Its surface was rough. No ice had formed there after respondent came. The platform was dry the evening before the accident. During the night it rained, froze, and snowed. Respondent and another woman slept in the station. A train was due shortly after 6 in the morning. They got up about 6; it was dark; respondent lit a lamp, and also a lantern, that was kept for use about the place. They went out and moved the truck from the west end of the building to a place near the track. The steps were covered with snow and ice. There was about 3 inches of snow on the platform. The truck was frozen to the ground and covered with ice. There was no light on the platform. The lamp and lantern were left inside, and it does not appear that either was placed to give light through the bay window or otherwise upon or about the steps or platform. Going out, respondent stepped off the west end of the steps. When returning to the waiting room, she approached from the north. There was ice under the snow immediately in front of the steps; she tripped on something rough, slipped. fell, and was injured.\n This case is governed by the act and the applicable principles of common law as established and applied in federal courts. There is no liability in the absence of negligence on the part of the carrier. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann.

Its duty in respect of the platform did not make petitioner an insurer of re- \n\n[275 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n spondent's safety; there was no guaranty that the place would be absolutely safe. The measure of duty in such cases is reasonable care, having regard to the circumstances. Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658, 664\n, 21 S. Ct. 75; Washington, etc., Railroad Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 570\n, 10 S. Ct. 1044; Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co., \n122 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 7 S. Ct. 1166. The petitioner was not required to have any particular type or kind of platform, or to maintain it in the safest and best possible condition. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 45 S. Ct. 169. No employment is free from danger. Fault or negligence on the part of petitioner may not be inferred from the mere fact that respondent fell and was hurt. She knew that it had rained and that the place was covered with ice and snow. Her knowledge of the situation and of whatever danger existed was at least equal to that chargeable against the petitioner. Petitioner was not required to give her warning. National Biscuit Co. v. Nolan (C. C. A.) 138 F. 6, 12. It is a matter of common knowledge that almost everywhere there are to be found in public ways and on private grounds numerous places in general use by pedestrians that in similar weather are not materially unlike the place where respondent fell. Under the circumstances, it cannot reasonably be held that failure of petitioner to remove the snow and ice violated any duty owed to her. The obligation in respect of station platforms and the like owed by carriers to their passengers or to others coming upon their premises for the transaction of business is greater than that due their employees accustomed to work thereon. The reason is that the latter, familiar with the situation, are deemed voluntarily to take the risk of known conditions and dangers. Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co., supra, 194 (7 S. Ct. 1166). The facts of this case, when taken most favorably to the respondent, are not sufficient to sustain a finding that petitioner failed in any duty owed \n\n[275 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n to her. Nelson v. Southern Ry. Co., \n246 \nU.S. 253\n, 38 S. Ct. 233. As negligence on the part of the petitioner is essential, we need not consider its contentions in respect of assumption of risk and negligence on the part of respondent.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMITCHELL v.

Bend county, Texas, partners, were adjudicated bankrupts both as a firm and individually. They were bankers and depositors of county funds. As such they had given two joint and several bonds both signed by the firm in its firm name as principal and by some of the members of the firm \n\n[276 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n individually, with others, as sureties. The county sought to prove its claim not only against the firm but also against the separate estates of the surviving members all of whom had bound themselves severally as well as jointly. The double proof was allowed by the District Court but was disallowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the Bankruptcy Act,  5f, by appropriating the individual estate of a partner to his individual debts excluded by implication debts that were also debts of the partnership from sharing with the former on equal terms. Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 548; Code, tit. 11, c. 3,  23 (11 USCA  23); (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 3.\n We are of opinion that the District Court was right. Except so far as the statute may prevent it a solvent man dealing with another for money to be advanced to or deposited with his firm may determine the security to be given as he and the other may agree. He may mortgage his private estate and we perceive no reason why he may not create a claim against it in bankruptcy by a separate contract of his own. The firm creditors know that they will be postponed to individual creditors, and that they have no voice or knowledge as to who the individual creditors shall be, or what the amount of their claims. The only real equity is not to disturb the equilibrium established by the parties. Those who take less security have no claim to be put on a footing with those who require more. It is not necessary to go into nice speculations as to what a partner can add to the liability already incurred when he offers a separate contract in addition to that which is made by his firm. We may assume that by the firm contract he is bound to the uttermost farthing-but he is bound only as a member of the firm and therefore subject to the bankruptcy rule. His creditor may require more and we can see nothing to hinder his putting himself in the position of a separate \n\n[276 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n debtor also. Certainly we find no prohibition in the bankruptcy law. Myers v. International Trust Co., \n273 \nU.S. 380\n, 47 S. Ct. 372.

YELLOWSTONE COUNTY(1928)\nNo. 207\nArgued: January 20, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Horace S. Davis, of Billings, Mont., and M. S. Gunn, of Helena, Mont., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. L. A. Foot, of Helena, Mont.,\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States, is engaged in a general commercial banking business in Yellowstone county, Montana. For the year 1925, an assessment for taxes was made by the assessor of Yellowstone county upon the shareholders, based upon the value of their shares of stock in the bank. The bank owned no real estate. In pursuance of the assessment, taxes were levied in the aggregate sum of $3,897.84 and demand was made for the payment of 50 per cent. of that amount, as provided by the Montana statutes. The bank paid the sum demanded under protest, claiming that the assessment and levy and the statutes of Montana under which they were made were invalid as being in conflict with Rev. Stats.  5219 (12 USCA  548), with certain provisions of the Constitution of Montana, and with the due process and equal protection of law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This action was then brought by the bank in behalf of its shareholders to recover the amount of the payment. The court of first instance sustained a general demurrer to the complaint and rendered final judgment against plaintiff in error, which, upon appeal to the state Supreme Court, was affirmed. 78 Mont. 62, 252 P. 876.\n Here the argument is confined to the question whether there is a violation of the restriction upon the state power of taxation contained in Rev. Stats.  5219, that the taxation of shares of national banking associations 'shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state.' \n\n[276 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n The contention that the laws of Montana, under which the assessment and levy were made, contravenue this restriction, rests upon the fact that shares of national banks were valued for assessment purposes at an amount equivalent to the value of the corporate assets, including Liberty Loan bonds and similar securities of the United States, and were taxed accordingly, while shares of state banks were not assessed or taxed at all, and the banks themselves were taxed upon the value of their assets, after excluding such bonds and similar securities.\n It is clear that the state statutes, as construed by the state Supreme Court in the present case, do not produce the discrimination asserted or any discrimination in favor of the moneyed capital employed by state banks in competition with national banks. That court now holds that the provisions of the state Constitution and statutes require the state to tax the property of every state bank and also the shares to the extent that they have a value beyond that of the taxable property of the bank. In assessing and imposing taxes upon the corporations, the value of the United States securities owned by the corporations is excluded, because such securities are exempted from state taxation by the laws of the United States. But in the taxation of shares of state as well as of national banks, the value of these securities, so far as it contributes to the value of the shares, is included, because the shares are the property of the shareholders distinct from the corporate assets, which are the property of the banks. See Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 518\n, 27 S. Ct. 571.\n If this were all, there would be no discrimination within the meaning of the federal law. But it is not all. The assessment, as actually made, clearly violated the restriction in section 5219 here relied upon, and it was made in conformity with the state statutes as construed by the state Supreme Court in the earlier case of East Helena State \n\n[276 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n Bank v. Rogers, 73 Mont. 210, 236 P. 1090. In that case the requirement of the statutes, so far as it applied to state banks, was stated by the court as follows (page 217 (236 P. 1092)):\n'This state had the option to tax the shares of stock in state banks to the individual shareholders, or to tax the property of such banks to the banks themselves. It could not tax both at the same time. Section 17, art. 12, Constitution of Montana. If it had chosen the first alternative, it might then have assessed the shares at their full cash value without reference to the character of the securities in which the bank's funds were invested (Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes); but it chose to tax the property of the banks, and must abide the consequences.'\n\n The taxing officials, conforming to this construction of the state law, as they were bound to do, while they assessed, levied and collected the tax now under review, laid no tax whatever upon shares of state banking corporations, although, as the record shows, these shares had a very large taxable value over and above the value of the taxable property of the banks, due to the ownership by the banks of tax-exempt federal securities. That this resulted in a substantial discrimination against plaintiff in error within the meaning of the restriction contained in section 5219 does not admit of doubt. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 581; Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 148\n, 152 S., 7 S. Ct. 826; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 664, 677\n, 19 S. Ct. 537.\n Nevertheless, it is contended for the defendants in error that, since the exemption from taxation of the federal securities in the hands of the state banks is created by federal statute, the discrimination is one which the state could not avoid. It is said that it was so decided in Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S. Ct. 23. But this view of that decision is entirely erroneous. The statutes of Iowa there under review expressly provide that shares \n\n[276 U.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n of stock in national banks and state and savings banks and loan and trust companies located in the state shall be assessed to the individual stockholders, and shares of national banks and those of competing state corporations are put, for purposes of taxation, upon terms of exact equality. The provision of the Iowa statute which was assailed related to the assessment of capital employed by individual bankers (p. 105 (44 S. Ct. 23)), and this court held that the restriction of section 5219 was not violated because the state, perforce, allowed a deduction of federal securities in assessing the capital of such individual bankers; that the federal law made such securities exempt and the state merely respected the exemption. Page 117 (44 S. Ct. 23). The decision in no way affects the rule (Van Allen v. Assessors and other cases, supra) that in respect of the taxation of state corporate banks, the shares must be taxed as they are in the case of national banks, so far as necessary to prevent discrimination, and that, in neither case, does the exemption of federal securities apply in the taxation of such shares.\n It is true that the state Supreme Court in the present case expressly repudiated the construction theretofore put by it upon the state statutes in the Rogers Case, supra, and, as already stated, adopted one to the exact contrary. But that does not cure the mischief which had been done under the earlier construction. That construction had already been acted upon by the taxing officials and the application thus made of the statutes had given rise to the present cause of action and an undoubted right to recover thereon. The statutes, as thus construed and applied to the concrete facts of the case, were invalid; and this is enough to justify the challenge here under consideration. Cudahy Co. v. Parramore, \n263 \nU.S. 418, 422\n, 44 S. Ct. 153, 30 A. L. R. 532; Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 42 S. Ct. 529, 28 A. L. R. 1207. Plaintiff in error cannot be deprived of its legal right to recover the amount of the tax unlawfully exacted of it \n\n[276 U.S. 499, 505]\n\u00a0\n by the later decision which, while repudiating the construction under which the unlawful exaction was made, leaves the monies thus exacted in the public treasury.\n But it is said that the taxing officers of the county, in view of the later decision, now have the power to tax the shares of state banks and thus bring about an equality. As to this it is unnecessary to say more than that it nowhere appears that these officers, if they possess the power, have undertaken to exercise it or that they have any intention of ever doing so. It will be soon enough to invite consideration of this purely speculative suggestion when, if ever, the taxing officials shall have put it into practical effect.\n Finally, it is urged that plaintiff in error may not maintain this action because of its failure to apply to the county board of equalization for an administrative remedy. We do not stop to inquire whether under any circumstances such remedy was open to the taxpayer, for the short answer is that the decision of the Supreme Court of Montana in the Rogers Case would have rendered any such application utterly futile since the county board of equalization was powerless to grant any appropriate relief in the face of that conclusive decision.

Ct. 38, 72 L. Ed. -. \n\n[276 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n Respondent created a district for the construction of a sewer to be paid for by assessments against the lands therein according to resulting benefits. The statutes require the city engineer to make estimates of the cost of such improvements, provide that no contract shall be made for any work for a price in excess of the estimate, and direct the city council to pass an ordinance defining the boundaries of the district, describing the work, and showing the estimated cost. Idaho C. S. 1919,  3879 and 4129. The engineer's estimate was $118,300. Assessments were made for that amount; and, pursuant to ordinance adopted December 6, 1920, bonds for $ 117,000 were issued. The validity of these is not questioned. It was found that the estimate was too low, and an ordinance was passed stating that the assessments first made were not sufficient to pay the cost and expenses of the work. Additional assessments amounting to $49,500 were made; and, pursuant to ordinance of January 10, 1921, respondent executed and, on March 8, 1921, delivered to a purchaser additional bonds for $43, 000. On that day the mayor, clerk, and treasurer of respondent issued a certificate under its seal stating that no litigation was pending or threatened in respect of the creation of the district, the construction of the sewer, or the issue of the bonds.\n A transcript of the proceedings and that certificate were submitted to the attorneys, who are acting for petitioner in this case, for examination as to the validity of the bonds. And they, it is alleged, relying upon the recitals in the bonds and the statements in the certificate, gave a written opinion that the bonds were valid. The complaint alleges that on July 13, 1921, petitioner, relying upon such recitals, certificate, and opinion, purchased three of these bonds. And petitioner says that the statement in the certificate was material because no suit to enjoin the making of special assessments or to set them aside may be brought after the expiration of thirty days from \n\n[276 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n the making of the assessment. Section 4137, C. S. 1919. The certificate was false. One Lucas, an owner of property in the district, had brought suit against the city and its officers to have the assessments in excess of the engineer's estimate declared illegal and to enjoin their collection. The trial court granted the relief sought; the Supreme Court held that the city was limited and bound by the original estimate and affirmed the judgment. Lucas v. City of Nampa, 41 Idaho, 35, 238 P. 288. Petitioner avers that under this decision his bonds are worthless.\n He insists that respondent was negligent in failing to have a proper estimate and valid assessments made and in causing the false certificate to be issued, and that the damages claimed were caused by the negligence and misrepresentation. The suit is for tort. The demurrer was rightly sustained, unless the complaint shows that a breach by respondent of some duty it owed petitioner caused the damage claimed.\n Each bond states that respondent acknowledges itself to be indebted and promises to pay bearer the sum stated; it contains recitals to the effect that all the things by law required in respect of the creation of the district, the construction of the sewer, and the issue of the bond in order to make it a valid obligation of the city have been done. It states that the total cost of the work has been assessed, and that the assessments are liens upon the land; that provision has been made for, and the city guarantees, the collection of assessments sufficient to pay accruing interest and principal at maturity. But, as required by statute, each bond declares that the holder shall have to claim against the city except for the collection of the assessments, that his remedy in case of nonpayment shall be confined to their enforcement, and that the interest and principal shall be payable out of that fund and not otherwise. The bonds are not negotiable. United States Mortgage Co. v. Sperry, \n138 \nU.S. 313, 343\n, 11 S. Ct. 321. It is clear \n\n[276 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n that respondent's faith or credit is not pledged and that the value of the bond depends upon the validity and worth of the assessments. The transcript furnished the examining attorneys showed that the engineer's estimate was too low and that the bonds in question were based on assessments in excess of that amount. Petitioner treats the transcript and false certificate as if furnished to him. He is charged, as of the time he bought the bonds, with notice of the invalidating facts, and is held to have known the law. His position is not strengthened by the fact that respondent's officers, as well as the examining attorneys, were mistaken as to the validity of the additional assessments and subsequent proceedings. Recitals that merely reflect opinion as to the legal effect of the bonds or of the statements therein are not actionable and furnish no support for petitioner's claim.\n The bonds were void, as held in the Lucas Case, because issued upon assessments made in excess of the engineer's estimate. On the facts disclosed by the complaint, actionable negligence cannot be predicated on the failure of respondent's officers properly to exert their powers and perform their duties in respect of the estimate, assessment, and contract for construction of the sewer. Such failure was not a breach of duty owed by respondent to petitioner. He had no relation to the matter until long after the bonds had been issued and sold to another. The facts showing their invalidity were disclosed by the transcript and known to the attorneys on whom he relied long before he purchased them. The complaint is not grounded on anything subsequently occurring.\n It remains to be considered whether petitioner may recover by reason of the certificate issued March 8, 1921, falsely stating that there was no suit in respect of the creation of the district, the construction of the sewer, or the issue of the bonds. No law required or authorized the making of any certificate. The statutes do not contem- \n\n[276 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n plate any such statement. It is not a part of or material to the prescribed proceedings. The city council is the governing body of the city, but it did not make or authorize the statement. The officers who signed the certificate were not authorized to define the improvement district, make the assessment, issue or sell the bonds or to bind the respondent to pay for such improvements. It cannot reasonably be said that they are impliedly authorized to make any statement or give assurance in respect of such matters.\n This action is not based on contract. Recovery is not claimed on the ground that respondent was empowered to pay for the work out of funds belonging to it or upon any promise that it would do so. As no actionable negligence or misrepresentation is shown, the lower courts rightly held that no cause of action is stated in the complaint. We find no conflict between the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case and the decisions referred to in the petition for this writ.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Peake v.

Young, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n N. & G. Taylor Company, a partnership composed of Taylor and Justice, had long been engaged in the manu- \n\n[275 U.S. 431, 436]\n\u00a0\n facture of tin plate. November 1, 1916, respondents and that partnership entered into a contract by which the former agreed to furnish, in fairly equal monthly quantities, and the latter agreed to take and pay for the fuel oil required by it, estimated at 1,200,000 gallons, for the eight months ending June 30, 1917. On January 31, 1917, the partners caused petitioner to be organized, giving it the name of the partnership with the word 'Incorporated' added. As of February 1, 1917, the corporation assumed the liabilities of the partnership and took over all its property and has since carried on the business.\n The petitioner commenced this action in the Northern district of Illinois, Eastern division, March 7, 1918. The declaration alleged an agreement between respondents and petitioner for the delivery of the oil, a breach by respondents, and resulting damage. No reference was made to the partnership, the contract between it and respondents, the subsequent creation of petitioner or its acquisition of the business. At the trial in May, 1924, petitioner by leave of court filed an amended declaration alleging that respondents and the partnership made an agreement for the oil in question; that on February 1, 1917, petitioner became the owner of all the assets of the firm including the agreement and all rights appertaining to it; that respondents failed and refused to deliver the oil either prior to February 1, 1917, to the partnership or afterwards to the petitioner-except approximately 40,000 gallons which was delivered to the partnership-and that thereby petitioner itself and as successor of the firm was subjected to great loss. Section 18 of the Illinois Practice Act ( chapter 110, Cahill's Revised Statutes 1927) provides that the assignee of any chose in action not negotiable may sue thereon in his own name, 'and he shall in his pleading on oath, or by his affidavit, where pleading is not required, allege that he is the actual bona fide owner thereof, and set forth how \n\n[275 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n and when he acquired title. ...' In order to comply with that provision, the petitioner filed the affidavit of its president, stating that on February 1, 1917, it took over the partnership assets including the contract and a right of action against respondents for its breach from the time it went into force to January 31, 1917\n\n\n Respondents, by plea to the amended declaration, set up a statute of Illinois (Revised Statutes, c. 83, par. 21) declaring that, when a cause of action has arisen in another state 'and by the laws thereof an action thereon cannot be maintained by reason of the lapse of time, an action thereon shall not be maintained in this state,' and one of Pennsylvania ( section 13857, Pennsylvania Statutes) providing that actions on contracts must be commenced within six years from the time the right of action accrued, and alleged that the cause of action arose in Pennsylvania more than six years before the filing of the amended declaration and was barred by the laws of both states. The trial court held that the amended declaration stated a new cause of action and that it was barred, directed a verdict and gave judgment for the respondents. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 14 F.(2d) 353. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 681\n, 47 S. Ct. 237.\n Section 18 of the Illinois Practice Act will be applied in the courts of the United States sitting in that state. R. S.  914 (28 USCA  724; Comp. St.  1537); Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co., \n133 \nU.S. 473, 488\n, 10 S. Ct. 399. In the absence of such a provision an assignee of a nonnegotiable chose in action could not sue in his own name. Glenn v. Marbury, \n145 \nU.S. 499, 509\n, 12 S. Ct. 914. The advantage conferred is taken subject to the terms specified, and the assignee must make the required showing in respect of ownership and source of title. It is established by the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois that in an action under that section a declaration that does not state that plaintiff is the actual bona fide owner thereof \n\n[275 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n and set forth how and when he acquired title fails to state a cause of action. And it is also held that a cause of action set forth in a declaration amended to comply with that section is barred if the period fixed by the statute of limitations has expired when the amended pleading is filed. Applying the state law, it must be held that the amended declaration set up a new cause of action which was then barred. Gallagher v. Schmidt, 313 Ill. 40, 144 N. E. 319; Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v. Chicago, 297 Ill. 444, 130 N. E. 736.\n Petitioner invokes R. S.  954 (28 USCA  777; Comp. St.  1591), providing that any court of the United States may at any time permit either of the parties to amend any defect in the pleadings upon such conditions as it shall in its discretion and by its rules prescribe. And it contends that federal courts allow such amendments independently of state enactments and decisions, and that here the amended declaration complied with section 18 of the Illinois act, but stated no new cause of action.\n Section 954 governs amendments and is to be liberally construed. Norton v. Larney, \n266 \nU.S. 511, 516\n, 45 S. Ct. 145, and cases cited. But the propriety of the filing of the amended declaration is not involved as permission was granted on the application of the petitioner. The substance of the change is to be regarded. In any view, a new cause of action was brought im more than six years after it accrued. The original declaration alleged an agreement between respondents and petitioner and set it out in haec verba. It was a letter dated November 1, 1916, addressed to 'N. & G. Taylor Company,' and signed by respondents. The words 'Accepted. N. & G. Taylor Co.,' appeared at the end of the letter. That declaration did not attempt to state a cause of action under section 18 of the state Practice Act. Petitioner did not sue or claim as assignee. No reference was made to the contract between respondents and the partnership. The cause of action \n\n[275 U.S. 431, 439]\n\u00a0\n there stated never existed. The amended declaration states a cause of action for breach of the contract that was made by the partnership. It cannot be treated as curing a defective statement of a cause of action therefore attempted to be set up. Cf. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, \n240 \nU.S. 214, 222\n, 36 S. Ct. 321. The change was not merely one of form; the fundamental substance of the claim was different. Cf. Friederichsen v. Renard, \n247 \nU.S. 207, 213\n, 38 S. Ct. 450. It is clear that the amended declaration substituted a new cause of action. Petitioner cites and relies on Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 \nU.S. 570\n, 33 S. Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134. But that case does not support its contention. There the amendment, allowed after the expiration of the period prescribed by the statute of limitations, related to form and not to the substance of the cause of action. The court said ( page 576 (33 S. Ct. 137)):\n'It introduced no new or different cause of action, nor did it set up any different state of facts as the ground of action, and therefore it related back to the beginning of the suit.'\n\n And it is plain that six years had expired when the amended declaration was filed. Respondents were in default when petitioner took over the business February 1, 1917. That appears from the allegations of the amended declaration as well as from the supporting affidavit. The contract covered fuel oil required in a period ending June 30, 1917. The action was commenced March 7, 1918; the cause of action had then accrued. The amended declaration was filed May 14, 1924, more than six years after the action was commenced. It cannot be deemed to relate back as it brought in a new cause of action, which must be treated as commenced at the time the amended declaration was filed. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Wyler, \n158 U.S. 285\n, 296, et seq., 15 S. Ct. 877; Salyers v. United States ( C. C. A.) 257 F. 255, 259.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAGLE v. LOI HOA(1928)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George W. Hott, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 476]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, Chinese merchants born in China and never naturalized elsewhere, applied at the port of San Francisco for admission into the United States. They had resided in French Indo-China and been engaged in business there for a number of years. They presented to the immigration authorities certificates of identification issued by officials of French Indo-China, with visas by the American Consul at Saigon, French Indo-China. They were denied admission on the ground that the certificate of identification required by section 6 of the Chinese Exclusion Act (Act of May 6, 1882, c. 126, 22 Stat. 58, 60 as amended by the Act of July 5, 1884, c. 220, 23 Stat. 115, 116, 117; U. S. C. title 8,  265 (8 USCA  265)), was a certificate of the government of which respondents were subjects, in this case the Chinese government, and not a certificate of the government of French Indo-China, where respondents merely resided. Their petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied by the District Court for Northern California. On appeal the two cases were consolidated in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the judgments of the District Court reversed. Loi Hoa v. Nagle, 13 F.(2d) 80. This court granted certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 682\n, 47 S. Ct. 237.\n Article 2 of the treaty of November 17, 1880, between the United States and China (22 Stat. 826, 827), provides for the admission of Chinese subjects 'proceeding to the United States as ... merchants.' Section 15 of the Exclusion Act, as amended (8 USCA  273), makes the act applicable 'to all subjects of China and Chinese, whether subjects of China or any other foreign power.' Section 6 as amended (the relevant portions are in the margin1) requires \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 477]\n\u00a0\n 'every Chinese person, other than a laborer, who may be entitled by said treaty or this act' to admission, to 'obtain the permission of and be identified as so entitled by the Chinese government, or of such other foreign government of which at the time such Chinese person shall be a subject.' The sole question presented is whether the word 'subject' as used in section 6 is to be taken as including only those persons who by birth or naturalization owe permanent allegiance to the government issuing the certificate, or as embracing also those who, being domiciled within the territorial limits of that government, owe it for that reason obedience and temporary allegiance.\n The word may be used in either sense. See The Pizarro, 2 Wheat. 227, 245; Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147, 154, 21 L. E. 426. If the narrower meaning be the appropriate one, the respondents were 'subjects' of the Chinese government, and it alone could issue certificates entitling them to admission. The government of French Indo- China could issue such certificates only to persons of the Chinese race who owed it permanent allegiance.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that, since the statute was in execution of a treaty with China, which related only to the immigration of Chinese nationals, the provisions in section 6 for the certification of identity could have no application to persons of Chinese race who were nationals of other governments, and so concluded that certificates were required of governments other than China only in the case of Chinese nationals resident under those governments.\n But in this view it is overlooked that the amended Exclusion Act is broader than the treaty. Before the amendment the federal courts had not agreed whether \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 478]\n\u00a0\n persons of Chinese race who were nationals of countries other than China were affected by the statute. United States v. Douglas (C. C.) 17 F. 634; In re Ah Lung (C. C.) 18 F. 28. Section 15 of the amended act made all its provisions applicable 'to all subjects of China and Chinese, whether subjects of China or any other foreign power.' The avowed purpose of the amendment was to alter the act as interpreted in United States v. Douglas, supra, where it had been held to have no application to Chinese subjects of Great Britain. Report of Committee on Foreign Affairs, 48th Cong. 1st. Sess. H. Rep. 614, p. 2.2 The purpose, therefore, of the insertion in section 6 of the phrase 'of such other foreign government of which at the time such Chinese person shall be a subject' was to require Chinese immigrants owing permanent allegiance to governments other than China to present certificates from the governments of their allegiance.\n Something may be said in support of the view that the more usual and, perhaps, more accurate use of the word 'subject' is that contended for by the government. Const. U. S. art. 3,  2; Hammerstein v. Lyne (D. C.) 200 F. 165; Dicey, Conflict of Laws (2d Ed.) 164. It is so used in our immigration and naturalization laws. Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29,  20, 39 Stat. 874, 890 (8 USCA  156); Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592,  4, 34 Stat. 596 (Comp. St.  4352). It may be said, also, that the importance of administrative convenience \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 479]\n\u00a0\n and certainty in a statute of this character suggests that the word was used as indicating citizenship by birth or naturalization, a status more easily ascertained than that of domicile or residence. But these considerations need not detain us in view of the history of the legislation, to which we have already referred, and of the long and consistent practical construction of the act.\n Both governments appear to have treated section 6 as amended as requiring the certificate to be issued by the Chinese government, except where the immigrant owes permanent allegiance to another foreign government. \n3\n The administrative regulations of the various departments have from the first required that the certificates of Chinese subjects coming from countries other than China be issued by Chinese consular officers. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[275 U.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n This interpretation was accepted by President Cleveland in his special message of April 6, 1886.5 8 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 391. He recommended legislation permitting the certificate in the case of Chinese nationals, resident in other foreign countries where there were no Chinese consular officers, to be issued by United States consuls in those countries. The Chinese government has uniformly authorized its diplomatic and consular officers in foreign countries to issue such certificates in the case of Chinese subjects resident there. \n6\n The validity of such certificates issued to Chinese subjects by consular officers of China in other foreign \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n countries had been recognized by the Department of State and upheld by the Attorney General. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Added weight is given to this course of practical construction by the history of article 3 of the treaty with China of March 17, 1894, 28 Stat. 1210, and of the later legislation re-enacting the Exclusion Act. Article 3 provided that Chinese subjects entitled to admission might 'produce a certificate from their government or the Government where they last resided.' The very fact that it was thought necessary to incorporate this provision in the treaty is a recognition that the pre-existing legislation did not have that effect. The treaty expired by limitation in 1904 and was not renewed. While it was in force Chinese nationals, resident abroad, could be admitted to the United States on presentation of a certificate either of the Chinese government, as authorized by section 6, or of the government of their residence, as permitted by the treaty. \n8\n During the life of the treaty the amended Exclusion Act, continued in force for 10 years from May 5, 1892, by the act of that date (chapter 60,  1, 27 Stat. 25 (Comp. St.  4315)), would have expired. But by the Act of April 29, 1902, c. 641,  1, 32 Stat. 176, 'all laws now in force ... regulating the coming of Chinese persons, ... into the United States, ... are hereby, re-enacted, extended, and continued so far as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations, until otherwise provided by law.' By this statute the certificate provisions of section 6 of the amended Exclusion Act were continued indefinitely and, on the expiration in 1904 of the treaty of 1894, became the only law on that subject. The reen- \n\n[275 U.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n actment of section 6 unchanged, and subject only to the provisions of a treaty now expired, must be accepted as a legislative approval of the practical construction the section had received. Compare National Lead Co v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140\n, 40 S. Ct. 237.\n If there could be doubt as to the proper interpretation of section 6 standing alone we think all ambiguity has been removed by the history of the legislation and the practical construction which has been given to it.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6. That in order to the faithful execution of the provisions of this act, every Chinese person, other than a laborer, who may be entitled by said treaty or this act to come within the United States, and who shall be about to come to the United States, shall obtain the permission of and be identified as so entitled by the Chinese government, or of such other foreign government of which at the time such Chinese person shall be a subject. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The very fact that the amended act went beyond the scope of the treaty and affected Chinese nationals of powers other than China was one source of the objections of the committee minority. 'It is perhaps worthy of notice that this section not only attempts to make more stringent restrictive regulations against Chinese laborers, subjects of China, with whom we have some show of right, under a treaty, to make them, and against the Chinese subjects of other nations, with whom we have no such treaty stipulations, but that its other provisions unquestionably exceed the scope of the treaty with China.' Report of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Views of the Minority, 48th Cong. 1st Sess. H. Rep. 614, p. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On December 6, 1884, in pursuance of the amendment of that year, the Secretary of the Treasury declared in a circular to the officers of the customs that 'Chinese subjects ... desiring to come to the United States from countries other than China, may do so on production of a certificate, ... to be issued by a Chinese diplomatic or consular officer, or if there be no such Chinese officer at such port, on a like certificate to be issued by a United States consular officer.' Foreign Relations, 1885, p. 192. Although this regulation, in so far as it permits the original issue of certificates to be made by American consular officers, went beyond the statute, it clearly indicates that Chinese nationals resident abroad were required to procure certificates not from the government of their residence but from the Chinese government or an American consular officer. In the case of certain Chinese merchants resident in Hong Kong, the Chinese government requested that the statute and regulation be so applied.

The court in banc sustained the excise, 256 Mass. 419, 152 N. E. 916, and in accordance with its rescript the court for Suffolk County dismissed the petitions. The writ for error was properly directed to the latter court. See Davis v. Cohen Co ., \n268 \nU.S. 638, 639\n, 45 S. Ct. 633 (69 L. Ed. 1129).\n The statute provides that every foreign corporation shall pay annually 'with respect to the carrying on or \n\n[277 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n doing of business by it within the Commonwealth,' an excise consisting in part of an amount 'equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it within the Commonwealth,' which is defined as 'such proportion of the fair cash value of all the shares constituting the capital stock ... as the value of the assets, both real and personal, employed in any business within the Commonwealth ... bears to the value of the total assets of the corporation,' with certain exceptions not here material. Section 30, cl. 4; section 39(1).\n The business of the National Leather Co.-hereinafter called the petitioner-was the purchasing of hides and skins, having them tanned by other companies, and selling the leather through the tanners. It operated no tanneries itself. Its business was conducted wholly in Massachusetts; its business offices were located there; and it carried on no active business outside the state. Among other properties it owned the entire capital stock, except a few qualifying shares, of the A. C. Lawrence Co. and the National Calfskin Co., two other Maine corporations. Its upper leather was tanned chiefly by these two subsidiary corporations; and its sole leather by other corporations in which it had no interest.\n The business of the Lawrence Company was the tanning of hides, principally for upper leather, which it sold on a commission basis. Most of its tanning was done for the petitioner. Its tanneries were in Massachusetts, where it was engaged in business, but it was qualified to do business and had selling branches in four or five other States. The business of the Calfskin Company was tanning hides of the petitioner. Its tannery was in Massachusetts, where it was engaged in business. It had no property or selling branches outside Massachusetts, and was not qualified to do business in any other State except Maine. \n\n[277 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n In determining the portions of the excises based upon 'corporate excess' the commissioner included all the capital stock of the Lawrence Company and the Calfskin Company owned by the petitioner, as part of the assets employed by it in business within Massachusetts; but did not include any stocks owned by it in other corporations which were not engaged in business within Massachusetts.\n The petitions for abatement were directed solely to the portions of the excises assessed by reason of this inclusion of the capital stocks of the Lawrence and Calfskin Companies.\n The petitioner contends that the inclusion of these stocks as part of the assets employed by it in business in Massachusetts for the purpose of measuring its taxable corporate excess is in effect the imposition of a tax upon the stocks themselves; that these stocks, as distinguished from the assets of the subsidiary corporations, had no situs in Massachusetts and were not within its jurisdiction; and that the statute, so applied, is therefore beyond the power of the State and violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Massachusetts court, in holding that the statute had been properly construed and applied by the commissioner and in sustaining the validity of the taxes, said:\n'The commissioner ... in determining under G. L. c. 63,  44, the 'corporate excess employed within the commonwealth by, every foreign corporation' doing domestic business here, is required to give those words the definition and to follow the legislative mandate in G. L. c. 63,  30, cl. 4. ... The petitioner held the stock in its two subsidiary corporations for the lawful prosecution of its business. All the facts recited lead to the conclusion that there was no error of law in including the shares of stock for computation of the excise of the petitioner. The entire business of the petitioner was con- \n\n[277 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n ducted in this Commonwealth, the certificates of stock of the subsidiary corporations actually were kept here, all the business of one and a large part of the business of the other was carried on here, and the petitioner made use of the activities of these subsidiary corporations as essential parts of its business. Without discussing whether any one or more of these factors standing alone would justify the method employed in ascertaining the excise, their collective force is sufficient to that end. The interpretation of the words of the statute requires this result. ... The language of the statute ... is explicit and its meaning is not clouded or obscure. It cannot render subject to direct taxation property not within the jurisdiction; but where other essential elements are present the excise is justified. ... Apart from the domicile of the several corporations and looking for the moment only at tangible property and its physical location, there is jurisdiction to sustain taxation in this Commonwealth. All the business of the petitioner and of one of its subsidiaries and a principal part of the business of the other subsidiary is conducted in Massachusetts. ... (There) is no direct tax on property, but an excise on a foreign corporation levied solely for the privilege of doing domestic business within this Commonwealth measured in part on the value of stock employed in business in this Commonwealth. ... The question whether the value of the stock of the Lawrence Company attributable to that part of its business and property in other States ought to have been deducted is not presented on this record. That relates to overvaluation, as to which a different remedy is provided. ... G. L. c. 63,  71.'\n\n For present purpose it may be assumed that the capital stocks of the two subsidiary companies had no situs in Massachusetts which brought them within the jurisdiction of that State for the purpose of imposing a direct property tax. See Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n\n[277 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n \n270 \nU.S. 69, 80\n, 46 S. Ct. 256 (70 L. Ed. 475, 43 A. L. R. 1374). But. here the statute does not impose any direct tax upon these stocks, and, as construed by the Massachusetts court, merely treats them as assets employed by the petitioner in its business within the State, and therefore requires that they be included when the total assets so employed by it are computed for the purpose of arriving at the proportionate part of the value of its own capital shares-determined by comparing the assets employed in business within the State with the total assets wheresoever employed or located-on which the excise for the privilege of carrying on its business within the State is imposed.\n It is settled law that a State may law-fully impose upon a foreign corporation a tax for the privilege of doing business within its borders which is measured by the proportionate part of its total gross receipts that are received within the State, Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217, 228\n, 12 S. Ct. 121, 163 (35 L. Ed. 994); or by the proportionate part of its total capital stock which is represented by the property located and business transacted within the State, Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, 258 U S. 290, 293, 42 S. Ct. 305 (66 L. Ed. 622); American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 447, 450; or by the proportionate part of its total net income which is attributable to the business carried on within the State, Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 41 S. Ct. 45 (65 L. Ed. 165); Bass, etc., Ltd., v. Tax Comm., \n266 \nU.S. 271, 282\n, 45 S. Ct. 82 (69 L. Ed. 282).\n Here both the commissioner, the administrative officer charged with the enforcement of the statute, and the Massachusetts court, have found that the capital stocks of the two subsidiary companies were employed by the petitioner in carrying on its business within Massachusetts. We find no adequate reason for disturbing this conclusion. On the contrary, looking to the substance of the transactions and not merely to form, we think that the petitioner, through its ownership of the capital stock of the two subsidiary corporations and the control which it \n\n[277 U.S. 413, 424]\n\u00a0\n thereby exercised over them, did, in a very real and practical sense, employ these stocks as an instrumentality in carrying on its business within Massachusetts-to the extent, at least, that the controlled activities and property of the subsidiary corporations were within the State. Cf. Edwards v. Chile Copper Co., \n270 \nU.S. 452, 456\n, 46 S. Ct. 345 ( 70 L. Ed. 678). And since the Massachusetts court did not determine whether the value of the stock in the Lawrence Company attributable to that part of its business and property in other States should have been deducted, for the reason that, as to such overvaluation, if any, a different statutory remedy was provided, we have no occasion to consider that question.\n It is said that under the Massachusetts statute the subsidiary corporations were subject to similar excises on their own account, and therefore there will be what is akin to double taxation. But we are not here concerned with an excise tax on the subsidiary corporations and need not consider its constitutional propriety either independently or in connection with the excise against the petitioner.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the effect of the challenged judgment is to tax property beyond the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, and that therefore it should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These proceedings were instituted under G.

The Court of Claims gave judgment for the United States (63 Ct. Cl. 256).\n The Revenue Act of 1921, approved November 23, 1921, chapter 136, tit. 2, Income Tax (42 Stat. 237, 238, 252, 261) provides:\n\n\n[277 U.S. 508, 517]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 213.

Four per centum of this is $2,695,279.12.\n During 1921 interest derived from all sources amounted to $3,811,132. 78; from dividends, nothing; from rents, $13,460-total, $3,824,592.78. $1, 125,788.26 of this interest came from tax-exempt securities-$873,075.66 from state and municipal obligations, and $252,712.60 from those of the United States.\n The collector treated interest plus dividends plus rents, $3,824,592. 78, as gross income, and allowed deductions amounting to $2,899,690.79, made up of the following items: $1,125,788.26, interest from tax-exempt securities; $1,569,490.86, the difference between 4 per cent. of the reserve fund ($2,695,279.12) and ($1,125,788.26) interest received from exempt securities; miscellaneous items, not contested \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 519]\n\u00a0\n and neglible here, $204,411.67. After deducting these from total receipts ($ 3,824,592.78-$2,899,690.79), there remained a balance of $924,901.99. This he regarded as net income, and upon it exacted 10 per centum, $92,490.20.\n If all interest received by the company had come from taxable securities, then, following the statute, there would have been deducted from the gross of $3,824,592.78-4 per cent. of the reserve, $2,695,279.12, plus the miscellaneous items $204,411.67-$2,899,690.79, and upon the balance of $924,901.99 the tax would have been $92,490.20. Thus it becomes apparent that petitioner was accorded no advantage by reason of ownership of tax-exempt securities.\n Petitioner maintains that the result of the collector's action was unlawfully to discriminate against it and really to exact payment on account of its exempt securities, contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States. Also that diminution of the ordinary deduction of 4 per cent. of the reserves because of interest received from tax-exempt securities, in effect, defeated the exemption guaranteed to their owners.\n The portion of petitioner's income from the three specified sources which Congress had power to tax-its taxable income-was the sum of these items less the interest derived from tax-exempt securities. Because of the receipt of interest from such securities, and to its full extent, pursuing the plan of the statute the collector diminished the 4 per cent. deduction allowable to those holding no such securities. Thus, he required petitioner to pay more upon its taxable income than could have been demanded had this been derived solely from taxable securities. If permitted, this would destroy the guaranteed exemption. One may not be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property solely because he owns some that is free. No device or form of words can deprive him of the exemption for which he has lawfully contracted. \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 520]\n\u00a0\n The suggestion that, as Congress may or may not grant deductions from gross income at pleasure, it can deny to one and give to another, is specious, but unsound. The burden from which federal and state obligations are free is the one laid upon other property. To determine what this burden is requires consideration of the mode of assessment, including, of course, deductions from gross values. What remains after subtracting all allowances is the thing really taxed.\n U. S. v. Ritchie (1872) Fed. Cas. No. 16168-Ritchie was the state's attorney for Frederick county, Md. The federal statute allowed an exemption of $1,000. The collector claimed that, if Ritchie's salary was held free from taxation, $1,000 of it should be applied to the exemption clause. Giles, J., held:\n'The United States could not apply the compensation of a state officer to the satisfaction of the exemption alone, because that would, indirectly, make his income from such source liable to the taxation from which it is exempt; that to exhaust the exemption clause by taking the amount out of his official income, would be to make it, in effect, subject to the revenue law, and to deny to a state's officer the advantage of the state's exemption, and that therefore the official income of defendant was not to be taken into consideration in the assessment of the tax.'\n\n People, etc., v. Commissioners, etc. (1870) 41 How. Prac. (N. Y.) 459, held: That, in determining the amount of personal property of an individual, by assessors or commissioners of taxes, for the purpose of taxation, stocks and bonds of the United States are to form no part of the estimate. They cannot be excluded or deducted from the amount of his assets, liable to taxation, for it is error to include them in such assets.\n Packard Motor Car Co. v. City of Detroit (1925) 232 Mich. 245, 205 N. W. 106 \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 521]\n\u00a0\n held: That tax-exempt credits may not be taxed, directly or indirectly, and in levying a tax on property they must be treated as nonexistent. The provision of Act No. 297, Pub. Acts 1921, providing that, if the person to be taxed 'shall be the owner of credits that are exempt from taxation such proportion only of his indebtedness shall be deducted from debts due or to become due as is represented by the radio between taxable credits and total credits owned, whether taxable or not,' is void as an interference with the power of the United States government to raise money by issuance of tax-exempt obligations, and is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.\n See, also, City of Waco v. Amicable Life Ins. Co. (Tex. Com. App. 1923) 248 S. W. 332.\n Miller et al., Executors, v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, held: That, where income from bonds of the United States which by act of Congress is exempt from state taxation is reached purposely, in the case of corporation owned bonds, by exempting the income therefrom in the hands of the corporations, and taxing only so much of the stockholder's dividends as corresponds to the corporate income not assessed, the tax is invalid.\n It is settled doctrine that directly to tax the income from securities amounts to taxation of the securities themselves, Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55 (November 21, 1927); also that the United States may not tax state or municipal obligations. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, Admx., \n269 \nU.S. 514, 521\n, 46 S. Ct. 172.\n How far the United States might repudiate their agreement not to tax we need not stop to consider. Counsel do not claim that here state obligations should have more favorable treatment than is accorded to those of the federal government. The Revenue Act of 1921 (section 213) expressly disavows any purpose to tax interest upon the latter's obligations. \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 522]\n\u00a0\n Section 1403 provides:\n'That if any provision of this act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the act, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.' Comp. St.  6371 4\/5 n.\n\n Congress had no power purposely and directly to tax state obligations by refusing to their owners deductions allowed to others. It had no purpose to subject obligations of the United States to burdens which could not be imposed upon those of a state.\n Considering what has been said, together with the saving clause just quoted, and the manifest general purpose of the statute, we think that provision of the act which undertook to abate the 4 per cent. deduction by the amount of interest received from tax-exempt securities cannot be given effect as against petitioner under the circumstances here disclosed. It was unlawfully required to pay $92,490.20, and is entitled to recover.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims (63 Ct. Cl. 256) must be reversed. If within ten days counsel can agree upon a decree for entry here, it may be presented. Otherwise, the cause will be remanded to the Court of Claims for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n On Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Claims.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n Ever since Corporation Tax Act, August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, the United States has laid upon life insurance companies a special excise tax measured by net income. But the several revenue acts have varied as to the rate of the tax and also as to the method of computing the taxable income. That is, the items to be included in gross income and the items to be allowed as deductions have been changed from time to time. In the earliest act no deduction was made of interest on tax- exempt bonds. Until 1921, the gross income considered included premium \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 523]\n\u00a0\n receipts. \n1\n See New York Life Insurance Co. v. Edwards, \n271 \nU.S. 109\n, 46 S. Ct. 436; McCoach v. Insurance Co. of North America, \n244 \nU.S. 585\n, 37 S. Ct. 709. Compare Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523\n, 40 S. Ct. 397. The inclusion of premium receipts, with corresponding deductions, was found to be unsatisfactory. After much consideration, Congress, upon consultation with the life insurance companies and with the approval of at least most of them, substituted a new basis for computing the tax. \n2\n Act of November 23, 1921, \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 524]\n\u00a0\n c. 136,  243-245, 42 Stat. 227, 261. The validity of that act is now attacked by the National Life Insurance Company. Other companies have, as amici curiae, filed a brief in support of the legislation.\n The gross income to be considered under the Act of 1921 is limited to that received 'from interest, dividends, and rents.' In order to ascertain the taxable income, this gross investment income is to be reduced by nine classes of deductions, so far as severally applicable. Only two of these are material here-the provisions in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 245. Taken together, they provide for the deduction from the gross investment income of the interest from tax-exempt bonds or of an amount equal to 4 per cent. of the mean insurance reserve, whichever sum is the greater. That is, paragraph (1) provides for a deduction of interest received from tax-exempt bonds;3 \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 525]\n\u00a0\n and this deduction is to be made to the full extent, under all circumstances. Paragraph (2) provides that there shall be deducted such amount, if any, as is required to be added to the income from the tax- exempt securities, to equal 4 per cent. of the mean insurance reserve. Thus, no deduction under paragraph (2) will be allowed, if the income from the tax-exempt securities equals or exceeds 4 per cent. of the required reserve. And if the company has any income from tax-exempt bonds, it will not receive the full deduction of 4 per cent. of the required reserve, under paragraph (2). The reason for allowing the deduction of 4 per cent. of the reserve is that a portion of the 'interest, dividends, and rents' received have to be used each year in maintaining the reserve; i. e., adding to it on the basis of a certain interest rate, varying from 3 per cent. to 4 per cent. according to the requirements of the statutes of the several states.\n The National Life Insurance Company had, during the year 1921, gross investment income amounting to $3,824.592.78. Of this income, $1,125,788. 26 was interest on tax-exempt bonds. Four per cent. of the company's insurance reserve amounted to $2,695,279.12. As the interest received from tax-exempt bonds was less than 4 per cent. upon its reserve, the company was allowed under paragraph (2) the additional deduction of a sum equal to the difference between these two, namely, $1,569,490.86. The aggregate of the deductions allowed under paragraphs (1) and (2) was thus no greater than the deduction would have been if all the company's income had been derived from taxable securities.\n That the return and the payment required of the company was in exact accord with the act is conceded. The contention is that the act is unconstitutional, because as applied it renders the tax-exempt privilege of no value to the company. The argument is that the tax burden from which such federal and state obligations are free is \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 526]\n\u00a0\n the one laid upon other property; that a person may not be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property because he owns some that is free; that here the company has been required to pay more upon its taxable income than could have been demanded under the statute had the income come been derived solely from taxable securities; that to permit this to be done would destroy the guaranteed exemption for which the bondholder lawfully contracted, and would enable the federal government to burden the states; and that this cannot be done, whatever the device or form of words employed by Congress. The argument rests, I think, upon misconceptions.\n Some of the tax-exempt bonds held by the company were state ( including county, district, and municipal) bonds. Some were United States bonds which in terms provide for exemptions from federal taxes. With the holders of state bonds the United States has entered into no contract. Whatever rights the company may have as to them must flow either directly from the terms of the federal act which provides for the deductions to be made in computing the net income, or must arise indirectly out of the Constitution. The objection made and sustained by the court, is that the act is void because thereby Congress taxes the bonds, an instrumentality of the states, or that it discriminates against the holder. Compare Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 U.S. 514\n, 521-524, 46 S. Ct. 172. As to the United States bonds, the claim is that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated, because the act nullifies the provision in the bond that it shall be exempt from federal taxation. \n4\n On this contention the court does not \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 527]\n\u00a0\n pass. Compare Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 36 S. Ct. 236. But it holds, nevertheless, that there must be deducted the full 4 per cent. of the reserve in addition to the tax-exempt interest from federal as well as from state securities. It interprets the will of Congress to be that such a deduction should be made, because otherwise federal obligations would have less favorable treatment than must be accorded state bonds.\n As the tax imposed by the Act of 1921 is on net income, I should have supported that it was settled by Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 147\n, 162 S., 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, that the inclusion in the computation of the interest on tax-exempt bonds, like the inclusion of the receipts from exports, Peck v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, or the inclusion in a state tax of receipts from interstate commerce, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 326\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 41 S. Ct. 45, would not have rendered the tax objectionable. Compare Interbore Rapid Transit Co. v. Sohmer, \n237 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 35 S. Ct. 549. But here it is indisputable that no part of the income derived from tax-exempt bonds is taxed; for the statute requires that, in computing the taxable income, the full amount of the interest on tax-exempt securities should be deducted. The only question that can arise in any case is how much additional shall be allowed as a deduction under paragraph (2).\n The only factual basis for complaint by the company is that, although a holder of tax-exempt bonds, it is, \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 528]\n\u00a0\n in respect to this particular tax, no better off than it would have been had it held only taxable bonds. Or, to put it in another way, the objection is not that the plaintiff is taxed on what is exempt, but that others, who do not hold tax-exempt securities, are not taxed more. But neither the Constitution, nor any Act of Congress, nor any contract of the United States, provides that, in respect to this tax, a holder of tax- exempt bonds, shall be better off than if he held only taxable securities. Nowhere can the requirement be found that those who do not hold tax-exempt securities shall, in respect to every tax, be subjected to a heavier burden than the owners of tax-exempt bonds.\n It is true that the tax-exempt privilege is a feature always reflected in the market price of bonds. The investor pays for it. But the value of the tax-exempt feature, like the value of the bond itself, may fluctuate for many reasons. Its value may be lessened by changing, through legislation, the supply or the demand. It may be lessened by laws which have no relation to taxation, as was done when the federal reserve legislation changed the basis for securing notes of issue. \n5\n The recent successive reductions in federal surtaxes6 lessened for many holders the relative value of tax-exempt bonds. The narrowing thereby of an existing use for the tax-exempt bonds was important enough to affect the market value. Some of the states lessened the value of United States bonds to many a holder, when they substituted a small tax \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 529]\n\u00a0\n on intangibles, or an income tax, for the heavy general property tax to which all taxable bonds had theretofore been subject. The amendment of the state Constitution involved in Florida v. Mellon, 273 U S. 12, 47 S. Ct. 265, by which Florida prohibited its Legislature from imposing taxes on succession or on income, and offered to the rich a haven of tax immunity, reduced the potential demand for, and hence the value of, tax-exempt bonds. By all such legislation the relative advantage, with respect to some taxes, of tax-exempt over taxable bonds was lessened. With respect to other taxes, the relative advantage was wholly removed. And the relative value of the tax-exempt bonds to the holder was thereby necessarily reduced. But obviously that lessening of relative advantage and of value did not impair any legal right possessed by the holder.\n The holder of tax-exempt bonds often finds himself with respect to taxes imposed under legislation other than the Act of 1921, no better off than if he had owned only taxable bonds. But this court has never held a statute invalid on that ground. A state inheritance or legacy tax is valid, although the tax is as high when the estate transmitted consists in part of bonds of the United States as when none are held. Plumber v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 859; Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S. Ct. 213. Compare Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 \nU.S. 384\n, 42 S. Ct. 324. This is true also of the tax upon Connecticut savings banks, upheld in Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; of that upon Massachusetts savings banks, upheld in Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; of that upon Massachusetts manufacturing corporations, upheld in Hamilton Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; of that upon insurance corporations, upheld in Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593. Under all of these statutes a corporation holding bonds of the United States was obliged to pay the same amount in taxes that it would have been required to pay if it had \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 530]\n\u00a0\n not been a holder of United States bonds. \n7\n Similarly it has been held, in a long line of cases sustaining state laws taxing shares in a national bank to the shareholders, that no deduction need be made in the assessment on account of the United States bonds constituting a part of the assets of the bank by which the value of the shares is measured. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583; People v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244, 255; Peoples National Bank of Kingfisher v. Board of Equalization, \n260 \nU.S. 702\n, 43 S. Ct. 98; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 44 S. Ct. 23.\n The mere fact that the National Life Insurance Company was not allowed a larger deduction than would have been available if it had held only taxable bonds, cannot, therefore, render the taxing provision void. Whether there is in the provision for deductions some element of discrimination which renders it unconstitutional, remains for consideration. It may be assumed-if the term is used with legal accuracy- that the United States may not discriminate against state bonds or against its own outstanding bonds. Discrimination is the act of treating differently two persons or things, under like circumstances. Compare Merchants' Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 463\n, 17 S. Ct. 829. Here the sole complaint is that the two, although the circumstances are unlike, are treated equally. The claim is not that the holder of tax-exempt bonds is denied a privilege enjoyed by others. It is that the holder of tax-exempt bonds should be given in respect to another matter a preferred status. The preference claimed is that it shall be allowed, in addition to tax exemption on its bonds, a deduction of 4 per cent. of the reserve. The Constitution does not require the United States to hold out special inducements to invest in state bonds, compare Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S. Ct. 265; nor to give to holders \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 531]\n\u00a0\n of its own bonds privileges not granted by its contract with them. As was stated by counsel for the amici curiae:\n'This allowance of a deduction of a fixed percentage, or 4 per cent. of the mean of the reserve, itself points to the nature of the deduction, not as a right but as a favor. In granting this favor, in the interest of policyholders, Congress was entitled to consider the deduction already allowed for income in tax-exempt securities.'8\n\n There is no suggestion that in fact Congress discriminated against tax-exempt bonds, or against insurance companies as holders thereof. \n9\n In the Senate, it was \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 532]\n\u00a0\n stated that all the life insurance companies favored the measure. \n10\n There is no suggestion of a purpose in Congress to favor some companies at the expense of others. But, even if the possibility of such discrimination appeared, the objection of inequality in operation, if it were applicable to federal legislation, Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 36 S. Ct. 236; La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 392\n, 41 S. Ct. 528; Barclay v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348, would not be open here. For there is no finding of the Court of Claims that the National Life fares less well than some other company. See Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n235 \nU.S. 23, 26\n, 35 S. Ct. 2; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 180\n, 181 S., 43 S. Ct. 526.\n I find nothing in the cases cited by the petitioner which lends support to the view that its rights have been violated. Directly to tax the gross income from securities amounts, of course, to taxing the securities themselves. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55. In Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, as was stipulated, the dividends which this court held could not be taxed by the state were directly declared from interest accruing from United States bonds. Thus the dividends from tax-exempt bonds were taxed while those from other sources were free from the tax. The tax challenged in People v. Weaver, \n100 U.S. 539\n, in Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 521\n, 34 S. Ct. 354, 58 L. Ed 706, and in \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 533]\n\u00a0\n each of the cases from the state courts cited, was a direct property tax imposed upon federal obligations. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n To hold that Congress may not legislate so that the tax upon an insurance company shall be the same whether it holds tax-exempt bonds or does not, would, in effect, be to read into the Constitution a provision that Congress must adapt its legislation so as to give to state securities, not merely tax exemption, but additional privileges, and to read into the contract of the United States with its the bondholders a promise that it will, so long as the bonds are outstanding, so frame its system of taxation that its tax-exempt bonds shall, in respect to all taxes imposed, entitle the holder to greater privileges than are enjoyed by holders of taxable bonds. But no rule is better settled than that provisions for tax exemption, constitutional or contractual, are to be strictly construed. Compare Trucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527, 575; Wilmington & Weldon R. R. v. Alsbrook, 146 U S. 279, 294, 13 S. Ct. 72, 36, L. Ed. 972; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 16 S. Ct. 456; Ford v. Delta & Pine Land Co., \n164 \nU.S. 662\n, 17 S. Ct. 230; Chicago Theological Seminary v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 662, 674\n, 23 S. Ct. 386; People ex rel. Metropolitan Street Ry. Co. v. St. Bd. of Tax Com'rs, \n199 \nU.S. 1, 36\n, 25 S. Ct. 705; Jetton v. University of the South, \n208 \nU.S. 489, 499\n, 28 S. Ct. 375. The rule was acted upon as recently as Millsaps College v. City of Jackson, \n275 \nU.S. 129\n, 48 S. Ct. 94. \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 534]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, even if the decision of the court on the main question be accepted as the rule of substantive law, I am unable to see how the company can be allowed to recover anything. The provision of section 245 is that there shall be deducted from the gross income:\n'(2) An amount equal to the excess, if any, over the deduction specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (i. e., the interest on tax-exempt securities), of 4 per centum of the mean of the reserve funds required by law.' (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 t(4)(a2)).\n\n The court has, of course, power to declare that the system of taxation established by Congress is unconstitutional. But I find no power in the court to amend paragraph (2) of section 245 so as to allow the company to deduct 4 per cent. of its reserves, in addition to its income from tax-exempt securities. Congress was confessedly under no obligation to allow any deduction on account of the insurance reserves of any company. To expand the scope of the permitted deduction is legislation-and none the less so because the operation can be performed by striking out certain words of the act.\n The power so to legislate is not conferred on this court by section 1403 of the Act. That section declares:\n'That if any provision of this act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the act, and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.' Comp. St.  6371 4\/5 n.\n\n The limited purpose and the narrow effect of such a clause was stated by this court in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 71\n, 42 S. Ct. 453, 459:\n It 'furnishes assurance to courts that they may properly sustain separate sections or provisions of a partly invalid act without hesitation or doubt as to whether they would have been adopted, even if the Legislature had been advised of the invalidity of part. But it does not give the court power to amend the act.'\n Even if such a clause could ever permit a court to enlarge the scope of a deduction allowed by a taxing statute, the present case would be wholly inappropriate for the \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 535]\n\u00a0\n exercise of such a power. Here the asserted unconstitutionality can be cured as readily by striking out the whole of paragraph (2) as by enlarging it. Section 1403 gives no light as to which course Congress would prefer. So far as there are indications elsewhere, they would point to the former course. The new method of taxation was intended by Congress to procure additional revenue from the insurance companies. House Report, 67th Cong. 1st Sess. No. 350, p. 14. And the deduction permitted by paragraph (2) was a concession which Congress need not have made. Whether, in view of these facts, a court could properly save the act by striking out paragraph (2), or whether the alleged unconstitutionality necessarily renders invalid the whole scheme of taxation, thus leaving in force the tax on insurance companies contained in the Act of 1918,12 there is no need to consider. Compare Springfield Gas & Electric Co. v. Springfield, \n257 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 42 S. Ct. 24; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 44 S. Ct. 323. On either view there can, in my opinion, be no recovery on the findings here.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n While it may be conceded that the petitioner has been discriminated against, the discrimination occurs only in respect of an act of bounty. Petitioner's only complaint is that Congress has not granted it as large an exemption-purely a matter of grace-as it has accorded to others owning no tax-exempt securities. \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 536]\n\u00a0\n In granting a bounty of any short, Congress has a particular purpose: The generous protection of insurance reserves in the interest of the policyholders. For that purpose an exemption of 4 per cent. of the reserves was considered sufficient. In the case of companies already entitled to an exemption of 4 per cent., a further act of bounty was of course unnecessary to accomplish the end in view. Unless established principles require it, I do not think we should hold that Congress was powerless to act as generously as was necessary to achieve its useful purpose without granting additional and unnecessary bounties to insurance companies fortuitously in possession of tax-exempt bonds.\n There is a distinction between imposing a burden and withholding a favor. By the Constitution or by contract the holders of tax-exempt securities are protected from burdens; but from neither source do they derive an affirmative claim to favors. If Congress voted to subsidize all insurance companies except those holding tax-exempt bonds, whatever other objections might be made to such a course, I do not think petitioner could complain because it had not been made the recipient of a gift. For the same reason I believe that its present contention is insubstantial.\n But, even though the result now reached were to be deemed a logical implication of the doctrine announced in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, that neither national nor state governments may tax the instrumentalities of the other, still, as this court has often held, that rule may not be pressed to the logical extreme of forbidding legislation which affects only remotely or indirectly the holders of the other's securities. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 46 S. Ct. 172. As Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has just pointed out, 'a state inheritance or legacy tax is valid although the tax is as high when the estate transmitted consists in part of bonds of the United States as when none are held'; and this court has sustained statutes under which 'a corporation holding bonds of the United \n\n[277 U.S. 508, 537]\n\u00a0\n States was obliged to pay the same amount in taxes that it would have been required to pay if it had not been a holder of United States bonds.' Not all income earned in the employment of a state is exempt from federal taxation, Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra; instrumentalities affecting indirectly or remotely the functions of one government may nevertheless be taxed by the other, Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362\n, 32 S. Ct. 499; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 50; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, 36 S. Ct. 298.\n Now, the rule which, under the decisions of this court, has been thus narrowly limited, is extended into a new field; and the government is forbidden to grant any benefit or immunity to a taxpayer unless it be extended in addition to the immunity already assured by reason of his possession of tax-exempt securities. Here too the remedy is not the cancellation of the benefits to others of which petitioner complains, but the grant to it of an added bounty which Congress has not authorized and which the Constitution, it seems to me, neither requires Congress nor permits this court to give.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112; Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 172, 173; Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 765-768; Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1075-1079.

This departure from principle is, however, rendered innocuous through deductions expressly allowed by the statute.' Hearings before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, 65th Cong. 2d Sess., on the Proposed Revenue Act of 1918, Pt. I, p. 811. The Senate Finance Committee recommended in 1918 the plan later included in the Act of 1921, namely, that the basis of the tax be changed so as to include only the investment income, and that the deductions should be similarly limited. Senate Report, 65th Cong. 3d Sess. No. 617, p. 9. In presenting the bill Senator Simmons stated that it had been framed after consultation with many representatives of the life insurance companies. 57 Cong. Rec. 254. The plan was adopted by the Senate, but had to be abandoned in conference.\n At the Annual Meeting of Life Insurance Presidents, December, 1920, it was stated that the basis of the income tax was unsatisfactory both to the companies and to the government, and that a plan similar to that embodied in the Senate amendment to the 1918 bill should be adopted. Proceedings of the Fourteenth Annual Meeting, pp. 140, 141, 143-145.

It was stated to the Senate Finance Committee that 'all the life insurance companies are behind that scheme and are satisfied with it.'

No. 275, p. 20; Brief of Amici Curiae, p. 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The scope of the deduction to be made on account of tax-exempt securities is defined by paragraph 4 of subdivision (b) of section 213 of act: 'Interest upon (a) the obligations of a state, territory, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia; or (b) securities issued under the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916; or (c) the obligations of the United States or its possessions; or (d) bonds issued by the War Finance Corporation. In the case of obligations of the United States issued after September 1, 1917 ( other than postal savings certificates of deposit), and in the case of bonds issued by the War Finance Corporation, the interest shall be exempt only if and to the extent provided in the respective acts authorizing the issue thereof as amended and supplemented, and shall be excluded from gross income only if and to the extent it is wholly exempt to the taxpayer from income, war profits and excess profits taxes.' 42 Stat. 227, 238 ( Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 ff). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The precise terms of the exemption are not the same in all issues of United States bonds. Thus, bonds issued under the First Liberty Loan are declared to be 'exempt, both as to principal and as to interest, from all taxation, except estate or inheritance taxes, imposed by authority of the United States, or its possessions, or by any state or local taxing authority.' In the second and later loans the bonds are subject to 'graduated additional income taxes, commonly known as surtaxes, and excess profits and war profits taxes, now or hereafter imposed by the United States,' except that the interest on an amount not in excess of a certain figure is free from tax. All the bonds held by the petitioner were, by the statutes under which they were issued, exempt from the normal tax. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] For the effect of the pending federal reserve legislation and its enactment (December 23, 1913, c. 6, 38 Stat. 251), on the market value of United States bonds held to secure national bank circulation, see Commercial & Financial Chronicle, vol. 97, pp. 91, 153, 271, 1083, volume 98, pp. 131, 200. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 265 (26 USCA  952(a); Comp.

Ct. 261. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The brief for the amici curiae states further: 'The petitioner has neither constitutional nor statutory right to deduct from its income an amount equal to 4 per centum of the mean of its reserve or to deduct any percentage of its reserve funds, or to deduct any interest derived from the investment of its reserve funds (in addition to that from tax-exempt securities). ... Every life insurance company that has tax-exempt securities is treated exactly on the same basis. Companies that have tax- exempt securities are not entitled to a double deduction and those that have no tax-exempt securities still have reserves which they hold for the protection of their policy holders and Congress has fairly allowed a deduction of a percentage of those reserves. ... This was a mere question of policy which Congress was free to adopt as it chose. ... What the petitioner wants is not simply to have its constitutional right protected, and to be immune from taxation on its investment in government securities, but to get a further advantage, to which it has no constitutional right, that is, to include its tax-exempt income in figuring its deduction on its reserve. It seeks not freedom from taxation, but a preferred position in calculating its reserve. What is there in the Constitution which comples Congress to give such an advantage? ... The petitioner has no constitutional right to gain an advantage from its investment in tax-exempt securities beyond the fact that it is not to be deprived in whole or in part of its investment and that the investment is not to be made a subject of taxation.' \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The amount of the United States securities outstanding on June 30, 1921, was $23,748,292.000. See Annual Report of Secretary of the Treasury for 1921, pp. 680-685. This figure does not include federal farm loan bonds, of which $420,763,315 were outstanding October 31, 1921, Id., p. 963, or the obligations of the insular possessions and the District of Columbia, of which there were $52,970,750 outstanding on June 30, 1921.

W. 332; (Court of Civil Appeals, 230 S. W. 698, 702, the case was rested upon the construction of the state statute. The constitutional question was treated slightly and obiter. In People v. Board of Commissioners of Taxes, 41 How. Pr. 459, 474 (Supreme Court of New York, at General Term 1871), there 'was no written opinion, the decision being rendered on argument.' It does not appear whether it was placed on the construction of the statutes or on a constitutional ground. This is also true of U. S. v. Ritchie, Fed. Cas. No. 16168. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] That tax was repealed by section 1400(a) of the Act of 1921 (Comp. St.  6371 4\/5 m(a)).

The attack upon the ordinance is that, as specifically applied to plaintiff in error, it deprived him of his property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[277 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n The suit was for a mandatory injunction directing the city and its inspector of buildings to pass upon an application of the plaintiff in error for a permit to erect any lawful buildings upon a tract of land without regard to the provisions of the ordinance including such tract within a residential district. The case was referred to a master to make and report findings of fact. After a view of the premises and the surrounding territory, and a hearing, the master made and reported his findings. The case came on to be heard by a justice of the court, who, after confirming the master's report, reported the case for the determination of the full court. Upon consideration, that court sustained the ordinance as applied to plaintiff in error, and dismissed the bill. 157 N. E. 618.\n A condensed statement of facts, taken from the master's report, is all that is necessary. When the zoning ordinance was enacted, plaintiff in error was and still is the owner of a tract of land containing 140,000 square feet, of which the locus here in question is a part. The locus contains about 29,000 square feet, with a frontage on Brookline street, lying west, of 304.75 feet, on Henry street, lying north, of 100 feet, on the other land of the plaintiff in error, lying east, of 264 feet, and on land of the Ford Motor Company, lying southerly, of 75 feet. The territory lying east and south is unrestricted. The lands beyond Henry street to the north and beyond Brookline street to the west are within a restricted residential district. The effect of the zoning is to separate from the west end of plaintiff in error's tract a strip 100 feet in width. The Ford Motor Company has a large auto assembling factory south of the locus; and a soap factory and the tracks of the Boston & Albany Railroad lie near. Opposite the locus, on Brookline street, and included in the same district, there are some residences; and opposite the locus, on Henry street, and in the same district, are other residences. The locus is now vacant, \n\n[277 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n although it was once occupied by a mansion house. Before the passage of the ordinance in question, plaintiff in error had outstanding a contract for the sale of the greater part of his entire tract of land for the sum of $63,000. Because of the zoning restrictions, the purchaser refused to comply with the contract. Under the ordinance, business and industry of all sorts are excluded from the locus, while the remainder of the tract is unrestricted. It further appears that provision has been made for widening Brookline street, the effect of which, if carried out, will be to reduce the depth of the locus to 65 feet. After a statement at length of further facts, the master finds:\n'That no practical use can be made of the land in question for residential purposes, because among other reasons herein related, there would not be adequate return on the amount of any investment for the development of the property.'\n\n The last finding of the master is:\n'I am satisfied that the districting of the plaintiff's land in a residence district would not promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of that part of the defendant city, taking into account the natural development thereof and he character of the district and the resulting benefit to accrue to the whole city and I so find.'\n\n It is made pretty clear that because of the industrial and railroad purposes to which the immediately adjoining lands to the south and east have been devoted and for which they are zoned, the locus is of comparatively little value for the limited uses permitted by the ordinance.\n We quite agree with the opinion expressed below that a court should not set aside the determination of public officers in such a matter unless it is clear that their action 'has no foundation in reason and is a mere arbitrary or irrational exercise of power having no substantial relation to the public health, the public morals, the public \n\n[277 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n safety or the public welfare in its proper sense.' Euclid v. Ambler Co., supra, p. 395 (47 S. Ct. 121).\n An inspection of a plat of the city upon which the zoning districts are outlined, taken in connection with the master's findings, shows with reasonable certainty that the inclusion of the locus in question is not indispensable to the general plan. The boundary line of the residential district before reaching the locus runs for some distance along the streets, and to exclude the locus from the residential district requires only that such line shall be continued 100 feet further along Henry street and thence south along Brookline street. There does not appear to be any reason why this should not be done. Nevertheless, if that were all, we should not be warranted in substituting our judgment for that of the zoning authorities primarily charged with the duty and responsibility of determining the question. Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S. Ct. 594, and cases cited. But that is not all. The governmental power to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of the land owner by restricting the character of his use, is not unlimited, and, other questions aside, such restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Euclid v. Ambler Co., supra, p. 395 (47 S. Ct. 114). Here, the express finding of the master, already quoted, confirmed by the court below, is that the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the part of the city affected will not be promoted by the disposition made by the ordinance of the locus in question. This finding of the master, after a hearing and an inspection of the entire area affected, supported, as we think it is, by other findings of fact, is determinative of the case. That the invasion of the property of plaintiff in error was serious and highly injurious is clearly established; and, since a neces- \n\n[277 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n sary basis for the support of that invasion is wanting, the action of the zoning authorities comes within the ban of the Fourteenth Amendment and cannot be sustained.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNIGRO v. UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 600\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. G. Lynch, of Kansas City, Mo., for Nigro.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here by certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, and is intended to submit to us, for answer, certain questions concerning the validity and proper construction of the Anti-Narcotic Act of December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785, as amended in the Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919,  1006, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1130 (26 USCA  691-695; Comp. St.  6287g).\n The Circuit Court of Appeals bases its questions on issues arising in its consideration on error of a judgment of conviction on the second count of an indictment drawn under section 2 of the act (26 USCA  696; Comp. St .  6287h). The count charged that one Frank Nigro and one Roy Williams unlawfully sold to one A. L. Raithel one ounce of morphine, not being sold in pursuance of a written order of A. L. Raithel on a form \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Roy Williams was not apprehended. Frank Nigro was tried and convicted, and sentence was imposed of five years' imprisonment at the Leavenworth penitentiary. The Circuit Court of Appeals expressed the opinion that the case could not be disposed of without determining the construction and possibly the constitutionality of the first provision of section 2 of the act, reading as follows:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the\n\n Commissioner of Internal Revenue.'\n A summing up of the evidence, tending to show the sale of an ounce of morphine by the defendants as charged in the second count, is contained in the certificate by the Court.\n The questions submitted for our consideration are as follows:\n Question I.\n Is the provision which is contained in the first sentence of section 2 of the act limited in its application to those persons who by section 1 are required to register and pay the tax?\n Question II.\n If a broader construction is given to said provision, is the provision as so construed, constitutional?\n If question I is answered in the affirmative, then we ask:\n Question III.\n Is it necessary for the government in prosecuting under said provision, to allege and prove that defendant was a person required by section 1 to register and pay the tax? \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n If question III is answered in the affirmative, then we ask:\n Question IV.\n Is the allegation that defendant made the sale not in pursuance of a written order of the buyer on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States sufficient to charge that defendant was a person required to be registered and to pay the tax under section 1?\n The second question was invoked by what we said in United States v. Daugherty, \n269 \nU.S. 360, 362\n, 46 S. Ct. 156, 157 (70 L. Ed. 309), as follows:\n'The constitutionality of the Anti-Narcotic Act, touching which this Court so sharply divided in United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86\n, 39 S. Ct. 214, was not raised below, and has not been again considered. The doctrine approved in Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E. 724; Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 242 S. Ct. 449; Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 67\n, 42 S. Ct. 453; and Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5\n, 45 S. Ct. 446, (39 A. L. R. 229), may necessitate a review of that question, if hereafter properly presented.'\n\n In Alston v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 47 S. Ct. 634, the question of the constitutionality of the act was sought to be presented, but the case only involved the validity of section 1 as amended in the Revenue Act of 1918. We held that section valid because it imposed a stamp tax on certain narcotic drugs, making it unlawful to purchase or sell them except in or from original stamped packages, which was plainly within the taxing power of Congress and had no necessary connection with any other requirement of the act which might subject it to reasonable question. We said that section 1 did not absolutely prohibit buying or selling; that it produced a substantial revenue and contained nothing to indicate that by colorable use of taxation Congress was attempting to invade the reserved powers of the States. \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n The present case relates to the validity of the second section of the law; but, before considering this, we must answer the first question and construe the meaning of the first sentence of section 2 quoted above. The controversy is whether the words 'any person' in that sentence include all persons or apply only to persons who are required to register and pay the tax under the first section of the act.\n We have put in the margin1 a synopsis of the original section 1 of the Act of 1914, and of the same section as amended \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n in the Revenue Act of 1918, and of some other sections now in force, including section 2.\n In interpreting the act, we must assume that it is a taxing measure, for otherwise it would be no law at all. If it is a mere act for the purpose of regulating and restraining the purchase of the opiate and other drugs, it is beyond the power of Congress, and must be regarded as invalid, just as the Child Labor Act of Congress was held to be, in Bailey, Collector, v. Drexel Furniture Co., \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449, 21 A. L. R. 1432. Everything in the construction of section 2 must \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n be regarded as directed toward the collection of the taxes imposed in section 1 and the prevention of evasion by persons subject to the tax. If the words cannot be read as reasonably serving such a purpose, section 2 cannot be supported. \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 343]\n\u00a0\n The importation, preparation, and sale of the opiate or other like drugs and their transportation and concealment in small packages are exceedingly easy, and make the levy and collection of a tax thereon correspondingly \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 344]\n\u00a0\n difficult. More that this, use of the drug for other than medicinal purposes leads to addiction, and causes the addicts to resort to so much cunning, deceit and concealment in the procurement and custody of the drug and to be willing to pay such high prices for it that, to be efficient, a law for taxing it needs to make thorough provision for preventing and discovering evasion of the tax-as by requiring that sales, purchases and other transactions in the drug be so conducted and evidenced that any dealing in it where the tax has not been paid may be detected and punished and that opportunity for successful evasion may be lessened as far as may be possible.\n The literal meaning of 'any person,' in the first line of the first sentence of section 2, includes all persons within the jurisdiction. The word 'persons' is given expressly the meaning of a partnership, association or corporation, as well as that of a natural person. Why should it not be given its ordinary comprehensive significance? The argument to the contrary in favor of limiting it to exclude all but those who are required to register and pay the tax is that it would be superfluous to include persons selling opium who are not registered, because they are denounced as criminals by the first section for selling without registration. That is no reason why they may not be included under a second reasonable restriction enforceable by punishment. Of course such a restriction should be fairly adapted to obstruct the successful accomplishment of the main crime or furnish means of detecting the guilty per- \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 345]\n\u00a0\n son, and not be a fruitless, useless inhibition only resulting in what is in effect a duplication of punishment for substantially the same crime, as in the case of United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 46 S. Ct. 513.\n It would seem to be admissible and wise in a law seeking to impose taxes for the sale of an elusive subject to require conformity to a prescribed method of sale and delivery calculated to disclose or make more difficult any escape from the tax. If this may be done, any departure from the steps enjoined may be punished, and added penalties may be fixed for successive omissions, but all for the one ultimate purpose of making it difficult to sell opium or other narcotics without registering or paying the tax.\n The reasonableness of such requirements is well illustrated in the many limitations which were imposed upon the ancient freedom in the making and sale of distilled spirits to the end that the collection of the heavy tax on the subject-matter might be successfully secured in spite of the temptation to avoid the tax. The provision of section 2 making it an offense to sell unless the purchaser gives a particular official form of order to the seller was enacted with a like object. The sale without such an order thus carries its illegality on its face. Its absence dispenses with the necessity of sending to examine the list of those registered to learn whether the seller is engaged in a legal sale. The requirement that the official forms can only be bought and obtained by one entitled to buy, whose name shall be stamped on the order form, and that after the sale the order form shall be recorded, effects a kind of registration of lawful purchasers, in addition to one of lawful sellers, and keeps selling and buying on a plane where evasion of the tax will be difficult.\n There are persons who may lawfully have access to or even custody of the drugs without registration. Thus included among such persons are the employees of those \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 346]\n\u00a0\n who have registered and paid the tax. If they were to attempt to sell such drugs the necessity for an order form from the would-be purchaser would embarrass the illegal sale, for the participants would hesitate to make a record of the transaction. Thus the operation of section 2 in preventing an individual not a registered dealer or physician from acquiring the drug other than by an order form or a prescription is directly related to tax enforcement, because such drugs are not necessarily consumed by the purchaser but may be peddled or sold illegally. These order form provisions constitute a needed check on illegal sales and they are distinctly helpful in the detection of an attempted dealing in, or selling of, the drug free from the tax.\n Section 2 of the act is the same as it was when originally passed in 1914. The construction put upon it before the amendment of section 1, by the Revenue Act of 1918, must be the same now as before. Under section 1 in the original act, the only provision to keep track of purchasers was the order form provision of section 2, as it is now. Without it, unless it applied to those not required to register or pay the tax, there was no restriction upon such persons whether illegal sellers or illegal purchasers in the disposition and spread of the drug, except the simple punishment for unregistered sellers in the first section, and there was entire immunity from order requirements of the purchasers from illegal sales. We cannot suppose that, considering the general language of section 2, any such result was intended by Congress.\n By the amendment of section 1, much higher occupation taxes were imposed, and they vary in amount for producers and manufacturers and for wholesale and retail dealers and for physicians. More than that, an excise tax of one cent per ounce of the drug is imposed, and payment thereof is to be evidenced by stamps attached to the bottle or box \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 347]\n\u00a0\n containing the drug, and the sale of the drug from anything but a stamped bottle or container is punishable. The provision for order forms is thus useful under the amended section, and there is therefore still reason for holding the provisions of section 2 to apply to all persons so as to be helpful in promoting detection of evasion from the added tax imposed under the new section 1. The two tax provisions of that section would be much less effective if a purchaser of drugs from an unregistered dealer is not required to furnish an order form. The purchaser may be himself one who should register, but has not done so, or he may be dealing in and selling the drug on which the stamp tax has not been paid, and it is just as important that sales by an unregistered dealer should be punished unless made on a prescribed form as that sales by registered dealers should be subject to penalty.\n There is nothing in the language of the section itself that would reduce the significance of the words 'any person' from the meaning of 'all persons' to that of those persons only who are required to register and pay the tax as there was in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 658, upon which the appellant relies much. In that case, the defendant was indicted for conspiring to get morphine into the possession of an unregistered person for use by him as an addict and not for medical purposes. The question was whether the possession conspired for was within section 8 of the act (26 USCA  700; Comp. St. 6287n) declaring it unlawful for any person who was not registered and had not paid the special tax to have the drug in his possession. It was held that section 8 applied only to persons required to register under section 1 and pay the occupation tax. The language of section 8 is more restricted than section 2. It reads:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any person not registered under the provision of this act, and who has not paid the special tax provided for by this act, to have in his possession or under \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 348]\n\u00a0\n his control any of the aforesaid drugs.'\n\n The words 'any person' in section 2 are not linked with those who have not registered and have not paid the tax, but ought to do so, as are the same words in section 8. The narrow construction of section 8 in the Jin Fuey Moy Case was reached in part certainly because of the juxtaposition of the words. This is shown by a more recent decision of this Court in United States v. Wong Sing, \n260 \nU.S. 18\n, 43 S. Ct. 7. In that case, Wong Sing was indicted under the amendment, section 1006 of the Revenue Act of 1918, for purchasing the drug not from an original stamped package and not from a person who was a registered dealer. It was objected that, under the Jin Fuey Moy Case, a person to be criminally liable under section 1006 must be of a class who must register and pay taxes, but it was held that that section was not limited as section 8 was held to be.\n In Fyke v. United States, 254 F. 225, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided that the proper construction of section 2 under the original act of 1914 made it applicable to sales by any person whether registered or not. Speaking of the act as it was before 1918, the Court said:\n'All sellers were members of the class required to register and pay the tax, under section 1, and the revenue derived from sellers, as provided for by that section, could manifestly not be collected unless Congress had the power to, and did in fact, punish the sale of the prohibited drugs by all persons except when made in conformity to the act. The necessity of prohibiting sales by unregistered persons and of sales by registered persons, not complying with the act, were of equal importance. If only the latter class were subject to its penalties, all persons, by failing to register, could sell with impunity, without paying the tax or complying with the other requirements of the act.\n\n'Section 1 punishes sales by persons who have neither registered nor paid the tax. Section 2 punishes persons \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 349]\n\u00a0\n who sell, not in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom the sale is made. The language of section 2 is general, and does not restrict the prohibition to registered sellers in terms. Indeed, the exception, lettered 'd', applies to a class expressly excepted from registry and payment of the tax by section 1. This exception would seem tobe superfluous, if section 2 applied only to registered persons, since the excepted class would not then be included in the class against whom the penalties of the section are directed.'\n\n The exception 'd' here referred to is that which requires no order form to be used by officers of the national, state, county and municipal governments, in purchases for certain governmental uses, and which would indicate that such officers, who are not required to register, would, but for this exception, be covered by section 2.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, in Coleman v. United States, 3 F.(2d) 243, expressly found that the first provision of section 2 was not intended to be limited in its application to the persons required to register under section 1.\n United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 513, is said to be in conflict with our view of the question before us. We do not think so. Defendants there were indicted for a conspiracy to sell intoxicating liquors, without making a permanent record of the sale, in violation of section 10, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  22). That section provided that no person should make, sell or transport intoxicating liquor without making a permanent record of it, showing in detail the amount and kind of liquor dealt with, the names of persons with whom dealt, and the time and place of such dealing. The form of the records was to be prescribed by the Commissioner and to be open to inspection by him, his agent, or any peace officer of the state. The defendants contended that the section applied only to those who under the act were authorized to sell liquor under a permit. The United States con- \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 350]\n\u00a0\n tended that the section in its general negation applied to any violator of the act. We held with the defendants that such a construction of section 10 imputed to Congress an improbable incongruity in wishing to add to the crime of making, selling or transporting liquor a second offense, if the person committing it should fail to make a record of his own wrongdoing. It was pointed out that Congress had before it the previous revenue acts governing distillers, rectifiers and brewers, requiring detailed records of all transactions which were lawfully subject to governmental regulation as a condition of granting permits, and that when Congress came to the Prohibition Act it adopted the same system of permits, and the parliamentary history of the section 10 showed that to secure records from its permittees was its only purpose in that section. The Katz Case was really, therefore, decided because of the incongruity that would result in an interpretation of section 10 as claimed by the government. Here there is really no such incongruity.\n Section 2 of the Anti-Narcotic Act introduces into the act the feature of the required and stamped order form to accompany each sale. It is to bear the name of the purchaser, and is addressed to the seller, with other data. Recorded as the law requires it to be, it constitutes a registry of purchasers, as distinguished from that of sellers. Congress intended not only to punish sales without registration under the first section, but also to punish them without order forms from the purchaser to the seller, as a means of making it difficult for the unregistered seller to carry through his unlawful sales to those who could not get order forms. Thus an illegal unregistered seller might wish to clothe his actual unregistered sales with order forms that would give the transaction a specious appearance of legality. To punish him for this misuse of an order form is not to punish him for not \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 351]\n\u00a0\n recording his own crime. It is to punish him for an added crime-that of deceiving others into the belief that the sale is a lawful sale. There is no incongruity in increasing the criminal liability of the nonregistered seller who fails to use an order form in his sales, or who misuses it. Both the registered and the nonregistered seller are, under our construction of the section, punished for not using the order forms as the statute requires, or for misusing them. The order form is not a mere record of a past transaction-it is a certificate of legality of the transaction being carried on, or else it is a means of discovering the illegality and is useful for the latter purpose. We think the resemblance of the Katz Case and this case is superficial and that they are distinguishable.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that the provision which is contained in the first sentence of section 2 of the act is not limited in its application to those persons who by section 1 are required to register and pay the tax. We answer the first question in the negative.\n This brings us to the second question, which is '... Is the provision as so construed constitutional?' It was held to be constitutional in United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 94\n, 39 S. Ct. 214. In that case the validity of the Anti-Narcotic Drug Act as it was enacted December 17, 1914, 38 Stat. 785, was under examination by this Court. The inquiry was whether section 2, in making sales of the drugs unlawful except to persons giving orders on forms issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to be preserved for official inspection, and forbidding any person to obtain the drugs by means of such order forms for any other purpose than use, sale or distribution in the conduct of a lawful business, or in the legitimate practice of his profession, bore a reasonable relation to the enforcement of the provided by section 1 and did not exceed the power of Congress It was held that section 2 aimed to confine sales \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 352]\n\u00a0\n to registered dealers and to those dispensing the drugs as physicians and to those who come to dealers with legitimate prescriptions of physicians; that Congress, with full power over the subject, inserted these provisions in an act specifically providing for the raising of revenue. Considered of themselves, the Court thought that they tended to keep the traffic above board and subject to inspection by those authorized to collect the revenue; that they tended to diminish the opportunity of unauthorized persons to obtain the drugs and sell them clandestinely without paying the tax imposed by the federal law. This Court said in the Doremus Case:\n'This case well illustrates the possibility which may have induced Congress to insert the provisions limiting sales to registered dealers and requiring patients to obtain these drugs as a medicine from physicians or upon regular prescriptions. Ameris, being as the indictment charges an addict, may not have used this great number of doses for himself. He might sell some to others without paying the tax, at least Congress may have deemed it wise to prevent such possible dealings because of their effect upon the collection of the revenue.'\n\n Referring to the same section 2, in United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 42 S. Ct. 301, 302 (66 L. Ed. 604); this Court said:\n'It is very evident from a reading of it that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of the Government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic.'\n\n Four members of the Court dissented in the Doremus Case, because of opinion that the court below had correctly held the act of Congress, in so far as it embraced the matters complained of, to be beyond its constitutional \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 353]\n\u00a0\n power and that the statute, in section 2, was a mere pretext as a tax measure, and was in fact an attempt by Congress to exercise the police power reserved to the states and to regulate and restrict the sale and distribution of dangerous and noxious narcotic drugs. Since that time, this Court has held that Congress, by merely calling an act a taxing act, cannot make it a legitimate exercise of taxing power under section 8 of article 1 of the Federal Constitution, if in fact the words of the act show clearly its real purpose is otherwise. Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 38\n, 42 S. Ct. 449. By the Revenue Act of 1918, the Anti- Narcotic Act was amended so as to increase the taxes under section 1, making an occupation tax for a producer of narcotic drugs $24 a year, for a wholesale dealer $12, for a retail dealer, $6, and for a physician administering the narcotic, $3. The amendment also imposes an excise tax of one cent an ounce on the sale of the drug. Thus the income from the tax for the government becomes substantial. Under the Narcotic Act, as now amended the tax amounts to about $1,000,000 a year, and since the amendment in 1919 it has benefited the Treasury to the extent of nearly $9, 000,000. If there was doubt as to the character of this act as an alleged subterfuge, it has been removed by the change whereby what was a nominal tax before was made a substantial one. It is certainly a taxing act now as we held in the Alston Case.\n It may be true that the provisions of the act forbidding all but registered dealers to obtain the order forms has the incidental effect of making it more difficult for the drug to reach those who have a normal and legitimate use for it, by requirement of purchase through order forms or by physician's prescription. But this effect, due to the machinery of the act, should not render the order form provisions void as an infringement on state \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 354]\n\u00a0\n police power where these provisions are genuinely calculated to sustain the revenue features. The section 2 was once sustained by this Court some nine years ago with more formidable reason against it than now exists under the amended statute. Its provisions have been enforced for those years. Whatever doubts may have existed respecting the order form provisions of the act have been removed by the amendment made in 1919\n\n\n We said in the Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 38\n, 42 S. Ct. 449, 451 (66 L. Ed. 817):\n'Taxes are occasionally imposed in the discretion of the Legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive.'\n\n In this case, the qualification of the right of a resident of a state to buy and consume opium or other narcotic without restraint by the federal government is subject to the power of Congress to lay a tax by way of excise on its sale. Congress does not exceed its power if the object is laying a tax and the interference with lawful purchasers and users of the drug is reasonably adapted to securing the payment of the tax. Nor does it render such qualification or interference with the original state right an invasion of it because it may incidentally discourage some in the harmful use of the thing taxed. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 524\n, 19 S. Ct. 522; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 60\n, 61 S., 20 S. Ct. 747; In re Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526, 536\n, 17 S. Ct. 444.\n This leads to an answer to the second question in the affirmative, and makes it unnecessary for us to answer the remaining third and fourth questions.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Nigro, not alleged to be registered as a dealer, was charged with violating section 2 of the Harrison Anti-Narcotic \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 355]\n\u00a0\n Act by selling opium (whether in or from an original stamped package does not appear) to Raithel, not a dealer, without an order upon a form issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n It is maintained, first, that section 2 applies to all sales, including, of course, those made by one who is not registered to a purchaser who cannot possibly secure an order form; and, secondly, that, so construed, is constitutional. Both propositions, I think, are wrong.\n Section 1 of the act imposes a definite tax (uniform for each class) upon 'every person' who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses, or gives away opium; also a stamp tax of one cent per ounce upon the drug. All who are subject to the tax are required to register; and the section further provides:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person required to register under the provisions of this act to import, manufacture, produce, compound, sell, deal in, dispense, distribute, administer, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs without having registered and paid the special tax as imposed by this section.'\n\n Section 2 declares:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs (opium, &c.) except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. ...\n\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall cause suitable forms to be prepared for the purposes above mentioned, and shall cause the same to be distributed to collectors of internal revenue for sale by them to those persons who shall have registered and paid the special tax as required by section one of this Act in their districts, respectively . ...' \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 356]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, no one who has not registered and paid the special tax laid by section 1 can obtain 'suitable forms.'\n\n Fair application of the principles of construction approved in United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610; United States v Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 658; and United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 513, should at least limit the words 'any person' in the first line of section 2 to those required to register by section 1, which renders unlawful every sale by an unregistered person, whether the purchaser possesses an order blank or no. And it seems unreasonable to conclude that the purpose of the next section was awkwardly to state something already plainly declared.\n The sale by Nigro was to one who could not obtain an order blank. Only a small group-importers, manufacturers, dealers, etc.-can obtain these blanks. As construed by the United States, the statute prohibits all sales except to those who are registered or hold physicians' prescriptions- no others can buy lawfully. Admittedly, the statute is valid only as a revenue measure. Any provision therein not appropriate to that end is beyond the power of Congress. $I can discover no adequate ground for thinking Congress could have supposed that collection of the prescribed tax would be materially aided by requiring those who engage in selling surreptitiously to consumers to do an impossible thing-receive an order upon a blank which the purchaser could not obtain. The plain intent is to control the traffic within the States by preventing sales except to registered persons and holders of prescriptions, and this amounts to an attempted regulation of something reserved to the States. The questioned inhibition of sales has no just relation to the collection of the tax laid on dealers. The suggestion to the contrary is fanciful. Although disguised, the real and primary purpose is not difficult to discover, and it is strict limitation and regulation of the traffic. \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 357]\n\u00a0\n Whether, or how far, opium, tobacco, diamonds, silk, etc., may be sold within their borders is primarily for the States to decide; the federal government may not undertake direct regulation of such matters.\n This Court said in United States v. Wong Sing, \n260 \nU.S. 18, 21\n, 43 S. Ct. 7, 8 (67 L. Ed. 105):\n'There could be no object in requiring a purchaser of the drugs to register but it fulfilled the purpose of the law to forbid a purchase 'except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package.\"\n\n The habit of smoking tobacco is often deleterious. Many think it ought to be suppressed. The craving for diamonds leads to extravagance, and frequently to crime. Silks are luxuries, and their use abridges the demand for cotton and wool. Those who sell tobacco, or diamonds, or silks may be taxed by the United States. But, surely, a provision in an act laying such a tax which limited sales of cigars, cigarettes, jewels, or silks to some small class alone authorized to secure official blanks would not be proper or necessary in order to enforce collection. The acceptance of such a doctrine would bring many purely local matters within the potential control of the federal government. The admitted evils incident to the use of opium cannot justify disregard of the powers 'reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in these views.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n Section 1 was originally enacted December 17, 1914, c. 1, 38 Stat. 785. It was amended by the Revenue Act of 1918 passed February 24, 1919,  1006, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1130. It contains the following:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person required to register under the provisions of this act to ... sell ... any of the aforesaid drugs without having registered and paid the special tax as imposed by this section.' \n\n[276 U.S. 332, 358]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 appeared in its present form in the original act. The pertinent provision is:\n\n'It shall be unlawful for any person to sell ... any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold ... on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.' 38 Stat. 786.\n\n The effect of these two provisions is to prohibit sale by any person who has not registered and to permit sale by a registered person upon a written blank issued by the Commissioner. That conclusion is so plain that discussion cannot affect it.\n Question 1 should be answered Yes.\n Question 2 need not be answered.\n Question 3 should be answered Yes.\n Question 4 should be answered No.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The original first section required every person who produced, sold, or gave away opium or coca leaves, or any preparation thereof, to register with the proper internal revenue collector his name and place of business and to pay a special tax of a dollar a year, provided that no employee of such person need either register or pay, nor were officers, of the general government or of state or county or municipal governments lawfully engaged in purchasing the drugs for hospitals or prisons required to do so.\n It was also provided that: 'It shall be unlawful for any person required to register under the terms of this act to produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs without having registered and paid the special tax provided for in this section.' The section provided that the word 'person' used in the act should be construed to mean and include a partnership, association or corporation as well as a natural person.\n By the Revenue Act of 1918, this first part of section one is made to read as follows: 'That on or before July 1 of each year every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses, or gives away opium or coca leaves, or any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation thereof, shall register with the collector of internal revenue of the district his name or style, place of business and place or places where such business is to be carried on, and pay the special taxes hereinafter provided.' A special tax is then imposed on importers, manufacturers, producers or compounders of the drugs of $24 per annum, on wholesale dealers, $12, on retail dealers, $6, and on physicians entitled to administer the drugs in their professional practice, $3. Employees of all lawfully registered persons are exempted from tax. It is then provided that: 'It shall be unlawful for any person required to reg- \n ister under the provisions of this act to import, manufacture, produce, compound, sell, deal in, dispense, distribute, administer, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs without having registered and paid the special tax as imposed by this section.' Then an excise revenue tax of one cent per ounce on the drug is imposed through stamps to be affixed to the bottle or other container. It is made unlawful to sell or dispense the drugs except in or from the original stamped package and possession of the drug by any person is made prima facie evidence of violation of the section. Possession of an original stamped package containing the drug is made prima facie evidence of liability to pay the tax. These presumptions are not to apply to a person obtaining the drug from a registered dealer in pursuance of a prescription written for legitimate medical uses issued by a physician or other registered practitioner and where the bottle or other container in which the drug is put up by the dealer bears the druggist's name, his serial and registry number, the number, name and address of the patient, as well as those of the writer of the prescription. The presumptions are not to apply to the dispensing of the drug to a patient by a registered physician or practitioner in the course of his professional practice for legitimate medical purposes where a record is kept. All the provisions of existing law relating to the engraving, sale and cancellation of tax paid stamps provided for in the internal revenue laws are made to apply to the stamps issued under the section. Unstamped packages found in possession of any person except as provided in the section are subject to seizure. Importers, manufacturers and wholesale dealers are to keep books and records and render monthly returns in relation to dealing with such drugs as are required by regulation made by the Commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. \n Section 2 of the Act of 1914 was not changed by the Revenue Act of 1918. This section provides: 'That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Every person who shall accept any such order, and in pursuance thereof, shall sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs, shall preserve such order for a period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to inspection by any officer, agent, or employee of the Treasury Department duly authorized for that purpose, and the state, territorial, district, municipal, and insular officials named in section five of this act. Every person who shall give an order as herein provided to any other person for any of the aforesaid drugs shall, at or before the time of giving such order, make or cause to be made a duplicate thereof on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and in case of the acceptance of such order, shall preserve such duplicate for said period of two years in such a way as to be readily accessible to inspection by the officers, agents, employees, and officials hereinbefore mentioned.' But section 2 is not to apply-\n (1) To dispensing by a registered physician in the course of his professional practice only if he keep a record of all his dispensing except what he dispenses in personal attendance upon a patient.\n (2) Or to dispensing of the drug to a consumer by a registered dealer on written prescription of a registered physician if dated on the day it is signed, the dealer to keep record of such prescriptions for inspection.\n (3) Or to sale, exportation, shipment or delivery of the drug by any person within the country for exportation under regulations.\n (4) Or to sale or giving away any of the drug to any officer of the national government or state, county or municipality lawfully engaged in making purchases for hospitals or prisons.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, is to cause suitable forms to be prepared for the purposes mentioned to be distributed to the collectors of \n internal revenue for sale by them to persons who have registered and paid the special tax, and no collector is to sell any forms except to such persons. The price of these forms is to be fixed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, but is not to exceed $1 per hundred. When a collector shall sell forms he is to cause the name of the purchaser to be plainly written or stamped on them before sale and delivery, and no person other than such purchaser shall use the forms so stamped to procure delivery on shipment of any such drug. It is made unlawful to obtain by means of such forms any such drug for use, sale or distribution of it except in the conduct of a lawful business in the drug or in the legitimate practice of a medical profession.\n The third section provides for returns and records to be made by registered persons.\n'The fourth section makes it unlawful for any nonregistered person who has not paid the tax to send, ship, or deliver to any person in another state, except common carriers and employees of registered persons.\n\n Section 5 (26 USCA  701; Comp. St.  6287k) provides for official inspection of orders, prescriptions, etc., and forbids a disclosure of information except for the enforcement of the act.\n Section 6 of the original act was amended by the Revenue Act of 1918 ( 26 USCA  702; Comp. St.  6287l), and relates to minimum limitations upon strength of opium and other drugs to come within statute, but dealers in preparations that are less than minimum are to keep a record of the sale of such for inspection.\n By section 7 (26 USCA  703; Comp. St.  6287m), internal revenue laws as to assessment, collection, remission and refund of internal revenue taxes are made applicable to taxes under the act so far as not inconsistent.\n By section 8 (26 USCA  700; Comp. St.  6287n), it is made unlawful 'for any person not registered' under the act, and who has not paid the special tax, to have in his possession or under his control such drugs, and his thus having them shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of this section, with the usual exemptions of employees of registered persons and of government officers having such possession for their official duties. The section directs that the exemptions need not be negatived in an informa- \n tion or indictment and that the burden of proof is to be upon person claiming exemption.\n Section 9 (26 USCA  705; Comp. St.  6287o) subjects any one violating or failing to comply with the requirements of the act to a fine of not more than $2,000 or imprisonment not more than five years or both.\n Section 10 (26 USCA  706; Comp. St.  6287p) authorizes appointment of agents and others necessary to enforce provisions of the act; and\n Section 11 makes appropriation for carrying out the act. \n\n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN COAL & DOCK CO. v. STRAND(1928)\nNo. 41\nArgued: October 23, 1928Decided: December 10, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Quarles, of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Mortimer Levitan, of Madison, Wis., John A. Cadigan, of Superior, Wis., and John W. Reynolds, of Green Bay, Wis., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, the Northern Coal & Dock Company, an Ohio corporation, whose business is mining, hauling, and selling coal, maintained a dock on Superior Bay, Wisconsin, where it received and unloaded coal brought by vessels from other Lake ports. It employed regularly some 18 men, who worked upon the dock or went upon vessels made fast thereto and unloaded them, as directed. Charles Strand was one of those so employed. October 10, 1924, while on the steamer Matthew Andrews assisting, as his duties required, in the discharge of her cargo, he was struck by the clamshell and instantly killed.\n Respondent Emma Strand, the widow, asked the Industrial Commission of Wisconsin for an award of death benefits against the petitioners-employer and insurance car- \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n rier. It found that both Strand and his employer were subject to the state Compensation Act (St. Wis. 1925,  102.01 et seq.) and awarded benefits. To review this ruling petitioners brought an action in the Dane county circuit court. That court sustained the award and the state Supreme Court approved its action. (193 Wis. 515, 213 N. W. 658, 215 N. W. 448.)\n Strand's employment contemplated that he should labor both upon the land and the water. When killed, he was doing longshore or stevedore work on a vessel lying in navigable waters, according to his undertaking. His employment, so far as it pertained to such work, was maritime; the tort was maritime; and the rights of the parties must be ascertained upon a consideration of the maritime law. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 217\n, 37 S. Ct. 524 (61 L. Ed. 1086, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900); State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302. Originally, that law afforded no remedy for damages arising from death; but we have held that it might be supplemented by state death statutes, which prescrible remedies capable of enforcement in court. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 42 S. Ct. 89 (66 L. Ed. 210). We have also held that state statutes providing compensation for employees through commission might be treated as amending or modifying the maritime law in cases where they concern purely local matters and occasion no interference with the uniformity of such law in its international and interstate relations. Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008; Millers' Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59, 64\n, 46 S. Ct. 194 (70 L. Ed. 470); Smith & Son v. Taylor, \n276 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S. Ct. 228.\n The unloading of a ship is not matter of purely local concern. It has direct relation to commerce and navigation, and uniform rules in respect thereto are essential. The fact that Strand worked for the major portion of the time upon land is unimprotant. He was upon the water in pursuit of his maritime duties when the accident occurred. \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n Chapter 331, Wisconsin Stats. 1923 (section 331.03, 1925 Stats.), provides for recovery of damages arising from death caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default. The same statutes (sections 102.01, 102.02, 102.03, 102.04, and 102.05, et seq.) deprive the employer in personal injury cases of any defense based upon assumption of risk, negligence of fellow servants, or contributory negligence (not willful), unless he has elected to pay compensation in the manner specified, and direct that no contract, rule, or regulation shall relieve him from this restriction; also that, where both employer and employee are subject to the provisions of the act, the liability for compensation therein provided shall be in lieu of all other. One who employers three or more workers is declared to have elected to be subject to the act unless he has indicated the contrary; and, generally, where he has not given notice to the contrary, an employee is subject to the act whenever the employer is.\n There is nothing in the record to indicate that, when contracting with its stevedores, the Dock Company actually agreed to subject itself to the liabilities imposed by the state Compensation Act. And it is enough here to say that the state had no power to impose upon an employer liabilities of that kind in respect of men engaged to perform the work of stevedores on shipboard.\n The Act of March 30, 1920, 41 Stat. 537 (46 USCA  761-768), which provides that the personal representative may sue whenever death may be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default on the high seas, is mentioned in the opinion below; but we think it has no bearing upon the present controversy.\n Section 33 of 'An act to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine, to repeal certain emergency legislation,' etc.-Jones, or Merchant Marine, Act-approved June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n 1007, amends section 20, Act of March 4, 1915 (46 USCA  688), to read as follows:\n'Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common- law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\n\n In International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty (October 18, 1926) \n272 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 19 (70 L. Ed. 157), the plaintiff-a longshoreman- while at work in the hold of a vessel at dock, suffered serious injury through negligence. He sued the employer for damages in the state court and recovered. This court affirmed the judgment and ruled that, within the intendment of the Merchant Marine Act:\n\"Seaman' is to be taken to include stevedores employed in maritime work on navigable waters as the plaintiff was.'\n\n New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147, 151\n, 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139, considered the effect of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, and chapter 143, 36 Stat. 291 (45 USCA  51-59), upon the former right of employees to recover under the laws of the states. That act provides that every interstate carrier by railroad 'shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier,' etc.\n We held 'the act is comprehensive and also exclusive,' and denied the right of an employee of an interstate carrier to recover under a state statute even in respect of injuries suffered without fault as to which the federal act provides no remedy.\n Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391, ruled that section 20, Act of March 4, 1915, as amended by the Merchant Marine Act, incorporated the Federal Employers' Liability Act into the maritime law of the United States. See, Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33, 35\n, 46 S. Ct. 410 (70 L. Ed. 813).\n We think it necessarily follows from former decisions that by the Merchant Marine Act-a measure of general application-Congress provided a method under which the widow of Strand might secure damages resulting from his death, and that no state statute can provide any other or different one. See Partrone v. M. P. Howlett, Inc., 237 N. Y. 394, 143 N. E. 232.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Concurring opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result. As the majority have placed their conclusion, in part at least, on the grounds that a stevedore, while working on a ship in navigable waters is a 'seaman' within the meaning of the Jones Act, International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19, and that by the Jones Act Congress has occupied the field and excluded all state legislation having application within it, I am content to rest the case there. Similar effect has \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n been given to the Federal Employers' Liability Act. N. Y. Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147\n, 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139\n\n\n But I should have found it difficult to say that the present case is controlled by the maritime law and so to suggest that workmen otherwise in the situation of the respondent, but who are not seamen and therefore are not given a remedy by the Jones Act, are excluded from the benefits of a compensation act like that of Wisconsin.\n The state act here is contractual, as we have held in Both Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Comm., \n271 \nU.S. 208\n, 46 S. Ct. 491, and the employer is bound to pay compensation in accordance with the schedules of the act because the parties have agreed that they shall apply rather than the common or any other applicable law. The employer, a wholesale coal dealer, owned or controlled no ships and, except that it owned a dock at which coal was delivered to it from ships, had no connection with maritime affairs. The employee's regular work was non-maritime and he spent but 2 per cent. of his time unloading his employer's coal from ships. To me it would seem that the rights of parties who have thus stipulated for the benefits of a state statute in an essentially nonmaritime employment are not on any theory controlled by the maritime law or within the purview of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145; State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302.\n Nor would it seem that resort by an employee only casually working on a ship, through such a nonmaritime stipulation, to a state remedy not against the ship or its owner, but against the employer engaged in a nonmaritime pursuit is anything more than a local matter or would impair the uniformity of maritime law in its international or interstate relations. Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008; Millers' Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59\n, 46 S. Ct. 194. Recovery in a state court upon an \n\n[278 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n insurance policy upon the life of a seaman for death occurring on a ship on the high seas while in the performance of his duties would not, I suppose, be deemed to have that effect or be precluded by the admiralty law, even though some of the provisions of the policy were imposed by state statute.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLMSTEAD v.

L. R. 1472, and 19 F.(2d) 850. The petition in No. 493 Was filed August 30, 1927; in Nos. 532 and 533, September 9, 1927. They were granted with the distinct limitation that the hearing should be confined to the single question whether the use of evidence of private telephone conversations between the defendants and others, intercepted by means of wire tapping, amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. \n276 \nU.S. 609\n, 48 S. Ct. 207, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The petitioners were convicted in the District Court for the Western District of Washington of a conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA) by unlawfully possessing, transporting and importing intoxicating liquors and maintaining nuisances, and by selling intoxicating liquors. Seventy-two others, in addition to the petitioners, were indicted. Some were not apprehended, some were acquitted, and others pleaded guilty.\n The evidence in the records discloses a conspiracy of amazing magnitude to import, possess, and sell liquor un- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 456]\n\u00a0\n lawfully. It involved the employment of not less than 50 persons, of two sea-going vessels for the transportation of liquor to British Columbia, of smaller vessels for coastwise transportation to the state of Washington, the purchase and use of a branch beyond the suburban limits of Seattle, with a large underground cache for storage and a number of smaller caches in that city, the maintenance of a central office manned with operators, and the employment of executives, salesmen, deliverymen dispatchers, scouts, bookkeepers, collectors, and an attorney. In a bad month sales amounted to $176,000; the aggregate for a year must have exceeded $2,000, 000.\n Olmstead was the leading conspirator and the general manager of the business. He made a contribution of $10,000 to the capital; 11 others contributed $1,000 each. The profits were divided, one-half to Olmstead and the remainder to the other 11. Of the several offices in Seattle, the chief one was in a large office building. In this there were three telephones on three different lines. There were telephones in an office of the manager in his own home, at the homes of his associates, and at other places in the city. Communication was had frequently with Vancouver, British Columbia. Times were fixed for the deliveries of the 'stuff' to places along Puget Sound near Seattle, and from there the liquor was removed and deposited in the caches already referred to. One of the chief men was always on duty at the main office to receive orders by the telephones and to direct their filling by a corps of men stationed in another room-the 'bull pen.' The call numbers of the telephones were given to those known to be likely customers. At times the sales amounted to 200 cases of liquor per day.\n The information which led to the discovery of the conspiracy and its nature and extent was largely obtained by intercepting messages on the telephones of the conspirators by four federal prohibition officers. Small \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 457]\n\u00a0\n wires were inserted along the ordinary telephone wires from the residences of four of the petitioners and those leading from the chief office. The insertions were made without trespass upon any property of the defendants. They were made in the basement of the large office building. The taps from house lines were made in the streets near the houses.\n The gathering of evidence continued for many months. Conversations of the conspirators, of which refreshing stenographic notes were currently made, were testified to by the government witnesses. They revealed the large business transactions of the partners and their subordinates. Men at the wires heard the orders given for liquor by customers and the acceptances; they became auditors of the conversations between the partners. All this disclosed the conspiracy charged in the indictment. Many of the intercepted conversations were not merely reports, but parts of the criminal acts. The evidence also disclosed the difficulties to which the conspirators were subjected, the reported news of the capture of vessels, the arrest of their men, and the seizure of cases of liquor in garages and other places. It showed the dealing by Olmstead, the chief conspirator, with members of the Seattle police, the messages to them which secured the release of arrested members of the conspiracy, and also direct promises to officers of payments as soon as opportunity offered.\n The Fourth Amendment provides:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n And the Fifth:\n'No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.' \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 458]\n\u00a0\n It will be helpful to consider the chief cases in this court which bear upon the construction of these amendments.\n\n Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S. Ct. 524, was an information filed by the District Attorney in the federal court in a cause of seizure and forfeiture against 35 cases of plate glass, which charged that the owner and importer, with intent to defraud the revenue, made an entry of the imported merchandise by means of a fraudulent or false invoice. It became important to show the quantity and value of glass contained in 29 cases previously imported. The fifth section of the Act of June 22, 1874 (19 USCA  535), provided that, in cases not criminal under the revenue laws, the United States attorney, whenever he thought an invoice, belonging to the defendant, would tend to prove any allegation made by the United States, might by a written motion, describing the invoice and setting forth the allegation which he expected to prove, secure a notice from the court to the defendant to produce the invoice, and, if the defendant refused to produce it, the allegations stated in the motion should be taken as confessed, but if produced the United States attorney should be permitted, under the direction of the court, to make an examination of the invoice, and might offer the same in evidence. This act had succeeded the act of 1867 (14 Stat. 547), which provided in such cases the District Judge, on affidavit of any person interested, might issue a warrant to the marshall to enter the premises where the invoice was and take possession of it and hold it subject to the order of the judge. This had been preceded by the act of 1863 (12 Stat. 740) of a similar tenor, except that it directed the warrant to the collector instead of the marshal. The United States attorney followed the act of 1874 and compelled the production of the invoice.\n The court held the act of 1874 repugnant to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. As to the Fourth Amendment, Justice Bradley said (page 621 (6 S. Ct. 527)):\n\n\n[277 U.S. 438, 459]\n\u00a0\n 'But, in regard to the Fourth Amendment, it is contended that, whatever might have been alleged against the constitutionality of the acts of 1863 and 1867, that of 1874, under which the order in the present case was made, is free from constitutional objection, because it does not authorize the search and seziure of books and papers, but only requires the defendant or claimant to produce them. That is so; but it declares that if he does not produce them, the allegations which it is affirmed they will prove shall be taken as confessed. This is tantamount to compelling their production; for the prosecuting attorney will always be sure to state the evidence expected to be derived from them as strongly as the case will admit of. It is true that certain aggravating incidents of actual search and seizure, such as forcible entry into a man's house and searching amongst his papers, are wanting, and to this extent the proceeding under the act of 1874 is a mitigation of that which was authorized by the former acts; but it accomplishes the substantial object of those acts in forcing from a party evidence against himself. It is our opinion, therefore, that a compulsory production of a man's private papers to establish a criminal charge against him, or to forfeit his property, is within the scope of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, in all cases in which a search and seizure would be; because it is a material ingredient, and effects the sole object and purpose of search and seizure.'\n Concurring, Mr. Justice Miller and Chief Justice Waite said that they did not think the machinery used to get this evidence amounted to a search and seizure, but they agreed that the Fifth Amendment had been violated.\n The statute provided an official demand for the production of a paper of document by the defendant, for official search and use as evidence on penalty that by refusal he should be conclusively held to admit the incriminat- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 460]\n\u00a0\n ing character of the document as charged. It was certainly no straining of the language to construe the search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to include such official procedure.\n The next case, and perhaps the most important, is Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1815C, 1177, a conviction for using the mails to transmit coupons or tickets in a lottery enterpise. The defendant was arrested by a police officer without a warrant. After his arrest, other police officers and the United States marshal went to his house, got the key from a neighbor, entered the defendant's room, and searched it, and took possession of various papers and articles. Neither the marshal nor the police officers had a search warrant. The defendant filed a petition in court asking the return of all his property. The court ordered the return of everything not pertinent to the charge, but denied return of relevant evidence. After the jury was sworn, the defendant again made objection, and on introduction of the papers contended that the search without warrant was a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and they were therefore inadmissible. This court held that such taking of papers by an official of the United States, acting under color of his office, was in violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant, and upon making seasonable application he was entitled to have them restored, and that by permitting their use upon the trial the trial court erred.\n The opinion cited with approval language of Mr. Justice Field in Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 733, saying that the Fourth Amendment as a principle of protection was applicable to sealed letters and packages in the mail, and that, consistently with it, such matter could only be opened and examined upon warrants issued on oath or affirmation particularly describing the thing to be seized.\n In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, 24 A. L. R. 1426, the defendants were arrested at their homes and \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 461]\n\u00a0\n detained in custody. While so detained, representatives of the government without authority went to the office of their company and seized all the books, papers, and documents found there. An application for return of the things was opposed by the district attorney, who produced a subpoena for certain documents relating to the charge in the indictment then on file. The court said:\n'Thus the case is not that of knowledge acquired through the wrongful act of a stranger, but it must be assumed that the government planned or at all events ratified the whole performance.'\n\n And it held that the illegal character of the original seizure characterized the entire proceeding and under the Weeks Case the seized papers must be restored.\n In Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313\n, 41 S. Ct. 266, the defendant was convicted of concealing whisky on which the tax had not been paid. At the trial he presented a petition asking that private property seized in a search of his house and store 'within his curtilage' without warrant should be returned. This was denied. A woman, who claimed to be his wife, was told by the revenue officers that they had come to search the premises for violation of the revenue law. She opened the door; they entered and found whisky. Further searches in the house disclosed more. It was held that this action constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the denial of the motion to restore the whisky and to exclude the testimony was error.\n In Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261, the facts were these: Gouled and two others were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. One pleaded guilty and another was acquitted. Gouled prosecuted error. The matter was presented here on questions propounded by the lower court. The first related to the admission in evidence of a paper surreptitiously taken from the office of the defendant by one acting under the direc- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 462]\n\u00a0\n tion of an officer of the Intelligence Department of the Army of the United States. Gouled was suspected of the crime. A private in the United States Army, pretending to make a friendly call on him, gained admission to his office, and in his absence, without warrant of any character, seized and carried away several documents. One of these, belonging to Gouled, was delivered to the United States attorney and by him introduced in evidence. When produced it was a surprise to the defendant. He had had no opportunity to make a previous motion to secure a return of it. The paper had no pecuniary value, but was relevant to the issue made on the trial. Admission of the paper was considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20\n, 46 S. Ct. 4, 51 A. L. R. 409, held that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were violated by admission in evidence of contraband narcotics found in defendant's house, several blocks distant from the place of arrest, after his arrest and seized there without a warrant. Under such circumstances the seizure could not be justified as incidental to the arrest.\n There is no room in the present case for applying the Fifth Amendment, unless the Fourth Amendment was first violated. There was no evidence of compulsion to induce the defendants to talk over their many telephones. They were continually and voluntarily transacting business without knowledge of the interception. Our consideration must be confined to the Fourth Amendment.\n The striking outcome of the Weeks Case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in court, really forbade its introduction, if obtained by government officers through a violation of the amendment. Theretofore many had supposed that under the ordinary common-law rules, if the tendered evidence was pertinent, the method of obtaining it was \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 463]\n\u00a0\n unimportant. This was held by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Dana, 2 Metc. 329, 337. There it was ruled that the only remedy open to a defendant whose rights under a state constitutional equivalent of the Fourth Amendment had been invaded was by suit and judgment for damages, as Lord Camden held in Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell, State Trials, 1029. Mr. Justice Bradley made effective use of this case in Boyd v. United States. But in the Weeks Case, and those which followed, this court decided with great emphasis and established as the law for the federal courts that the protection of the Fourth Amendment would be much impaired, unless it was held that not only was the official violator of the rights under the amendment subject to action at the suit of the injured defendant, but also that the evidence thereby obtained could not be received.\n The well-known historical purpose of the Fourth Amendment, directed against general warrants and writs of assistance, was to prevent the use of governmental force to search a man's house, his person, his papers, and his effects, and to prevent their seizure against his will. This phase of the misuse of governmental power of compulsion is the emphasis of the opinion of the court in the Boyd Case. This appears, too, in the Weeks Case, in the Silverthorne Case, and in the Amos Case.\n Gouled v. United States carried the inhibition against unreasonable searches and seizures to the extreme limit. Its authority is not to be enlarged by implication, and must be confined to the precise state of facts disclosed by the record. A representative of the Intelligence Department of the Army, having by stealth obtained admission to the defendant's office, seized and carried away certain private papers valuable for evidential purposes. This was held an unreasonable search and seizure within the Fourth Amendment. A stealthy entrance in such cir- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 464]\n\u00a0\n cumstances became the equivalent to an entry by force. There was actual entrance into the private quarters of defendant and the taking away of something tangible. Here we have testimony only of voluntary conversations secretly overheard.\n The amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material things-the person, the house, his papers, or his effects. The description of the warrant necessary to make the proceeding lawful is that it must specify the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized.\n It is urged that the language of Mr. Justice Field in Ex parte Jackson, already quoted, offers an analogy to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in respect of wire tapping. But the analogy fails. The Fourth Amendment may have proper application to a sealed letter in the mail, because of the constitutional provision for the Postoffice Department and the relations between the government and those who pay to secure protection of their sealed letters. See Revised Statutes,  3978 to 3988, whereby Congress monopolizes the carriage of letters and excludes from that business everyone else, and section 3929 (39 USCA  259), which forbids any postmaster or other person to open any letter not addressed to himself. It is plainly within the words of the amendment to say that the unlawful rifling by a government agent of a sealed letter is a search and seizure of the sender's papers of effects. The letter is a paper, an effect, and in the custody of a government that forbids carriage, except under its protection.\n The United States takes no such care of telegraph or telephone messages as of mailed sealed letters. The amendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no searching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the use of the sense of hearing and that only. There was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 465]\n\u00a0\n By the invention of the telephone 50 years ago, and its application for the purpose of extending communications, one can talk with another at a far distant place.\n The language of the amendment cannot be extended and expanded to include telephone wires, reaching to the whole world from the defendant's house or office. The intervening wires are not part of his house or office, any more than are the highways along which they are stretched.\n This court, in Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 149\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 284 (69 L. Ed. 543, 39 A. L. R. 790), declared:\n'The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests, as well as the interest and rights of individual citizens.'\n\n Justice Bradley, in the Boyd Case, and Justice Clarke, in the Gouled Case, said that the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment were to be liberally construed to effect the purpose of the framers of the Constitution in the interest of liberty. But that cannot justify enlargement of the language employed beyond the possible practical meaning of houses, persons, papers, and effects, or so to apply the words search and seizure as to forbid hearing or sight.\n Hester v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 57\n, 44 S. Ct. 445, held that the testimony of two officers of the law who trespassed on the defendant's land, concealed themselves 100 yards away from his house, and saw him come out and hand a bottle of whisky to another, was not inadmissible. While there was a trespass, there was no search of person, house, papers, or effects. United States v. Lee, \n274 \nU.S. 559, 563\n, 47 S. Ct. 746; Eversole v. State, 106 Tex. Cr. R. 567, 294 S. W. 210.\n Congress may, of course, protect the secrecy of telephone messages by making them, when intercepted, inadmissible in evidence in federal criminal trials, by direct legislation, \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 466]\n\u00a0\n and thus depart from the common law of evidence. But the courts may not adopt such a policy by attributing an enlarged and unusual meaning to the Fourth Amendment. The reasonable view is that one who installs in his house a telephone instrument with connecting wires intends to project his voice to those quite outside, and that the wires beyond his house, and messages while passing over them, are not within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Here those who intercepted the projected voices were not in the house of either party to the conversation.\n Neither the cases we have cited nor any of the many federal decisions brought to our attention hold the Fourth Amendment to have been violated as against a defendant, unless there has been an official search and seizure of his person or such a seizure of his papers or his tangible material effects or an actual physical invasion of his house 'or curtilage' for the purpose of making a seizure.\n We think, therefore, that the wire tapping here disclosed did not amount to a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n What has been said disposes of the only question that comes within the terms of our order granting certiorari in these cases. But some of our number, departing from that order, have concluded that there is merit in the twofold objection, overruled in both courts below, that evidence obtained through intercepting of telephone messages by a government agents was inadmissible, because the mode of obtaining it was unethical and a misdemeanor under the law of Washington. To avoid any misapprehension of our views of that objection we shall deal with it in both of its phases.\n While a territory, the English common law prevailed in Washington, and thus continued after her admission in 1889. The rules of evidence in criminal cases in courts of the United States sitting there consequently are those of the common law. United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361, \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 467]\n\u00a0\n 363, 366; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 301\n, 12 S. Ct. 617; Rosen v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 467\n, 38 S. Ct. 148; Withaup v. United States (C. C. A.) 127 F. 530, 534; Robinson v. United States (C. C. A.) 292 F. 683, 685.\n The common-law rule is that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the means by which it was obtained. Professor Greenleaf, in his work on Evidence (volume 1 (12th Ed., by Redfield)  254(a)), says:\n'It may be mentioned in this place, that though papers and other subjects of evidence may have been illegally taken from the possession of the party against whom they are offered, or otherwise unlawfully obtained, this is no valid objection to their admissibility, if they are pertinent to the issue. The court will not take notice how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully, nor will it form an issue, to determine that question.'\n\n Mr. Jones, in his work on the same subject, refers to Mr. Greenleaf's statement, and says:\n'Where there is no violation of a constitutional guaranty, the verity of the above statement is absolute.' Section 2075, note 3, vol. 5.\n\n The rule is supported by many English and American cases cited by Jones in section 2075, note 3, and section 2076, note 6, vol. 5; and by Wigmore, vol. 4,  2183. It is recognized by this court in Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S. Ct. 372. The Weeks Case announced an exception to the commonlaw rule by excluding all evidence in the procuring of which government officials took part by methods forbidden by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Many state courts do not follow the Weeks Case. People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N. E. 585. But those who do treat it as an exception to the general common-law rule and required by constitutional limitations. Hughes v. State, 145 Tenn. 544, 551, 566, 238 S. W. 588, 20 A. L. R. 639; State v. Wills, 91 W. Va. 659, 677, 114 S. E. 261, 24 A. L. R. 1398; State v. Slamon, 73 Vt. 212, 214, 215, 50 A. 1097, 87 Am. St. Rep. 711; Gindrat v. People, 138 Ill. 103, 111, 27 N. E. 1085; People v. Castree, 311 Ill. 392, 396, 397, 143 N. E. 112, 32 A. L. R. 357; State v. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 468]\n\u00a0\n Gardner, 77 Mont. 8, 21, 249 P. 574, 52 A. L. R. 454; State v. Fahn, 53 N. D. 203, 210, 205 N. W. 67. The common-law rule must apply in the case at bar.\n Nor can we, without the sanction of congressional enactment, subscribe to the suggestion that the courts have a discretion to exclude evidence, the admission of which is not unconstitutional, because unethically secured. This would be at variance with the common-law doctrine generally supported by authority. There is no case that sustains, nor any recognized text-book that gives color to, such a view. Our general experience shows that much evidence has always been receivable, although not obtained by conformity to the highest ethics. The history of criminal trials shows numerous cases of prosecutions of oathbound conspiracies for murder, robbery, and other crimes, where officers of the law have disguished themselves and joined the organizations, taken the oaths, and given themselves every appearance of active members engaged in the promotion of crime for the purpose of securing evidence. Evidence secured by such means has always been received.\n A standard which would forbid the reception of evidence, if obtained by other than nice ethical conduct by government officials, would make society suffer and give criminals greater immunity than has been known heretofore. In the absence of controlling legislation by Congress, those who realize the difficulties in bringing offenders to justice may well deem it wise that the exclusion of evidence should be confined to cases where rights under the Constitution would be violated by admitting it.\n The statute of Washington, adopted in 1909, provides (Remington Compiled Statutes 1922,  2656(18) that:\n'Every person ... who shall intercept, read or in any manner interrupt or delay the sending of a message over any telegraph or telephone line ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.' \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 469]\n\u00a0\n This statute does not declare that evidence obtained by such interception shall be inadmissible, and by the common law, already referred to, it would not be. People v. McDonald, 177 App. Div. 806, 165 N. Y. S. 41. Whether the state of Washington may prosecute and punish federal officers violating this law, and those whose messages were intercepted may sue them civilly, is not before us. But clearly a statute, passed 20 years after the admission of the state into the Union, cannot affect the rules of evidence applicable in courts of the United States. Chief Justice Taney, in United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361, 363 (13 L. Ed. 1023), construing the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act (now 28 USCA  77), said:\n\n'But it could not be supposed, without very plain words to show it, that Congress intended to give to the states the power of prescribing the rules of evidence in trials for offenses against the United States. For this construction would in effect place the criminal jurisprudence of one sovereignty under the control of another.'\n\n See, also, Withaup v. United States (C. C. A.) 127 F. 530, 534.\n The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are affirmed. The mandates will go down forthwith under rule 31.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n My brother BRANDEIS has given this case so exhaustive an examination that I desire to add but a few words. While I do not deny it I am not prepared to say that the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant, although I fully agree that courts are apt to err by sticking too closely to the words of a law where those words import a policy that goes beyond them. Gooch v. Oregon Short Line R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 42 S. Ct. 192. But I think, as Mr. Justice BRANDEIS says, that apart from the Constitution the government ought not to use \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 470]\n\u00a0\n evidence obtained and only obtainable by a criminal act. There is no body of precedents by which we are bound, and which confines us to logical deduction from established rules. Therefore we must consider the two objects of desire both of which we cannot have and make up our minds which to choose. It is desirable that criminals should be detected, and to that end that all available evidence should be used. It also is desirable that the government should not itself foster and pay for other crimes, when they are the means by which the evidence is to be obtained. If it pays its officers for having got evidence by crime I do not see why it may not as well pay them for getting it in the same way, and I can attach no importance to protestations of disapproval if it knowingly accepts and pays and announces that in future it will pay for the fruits. We have to choose, and for my part I think it a less evil that some criminals should escape than that the government should play an ignoble part.\n For those who agree with me no distinction can be taken between the government as prosecutor and the government as judge. If the existing code does not permit district attorenys to have a hand in such dirty business it does not permit the judge to allow such iniquities to succeed. See Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, 24 A. L. R. 1426. And if all that I have said so far be accepted it makes no difference that in this case wire tapping is made a crime by the law of the state, not by the law of the United States. It is true that a state cannot make rules of evidence for courts of the United States, but the state has authority over the conduct in question, and I hardly think that the United States would appear to greater advantage when paying for an odious crime against state law than when inciting to the disregard of its own. I am aware of the often-repeated statement that in a criminal proceeding the court will not take notice of the manner in which papers offered in evidence have been \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 471]\n\u00a0\n obtained. But that somewhat rudimentary mode of disposing of the question has been overthrown by Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, and the cases that have followed it. I have said that we are free to choose between two principles of policy. But if we are to confine ourselves to precedent and logic the reason for excluding evidence obtained by violating the Constitution seems to me logically to lead to excluding evidence obtained by a crime of the officers of the law.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The defendants were convicted of conspiring to violate the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). Before any of the persons now charged had been arrested or indicted, the telephones by means of which they habitually communicated with one another and with others had been tapped by federal officers. To this end, a lineman of long experience in wire tapping was employed, on behalf of the government and at its expense. He tapped eight telephones, some in the homes of the persons charged, some in their offices. Acting on behalf of the government and in their official capacity, at least six other prohibition agents listened over the tapped wires and reported the messages taken. Their operations extended over a period of nearly five months. The typewritten record of the notes of conversations overheard occupies 775 typewritten pages. By objections seasonably made and persistently renewed, the defendants objected to the admission of the evidence obtained by wire tapping, on the ground that the government's wire tapping constituted an unreasonable search and seizure, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the use as evidence of the conversations overheard compelled the defendants to be witnesses against themselves, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n The government makes no attempt to defend the methods employed by its officers. Indeed, it concedes \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 472]\n\u00a0\n that, if wire tapping can be deemed a search and seizure within the Fourth Amendment, such wire tapping as was practiced in the case at bar was an unreasonable search and seizure, and that the evidence thus obtained was inadmissible. But it relies on the language of the amendment, and it claims that the protection given thereby cannot properly be held to include a telephone conversation.\n'We must never forget,' said Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 4 L. Ed. 579, 'that it is a Constitution we are expounding.' Since then this court has repeatedly sustained the exercise of power by Congress, under various clauses of that instrument, over objects of which the fathers could not have dreamed. See Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n96 U.S. 1\n, 9; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 135\n, 39 S. Ct. 502; Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163\n, 39 S. Ct. 507, 4 A. L. R. 1623; Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432\n, 45 S. Ct. 345, 37 A. L. R. 1407. We have likewise held that general limitations on the powers of government, like those embodied in the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, do not forbid the United States or the states from meeting modern conditions by regulations which 'a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive.' Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 387\n, 47 S. Ct. 114, 118 (71 L. Ed. 303); Buck v. Bell, \n274 \nU.S. 200\n, 47 S. Ct. 584, 71 L. 1000. Clauses guaranteeing to the individual protection against specific abuses of power, must have a similar capacity of adaptation to a changing world. It was with reference to such a clause that this court said in Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 373\n, 30 S. Ct. 544, 551 (54 L. Ed. 793, 19 Ann. Cas. 705):\n\n'Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from an experience of evils, but its general language should not, therefore, be necessarily confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 473]\n\u00a0\n and purposes. Therefore a principal to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of Constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.' The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made. In the application of a Constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. Under any other rule a Constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be lost in reality.'\n\n When the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were adopted, 'the form that evil had theretofore taken' had been necessarily simple. Force and violence were then the only means known to man by which a government could directly effect self-incrimination. It could compel the individual to testify-a compulsion effected, if need be, by torture. It could secure possession of his papers and other articles incident to his private life-a seizure effected, if need be, by breaking and entry. Protection against such invasion of 'the sanctities of a man's home and the privacies of life' was provided in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by specific language. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 630\n, 6 S. Ct. 524. But 'time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes.' Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become available to the government. Discovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 474]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, 'in the application of a Constitution, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but of what may be.' The progress of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire tapping. Ways may some day be developed by which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. Advances in the psychic and related sciences may bring means of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions. 'That places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer' was said by James Otis of much lesser intrusions than these. 1 To Lord Camden a far slighter intrusion seemed 'subversive of all the comforts of society.' \n2\n Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?\n A sufficient answer is found in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 627-630, 6 S. Ct. 524, a case that will be remembered as long as civil liberty lives in the United States. This court there reviewed the history that lay behind the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. We said with reference to Lord Camden's judgment in Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell's State Trials, 1030:\n'The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case there before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employe  of the sanctities of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal se- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 475]\n\u00a0\n curity, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense-it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of Lord Camden's judgment. Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence of a crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.'3\n\n In Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, it was held that a sealed letter intrusted to the mail is protected by the amendments. The mail is a public service furnished by the government. The telephone is a public service furnished by its authority. There is, in essence, no difference between the sealed letter and the private telephone message. As Judge Rudkin said below:\n'True, the one is visible, the other invisible; the one is tangible, the other intangible; the one is sealed, and the other unsealed; but these are distinctions without a difference.'\n\n The evil incident to invasion of the privacy of the telephone is far greater than that involved in tampering with the mails. Whenever a telephone line is tapped, the privacy of the persons at both ends of the line is invaded, and all con- \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 476]\n\u00a0\n versations between them upon any subject, and although proper, confidential, and privileged, may be overheard. Moreover, the tapping of one man's telephone line involves the tapping of the telephone of every other person whom he may call, or who may call him. As a means of espionage, writs of assistance and general warrants are but puny instruments of tyranny and oppression when compared with wire tapping.\n Time and again this court, in giving effect to the principle underlying the Fourth Amendment, has refused to place an unduly literal construction upon it. This was notably illustrated in the Boyd Case itself. Taking language in its ordinary meaning, there is no 'search' or 'seizure' when a defendant is required to produce a document in the orderly process of a court's procedure. 'The right of the people of be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,' would not be violated, under any ordinary construction of language, by compelling obedience to a subpoena. But this court holds the evidence inadmissible simply because the information leading to the issue of the subpoena has been unlawfully secured. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182. Literally, there is no 'search' or 'seizure' when a friendly visitor abstracts papers from an office; yet we held in Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261, that evidence so obtained could not be used. No court which looked at the words of the amendment rather than at its underlying purpose would hold, as this court did in Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 733, that its protection extended to letters in the mails. The provision against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment has been given an equally broad construction. The language is:\n'No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'\n\n Yet we have held not only that the \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 477]\n\u00a0\n protection of the amendment extends to a witness before a grand jury, although he has not been charged with crime (Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 562\n, 586 S., 12 S. Ct. 195), but that:\n'It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant.' McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n266 \nU.S. 34, 40\n, 45 S. Ct. 16, 17 (69 L. Ed. 158).\n\n The narrow language of the Amendment has been consistently construed in the light of its object, 'to insure that a person should not be compelled, when acting as a witness in any investigation, to give testimony which might tend to show that he himself had committed a crime. The privilege is limited to criminal matters, but it is as broad as the mischief against which it seeks to guard.' Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra, page 562 (12 S. Ct. 198).\n Decisions of this court applying the principle of the Boyd Case have settled these things. Unjustified search and seizure violates the Fourth Amendment, whatever the character of the paper;4 whether the paper when taken by the federal officers was in the home,5 in an office,6 or elsewhere;7 whether the taking was effected by force,8 by \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 478]\n\u00a0\n fraud,9 or in the orderly process of a court's procedure. \n10\n From these decisions, it follows necessarily that the amendment is violated by the officer's reading the paper without a physical seizure, without his even touching it, and that use, in any criminal proceeding, of the contents of the paper so examined-as where they are testified to by a federal officer who thus saw the document or where, through knowledge so obtained, a copy has been procured elsewhere11-any such use constitutes a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n The protection guaranteed by the amendments is much broader in scope. The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone-the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To protect, that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And the use, as evidence \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 479]\n\u00a0\n in a criminal proceeding, of facts ascertained by such intrusion must be deemed a violation of the Fifth.\n Applying to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments the established rule of construction, the defendants' objections to the evidence obtained by wire tapping must, in my opinion, be sustained. It is, of course, immaterial where the physical connection with the telephone wires leading into the defendants' premises was made. And it is also immaterial that the intrusion was in aid of law enforcement. Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Independently of the constitutional question, I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed. By the laws of Washington, wire tapping is a crime. \n13\n Pierce's \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 480]\n\u00a0\n Code 1921,  8976(18). To prove its case, the government was obliged to lay bare the crimes committed by its officers on its behalf. A federal court should not permit such a prosecution to continue. Compare Harkin v. Brundage (No. 117) \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S. Ct. 268, decided February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 438, 481]\n\u00a0\n The situation in the case at bar differs widely from that presented in Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 574, 13 A. L. R. 1159. There only a single lot of papers was involved. They had been obtained by a private detective while acting on behalf of a private party, without the knowledge of any federal official, long before any one had thought of instituting a \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 482]\n\u00a0\n federal prosecution. Here the evidence obtained by crime was obtained at the government's expense, by its officers, while acting on its behalf; the officers who committed these crimes are the same officers who were charged with the enforcement of the Prohibition Act; the crimes of these officers were committed for the purpose of securing evidence with which to obtain an indictment and to secure a conviction. The evidence so obtained constitutes the warp and woof of the government's case. The aggregate of the government evidence occupies 306 pages of the printed record. More than 210 of them are filled by recitals of the details of the wire tapping and of facts ascertained thereby. \n14\n There is literally no other evidence of guilt on the part of some of the defendants except that illegally obtained by these officers. As to nearly all the defendants (except those who admitted guilt), the evidence relied upon to secure a conviction consisted mainly of that which these officers had so obtained by violating the state law.\n As Judge Rudkin said below (19 F.(2d) 842):\n'Here we are concerned with neither eavesdroppers nor thieves. Nor are we concerned with the acts of private individuals. ... We are concerned only with the acts of federal agents, whose powers are limited and controlled by the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The Eighteenth Amendment has not in terms empowered Congress to authorize any one to violate the criminal laws of a state. And Congress has never purported to do so. Compare Maryland v. Soper, \n270 \nU.S. 9\n, 46 S. Ct. 185. The terms of appointment of federal prohibition agents do not purport to confer upon them authority to violate any criminal law. Their superior officer, the Secretary of the Treasury, has not instructed them to commit \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 483]\n\u00a0\n crime on behalf of the United States. It may be assumed that the Attorney General of the United States did not give any such instruction. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n When these unlawful acts were committed they were crimes only of the officers individually. The government was innocent, in legal contemplation; for no federal official is authorized to commit a crime on its behalf. When the government, having full knowledge, sought, through the Department of Justice, to avail itself of the fruits of these acts in order to accomplish its own ends, it assumed moral responsibility for the officers' crimes. Compare the Paquete Habana, \n189 \nU.S. 453, 465\n, 23 S. Ct. 593; O'Reilly de Camara v. Brooke, \n209 \nU.S. 45, 52\n, 28 S. Ct. 439; Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530, 532\n, 47 S. Ct. 191; Gambino v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 310\n, 48 S. Ct. 137, and if this court should permit the government, by means of its officers' crimes, to effect its purpose of punishing the defendants, there would seem to be present all the elements of a ratification. If so, the government itself would become a lawbreaker.\n Will this court, by sustaining the judgment below, sanction such conduct on the part of the executive? The governing principle has long been settled. It is that a court will not redress a wrong when he who invokes its aid has unclean hands. \n16\n The maxim of unclean hands comes \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 484]\n\u00a0\n from courts of equity. 17 But the principle prevails also in courts of law. Its common application is in civil actions between private parties. Where the government is the actor, the reasons for applying it are even more persuasive. Where the remedies invoked are those of the criminal law, the reasons are compelling. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n The door of a court is not barred because the plaintiff has committed a crime. The confirmed criminal is as much entitled to redress as his most virtuous fellow citizen; no record of crime, however long, makes one an outlaw. The court's aid is denied only when he who seeks it has violated the law in connection with the very transaction as to which he seeks legal redress. 19 Then aid is denied despite the defendant's wrong. It is denied in order to maintain respect for law; in order to promote confidence in the administration of justice; in order to preserve the judicial process from contamination. The rule is one, not of action, but of inaction. It is sometimes \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 485]\n\u00a0\n spoken of as a rule of substantive law. But it extends to matters of procedure as well. \n20\n A defense may be waived. It is waived when not pleaded. But the objection that the plaintiff comes with unclean hands will be taken by the court itself. \n21\n It will be taken despite the wish to the contrary of all the parties to the litigation. The court protects itself.\n Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means-to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal-would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n I sincerely regret that I cannot support the opinion and judgments of the court in these cases. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 486]\n\u00a0\n The order allowing the writs of certiorari operated to limit arguments of counsel to the constitutional question. I do not participate in the controversy that has arisen here as to whether the evidence was inadmissible because the mode of obtaining it was unethical and a misdemeanor under state law. I prefer to say nothing concerning those questions because they are not within the jurisdiction taken by the order.\n The court is required to construe the provision of the Fourth Amendment that declares:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.'\n\n The Fifth Amendment prevents the use of evidence obtained through searches and seizures in violation of the rights of the accused protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n The single question for consideration is this: May the government, consistently with that clause, have its officers whenever they see fit, tap wires, listen to, take down, and report the private messages and conversations transmitted by telephones?\n The United States maintains that:\n'The 'wire tapping' operations of the federal prohibition agents were not a 'search and seizure' in violation of the security of the 'persons, houses, papers and effects' of the petitioners in the constitutional sense or within the intendment of the Fourth Amendment.'\n\n The court, adhering to and reiterating the principles laid down and applied in prior decisions22 construing the search and seizure clause, in substance adopts the contention of the government.\n The question at issue depends upon a just appreciation of the facts. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 487]\n\u00a0\n Telephones are used generally for transmission of messages concerning official, social, business and personal affairs including communications that are private and privileged-those between physician and patient, lwayer and client, parent and child, husband and wife. The contracts between telephone companies and users contemplate the private use of the facilities employed in the service. The communications belong to the parties between whom they pass. During their transmission the exclusive use of the wire belongs to the persons served by it. Wire tapping involves interference with the wire while being used. Tapping the wires and listening in by the officers literally constituted a search for evidence. As the communications passed, they were heard and taken down.\n In Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S. Ct. 524, there was no 'search or seizure' within the literal or ordinary meaning of the words, nor was Boyd-if these constitutional provisions were read strictly according to the letter-compelled in a 'criminal case' to be a 'witness' against himself. The statute, there held unconstitutional because repugnant to the search and seizure clause, merely authorized judgment for sums claimed by the government on account of revenue if the defendant failed to produce his books, invoices and papers. The principle of that case has been followed, developed and applied in this and many other courts. And it is in harmony with the rule of liberal construction that always has been applied to provisions of the Constitution safeguarding personal rights (Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28, 32\n, 47 S. Ct. 248), as well as to those granting governmental powers. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 404, 406, 407, 421; Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 153, 176; Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264; Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 21.\n This court has always construed the Constitution in the light of the principles upon which it was founded. \n\n[277 U.S. 438, 488]\n\u00a0\n The direct operation or literal meaning of the words used do not measure the purpose or scope of its provisions. Under the principles established and applied by this court, the Fourth Amendment safeguards against all evils that are like and equivalent to those embraced within the ordinary meaning of its words. That construction is consonant with sound reason and in full accord with the course of decisions since McCulloch v. Maryland. That is the principle directly applied in the Boyd Case.\n When the facts in these cases are truly estimated, a fair application of that principle decides the constitutional question in favor of the petitioners. With great deference, I think they should be given a new trial.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I concur in the opinions of Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS. I agree also with that of Mr. Justice BUTLER so far as it deals with the merits. The effect of the order granting certiorari was to limit the argument to a single question, but I do not understand that it restrains the court from a consideration of any question which we find to be presented by the record, for, under Judicial Code,  240(a), 28 USCA  347(a), this court determines a case here on certiorari 'with the same power and authority, and with like effect, as if the cause had been brought (here) by unrestricted writ of error or appeal.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Otis' argument against Writs of Assistance.

Ct. 19, the statement made in the Boyd Case was repeated, and the court quoted the statement of Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Railway Commission (C. C.) 32 F. 241, 250: 'Of all the rights of the citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves, not merely protection of his person from assault, but exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from the inspection and scrutiny of others. Without the enjoyment of this right, all other rights would lose half their value.' The Boyd Case has been recently reaffirmed in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, in Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261, and in Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n, 47 S. Ct. 248. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Gouled v.

Davies, all of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 130, 132]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry E. Foster, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Peterson, a seaman, brought an action at law in a Superior Court of Washington against his employer, the Pacific Steamship Company, the owner of a domestic merchant vessel on which he was serving, to recover damages for personal injuries suffered at sea on a voyage between the ports of Puget Sound and California.\n The complaint charged that the injury resulted from the negligence of the mate of the vessel-there being no charge that the vessel was unseaworthy-and based the right of action expressly on section 20 of the Seamen's Act of 1915,1 as amended by section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920.2 This provides:\n'That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.'3\n\n The company in its answer, not only denied the averments of negligence, but alleged, generally in paragraph 2, \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 133]\n\u00a0\n 'that long prior to the commencement of plaintiff's action set out in his said complaint, the plaintiff elected to receive wages to the end of the voyage, and maintenance and cure for any injuries which he received on said voyage; and the plaintiff has received his wages to the end of the voyage and has received maintenance and cure for any injury received, and received the same prior to the filing of his said complaint herein, and he cannot now maintain an action under the Jones Act, or any other act, for damages for any injuries received upon the voyage;' and 'for further answer and affirmative defense' alleged particularly, in paragraph 3, that as soon as the vessel arrived at San Francisco the plaintiff was removed from the vessel by the defendant and conveyed to the Marine Hospital for maintenance and cure; that he 'has received from the defendant at said hospital maintenance and cure as far as medical and surgical attention can reasonably effect a cure,' and also received his wages from the defendant to the end of the voyage, aggregating $41.10, prior to the commencement of the suit; and that 'the plaintiff in accepting said wages to the end of the voyage and in permitting defendant to take him to said Marine Hospital , ... and in consenting to go thereto for maintenance and cure for the injuries he received, elected to take compensation for said injury under the general admiralty and maritime law in such case made and provided, and he has been fully and completely compensated by defendant for said injuries under the said general admiralty and maritime law, and the plaintiff made said election to accept compensation and received the same under the general admiralty and maritime law long prior to the filing of this suit and the plaintiff cannot now elect to sue or maintain this action for damages under section 20 of the act of Congress of March 4, 1915, as amended by section 33 of the Act of June 5, 1920, known as the Jones Act.'\n The court, on the plaintiff's motion, struck from the answer the allegations in paragraph 2; and also sustained a \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 134]\n\u00a0\n demurrer interposed by the plaintiff to the 'affirmative defense' in paragraph 3 on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the action. The case proceeded to trial, and the plaintiff had verdict and judgment. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. Peterson v. Pacific S. S. Co., 145 Wash. 460, 261 P. 115.4 A petition for a writ of certiorari, directed solely to the rulings as to the right to maintain the suit under section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, was then granted (\n276 \nU.S. 612\n, 48 S. Ct. 321).\n By the general maritime law of the United States prior to the Marchant Marine Act, a vessel and her owner were liable, in case a seaman fell sick, or was wounded in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage was continued, and were liable to an indemnity for injuries received by a seaman in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship and her appliances; but a seaman was not allowed to recover an indemnity for injuries sustained through the negligence of the master or any member of the crew.

Ct. 475.\n By section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, as heretofore construed, the prior maritime law of the United States was modified by giving to seamen injured through negligence the rights given to railway employees by the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 and its amendments (45 USCA  51-59) and permitting these new substantive rights to be asserted and enforced in actions in personam against the employers in federal or state courts administering common-law remedies, with the right of trial by jury, or in suits in admiralty in courts administering maritime remedies, without trial by \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 135]\n\u00a0\n jury. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 410; Panama R. R. v. Vasquez, \n271 \nU.S. 557\n, 46 S. Ct. 596; Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316\n, 47 S. Ct. 600\n\n\n The defendant contends, on the one hand, that this statute gives an injured seaman the new right of action for damages merely as an alternative right to those provided by the old maritime rules, which he may enforce 'at his election,' thereby requiring him to elect whether he will proceed for the recovery of maintenance, cure, wages and indemnity under the old maritime rules, or for the recovery of damages under the new rule; and hence that if he demands and receives from the employer maintenance, cure and wages under the old maritime rules, he is bound by that as an election and cannot thereafter maintain an action for damages under the statute.\n The plaintiff contends, on the other hand, that the words 'at his election' as used in the statute, refer at the most, to an election between an action for compensatory damages, on the ground of negligence, under the new rule, and the inconsistent action for indemnity or compensatory damages on the ground of unseaworthiness, under the old maritime rules; and not to an election between an action for damages under the new rule and the consistent and cumulative remedy for maintenance, cure and wages under the old rules.\n We pass without determination the question whether the affirmative allegations of fact in the answer, as distinguished from the conclusions of the pleader, show that the plaintiff had in fact demanded or received maintenance and cure from the defendant or had merely acquiesced in being taken by the defendant to the Marine Hospital and there receiving from the United States, without expense to himself or to the defendant, maintenance and treatment as a disabled seaman; and we proceed to the determination of the sole question argued by counsel, \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 136]\n\u00a0\n that is, whether if the plaintiff had demanded and received maintenance, cure and wages from the defendant this constituted an election which prevented him from thereafter maintaining a suit for compensatory damages under the statute.\n It was stated, in general terms, in Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, at page 388 of 264 U. S. (44 S. Ct. 394), that the statute 'extends to injured seamend a right to invoke, at their election, either the relief accorded by the old rules or that provided by the new rules. The election is between alternatives accorded by the maritime law as modified. ...' And see Engel v. Davenport, supra, at page 36 of 271 U. S. (46 S. Ct. 410). But this general statement does not define the scope of the election or the precise alternative accorded-a question which was not involved or discussed in either of these cases. And while an incidental statement in the Engel Case, at page 36 (46 S. Ct. 410), if taken broadly, might well be understood to mean that the right to recover compensatory damages under the new rule was granted as an alternative to the allowances covered by the old rules, including maintenance, cure and wages, this was at the most a general expression respecting a particular as to which no question was raised-no allowance for maintenance, cure and wages being there involved- which ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision, Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat, 264, 399 (5 L. Ed. 257); Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 244\n, 258 21 S. Ct. 770 (45 L. Ed. 1088); Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 31 S. Ct. 300( (55 L. Ed. 258); Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., \n239 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 36 S. Ct. 50 ( 60 L. Ed. 275); or to prevent the determination as an original question of the proper construction of the statute in that particular. See United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 239\n, 30 S. Ct. 81 (54 L. Ed. 173).\n What then were the 'alternatives' accorded to an injured seaman by the maritime law, as modified, between which the statute grants him an election? Plainly, we think, the right under the new rule to compensatory dam- \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 137]\n\u00a0\n ages for injuries caused by negligence is not an alternative of the right under the old rule to maintenance, cure and wages-which arises, quite independently of negligence, when the seaman falls sick or is injured in the service of the ship, and grows out of that which was termed in the Montezuma (C. C. A.) 19 F. (2d) 355, 356, the 'personal indenture' created by the relation of the seaman to his vessel. In Harden v. Gordon, 2 Mason, 541, 11 Fed. Cas. 480, 481-cited with apparent approval in the Osceola Case, at page 172 of 189 U. S. (23 S. Ct. 485)-Mr. Justice Story said that a claim for the expenses of curing a seaman incase of sickness 'constitutes, in contemplation of law, a part of the contract for wages, and is a material ingredient in the compensation for the labour and services of the seamen.' And in The A. Heaton (C. C.), 43 F. 592, 595, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, said that the right of a seaman to receive his wages to the end of the voyage and to be cured at the ship's expense, being 'grounded solely upon the benefit which the ship derives from his service, and having no regard to the question whether his injury has been caused by the fault of others or by mere accident, does not extend to compensation or allowance for the effects of the injury; but it is in the nature of an additional privilege, and not of a substitute for or a restriction of other rights and remedies,' and 'does not, therefore, displace or affect the right of the seaman to recover against the master or owners for injuries by their unlawful or negligent acts.' Thus, it has been held that claims for maintenance, cure and wages, and for indemnity for injuries occasioned by unseaworthiness, may be demanded and recovered in the same proceeding, Roebling's Sons Co. v. Erickson (C. C. A.) 261 F. 986, 988; that a recovery in one proceeding for wages and maintenance does not preclude the recovery in a subsequent proceeding of indemnity for injuries resulting from unseaworthiness, The Rolph (C. C. A.) 299 F. 52, 55; and that there is \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 138]\n\u00a0\n no inconsistency between the right to recover compensatory damages under the new rule for injuries caused by negligence and the right to recover maintenance, cure and wages under the old rules, the remedies not being of such a nature that the adoption of one is a repudiation or negation of the other, Lippman v. Romich (C. C. A.) 26 F. (2d) 601, 602. In short, the right to maintenance, cure and wages, implied in law as a contractual obligation arising out of the nature of the employment, is independent of the right to indemnity or compensatory damages for an injury caused by negligence; and these two rights are consistent and cumulative.\n The right to recover compensatory damages under the new rule for injuries caused by negligence is, however, an alternative of the right to recover indemnity under the old rules on the ground that the injuries were occasioned by unseaworthiness; and it is between these two inconsistent remedies for an injury, both grounded on tort, that we think an election is to be made under the maritime law as modified by the statute. Unseaworthiness, as is well understood, embraces certain species of negligence; while the statute includes several additional species not embraced in that term. But, whether or not the seaman's injuries were occasioned by the unseaworthiness of the vessel or by the negligence of the master or members of the crew, or both combined, there is but a single wrongful invasion of his primary right of bodily safety and but a single legal wrong, Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, supra, 321 of \n274 U.S. 47\n S. Ct. 600), for which he is entitled to but one indemnity by way of compensatory damages.\n Considered in the light of these several remedies and the extent of the inconsistency between them, we agree with the view expressed by the Supreme Court of Washington that the statute was not intended to restrict in any way the long-established right of a seaman to mainte- \n\n[278 U.S. 130, 139]\n\u00a0\n nance, cure and wages-to which it made no reference. And we conclude that the alternative measures of relief accorded him, between which he is given an election, are merely the right under the new rule to recover compensatory damages for injuries caused by negligence and the right under the old rules to recover indemnity for injuries occasioned by unseaworthiness; and that no election is required between the right to recover compensatory damages for a tortious injury under the new rule and the contractual right to maintenance, cure and wages under the old rules- the latter being a cumulative right in no sense inconsistent with, or an alternative of, the right to recover compensatory damages.\n It results that there was no error in the rulings as to the affirmative defense interposed by the defendant. And the judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 1164, c. 153. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 41 Stat. 988, c. 250; U. S.

STATE OF MISSISSIPPI EX REL. KNOX(1928)\nNo. 288\nArgued: March 5, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. George Butler, of Jackson, Miss., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 219]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. L. Byrd, of Jackson, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 218, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 116 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1922 provided that 'any person engaged in the business of distributor of gasoline, or retail dealer in gasoline, shall pay for the privilege of engaging in such business, an excise tax of 1 (one cent) per gallon upon the sale of gasoline, ...' except that sold in interstate commerce or purchased outside the state and brought in by the consumer for his own use. Chapter 115, Laws of 1924, increased the tax to three cents, and chapter 119, Laws of 1926, made it four cents per gallon. Since some time in 1925 petitioner has been engaged in that business. The State sued to recover taxes claimed on account of sales made by petitioner to the United States for the use of its Coast Guard fleet in service in the Gulf of Mexico and its Veterans' Hospital at Gulfport. Some of the sales were made while the act of 1924 was in force and some after the rate had been increased by the act of 1926. Accordingly the demand was for three cents a gallon on some and four cents on the rest. Petitioner defended on the ground that these statutes, if construed to impose taxes on such sales, are \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n repugnant to the federal Constitution. The court of first instance sustained that contention and the State appealed. The Supreme Court held the exaction a valid privilege tax measured by the number of gallons sold; that it was not a tax upon instrumentalities of the federal government, and that the United States was not entitled to buy such gasoline without payment of the taxes charged dealers. 147 Miss. 663, 112 So. 584.\n The United States is empowered by the Constitution to maintain and operate the fleet and hospital. Article 1,  8. That authorization and laws enacted pursuant thereto are supreme (article 6); and, in case of conflict, they control state enactments. The states may not burden or interfere with the exertion of national power or make it a source of revenue or take the funds raised or tax the means used for the performance of federal functions. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 425, et seq.; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, 448; Ohio v. Thomas, \n173 \nU.S. 276\n, 19 S. Ct. 453; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453; Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51\n, 41 S. Ct. 16; Clallam County v.

Ct. 371. The strictness of that rule was emphasized in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171. The right of the United States to make such purchases is derived from the Constitution. The petitioner's right to make sales to the United States was not given by the State and does not depend on state laws; it results from the authority of the national government under the Constitution to choose its own means and sources of supply. While Mississippi may impose charges upon petitioner for the privilege of carrying on trade that is subject to the power of the State, it may not lay any tax upon transactions by which the United States secures the things desired for its governmental purposes. \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 222]\n\u00a0\n The validity of the taxes claimed is to be determined by the practical effect of enforcement in respect of sales to the government. Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 40 S. Ct. 93. A charge at the prescribed rate is made on account of every gallon acquired by the United States. It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser is required to report and make payment to the State. Sale and purchase constitute a transaction by which the tax is measured and on which the burden rests. The amount of money claimed by the State rises and falls precisely as does the quantity of gasoline so secured by the government. It depends immediately upon the number of gallons. The necessary operation of these enactments when so construed is directly to retard, impede, and burden the exertion by the United States of its constitutional powers to operate the fleet and hospital. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 436; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, 505 (42 S. Ct. 171); Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609, 613\n, 46 S. Ct. 592. To use the number of gallons sold the United States as a measure of the privilege tax is in substance and legal effect to tax the sale. Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 U.S. 460\n; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 494\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316. And that is to tax the United States-to exact tribute on its transactions and apply the same to the support of the State.\n The exactions demanded from petitioner infringe its right to have the constitutional independence of the United States in respect of such purchases remain untrammeled. Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 867; Telegraph Co. v. Texas, supra. Cf. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 216\n, 44 S. Ct. 15. Petitioner is not liable for the taxes claimed.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n The State of Mississippi in 1924 and 1926 imposed upon distributors and retail dealers of gasoline, for the \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 223]\n\u00a0\n privilege of engaging in the business, an excise tax of three cents and four cents respectively per gallon sold in the State. The Supreme Court of the State declares it to be a privilege tax but points out that whether this tax is on the privilege or on the property it is imposed before the gasoline has left the dealer's hands. The plaintiff in error, a dealer, was sued by the State for certain sums that were due under the statutes. It pleaded that the sales in respect of which the tax was demanded were sales to the United States for the use of its Coast Guard and Veterans' Hospital, that these being instrumentalities of the government it did not include the amount of the tax in the price charged, and that the statute did not and could not tax the dealer for them consistently with the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of the State upheld the tax and pointed out the extreme consequences to which a different decision might lead.\n It seems to me that the State Court was right. I should say plainly right, but for the effect of certain dicta of Chief Justice Marshall which culminated in or rather were founded upon his often quoted proposition that the power to tax is the power to destroy. In those days it was not recognized as it is today that most of the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree. If the States had any power it was assumed that they had all power, and that the necessary alternative was to deny it altogether. But this Court which so often has defeated the attempt to tax in certain ways can defeat an attempt to discriminate or otherwise go too far without wholly abolishing the power to tax. The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits. The power to fix rates is the power to destroy if unlimited, but this Court while it endeavors to prevent confiscation does not prevent the fixing of rates. A tax is not an unconstitutional regulation in every case where an absolute prohibition of sales would be one. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 162\n, 27 S. Ct. 188. \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 224]\n\u00a0\n To come down more closely to the question before us, when the Government comes into a State to purchase I do not perceive why it should be entitled to stand differently from any other purchaser. It avails itself of the machinery furnished by the State and I do not see why it should not contribute in the same proportion that every other purchaser contributes for the privileges that it uses. It has no better or other right to use them than anyone else. The cost of maintaining the State that makes the business possible is just as necessary an element in the cost of production as labor or coal. If the plaintiff in error had paid the tax and had added it to the price the Government would have had nothing to say. It could take the gasoline or leave it but it could not require the seller to abate his charge even if it had been arbitrarily increased in the hope of getting more from the Government than could be got from the public at large. But in fact the Government has not attempted to say anything in this case, which is simply that of dealer trying to cut down a legitimate tax on his business because certain purchasers proposed to use the goods in a certain way, although so far as the sale was concerned they were free to turn the gasoline into the ocean, use if for private purposes or sell it again. It does not appear that the Government would have refused to pay a price that included the tax if demanded, but if the Government has refused it would not have exonerated the seller. Pierce Oil Corporation v. Hopkins, \n264 \nU.S. 137, 139\n, 44 S. Ct. 251.\n An imperfect analogy with taxation that affects interstate commerce is relied upon. Even the law on that subject has been liberalized since the decision of most of the cases cited. Sonneborn Brothers v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S. Ct. 643. But obviously it does not follow from the invalidity of a tax directly burdening interstate commerce that a tax upon a domestic seller is bad because he may be able to shift the burden to a purchaser, even \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 225]\n\u00a0\n though an agency of the Government, who is willing to pay the price with the tax and who has no rational ground for demanding favor. I am not aware that the President, the Members of Congress, the Judiciary or, to come nearer to the case in hand, the Coast Guard or the officials of the Veterans' Hospital, because they are instrumentalities of government and cannot function naked and unfed, hitherto having been held entitled to have their bills for food and clothing cut down so far as their butchers and tailors have been taxed on their sales; and I had not supposed that the butchers and tailors could omit from their tax returns all receipts from the large class of customers to which I have referred. The question of interference with Government, I repeat, is one of reasonableness and degree and it seems to me that the interference in this case is too remote. Metcalf v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S. Ct. 172.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE agree with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n I am unable to think that every man who sells a gallon ofgasoline to be used by the United States thereby becomes a federal instrumentality, with the privilege of claiming freedom from taxation by the state. sells a gallon of gasoline to be used by the but it ought not to be extended beyond the reasons which underlie it. Its limitations were well pointed out fifty years ago in Union Pac. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 30, 31 (21 L. Ed. 787): 'It cannot be that a state tax which remotely affects the efficient exercise of a federal power is for that reason alone inhibited by the Constitution. To hold that would be to deny to the States all power to tax persons or property. Every tax levied by a State withdraws from the reach of federal taxation a portion of the property \n\n[277 U.S. 218, 226]\n\u00a0\n from which it is taken, and to that extent diminishes the subject upon which federal taxes may be laid. The States are, and they must ever be, coexistent with the national government. Neither may destroy the other. Hence the federal Constitution must receive a practical construction. Its limitations and its implied prohibitions must not be extended so far as to destroy the necessary powers of the States, or prevent their efficient exercise.'\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in these views. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF SIOUX COUNTY, NEB. v. NATIONAL SURETY CO.(1928)\nNo. 196\nArgued: January 19, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n In view of the state court's construction of Comp. St. Neb. 1922,  6193, county may recover from surety of insolvent depository full amount of its deposit after bank's insolvency, not exceeding amount of bond, even though such deposit exceeded 50 per cent. of authorized capital of depository, contrary to the statute.\n In action against surety on bond of depository of county moneys, surety held liable for attorneys' fees, to be included in judgment, under Rev. St. U. S.  914 (28 USCA  724; Comp. St.  1537), under provision for allowance of such fees as costs in Comp. St. Neb. 1922,  7811, notwithstanding that costs in federal courts are regulated exclusively by Rev. St. U. S.  823, 824 (28 USCA  571, 572), since such allowance is not 'costs' in ordinary sense.\n For purpose of fixing reasonable sum for attorney's fees, for which surety on bond of depository of county funds is liable in action on bond under Comp. St. Neb. 1922,  7811, regard should be had for amount substantially involved. \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles S. Lobingier, of Washington, D. C., and Mr. Edwin D. Crites, of Chadron, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edwin G. Davis, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, a surety company, as surety, and the First National Bank of Harrison, Neb., a designated depository for county funds, as principal, gave their bond to Sioux county, Nebraska, the petitioner, in the sum of $30,000. The bond, required by statute, was conditioned on the payment by the bank, on the order of the county treasurer, of all sums of money deposited with it by the county. The bank became insolvent and closed its doors when the county deposits amounted to $35,395.70. The present suit was brought in the district court of Sioux county, Nebraska, to recover from the surety the amount of the bond and a reasonable attorney's fee, under Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922,  7811, and was removed to the United States District Court for diversity of citizenship.\n The authorized capital of the bank was $50,000, and the defense relied upon by the surety was a provision of Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922,  6193, which forbade the deposit of county funds by county treasurers in excess of 50 per cent. of the authorized capital of the depository. The district court gave judgment for the full amount of the bond and for an attorney's fee of $3,000. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the judgment, disallowing the attorney's fee and any recovery on the bond \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 240]\n\u00a0\n in excess of $25,000, which was one-half of the authorized capital of the bank. National Surety Co. v. Lyons (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 688. This court granted certiorari. \n274 \nU.S. 729\n, 47 S. Ct. 587\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals took the view that the Nebraska statute, printed in the margin,1 as construed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, operated to limit the liability on the statutory surety bond to one-half of the authorized capital of the depository. Cole v. Myers, 100 Neb. 480, 160 N. W. 894; Blaco v. State, 58 Neb. 557, 78 N. W. 1056; In re State Treasurer's Settlement, 51 Neb. 116, 70 N. W. 532, 36 L. R. A. 746; State ex rel. Davis v. People's State Bank of Anselmo, 111 Neb. 126, 196 N. W. 912, 198 N. W. 1018.\n The correctness of this interpretation of the Nebraska decisions is questioned here, but all doubts on that point have been set at rest by a later decision of the state court. In Scotts Bluff County v. First Nat. Bank, 212 N. W. 617, decided since the entry of judgment below, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that the statute does not have the effect asserted, and that within the amount of the bond a county may recover from the surety the full amount of the deposit, even though it exceed 50 per cent. of the authorized capital of the depository.\n We accept this construction of the statute and accordingly set aside the conflicting interpretation of the court below, even though it antedated the determination by the state court. Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458\n, 45 S. Ct. 543; Bauserman v. Blunt, \n147 \nU.S. 647\n, 13 S. Ct. 466. If, as the state court held, the statute is to be construed as not \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 241]\n\u00a0\n affecting the obligation of the surety, we think it plain that the liability on the bond, qua contract, is not affected by the county treasurer's breach of duty. The bond contains no limitation of the amount which the treasurer may deposit. The District Court was therefore right in allowing a recovery of the full amount of the bond.\n In striking down so much of the judgment as allowed an attorney's fee the court below was persuaded that section 7811, which provides for an attorney's fee, authorized it only as costs to be taxed in the state court. As costs in the federal courts are regulated exclusively by R. S.  823 and 824 (28 USCA  571, 572), the court concluded that other costs, authorized only by a state statute, could not be included in the judgment. See United States v. Sanborn, \n135 \nU.S. 271, 282\n, 10 S. Ct. 812; The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 388, et seq.. Compare Ex parte Peterson, \n253 U.S. 300\n, 314-319, 40 S. Ct. 543.\n Both in an earlier case, Globe Indemnity Co. v. Sulpho-Saline Bath Co . (C. C. A.) 299 F. 219, certiorari denied \n266 \nU.S. 606\n, 45 S. Ct. 92 (see, also, Spring Garden Insurance Co. v. Amusement Syndicate Co. (C. C. A.) 178 F. 519), and in a later case, Business Men's Assurance Co. v. Campbell, 18 F.(2d) 223, the same court applied the Nebraska statute allowing the recovery of attorney's fees in suits upon insurance policies. When it was argued that no other costs can be taxed in a court of the United States than those authorized by federal statute, the Circuit Court of Appeals said in the latter case (page 224) that the objection 'applies only to ordinary costs, and not to allowances for attorney's services provided by state statutes.'\n State statutes allowing the recovery of attorney's fees in special classes of actions have been upheld as constitutional by this court, Farmers' & Merchants' Insurance Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301\n, 23 S. Ct. 565; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. v. Harris, \n234 \nU.S. 412\n, 34 S. Ct. 790, L. R. A. 1915E, 942; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. v.

A.) 4 F.(2d) 835, certiorari denied \n268 \nU.S. 704\n, 45 S. Ct. 639.\n In these cases the local statutes were in effect treated as creating a statutory liability in which insurers, by accepting risks after their enactment, had acquiesced, and for the liability thus assumed a remedy was available in the federal as well as in the state courts. Fidelity Mutual Life Ass'n v. Mettler, supra, at page 326.\n The present statute, printed in the margin,2 provides that in the cases specified the court 'shall allow the plaintiff a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee, in addition to the amount of his recovery, to be taxed as a part of the costs.' The direction that the added liability be included in the judgment as costs does no more in substance than the provision upheld and applied in the Mettler Case, that the insurance company 'shall be liable to pay ... all reasonable attorney's fees' or the provision upheld and applied in Home Life Insurance Co. v. Fisher, supra, that the attorney's fees should be added to the judgment.\n Such doubt as there may be as to the meaning and effect of the statute arises from certain decisions of the Supreme \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n Court of Nebraska enforcing it in suits upon insurance contracts entered into before its enactment, in which the statute, attacked as impairing the obligation of the contract, was characterized as 'remedial' or as a 'costs' statute. Nye-Schneider-Fowler Co. v. Bridges, Hoye & Co., 98 Neb. 27, 151 N. W. 942; Id., 98 Neb. 863, 155 N. W. 235; Ward v. Bankers' Life Co., 99 Neb. 812, 157 N. W. 1017; Reed v. American Bonding Co., 102 Neb. 113, 166 N. W. 196, L. R. A. 1918C, 63. In Nye-Schneider-Fowler Co. v. Bridges, Hoye & Co., supra, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said (page 867 ( 155 N. W. 236)):\n'If the question that we are considering was now presented for the first time, we would hesitate to say that this statute does not create and add to the contract a legal liability which would not exist under the contract prior to the enactment of this statute. The fact that the attorney's fee is to be taxed as costs in the case is not of itself decisive of the question.'\n\n But the question before the Nebraska court in the cases cited was not that with which we are now concerned. Whether this liability for an attorney's fee, assumed by entering into an insurance contract after the enactment of the statute providing for the liability, may be enforced in the federal courts does not depend on any nice distinctions which may be taken between the right created and the remedy given. Disregarding mere matters of form it is clear that it is the policy of the state to allow plaintiffs to recover an attorney's fee in certain cases, and it has made that policy effective by making the allowance of the fee mandatory on its courts in those cases. It would be at least anomalous if this policy could be thwarted and the right so plainly given destroyed by removal of the cause to the federal courts.\n That the statute directs the allowance, which is made to plaintiff, to be added to the judgment as costs are added does not make it costs in the ordinary sense of the traditional, arbitrary and small fees of court officers, attorneys' \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n docket fees and the like, allowed to counsel by R. S.  823, 824. The present allowance, since it is not costs in the ordinary sense, is not within the field of costs legislation covered by R. S.  823, 824. That the particular mode of enforcing the right provided by the state statute-i. e., by taxing the allowance as costs-is not available to the federal courts under R. S.  823, 824, does not preclude the recovery. Since the right exists the federal courts may follow their own appropriate procedure for its enforcement by including the amount of the fee in the judgment. R. S.  914 (28 USCA  724; Comp. St.  1537). Compare Mexican Central Ry. v. Pinkney, \n149 \nU.S. 194\n, 13 S. Ct. 859; Indianapolis & St. Louis R. R. v. Horst, \n93 U.S. 291\n; Manitowoc Malting Co. v. Fuechtwanger (D. C.) 196 F. 506; Boatmen's Bank v. Trower Bros. Co. (C. C. A.) 181 F. 804.\n It is said that the fee customarily allowed in Nebraska is not less than 10 per cent. of the amount involved, O'Shea v. North American Hotel Co., 111 Neb. 582, 197 N. W. 385; Wirtele v. Grand Lodge, 111 Neb. 302, 196 N. W. 510; Central Nebraska Millwork Co. v. Olson & Johnson Co., 111 Neb. 396, 196 N. W. 707; and that as directed by the statute an additional fee should be allowed here for the appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals and to this court. The District Court, in allowing $3,000, apparently assumed that the full amount of the bond, $30,000, was involved. In a technical sense this was true, since the defendant, by its pleading put in issue the right to recover the whole amount. But in point of substance the only defense was directed to the $5,000 by which the amount of the bond exceeded one-half the bank's authorized capital. For the purpose of fixing a reasonable sum, regard should be had for the amount substantially involved. For that reason we think that the fee to be allowed in all courts should not exceed $2,000. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed and the cause \n\n[276 U.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n remanded, with directions to reinstate so much of the District Court's judgment as awarded to petitioner the amount of the bond with interest, aggregating $33,492.50; interest on that amount at the rate of 7 per cent. will be allowed from September 22, 1925, the date of the District Court's judgment; and the sum of $2,000 without interest will be allowed as an attorney's fee.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.

BRYANT v. ZIMMERMAN(1928)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n Zimmerman \n278 U.S. 63\n (1928) ]\n\n\n[278 U.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Connaughton and W. F. Zumbrunn, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Walter F. Hofheins and John H. Clogston, both of Buffalo, N. Y., and Albert Ottinger, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relator, Bryant, who was held in custody to answer a charge of violating a statute of New York, brought a proceeding in habeas corpus in a court of that state to obtain his discharge on the ground, as was stated in the petition, that the warrant under which he was arrested and detained was issued without any jurisdiction, in that the statute which he was charged with violating was unconstitutional.\n The court sustained the validity of the statute and refused to discharge him, People ex rel. Bryant v. Sheriff of Erie County, 123 Misc. Rep. 859, 206 N. Y. S. 533; and that judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division, 213 App. Div. 414, 210 N. Y. S. 269; and by the Court of Appeals, 241 N. Y. 405, 150 N. E. 497, 43 A. L. R. 909. He them sued out the present writ of error under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code ( 28 USCA  344)-his assignment of errors presented in obtaining the writ being to the effect that the Court of Appeals erroneously had held the statute valid against a contention made by him that it was invalid, because repugnant to so much of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as declares:\n'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 66]\n\u00a0\n The material parts of the state statute (article 5-A, Civil Rights Law; Laws 1923, p. 1110, c. 664), are as follows:\n\n'Sec. 53. Every existing membership corporation, and every existing unincorporated association having a membership of twenty or more persons, which corporation or association requires an oath as a prerequisite or condition of membership, other than a labor union or a benevolent order mentioned in the benevolent orders law, within thirty days after this article takes effect, and every such corporation or association hereafter organized, within ten days after the adoption thereof, shall file with the secretary of state a sworn copy of its constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations and oath of membership, together with a roster of its membership and a list of its officers for the current year. ...'\n\n'Sec. 56. ... Any person who becomes a member of any such corporation or association, or remains a member thereof, or attends a meeting thereof, with knowledge that such corporation or association has failed to comply with any provision of this article, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.'\n\n Both parties treat the case as rightly here and as presenting the question whether the state statute is repugnant to the provisions before quoted from the Fourteenth Amendment. But as consent or acquiescence of the parties does not suffice to establish our appellate jurisdiction, and some of our number have doubted the existence of such jurisdiction in this case, we now take up the question.\n Section 237a of the Judicial Code (section 344, title 28, U. S. Code) provides that this court may review upon writ of error1 'a final judgment or decree in any suit' in the \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n court of last resort of a state 'where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.' It is under this provision that a review is invoked.\n There are various ways in which the validity of a state statute may be drawn in question on the ground that it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. No particular form of words or phrases is essential, but only that the claim of invalidity and the ground therefor be brought to the attention of the state court with fair precision and in due time. And if the record as a whole shows either expressly or by clear intendment that this was done, the claim is to be regarded as having been adequately presented. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Of course the decision must have been against the claim of invalidity, but it is not necessary that the ruling shall have been put in direct terms. If the necessary effect of the judgment has been to deny the claim, that is enough. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n With these general rules in mind we turn to what is shown in this case. The petition for habeas corpus, while asserting that the state statute was 'unconstitutional,' contained no mention of any constitutional provision, state or federal. The opinion delivered by the court of \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n first instance was similarly indefinite. Up to that point it is left uncertain whether the claim of invalidity was grounded on some provision of the state Constitution, or on some provision of the Constitution of the United States, or on both. If this were all, there plainly would be no basis for a review in this court. But more appears. The relator took an appeal to the Appellate Division. The appeal was not accompanied by an assignment of errors, but this was not an omission. The local practice does not recognize an assignment of errors as known in other jurisdictions; it merely requires the appellant to set forth in a printed brief 'the points to be relied on by him.' In the opinion delivered, which for present purposes is deemed part of the record,4 the Appellate Division stated distinctly that the relator's claim of invalidity was grounded on asserted repugnance to both the due process of law clause of the state Constitution and the clauses hereinbefore quoted from the Fourteenth Amendment. After so stating the claim the court considered it at length and denied it. From that decision the relator appealed to the Court of Appeals. Again the appeal was not accompanied by an assignment of errors, and for the same reason as before. See rule 7, Court of Appeals Rules. The appeal was entertained and the decision of the Appellate Division was affirmed. The Court of Appeals in its opinion does not mention the Constitution of the state or the Fourteenth Amendment, but does state that the relator was asserting the 'unconstitutionality' of the statute on the ground that it deprived him of his liberty without due process of law and denied him the equal protection of the laws, etc. Nothing in the opinion is at all indicative of an aban- \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n donment by the relator of his reliance on the Fourteenth Amendment which was so distinctly stated in the opinion of the Appellate Division. On the contrary, the court's discussion of the case and its citation of authorities proceed as if it were considering the identical claim of invalidity that was presented in the Appellate Division and there denied. Among the citations are several decisions of this court dealing only with the clauses before quoted from the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed, the opinion shows that in upholding the statute against the contention that it denies the equal protection of the laws the Court of Appeals practically rested its decision 'on the authority' of Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 296\n, 297 S., 44 S. Ct. 325. where another statute of New York assailed as in conflict with the equal protection clause of that amendment was sustained.\n From this showing in the record, coupled with the absence from the state Constitution of an equal protection of the laws clause, we think it apparent that the claim of invalidity by reason of the statute's repugnance to the Fourteenth Amendment was presented to the Court of Appeals and that by its decision the statute was upheld against that claim.\n Upon looking at that decision as published in the official reports ( 241 N. Y. 405, 150 N. E. 497, 43 A. L. R. 909), we find it stated by the reporter in his accompanying synopsis of the briefs that the brief on behalf of the relator embodied the specific claim that the statute was invalid because in conflict with the equal protection and other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, as we otherwise reach the conclusion that the claim was adequately made, there is no need to notice what is said in the reporter's synopsis beyond observing that it probably points to the reason why both parties, and the Chief Judge who allowed the writ of error, treated the case as one in which the question of the validity of the statute under the Constitution of the United States had been properly presented. \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n Our jurisdiction to review the decision is questioned also because of the nature of the case, it being a proceeding in habeas corpus brought to obtain the discharge of one who is held in custody to answer a charge of violating a state statute alleged to be invalid by reason of its conflict with the Constitution of the United States. But we think our jurisdiction is in this regard so well established by prior decisions and long- continued practice that it is not debatable.\n In the early case of Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 563, 568, 597, 614, this court held after must consideration that a proceeding in habeas corpus in a state court to obtain the release of one held in custody upon a criminal charge, where the detention is alleged to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States, is a 'suit' within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute, and that an order of the state court of last resort refusing to discharge him is a final judgment in that suit and subject to review by this court. That holding has been respected and given effect in an unbroken line of later decisions, all of which in their material facts and surroundings were like the case now before us. \n5\n It also has been followed in other cases related in principle. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n The proceeding before us was not brought in antagonism to the established practice in the state, but in entire \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n keeping with that practice as confirmed by local statutes. Civil Practice Act, art. 77,  1230-1235, 1251. This was recognized in the decisions given by the courts of the state. And the proceeding was independent, adversary and both adapted and directed to the enforcement of a most important personal right. It is quite unlike the fragmentary or branch proceeding considered in Grays Harbor Logging Co. v. Coats-Fordney Logging Co., \n243 \nU.S. 251, 256\n, 37 S. Ct. 295; the judgment in which was held to be interlocutory only, and not final in the sense of the jurisdictional statute.\n We are accordingly of opinion that the case and the judgment therein are of such a nature that we have jurisdiction to review the latter.\n The offense charged against the relator is that he attended meetings and remained a member of the Buffalo Provisional Klan of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, an unincorporated association-but neither a labor union nor a benevolent order mentioned in the benevolent orders law-having a membership of more than 20 persons and requiring an oath as a prerequisite or condition of membership, he then having knowledge that such association had wholly failed to comply with the requirement in section 53.\n There are various privileges and immunities which under our dual system of government belong to citizens of the United States solely by reason of such citizenship. It is against their abridgement by state laws that the privilege and immunity clause in the Fourteenth Amendment is directed. But no such privilege or immunity is in question here. If to be and remain a member of a secret, oath-bound association within a state be a privilege arising out of citizenship at all, it is an incident of state rather than United States citizenship; and such protection as is thrown about it by the Constitution is in no \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n wise affected by its possessor being a citizen of the United States. Thus there is no basis here for invoking the privilege and immunity clause. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n The relator's contention under the due process clause is that the statute deprives him of liberty in that it prevents him from exercising his right of membership in the association. But his liberty in this regard, like most other personal rights, must yield to the rightful exertion of the police power. There can be no doubt that under that power the state may prescribe and apply to associations having an oath-bound membership any reasonable regulation calculated to confine their purposes and activities within limits which are consistent with the rights of others and the public welfare. The requirement in section 53 that each association shall file with the secretary of state a sworn copy of its constitution, oath of membership, etc., with a list of members and officers is such a regulation. It proceeds on the two-fold theory that the state within whose territory and under whose protection the association exists is entitled to be informed of its nature and purpose, of whom it is composed and by whom its activities are conducted, and that requiring this information to be supplied for the public files will operate as an effective or substantial deterrent from the violations of public and private right to which the association might be tempted if such a disclosure were not required. The requirement is not arbitrary or oppressive, but reasonable and likely to be of real effect. Of course, power to require the disclosure includes authority to prevent individual members of an association which has failed to comply from attending meetings or retaining membership with knowl- \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n edge of its default. We conclude that the due process clause is not violated.\n The main contention made under the equal protection clause is that the statute discriminates against the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and other associations in that it excepts from its requirements several associations having oath-bound membership, such as labor unions, the Masonic fraternity, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Knights of Columbus-all named in another statute, which provides for their incorporation and requires the names of their officers as elected from time to time to be reported to the secretary of state.\n The principle to be applied in determining whether a particular discrimination or classification offends against the equal protection clause is shown in the following excerpts from some of our decisions:\n Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 281, 282 (58 L. Ed. 539)-'The discrimination undoubtedly presents a more difficult question. But we start with the general consideration that a state may classify with reference to the evil to be prevented, and that if the class discriminated against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly to be feared, it properly may be picked out. A lack of abstract symmetry does not matter. The question is a practical one, dependent upon experience. The demand for symmetry ignores the specific difference that experience is supposed to have shown to mark the class. It is not enough to invalidate the law that others may do the same thing and go unpunished, if, as a matter of fact, it is found that the danger is characteristic of the class named. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 80\n, 81 S. (31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160). The state 'may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the whole filed of possible abuses.' Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 U.S. 157\n, 160 (33 S. Ct. 66, 67 (57 L. Ed. 164)).'\n\n\n[278 U.S. 63, 74]\n\u00a0\n Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 383\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, 344 (59 L. Ed. 628, L. R. A. 1915F, 829)-'The contention as to the various omissions which are noted in the objections here urged ignores the well- established principle that the Legislature is not bound, in order to support the constitutional validity of its regulation, to extend it to all cases which it might possibly reach. Dealing with practical exigencies, the Legislature may be guided by experience. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 138\n, 144 (34 S. Ct. 281). It is free to recognize degrees of harm, and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest.'\n Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 296\n, 44 S. Ct. 325, 327 (68 L. Ed. 690)-' Such classification must not be 'purely arbitrary, oppressive or capricious.' American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 U.S. 89\n, 92 (21 S. Ct. 43). But the mere production of inequality is not enough. Every selection of persons for regulation so results, in some degree. The inequality produced, in order to encounter the challenge of the Constitution, must be 'actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary.' Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n261 U.S. 379\n, 384 (43 S. Ct. 387, 389 67 L. Ed. 705), and cases cited. Thus classifications have been sustained which are based upon differences between fire insurance and other kinds of insurance. Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 562 (19 S.

Pennsylvania (decided May 28, 1928) \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553-'The equal protection clause does not detract from \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 75]\n\u00a0\n the right of the state justly to exert its taxing power or prevent it from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in that connection, 'but it does require that the classification be not arbitrary, bus based on a real and substantial difference having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation.' Power Co. v. Saunders, \n274 U.S. 490\n, 493 ( 47 S. Ct. 678).'\n The courts below recognized the principle shown in the cases just cited and reached the conclusion that the classification was justified by a difference between the two classes of associations shown by experience, and that the difference consisted (a) in a manifest tendency on the part of one class to make the secrecy surrounding its purposes and membership a cloak for acts and conduct inimical to personal rights and public welfare, and (b) in the absence of such a tendency on the part of the other class. In pointing out this difference one of the courts (123 Misc. Rep. 859, 206 N. Y. S. 533) said of the Ku Klux Klan, the principal association in the included class:\n'It is a matter of common knowledge that this organization functions largely at night, its members disguised by hoods and gowns and doing things calculated to strike terror into the minds of the people,'\n\n -and later said of the other class:\n'These organizations and their purposes are well known, many of them having been in existence for many years. Many of them are oath-bound and secret. But we hear of no complaints against them regarding violation of the peace or interfering with the rights of others.'\n\n Another of the courts (213 App. Div. 414, 210 N. Y. S. 269) said:\n'It is a matter of common knowledge that the association or organization of which relator is concedely a member exercise activities tending to the prejudice and intimidation of sundry classes of our citizens. But the legislation is not confined to this society,'\n\n -and later said of the other class:\n'Labor unions have a recognized lawful purpose. The benevolent orders mentioned in the Benevolent Orders Law have already received legislative scrutiny and been \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 76]\n\u00a0\n granted special privileges so that the legislature may well consider them beneficent rather than harmful agencies.'\n\n The third court (241 N. Y. 405, 150 N. E. 497, 43 A. L. R. 909), after recognizing 'the potentialities of evil in secret societies' and observing that 'the danger of certain organizations has been judicially demonstrated'-meaning in that state-said:\n'Benevolent orders, labor, unions and college fraternities have existed for many years, and, while not immune from hostile criticism, have on the whole justified their existence.'\n\n We assume that the Legislature had before it such information as was readily available, including the published report of a hearing before a committee of the House of Representatives of the Fifty-Seventh Congress relating to the formation, purposes, and activities of the Ku Klux Klan. \n8\n If so it was advised-putting aside controverted evidence-that the order was a revival of the Ku Klux Klan of an earlier time, with additional features borrowed from the Know Nothing and the A. P. A. orders of other periods; that its membership was limited to native-born, gentile, protestant whites; that in part of its constitution and printed creed it proclaimed the widest freedom for all and full adherence to the Constitution of the United States, in another exacted of its members an oath to shield and preserve 'white supremacy,' and in still another declared any person actively opposing its principles to be 'a dangerous ingredient in the body politic of our country and an enemy to the weal of our national commonwealth'; that it was conducting a crusade against Catholics, Jews, and negroes, and stimulating hurtful religious and race prejudices; that it was striving for political power, and assuming a sort of guardianship over the administration of local, state, and national af- \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 77]\n\u00a0\n fairs; and that at times it was taking into its own hands the punishment of what some of its members conceived to be crimes.\n We think it plain that the action of the courts below in holding that there was a real and substantial basis for the distinction made between the two sets of associations or orders was right and should not be disturbed.\n Criticism is made of the classification on the further ground that the regulation is confined to associations having a membership of 20 or more persons. Classification based on numbers is not necessarily unreasonable. There are many instances in which it has been sustained. We think it not unreasonable in this instance. With good reason the Legislature may have thought that an association of less than 20 persons would have only a negligible influence, and be without the capacity for harm that would make regulation needful.\n We conclude that all the objections urged against the statute are untenable as held by the courts below.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n For two reasons, I think we have no jurisdiction of this writ of error and that it should be dismissed.\n The cause was finally determined by the Court of Appeals of New York January 12, 1926. The record fails to disclose that any federal question was presented to or considered by that court. Moreover, the real controversy between the parties involves no substantial federal question.\n The petition for habeas corpus-presented to the Supreme Court- affirmed that plaintiff in error was confined in the Buffalo jail under pretense that he had 'violated chapter 664 of the Laws of 1923, which law is commonly known as the Walker Law, and which law is sec- \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 78]\n\u00a0\n tions 53, 54, 55, and 56 of article 5-A of the Civil Rights Law.' These sections are printed below. \n9\n It then alleged:\n'That said imprisonment and restraint is illegal in this, to wit: That the Magistrate was without jurisdiction to issue the warrant, or cause his arrest, inasmuch as chapter 664 of the Laws of 1923, is unconstitutional and void and of no force or effect.'\n\n And upon that ground alone it sought the petitioner's release. The petition did not refer to the Federal Constitution or any statute of the United States.\n The warrant for plaintiff in error's arrest was based upon an information which, in the language of the Court of Appeals, charged:\n'That he attended a meeting of and remained a member of Buffalo Provisional Klan of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan with knowledge that said \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 79]\n\u00a0\n association, which has more than 20 members, requires an oath as a prerequisite or condition of membership, and is not a labor union or a benevolent order mentioned in the Benevolent Orders Law (Consol. Laws, c. 3), had not complied with the provisions of the statute by filing with the secretary of state a sworn copy of its constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations and oath of membership, together with a roster of its membership and a list of its officers for the current year.'\n\n The writ of habeas corpus followed the usual form: The record contains no return thereto.\n Upon an affidavit that the constitutionality of chapter 664, Act of 1923, had been challenged, the Supreme Court permitted the Attorney General to intervene. \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 80]\n\u00a0\n The cause was heard by the Supreme Court upon the petition, information, warrant, writ of habeas corpus, and argument of counsel. No other evidence was introduced. There is nothing to show that the association to which plaintiff in error belonged had any connection whatever with the Ku Klux Klan of the last century; nothing to show its purposes, or the nature of the oath taken by members.\n The Supreme Court discharged the writ, but neither its judgment nor the accompanying opinion mentions the Federal Constitution or any statute of the United States. Without supporting evidence, that court said:\n'It may be assumed that the Legislature informed itself of conditions bearing upon the proposed legislation. These conditions probably are not such as would enable the court to take judicial notice of them, but the Legislature could well have learned of the acts of the Klan. It is a matter of common knowledge that this organization functions largely at night, its members disguised by hoods and gowns and doing things calculated to strike terror into the minds of the people. It is claimed that they are organized against certain of the citizens by reason of race or religion.'\n\n Thereupon the cause was appealed to the Appellate Division, without any assignment of errors, and that court affirmed the order discharging the writ. The opinion there contains the following language:\n'The facts are not in dispute. Relator sued out a writ of habeas corpus upon the theory that the statute in question is unconstitutional and that is the only question to be determined. ...\n\n'Relator complains that the exemption in said statute of labor unions and the benevolent orders mentioned in the Benevolent Orders Law is an unlawful classification in violation of section 6 of article 1 of the Constitution of \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 81]\n\u00a0\n the state of New York, which provides among other things that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process or law, and of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, which provides that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, and that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, and that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. ...\n\n'It is a matter of common knowledge that the association or organization of which relator is concededly a member exercises activities tending to the prejudice and intimidation of sundry classes of our citizens. ...'\n\n The foregoing is the only direct reference to Federal Constitutional or laws disclosed by the record.\n Finally, the cause went by appeal and without assignment of error of the Court of Appeals of New York. That court affirmed the order of the Appellate Division and delivered a supporting opinion, which does not mention the Federal Constitution, or any statute of the United States. Certainly it cannot be said that the record affirmatively discloses that any federal question was raised or considered in the Court of Appeals.\n In Crowell v. Randell (1836) 10 Pet. 368, 392, upon motion to dismiss the writ of error to the Supreme Court of Delaware for want of jurisdiction, Mr. Justice Story, in behalf of the court, said:\n'In the interpretation of this section (25) of the act of 1789 (1 Stat. 85), it has been uniformly held, that to give this court appellate jurisdiction, two things should have occurred and be apparent in the record: First, that some one of the questions stated in the section did arise in the court below; and, secondly, that a decision was actually made thereon, by the same court, in the manner required by \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 82]\n\u00a0\n the section. If both of these do not appear on the record, the appellate jurisdiction fails. It is not sufficient to show, that such a question might have occurred, or such a decision might have been made, in the court below. It must be demonstrable, that they did exist, and were made. The principal, perhaps the only important, difficulty which has even been felt by the court, has been in ascertaining in particular cases, whether these matters (the question and decision) were apparent on the record. And here the doctrine of the court has been, that it is not indispensable, that it should appear on the record, in totidem verbis, or by direct and positive statement, that the question was made and the decision given by the court below on the very point; but that it is sufficient, if it be clear, from the facts stated, by just and necessary inference, that the question was made, and that the court below must, in order to have arrived at the judgment pronounced by it, have come to the very decision of that question as indispensable to that judgment.'\n\n The language of the Act of February 13, 1925 (28 USCA  344), and of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 85,  25), presently important, is substantially the same.\n In Michigan Sugar Co. v. Michigan, \n185 \nU.S. 112, 113\n, 22 S. Ct. 581 ( 46 L. Ed. 829), by Chief Justice Fuller, this court said:\n'The Supreme Court of the state did not refer to the Federal Constitution or consider and decide any federal question. For aught that appears, the court proceeded in its determination of the cause without any thought that it was disposing of such a question.\n\n'The rule is firmly established, and has been frequently reiterated, that the jurisdiction of this court to re-examine the final judgment of a state court, under the third division of section 709 (Rev. St.), cannot arise from mere inference, but only from averments so distinct and positive as to place \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 83]\n\u00a0\n it beyond question that the party bringing the case here from such court intended to assert a federal right. The statutory requirement is not met unless the party unmistakably declares that he invokes for the protection of his rights, the Constitution, or some treaty, statute, commission or authority, of the United States. Applying this rule to the case before us, the writ of error cannot be maintained.'\n\n In Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 360\n, 47 S. Ct. 641, 643 (71 L. Ed. 1095), we held-\n'It has long been settled that this court acquires no jurisdiction to review the judgment of a state court of last resort on a writ of error, unless it affirmatively appears on the face of the record that a federal question constituting an appropriate ground for such review was presented in and expressly or necessarily decided by such state court.'\n\n Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 392; Mississippi & M. Railroad Co. v. Rock, 4 Wall. 177, 180; California Powder Works v. Davis, \n151 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 14 S. Ct. 350; Cincinnati, etc., railway v. Slade, \n216 \nU.S. 78, 83\n, 30 S. Ct. 230; Hiawassee Power Co. v. Carolina-Tenn. Co., \n252 \nU.S. 341, 343\n, 40 S. Ct. 330; New York v. Kleinert, \n268 \nU.S. 646, 650\n, 45 S. Ct. 618-Were cited. See, also, Mellon v. O'Neil, \n274 \nU.S. 212, 214\n, 48 S. Ct. 62; Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 199\n, 19 S. Ct. 379; Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n175 \nU.S. 626, 634\n, 20 S. Ct. 205.\n It is not enough that the opinion of the Appellate Division referred to the Constitution of the United States. To give us jurisdiction the record must show affirmatively that the federal question was before the Court of Appeals. Mere inference will not do. This rule has been rigidly enforced for a hundred years.\n The function of a writ of habeas corpus is to test the validity of challenged imprisonment-not the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. And over and over again this court has asserted that it will not permit habeas corpus to perform the office of a writ of error. \n\n[278 U.S. 63, 84]\n\u00a0\n It must now be accepted as settled doctrine in this court that one is not deprived of any federal right merely by being put on trial for violating a state statute which conflicts with the Federal Constitution. Nor is one deprived of his federal right solely because he may be imprisoned after conviction of violating a state statute admittedly in conflict with the Federal Constitution.\n It follows that when the petition for habeas corpus alleged that plaintiff in error was imprisoned under a charge of violating a state statute said to be unconstitutional and void, no real federal question was raised. The legality of his imprisonment did not depend at all upon the validity of the act which it was said he had violated. His right was to an orderly hearing upon the charge, with the privilege of ultimate review here. And as the habeas corpus proceeding never involved any substantial question arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, we have no jurisdiction to review it.\n Undoubtedly, cases like this have been entertained here in the past. But, since it has become settled law that mere imprisonment and trial under a charge based upon an unconstitutional state statute does not deprive one of his liberty without due process of law, we should deny further jurisdiction. There is no longer any controverted federal question essential to decision of the cause.\n This view is aided by consideration of the serious and manifest evil which will follow a different course. Certainly, we should not undertake to determine the validity of a state statute in advance of trial upon the merits simply because some prisoner sees fit to sue out a writ of habeas corpus upon the alleged ground of conflict between the statute and Federal Constitution. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The acts of January 32, 1928, c. 14, 45 Stat. 54, and April 26, 1928, c. 440, 45 Stat. 466 (28 USCA  861a, 861b), substituted an appeal for a writ of error.

BANK OF NEW YORK(1928)\nNo. 16\nArgued: October 29, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Martin Saxe, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. H. King, of New York City, for Keating as Receiver of Taxes.\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Falconer, N. Y., for Ottinger, Atty. Gen.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a national banking association organized under the National Bank Act (12 USCA  21 et seq.) with its principal office in the city of New York, brought suit in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against Andrew B. Keating, receiver, and William Reid, Jr., collector of taxes of the city of New York, to enjoin them from collecting taxes assessed against shares in the association in pursuance of a state law, but by, and for the the sole use of, the city. The prayer for relief rested upon the contention that the provisions of the state law, which fixed the rate of tax, discriminated in favor of other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the state, in contravention of section 5219, U. S. Rev. Stats. (12 USCA  548), and of provisions of the Constitution of the United States. A statutory court of three judges was constituted under section 266 of the Judicial Code (U. S. Code, title 28,  380; 28 USCA  380), and a master appointed, by whom evidence was taken and \n\n[278 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n reported. When the case came on for final hearing, the court, of its own motion, dissolved after directing that the cause proceed before a single district judge upon the ground that the suit was not one coming within the terms of section 266. Petitioner applied to this court for a writ of mandamus requiring the judges composing the statutory court to reconvene and proceed to a determination of the case. Upon filing the petition, a rule to show cause was issued (\n278 \nU.S. 555\n, 49 S. Ct. 7, 73 L. Ed. -), upon a return to which the application has been heard.\n The statutory court held that section 266 did not apply because neither of the defendants was an officer of the state and the suit involved only the action of city officials in the collection of taxes for the use of the city. 29 F.(2d) 621. In support of this ruling, Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565\n, 48 S. Ct. 585 (June 4, 1928), was relied upon. In that case suit was brought to enjoin proceedings under a resolution of the city of Phoenix, Arizona, directing the paving of a street upon which petitioner was an abutting owner. The improvement was to be made pursuant to general statutes of the state, which were assailed as contravening the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Judge denied a request to call two judges to sit with him, upon the ground that the case did not come within section 266. This court sustained the action of the District Judge, and held that the section did not apply, although the constitutionality of a statute was challenged, because the defendants were local officers and the suit concerned matters of interest only to the particular municipality involved. We need add little to what we there said.\n Section 266 provides that no injunction 'restraining the enforcement ... of any statute of a state by restraining the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement ... of such statute, ... shall be issued or granted ... upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute,' except upon a hearing and determina- \n\n[278 U.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n tion of a court composed of three judges. The suit here involved the constitutionality of a state statute, but it was not brought to restrain 'the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement' thereof. The persons sued are municipal officers, having no state functions to perform, but charged only with the duty of collecting and receiving taxes assessed by other city officials in no respect for the use of the state but for and in behalf of the city alone. In effect, the contention for petitioner practically comes to this-that the general purpose of section 266 being to safeguard state legislation assailed as unconstitutional from the improvident action of federal counts, the words, 'by restraining the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement ... of such statute' are without significance. In other words, we are asked to ignore the quoted words and read the section as though they were not there.\n But we are not at liberty thus to deny effect to a part of a statute. No rule of statutory construction has been more definitely stated or more often repeated than the cardinal rule that 'significance and effect shall, if possible, be accorded to every word. As early as in bacon's Abridgment ,  2, it was said that 'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\" Washington Market Co. v. Hoffman, \n101 U.S. 112\n, 115 (25 L. Ed. 782). We are unable to perceive any ground for departing from the rule in the case before us. It follows that, giving effect to the phrase in question, section 266 requires the concurrence of two things in order to give the three-judge court jurisdiction: (1) The suit must seek to have a state statute declared unconstitutional, or that in effect; and (2) it must seek to restrain the action of an officer of the state in the enforcement of such statute. See Henrietta Mills Co. v. Rutherford County (D. C.) 26 F.(2d) 799, 800; Connor v. Board of Com'rs of Logan County, \n\n[278 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n Ohio (D. C.) 12 F.(2d) 789, 790; Connecting Gas Co. v. Imes (D. C.) 11 F.( 2d) 191, 194, 195. The second requisite here is lacking.\n Our attention is directed to several cases disposed of under section 266, where this court passed on the merits although the suits were against local officers. We do not stop to inquire whether, at least in some of these cases, the so-called local officers in fact represented the state or exercised state functions in the matters involved and properly might be held to come within the provision of section 266 now under review. Compare, for example, People ex rel. Plancon v. Prendergast, 219 N. Y. 252, 258, 114 N. E. 433; State ex rel. Lopas v. Shagren, 91 Wash. 48, 52, 157 P. 31; Griffin v.

It is enough to say, as was said in the Collins Case, that the propriety of the hearing before three judges was not considered in the cases to which we are referred, and they cannot be regarded as having decided the question.

Ellis and S. B. Axtell, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 151, 153]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Cletus Keating, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plamals, the petitioner, a subject of Spain, belonged to the crew of the British ship Pinar Del Rio. She was \n\n[277 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n anchored at Philadelphia April 27, 1923. He was being hoisted up to paint the smokestack; a rope broke; he fell to the deck and sustained serious injuries. The accident resulted from the negligence of the mate, who selected a defective rope. An abundant supply of good rope was on board.\n Six months after the accident, Plamals began this proceeding in rem against the ship in the District Court, Southern District of New York. The libel alleged that his injuries 'were due to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her, in that the said rope was old, worn, and not suitable for use, in that libelant was ordered to perform services not within the scope of his duties, and in other respects that libelant will point out on the trial of this action.'\n There is nothing to show that painting the smokestack was beyond the scope of the duties assumed.\n In the District Court the petitioner asserted by his proctor that he claimed under section 33, Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 (46 USCA  688; Comp. St.  8337a) which follows; that section 20 of such Act of March 4, 1925, be, and is, amended to read as follows:\n'Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common- law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the \n\n[277 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.'\n\n The District Court ruled that the rights and liabilities of the parties were fixed by the law of the ship's flag, and was of opinion that the British Workmen's Compensation Act afforded the only remedy. It accordingly dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that a lien against the vessel is essential to every proceeding in rem against her, and that no such lien arose by reason of section 33 of the Jones Act in favor of the injured seaman. Upon that ground it affirmed the questioned decree. 16 F.(d) 984.\n We agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and find it unnecessary now to consider whether the provisions of section 33 are applicable where a foreign seaman employed on a foreign ship suffers injuries while in American waters.\n The record does not support the suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio was unseaworthy. The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.\n We must treat the proceeding as one to enforce the liability prescribed by section 33. It was so treated by petitioner's proctor at the original trial; and the application for certiorari here spoke of it as based upon that section. The evidence would not support a recovery upon any other ground.\n Section 20, Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1185), originally provided-\n'That in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be follow-servants with those under their authority.'\n\n Chelentis v. Luckenbach Steamship Co. (1918) \n247 \nU.S. 372, 384\n, 38 S. Ct. 501, pointed out that this imposed no new liability upon the shipowner.\n Section 33 brings into our maritime law the provisions of certain statutes which define the liability of masters to employees originally intended to be enforced in actions at \n\n[277 U.S. 151, 156]\n\u00a0\n law. They imposed personal liability, and gave no lien of any kind. The statute which extended them to seamen expressly provided that the employer might be sued only in the district where he resides or has his principal office. This provision repels the suggestion that the intention was to subject the ship to in rem proceedings. Generally, at least proceedings of that nature may be brought wherever the ship happens to be.\n The ordinary maritime privilege or lien, though adhering to the vessel, is a secret one, which may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice, and is therefore stricti juris. It cannot be extended by construction, analogy, or inference. The Corsair, \n145 \nU.S. 335, 347\n, 12 S. Ct. 949; The Albert Dumois, \n177 \nU.S. 240, 257\n, 20 S. Ct. 595; Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Lumber Co., \n260 \nU.S. 490, 499\n, 43 S. Ct. 172.\n Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 386\n, 391 S., 44 S. Ct. 391, 393, 395 (68 L. Ed. 748), declares:\n'Section 33 'is concerned with the relative rights and obligations of seamen and their employers arising out of personal injuries sustained by the former in the course of their employment.' 'The injured seaman is permitted, but not required, to proceed on the common-law side of the court.' 'The statute leaves the injured seamen free under the general law-sections 24 (par. 3) and 256 (par. 3) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41(3), 371(3))-to assert his right of action under the new rules on the admiralty side of the court.'\n\n In the system from which these new rules come no lien exists to secure claims arising under them and, of course, no right to proceed in rem. We cannot conclude that the mere incorporation into the maritime law of the rights which they create to pursue the employer was enough to give rise to a lien against the vessel upon which the injury occurred. The section under consideration does not undertake to impose liability on the ship itself, but by positive words indicates a contrary purpose. Seamen may invoke, at their election, the relief accorded by the old \n\n[277 U.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n rules against the ship, or that provided by the new against the employer. But they may not have the benefit of both.\n To subject vessels during all the time allowed by the statute of limitations to secret liens to secure undisclosed and unlimited claims for personal injuries by every seaman who may have suffered injury thereon would be a very serious burden. One desiring to purchase, for example, could only guess vaguely concerning the value. 'An act to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine' ought not to be so construed in the absence of compelling language.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUAKER CITY CAB CO. v. COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA(1928)\nNo. 139\nArgued: April 20, 1927Decided: May 28, 1928\n\n\n\n As Amended June 9, 1928. \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 390]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Owen J. Roberts, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Douglas D. Story, of Jersey City, N. J., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Robert Jones and George W. Woodruff, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Judgment was entered in the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, Pa., in favor of the commonwealth for 'gross receipts taxes for the six months ending the 31st day of December, 1923,' amounting, with interest and commission, to $6,049.94. The tax is claimed under section 23 of an Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, 431. \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 399]\n\u00a0\n The provisions here material are printed in the margin. \n1\n The gross receipts taxed were derived by plaintiff in error from the use of its motor vehicles for the transportation within Pennsylvania of persons and their luggage. Plaintiff in error contended that, if applied to such receipts, the section violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The highest court of the state upheld the act, and affirmed the judgment. 287 Pa. 161, 134 A. 404.\n Plaintiff in error is a New Jersey corporation authorizedto do business in Pennsylvania as a foreign corporation; and, since June 1, 1917, it has carried on a general taxicab business in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court held that the section taxes gross receipts from the operation of taxicabs. It provides that every transportation company, whether incorporated in Pennsylvania or elsewhere, owning or operating any device for the transportation of passengers, 'shall pay to the state treasurer a tax of eight mills upon the dollar upon the tross receipts of said corporation ... received from passengers ... transported wholly within this state. ...'\n Plaintiff in error was subject to competition in its business by individuals and partnerships operating taxicabs. The act does not apply to them, and no tax is imposed on their receipts. Corporations operating taxicabs are not exempted from any of the taxes imposed on \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 400]\n\u00a0\n natural persons carrying on that business. And every such corporation, whether domestic or foreign, pays a capital stock tax of 5 mills on the actual value of its capital stock and a bonus of one-third of 1 per cent. on the par value of all stock issued if it be a domestic corporation, and a like rate on its capital employed in Pennsylvania if it be a foreign corporation. Act of July 22, 1913, P. L. 903 (Pa. St. 1920,  20366-20368 ); section 1, Act of May 3, 1899, P. L. 189 (Pa. St. 1920,  5686); section 1, Act of May 8, 1901, P. L. 150 (Pa. St. 1920,  5691). The Supreme Court said that it is immaterial whether individuals engaged in a like taxicab business are subject to the tax here involved, and that corporations may be placed in a class separate from individuals and so taxed.\n The equal protection clause extends to foreign corporations within the jurisdiction of the state, and safeguards to them protection of laws applied equally to all in the same situation. Plaintiff in error is entitled in Pennsylvania to the same protection of equal laws that natural persons within its jurisdiction have a right to demand under like circumstances. Kentucky v. Paramount Exch., \n262 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 43 S. Ct. 636. The equal protection clause does not detract from the right of the state justly to exert its taxing power or prevent it from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in that connection, 'but it does require that the classification be not arbitrary, but based on a real and substantial difference having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation.' Power Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 47 S. Ct. 678, 679 (71 L. Ed. 1165). It is established that a corporation, by seeking and obtaining permission to do business in a state, does not thereby become bound to comply with, or estopped from objecting to, the enforcement of its enactments that conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The right to withhold from a foreign corporation permission to do local business therein does not enable the state to require such a corporation \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 401]\n\u00a0\n to surrender the protection of the federal Constitution. Power Co. v. Saunders, supra, 497 (47 S. Ct. 680); Hanover Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 507\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713; Frost v. Railroad Commission, \n271 U.S. 583\n, 593 et seq., 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 46 S. Ct. 331; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S. Ct. 85; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S. Ct. 57.\n The section declares the imposition to be a tax 'upon gross receipts.' And the Supreme Court said (287 Pa. 167, 134 A. 406):\n'The real subject of the tax is the gross receipts of a company engaged in the transportation of freight of passengers. ...'\n\n That statement is not affected by a later expression referring to the tax as a 'state tax on business or income' in contrast with a 'local tax on property,' such as hacks, cabs, and other vehicles. The variation of language used by the court evidently is intended to be, and is, without significance. The words of the section are too plain to require explanation. They could not reasonably be given any other meaning. But, in any event, a characterization of the tax by the state court is not binding here. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32\n, 48 S. Ct. 423; St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S. Ct. 125. There is no controversy as to the application of the tax. Plaintiff in error assumes that the section covers its gross receipts, as held by the state court, but insists that the section is invalid because it does not extend to like receipts of natural persons and partnerships. No doubt there are situations in which, as appears in Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S. Ct. 373, and other cases, a percentage of gross earnings may be taken as a tax on property used in the business and properly may be deemed not to be a tax or burden on such earnings. But the practical operation of the section is to be regarded, and it is to be dealt with according to its effect. Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S. \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 402]\n\u00a0\n 218, 48 S. Ct. 451. Here the tax is one that can be laid upon receipts belonging to a natural person quite as conveniently as upon those of a corporation. It is not peculiarly applicable to corporations, as are taxes on their capital stock or franchises. It is not taken in lieu of any other Pa. 83, 22 A. 240; Commonwealth v. National Oil fall elsewhere. It is laid upon and is to be considered and tested as a tax on gross receipts; it is specifically that and nothing else.\n In effect section 23 divides those operating taxicabs into two classes. The gross receipts of incorporated operators are taxed, while those of natural persons and partnerships carrying on the same business are not. The character of the owner is the sole fact on which the distinction and discrimination are made to depend. The tax is imposed merely because the owner is a corporation. The discrimination is not justified by any difference in the source of the receipts or in the situation or character of the property employed. It follows that the section fails to meet the requirement that a classification, to be consistent with the equal protection clause, must be based on a real and substantial difference having reasonable relation to the subject of the legislation. Power Co. v. Saunders, supra. No decision of this court gives support to such a classification. And the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has condemned such a classification. Schoyer v. Comet Oil & Refining Co., 284 Pa. 189, 196, 197, 130 A. 413. In no view can it be held to have more than an arbitrary basis As construed and applied by the state court in this case, the section violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See The Railroad Tax Cases (C. C.) 13 F. 722; County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co. (C. C.) 18 F. 385; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Walker (C. C.) 47 F. 681. The tax cannot be sustained.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 403]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n I think that the judgment should be affirmed. The principle that I think should govern is the same that I stated in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, April 30, 1928, \n277 \nU.S. 32\n, 48 S. Ct. 423. Although this principle was not applied in that case I do not suppose it to have been denied that taking acts like other rules of law may be determined by differences of degree, and that to some extent States may have a domestic policy that they constitutionally may enforce. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S. Ct. 192. If usually there is an important difference of degree between the business done by corporations and that done by individuals, I see no reason why the larger businesses may not be taxed and the small ones disregarded, and I think it would be immaterial if here and there exceptions were found to the general rule. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 158, et seq., 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S. Ct. 833; Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 393\n, 34 S. Ct. 114; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S. Ct. 440. Furthermore if the State desired to discourage this form of activity in corporate form and expressed its desire by a special tax I think that there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent it.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n It has been the consistent policy of Pennsylvania since 1840 to subject businesses conducted by corporations to heavier taxation than like businesses conducted by individuals. \n1\n It has likewise been the consistent policy of \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 404]\n\u00a0\n the state since 1864 to subject some kinds of businesses conducted by corporations to heavier taxation than other businesses conducted by corporations. \n2\n Pursuant to this policy, the Legislature of Pennsylvania laid, in 1889, upon public service corporations furnishing transportation for hire, a gross receipts tax of eight mills on each dollar of gross receipts earned wholly within the state. Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 1889, pp. 420, 431 (Pa. Stat. 1920,  20388). That statute has remained unchanged so far as affects the question here involved. \n3\n It applies equally to every corporation engaged in the same kind of business, and makes no discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations. But neither this specific tax, nor any equivalent tax, is laid upon individuals or partnerships engaged in the same business. Nor it this tax or an equivalent laid upon corporations which supply certain other public services.\n The Supreme Court of the state has construed this statute as applicable to all taxicab corporations, and has held the Quaker City Cab Company, a foreign corporation doing an intrastate business in Pennsylvania since the year 1917, liable for the taxes accrued on that business \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 405]\n\u00a0\n for the last six months of 1923, which was agreed on as a test period. The company claims that the statute as construed and applied violates the Federal Constitution. There is no contention that it violates either the commerce clause or the due process clause. The claim is that it denies equal protection of the laws; and the contention is rested specifically upon the ground that the exaction 'is not a tax peculiar to corporations.'\n As the statute applies equally to domestic and to foreign corporations, cases like Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, 30 S. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247, Kentucky Finance Corporation v. Paramount Auto Exchange, \n262 \nU.S. 544\n, 43 S. Ct. 636, Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713, and Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490\n, 47 S. Ct. 678, have no application. And no claim is made that the Federal Constitution prevents a state from taxing corporations engaged in one class of business more heavily than those engaged in another. Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114\n, 30 S. Ct. 496; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S. Ct. 578; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S. Ct. 83; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S. Ct. 526. The fundamental question requiring decision is a general one. Does the equality clause prevent a state from imposing a heavier burden of taxation upon corporations engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, than upon individuals engaged under like circumstances in the same kind of business? The narrower question presented is whether this heavier burden may be imposed by a form of tax 'not peculiarly applicable to corporations'; that is, by a tax of such a character that it might have been extended to individuals if the Legislature had seen fit to do so.\n The equality clause does not forbid a state to classify for purposes of taxation. Discrimination through classification is said to violate that clause only where it is such as to preclude the assumption that it was made 'in the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion.' Stebbins \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 406]\n\u00a0\n v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 426 (69 L. Ed. 884, 44 A. L. R. 1454). In other words, the equality clause requires merely that the classification shall be reasonable. We call that action reasonable which an informed, intelligent, justminded, civilized man could rationally favor. In passing upon legislation assailed under the equality clause we have declared that the classification must rest upon a difference which is real, as distinguished from one which is seeming, specious, or fanciful, so that all actually situated similarly will be treated alike, that the object of the classification must be the accomplishment of a purpose or the promotion of a policy, which is within the permissible functions of the state, and that the difference must bear a relation to the object of the legislation which is substantial, as distinguished from one which is speculative, remote, or negligible. \n4\n Subject to this limitation of reasonableness, the equality clause has left unimpaired, both in range and in flexibility, the state's power to classify for purposes of taxation. Can it be said that the classification here in question is unreasonable?\n The difference between a business carried on in corporate form and the same business carried on by natural persons is, of course, a real and important one. As was stated in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 161\n, 162 S., 31 S. Ct. 342, 353 (55 L. Ed. 389, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312):\n'It could not be said ... that there is no substantial differ- \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 407]\n\u00a0\n ence between the carrying on of business by the corporations taxed, and the same business when conducted by a private firm or individual. The thing taxed is not the mere dealing in merchandise, in which the actual transactions may be the same, whether conducted by individuals or corporations, but the tax is laid upon the privileges which exist in conducting business with the advantages which inhere in the corporate capacity of those taxed, and which are not enjoyed by private firms or individuals.'\n\n Because of this difference, Congress has repeatedly discriminated against incorporated concerns and in favor of the unincorporated. The Corporation Tax Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, imposed a tax of 1 per cent. on the net income of corporations when a corresponding tax was not imposed upon the income of individuals. Since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, the net income of both corporations and individuals has been subjected to taxes of the same nature; but the tax imposed has discriminated heavily against at least many of the businesses which are incorporated. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The imposition of the heavier tax on corporations by means of an annual tax in the form of a franchise tax de- \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 408]\n\u00a0\n clared to be for the privilege of doing business in corporate form is common, and, since Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 606\n, 607 S., 10 S. Ct. 593, the validity of such a tax has not been questioned. This heavier burden the state may impose by means of an annual franchise tax in addition to the ordinary property and excise taxes imposed upon all persons, natural and artificial. Or it may impose the heavier burden by means of a franchise tax which will be the sole tax upon the corporation; that is, it may make the franchise tax so high as to include both the tax representing the special privilege of doing business in corporate form and the equivalent for taxes borne by natural persons engaged in the same occupation. Few propositions are better settled that the rule that, in determining whether a state tax violates the Federal Constitution, we are to look at the operation or effect of the tax and not at its name or form. Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329, 333\n, 334 S., 22 S. Ct. 382; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 571\n, 30 S. Ct. 578; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett ( No. 197) \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 230. Compare Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 103\n, 19 S. Ct. 609. Since a state is permitted to impose upon the corporation more than a pro rata share of the common burden of taxation, I find nothing in the Federal Constitution which prohibits it from adopting any of the familiar kinds of taxes as the means of the heavier imposition. Surely, there is nothing inherently objectionable in the long-established, commonly used, gross earnings tax, which should prevent its being selected for that purpose. \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 409]\n\u00a0\n Why Pennsylvania should have chosen to impose upon corporations a heavier tax than upon individuals or partnerships engaged under like circumstances in the same line of business, or why it should have selected this particular form of tax as the means of doing so, we have no occasion to enquire. The state may have done this, because, in view of the advantages inherent in corporate organization, the Legislature believed that course necessary in order to insure a just distribution of the burdens of government. In Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 162\n, 31 S.  Ct. 342, 353 (55 L. Ed. 389, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312), this court listed the advantages which justify the imposition of special taxes on corporations:\n'The continuity of the business, without interruption by death or dissolution, the transfer of property interests by the disposition of shares of stock, the advantages of business controlled and managed by corporate directors, the general absence of individual liability, these and other things inhere in the advantages of business thus conducted, which do not exist when the same business is conducted by private individuals or partnerships.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[277 U.S. 389, 410]\n\u00a0\n In Pennsylvania the practice of imposing heavier burdens upon corporations dates from a time when there,7 as elsewhere in America, the fear of growing corporate power was common. The present heavier imposition may be a survival of an early effort to discourage the resort to that form of organization. The apprehension is now less common. But there are still intelligent, informed, just-minded, and civilized persons who believe that the rapidly growing aggregation of capital through corporations constitutes an insidious menace to the liberty of the citizen; that it tends to increase the subjection of labor to capital; that, because of the guidance and control necessarily exercised by great corporations upon those engaged in business, individual initiative is being impaired and creative power will be lessened; that the absorption of capital by corporations, and their perpetual life, may bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain; that the evils incident to the accelerating absorption of business by corporations outweigh the benefits thereby secured; and that \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 411]\n\u00a0\n the process of absorption should be retarded. The court may think such views unsound. But obviously the requirement that a classification must be reasonable does not imply that the policy embodied in the classification made by the Legislature of a state shall seem to this court a wise one. It is sufficient for us that there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which prohibits a state from imposing a heavier tax burden upon corporations organized for the purpose of engaging exclusively in intrastate commerce, and that there is nothing inherently objectionable in the instrument which Pennsylvania selected for imposing the heavier burden- the gross receipts tax.\n\n For these reasons, I should have no doubt that the statute of Pennsylvania was well within its power, if the question were an open one. But it seems to me that the validity of such legislation has been established by a decision of this court, rendered after much consideration. The contention here sustained differs in no essential respect from that made and overruled in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 161\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. There, as here, the tax was imposed merely because the owner of the business was a corporation, as distinguished from an individual or a partnership. There, as here, the character of the owner was the sole fact on which the distinction was made to depend. There, as here, the discrimination was not based on any other difference in the source of the income or in the character of the property employed. The cases differ in but two respects, neither of them material. In the Flint Case the tax was on net income, while here it is on gross receipts; and the Flint Case arose under the Fifth Amendment, while the present case arises under the Fourteenth. But a tax on net income is no more 'peculiarly applicable to corporations' than is a tax on gross receipts; and in the Flint Case it was distinctly ruled that, 'even if the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment were ap- \n\n[277 U.S. 389, 412]\n\u00a0\n plicable to the present case,' the tax must be upheld. More recently in Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532, 534\n, 40 S. Ct. 304, 64 L. 396 ), the validity of a state statute discriminating against corporations was sustained, and it was said that 'a state may have a policy in taxation,' and that 'a discrimination between corporations and individuals with regard to a tax like this cannot be pronounced arbitrary, although we may not know the precise ground of policy that led the state to insert the distinction in the law.' Compare Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, 30 S. Ct. 496. In my opinion, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n That businesses carried on in corporate form may be taxed, while those carried on by individuals or partnerships are left untaxed, was the rule broadly applied under the Fifth Amendment in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Company, \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, and I can see no reason for not applying it here under the Fourteenth Amendment as well. It is no objection to a taxing statute that the classification is based on two distinct elements-here the doing of business in a corporate form, upheld in Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., supra ( and see Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593; Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532\n, 40 S. Ct. 304), and the character of the business done as distinguished from other classes of business, upheld in Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114\n, 30 S. Ct. 496; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S. Ct. 578; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co ., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S. Ct. 83. For it was decided in Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454, that such a combination of two permissible bases of classification may itself be made the basis of a classification. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That every ... transportation company, ... now or hereafter incorporated or organized by or under any law of this commonwealth, or now or hereafter organized or incorporated by any other state or by the United States or any foreign government, and doing business in this commonwealth, and owning, (or) operating ... any railroad ... or other device for the transportation of freight or passengers or oil ... shall pay to the state treasurer a tax of eight mills upon the dollar upon the gross receipts of said corporation ... received from passengers and freight traffic transported wholly within this state. ...

St.  6336aa, 6336jj), the normal tax on individuals was 4 per cent. while that on corporations was 6 per cent. The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18,  210, 230, 40 Stat. 1057, 1062, 1075 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 e, 6336 1\/8 nn), imposed on individuals a normal tax of 12 per cent. for 1918 and 8 per cent. thereafter, with subnormal rates of 6 per cent. and 4 per cent., respectively; the rate on corporations was 12 per cent. for 1918, 10 per cent. thereafter; the excess profits tax imposed by section 301 of the same act, 40 Stat. 1057, 1088 (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 aa), applied only to corporations. Under the Act of 1921, c. 136 ,  210, 230, 42 Stat. 227, 223 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 e, 6336 1\/8 nn), 252, the rate on individuals was 8 per cent. with a subnormal rate of 4 per cent, whereas the rate on corporations was to be 10 per cent. for 1921, and 12 1\/2 per cent. for following years. The Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234 ,  210, 230, 43 Stat. 253, 264, 282 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 e, 6336 1\/6 n ), lowered the normal rate on individuals to 6 per cent. with subnormal rates of 2 per cent. and 4 per cent., but made no change in the rate to be paid by corporations. The Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27,  210, 230, 44 Stat. 6, 21, 39 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/3 e, 6336 1\/3 n), further lowered the rate on individuals to 5 per cent. with subnormals of 1 1\/2 per cent. and 3 per cent., but raised the rate of the corporation income tax to 13 per cent. for 1925 and 13 1\/2 per cent. thereafter.\n The Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1927, p. 48, states: 'If we include the tax paid by individuals on the dividends received from corporations, the rate of tax on net corporate income is 15.27 per cent., whereas, had all the corporations been taxed as partnerships, the average rate of tax on their net income would have been 9.1 per cent.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This reason for heavier taxation of corporations was stressed in Congress both in the debate on the proposed amendment to the War Revenue Bill of 1898 taxing corporations on their gross receipts, and in the debate on the corporation tax amendment to the Tariff Bill of 1909. See 31 Cong. Rec. 4964, 5092, 5101; 44 Cong. Rec. 4237. Senator Root stated: 'My own state has for many years grouped all corporations within its borders, with certain specific exceptions, in a class upon the revenues of which it imposes a tax imposed on no other members of the community. And it is a late day for us to be told that there is no right in the United States to adopt this old, familiar, general basis of classification for the purpose of imposing an excise tax. It is founded upon reason, sir, and not alone upon authority.' 44 Cong. Rec. 4005, 4006.\n The states, too, have acted upon this theory. See Annual Report of the Assessors of New York, 1882, pp. 15-17; Communication of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of Kansas, relating to the bill for an annual franchise tax, 1911.\n In proposing the enactment of a tax of one shilling in the pound on the profits and income of concerns with limited liability, April 19, 1920, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said: 'I justify it on much broader grounds. Companies incorporated with a limited liability enjoy privileges and conveniences by virtue of the law for which they may well be asked to pay some acknowledgment.' The statement is quoted in Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1920, p. 42. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A commission appointed pursuant to joint resolution of the Legislature of Pennsylvania reported in 1862: 'Corporations in this state are very numerous and very powerful. They have not only drawn within their control an immense amount of capital, but that have drawn within their power the entire commerce of the state. ... The franchises of corporations are property, and the legitimate subject of taxation; in fixing a tax upon corporations these extraordinary privileges, their franchises, constitute the first grounds of the commonwealth's claim to contribution, and in that consists her right to discriminate in favor of the public.' Shortly after this report, the Legislature passed the Act of April 30, 1864, P. L. 218, the first of the special taxes on corporations which have since formed an integral part of the revenue system of the state. \n\n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREED v.

C ., for petitioners.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 376, 383]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Albert J. Williams, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 376, 386]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners brought this suit in the United States court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court held it was without jurisdiction and dismissed the case. 21 F.(2d) 144. The Circuit of Appeals adopted its opinion, and affirmed the decree. 21 F.(2d) 1018\n\n\n Petitioners maintain that the District Court had jurisdiction under the first paragraph of section 24 of the Judicial Code, U. S. C. tit. 28,  41 (28 USCA  41(1), which provides that the District Courts shall have original jurisdiction 'of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, brought by the United States, or by any officer thereof authorized by law to sue. ...'\n Petitioners, other than South, are United States Senators, and constitute a special committee created by Senate Resolution 195, passed May 19, 1926, to make investigation of means used to influence the nomination of candidates for the Senate. The Resolution empowered the committee 'to require by subpoena or otherwise the at- \n\n[277 U.S. 376, 387]\n\u00a0\n tendance of witnesses, the production of books, papers, and documents, and to do such other acts as may be necessary in the matter of said investigation.'\n At a general election held in Pennsylvania November 2, 1926, William S. Vare and William B. Wilson were opposing candidates for the United States Senate. Vare was given the certificate of election, and Wilson initiated a contest. Thereafter January 11, 1927, the Senate passed Resolution 324. It recites that Wilson charges fraudulent and unlawful practices in connection with Vare's nomination and the election, and declares that, unless preserved for the use of the Senate, evidence relating to the election will be lost or destroyed. The Resolution empowers the special committee 'to take ... and preserve all ballot boxes, ... ballots, return sheets, ... and other records, books and documents used in said senatorial election. ...' It confers on the committee 'all powers of procedure with respect to the subject-matter of this resolution that said committee possesses under Resolution numbered 195 ... with respect to the subject-matter of that resolution'; and it requires the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate to attend and execute the directions of the committee.\n The Chairman of the Committee on Audit and Control of Contingent Expenditures having refused to approve the special committee's vouchers for expenses after the expiration of that Congress, the Sergeant at Arms refused to execute its orders. Thereupon the special committee directed the petitioner South, as its representative, to take possession of the boxes, ballots, and other things referred to in Resolution 324.\n Respondents are the commissioners, the prothonotary, and a justice of the peace of Delaware county, Pa. They are authorized custodians of boxes, ballots, and other things used in connection with the election. These were demanded by South in behalf of the commit- \n\n[277 U.S. 376, 388]\n\u00a0\n tee. Respondents declined to give them up, and this suit was brought to obtain possession of them.\n Petitioners do not claim that any act of Congress authorizes the committee or its members, collectively or separately, to sue. Of course, South's authority is no greater than that of the committee which he represents. The suit cannot be maintained unless the committee or its members were authorized to sue by Resolutions 195 and 324, even if it be assumed that the Senate alone may give that authority. The power is not specifically granted by either resolution. Petitioners rely on the general language in Resolution 195, which follows the express authorization of the committee to use its own process to require the production of evidence. The words are, 'and to do such other acts as may be necessary in the matter of said investigation.' The resolutions are to be construed having regard to the power possessed and customarily exerted by the Senate. It is the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members. Article I,  5 (Const.). It is fully empowered, and may determine such matters without the aid of the House of Representatives or the executive or judicial department. That power carries with it authority to take such steps as may be appropriate and necessary to secure information upon which to decide concerning elections. It has been customary for the Senate-and the House as well-to rely on its own power to compel attendance of witnesses and producton of evidence in investigations made by it or through its committees. By means of its own process or that of its committee, the Senate is empowered to obtain evidence relating to the matters committed to it by the Constitution. McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 160\n, 161 S., 167, 174, 47 S. Ct. 319, 50 A. L. R. 1. And Congress has passed laws calculated to facilitate such investigations. R. S.  101-104; U. S. C. tit. 2,  191-194 (2 USCA  191-194). Petitioners have not called attention to any action of the Senate, and we know of none, \n\n[277 U.S. 376, 389]\n\u00a0\n that supports the construction for which they contend. In the absence of some definite indication of that purpose, the Senate may not reasonably be held to have intended to depart from its established usage. Authority to exert the powers of the Senate to compel production of evidence differs widely from authority to invoke judicial power for that purpose. The phrase, 'such other acts as may be necessary,' may not be taken to include everything that under any circumstances might be covered by its words. The meaning of the general language emloyed is to be confined to acts belonging to the same general class as those specifically authorized. Oates v. National Bank, \n100 U.S. 239\n, 244; Barrett v. Van Pelt, \n268 \nU.S. 85, 90\n, 45 S. Ct. 437; Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 291\n, 48 S. Ct. 520. The context, the established practice of the Senate to rely on its own powers, and the attending circumstances, oppose the construction for which petitioners contend, and show that the Senate did not intend to authorize the committee, or anticipate that there might be need, to invoke the power of the Judicial Department. Petitioners are not 'authorized by law to sue.'\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREINECKE v. GARDNER(1928)\nNo. 471\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., for Reinecke.\n Mr. Albert L. Hopkins, of Washington, D. C., for Gardner.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case, pending in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, that court has certified to this questions of law concerning which it asks instructions for the proper disposal of the cause. Judicial Code,  239 ( 28 USCA  346). The certificate states that the appellee, trustee in bankruptcy of a coal-mining corporation, acting under order of the bankruptcy court, carried on the business of the bankrupt, using for that purpose its entire property. From October 3, 1913, the date of the adjudication, until about January 1, 1917, the business was conducted at a loss, but in 1917 and 1918 there were substantial profits. In 1917 the bankruptcy court, on the application of holders of bonds secured by trust deeds of all the bankrupt's property, ordered the payment of the bond interest maturing in 1916, the profits of the business for 1916 exceeding the interest maturing in that year. The trustee kept his books on the accrual basis and the interest coming due in 1916 was shown on the books as then kept. The trustee deducted from gross income of that year the bond interest which matured in 1916 and was paid in 1917. The Commis- \n\n[277 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n sioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction, and filed in the bankruptcy court a claim for the additional income and the excess profits tax due for 1917, on the ground the interest maturing on the bonds in 1916 had been improperly deducted from 1917 profits. The questions certified are as follows:\n'Question 1. Is a trustee in bankruptcy, operating under order of the bankruptcy court the business of a bankrupt domestic corporation in the year 1917, and realizing net profits from the operation, subject to the excess profits tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1917, in a case where the corporation, if itself conducting the business, would under the act, have been subject to such tax?\n\n'Question 2. Under the above stated facts, is the trustee in bankruptcy, in computing income and excess profits taxes for the year 1917, entitled to deduct from the gross income of 1917 the bond interest maturing in 1916, and paid in 1917 out of profits of his operation in 1917 of the bankrupt's business?'\n\n As under the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA) the entire property of the bankrupt vested in the trustee, the income in question was not the income of the bankrupt corporation but of the trustee, and was subject to income and excess profits tax only if the statutes authorized the assessment of the tax against him. The Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756 (Comp. St.  6336a et seq.), and the War Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300 ( Comp. St.  6336aa et seq.), imposed income and excess profits taxes on individuals, partnerships, and corporations, but neither in terms mentioned trustees in bankruptcy as taxable persons. But section 13(c) of the Act of 1916 (Comp. St.  6336m (c)) required trustees in bankruptcy of corporations subject to the income tax to make returns of net income, and provided that 'any income tax due on the basis of such returns ... shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if assessed directly against the' corporation. This section, as \n\n[277 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n appellee concedes, by its terms extends the tax imposed by section 10 of the Act of 1916 (Comp. St.  6336j) to income received by trustees in bankruptcy of corporations. See United States v. Chicago & Eastern Ill. Ry . (D. C.) 298 F. 779.\n In the next year section 4 of title of the Act of 1917 (Comp. St.  6336jj) imposed an income tax of 4 per cent. 'in addition to the tax imposed' by section 10 of the Act of 1916 as then amended on the same subjects taxed by section 10, and provided that 'the tax imposed by this section shall be computed, levied, assessed, collected, and paid upon the same incomes and in the same manner as the tax' imposed by section 10. The respondent was thus subjected to the additional income tax of the later act.\n The case is different with respect to the excess profits tax. That tax was imposed by title 2 of the Act of 1917 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 a- 6336 3\/8 o) on corporations, partnerships, and individuals engaged in trade or business. The title made no mention of executors, receivers, trustees or persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, and contained no language corresponding to the quoted provision of title 1,  4, extending the additional income tax to 'the same incomes' taxed by section 10 of the Act of 1916. A tax imposed on corporations alone does not extend to a trustee in bankruptcy of a corporation. See United States v. Whitridge, \n231 \nU.S. 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 24; Scott v. Western Pacific Ry. ( C. C. A.) 246 F. 545; compare Smietanka v. First Trust & Savings Bank, \n257 \nU.S. 602\n, 42 S. Ct. 223. In support of the assessment of an excess profits tax the collector relies on the general language of section 212 of title 2, printed in the margin,1 providing, in substance, that all \n\n[277 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n the administrative provisions of the Act of 1916 not inconsistent with title 2 are made applicable to it, and argues that the provisions of section 13(c) of the Act of 1916, requiring the trustee in bankruptcy of a corporation to file a return and subjecting to tax the income thus disclosed are incorporated in the Act of 1917 by reference and extended to the excess profits taxes imposed by that act.\n It is to be noted that section 212 purports to take over from the earlier acts administrative provisions only. Its last clause, adopting the provision of title 1 of the 1916 act 'relating to returns and payment of the tax,' refers to the administrative provisions of the earlier act fixing the time and manner of making returns and payment of the tax and not to the classes of income to be assessed. In this connection the omission from section 212 of any clause corresponding to the assessment provisions of title 1, by which the additional income tax was imposed on the 'same incomes' taxed by the earlier act, is significant. If the requirement in section 13(c), that trustees shall make returns be considered an administrative provision, certainly the added clause, 'any ... tax due on the basis of such returns ... shall be assessed and collected,' is more than administrative, and actually imposes a tax. As such it is not incorporated in the later act by the reference in section 212. Thus the later act is without any provision subjecting one in the position of appellee to the excess profits tax.\n The apparent purpose of section 212 was to take over from the earlier act those applicable administrative provisions which would aid in the collection of the new tax imposed \n\n[277 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n by title 2, and not to extend it to classes of persons or subjects not mentioned in the title. Various reasons may be urged why Congress may not have intended to extend the excess profits tax to trustees in bankruptcy. But whatever purpose Congress may have had, we think the language of section 212 falls short of indicating any intention to enlarge the classes of taxpayers mentioned in title 2. The extension of a tax by implication is not favored. United States v. Whitridge, supra; Smietanka v. First Trust & Savings Bank, supra.\n The Treasury Department itself has held that testamentary trustees and trustees of estates in process of distribution, notwithstanding the administrative provisions of the 1916 act requiring them to make returns for income tax purposes, are not taxable for excess profits. L. O. 1100, I- 2 C. B. 230; S. M. 2384, III-2 C. B. 330.\n The first question is answered 'No.'\n As the trustee in bankruptcy was subject to an income tax under the Act of 1916, an answer to the second question is not made unnecessary by our answer to the first. The second was, we assume, intended to present the question whether the deduction of interest, accrued and payable in 1916, but actually paid in 1917, was required to be made from 1916 income because the taxpayer kept his books on the accrual basis. We are unable to answer the question, for the reason that the certificate omits to state facts essential to its determination. The applicable section, 13(d) of the Act of 1916 (Comp. St.  6336m(d)), directs that, if the taxpayer keeps his books on any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, and the return is made on the basis adopted, the tax shall be computed on that basis, unless the books clearly do not reflect the taxpayer's true income, In United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131, it was pointed out that under the Act of 1916 and applicable treasury regulations, the taxpayer must make all deductions from gross income as of the year when the pay- \n\n[277 U.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n ments were made, unless he keeps his books on an accrual basis which accurately reflects his income, and actually made his return on that basis. See United States v. Mitchell, \n271 \nU.S. 9\n, 46 S. Ct. 418; American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99\n, 47 S. Ct. 520. The present certificate fails to state whether the books of the trustee as kept reflected his income or whether his return was made on the accrual basis or on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements. Under Judicial Code,  239, the facts pertinent to the question asked must be certified. When they are omitted from the certificate, the question need not be answered. Dillon v. Strathearn S. S. Co., \n248 \nU.S. 182\n, 39 S. Ct. 83.\n Question No. 1 answered 'No.'\n Question No. 2 not answered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 212.

FRENCH OVERSEAS CORPORATION(1928)\nNo. 459\nArgued: April 16, 1928Decided: May 21, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John M. Woolsey and Mark W. Maclay, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. Catesby Jones and D. Roger Englar, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, in July, 1917, shipped a cargo on the schooner Malcolm Baxter, owned by respondent, from New Orleans to Bordeaux, and prepaid the freight. The bill of lading stipulated:\n'Prepaid freight is to be considered as earned in shipment of goods and is to be retained by vessel's owner, ... if there be forced interruption or abandonment of the voyage, at a port of distress or elsewhere.'\n\n In addition there was the usual clause exempting the vessel from 'restraints of princes, rulers, and peoples.' After departure from New Orleans the Baxter developed leaks due to unseaworthiness which caused her to put in at Key West, where she was surveyed. In order to effect the necessary repairs she was towed to Havana, where she was unladen and repaired, remaining there for that purpose until January 14, 1918. Before the completion of the repairs the United States Export Administrative Board put into effect its ruling of Novem- \n\n[277 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n ber 18, 1917, that sailing vessels would not be permitted to clear for points beyond the war zone. This ruling remaining in force when the repairs were completed, the Baxter, being unable to secure a clearance for Bordeaux, took her cargo on board and proceeded to New York, where the petitioners libeled the vessel in the District Court for Southern New York to recover freight money, damages to cargo, and damages for failure to perform the contract voyage from New Orleans to Bordeaux.\n Respondent as owner filed a petition for exoneration and limitation of liability and enjoined further proceedings on the libels. Petitioners filed claims in the limitation proceedings, claiming damages as in the original libels, setting up the deviation and the abandonment of the voyage, by reason of the ship's unseaworthiness on sailing.\n The District Court denied the petition to limit liability, but allowed the claim for freight money and for damages sustained by petitioners, including damage to cargo. A special master, appointed to take proof of damage, found that the measure of damages was the excess cost of the substituted carriage and incidental expenses, and in the case of goods which could not be sent forward the damage was measured by the difference between the value of the goods at the time when and in the condition in which they should have arrived at destination, and their, value at the place where and in the condition in which they actually were received, less charges saved plus incidental expenses. Final decree was given to the petitioners for the damage as found.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the ruling of the District Court denying exoneration and limitation of liability but reversed the judgment, holding there could be no recovery of the prepaid freight or excess cost of transportation over prepaid freight; that the recovery of damages must be limited to actual damages to \n\n[277 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n cargo resulting from unseaworthiness, and the difference between the value of the cargo had it arrived in Bordeaux on a straight voyage on August 16, 1917, the date when the Baxter sailed, and on a voyage leaving Havana January 14, 1918, the date when the repairs were completed and the Baxter was ready for sea. The Malcolm Baxter, Jr., 20 F.(2d) 304.\n Both courts below agreed that the Baxter was unseaworthy on sailing, and that respondent failed to exercise due diligence to ascertain her condition before sailing. This was sufficient ground for denying the petition for exoneration and limitation of liability under the Harter Act ( Act Feb. 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445 (46 USCA  190-195; Comp. St.  8029-8033, 8035)), and acts permitting limitation of liability to the vessel and pending freight (R. S.  4282-4289 (46 USCA  175, 182-188; Comp. St.  8020-8027)).

Ct. 255; but petitioners urge that the Baxter's putting in first at Key West, and later at Havana, must be deemed a voluntary deviation, because due to the negligence of the owner in failing to discover the unseaworthiness and to make the vessel seaworthy before sailing.\n Unseaworthiness alone, or deviation caused by it, displaces the contract of affreightment only in so far as damage is caused by the unseaworthiness. The Caledonia, \n157 \nU.S. 124\n, 15 S. Ct. 537; The Europa, (1908) P. 84; Thorley v. Orchis S. S. Col, Limited, (1907) 1 K. B. 660; Kish v. Taylor, (1912) A. C. 604, 618. But if the deviation here is to be classed with voluntary deviations, respondent may not claim the benefit of the clauses of the bill of landing and is responsible for the cargo as insurer. The Willdomino, \n272 \nU.S. 718\n, 47 S. Ct. 261; St. Johns Corp. v. Companhia Geral, etc., \n263 \nU.S. 119\n, 44 S. Ct. 30; Mobile & Montgomery Ry. v. Jurey, \n111 \nU.S. 584\n, 4 S. Ct. 566; Lawrence v. Minturn, 17 How. 111. And see The Indrapura (D. C.) 171 F. 929. In any case it is contended that respondent's negligent failure to discover the unsea- \n\n[277 U.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n worthiness of the vessel resulted in the delay which brought her within the operation of the embargo, and that the shipowners are for that reason liable for damages for all the delay, including that immediately resulting from the embargo.\n Respondents had purchased the vessel about one month before she sailed. At that time she was unseaworthy, due to a hog or camber in her keel, a structural weakness dangerous to the ship in heavy weather, which later caused the leak and made necessary the repairs at Havana. Following the purchase and before sailing from New Orleans a survey was made by the owner, which appears not to have disclosed her condition, but both courts below agree that the fact of her unseaworthiness could have been discovered by due diligence.\n The evidence supports the finding of the court of appeals that the master of the Baxter 'did not leave New Orleans with knowledge that he would have to make port for repairs, and honestly thought he could make the trip in safety and tried unsuccessfully to do so.' The case is therefore not one where the master set sail with the knowledge that the deviation from the voyage, as described in the bill of lading, would ensue, and with the purpose and intent to deviate as in The Willdomino, supra. There the officers of the vessel, under direction of the owner, sailed from Ponta Delgada, bound for New York, all knowing that the supply of fuel was insufficient for the voyage, and intending to take the vessel to North Sidney, and we held that the deviation under the circumstances was voluntary and inexcusable.\n But here the deviation was not voluntary and the point to be determined is whether a like effect is to be given to a deviation to avoid perils of the sea where the deviation would not have been necessary if the owner had used reasonable diligence to start the voyage with a seaworthy vessel.\n No sufficient reason is suggested to us for thus extending the rule, nor do we perceive any. Petitioner, without \n\n[277 U.S. 323, 333]\n\u00a0\n resort to it, is entitled to recover all damages caused by the unseaworthiness. The basis of the privilege of deviation to avoid perils of the sea is humanitarian. See Carver, Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.)  291, 292. To hold that the master whose ship is in a perilous position must choose between the hazard of continuing the voyage and gaining safety only by forfeiting the contract of affreightment would be a departure from that principle for no purpose except to give the shipper an added and unnecessary protection. 'It is the pesence of the peril and not its cause' which justifies the deviation. See Strang v. Scott, 14 App. Cas. 801. This is the conclusion reached in other circuits (The Turret Crown (C. C. A.) F. 439, 445; The Turret Crown (D. C.) 282 F. 439, 445; The Turret Crown (D. C .) 282 F. 354, 360; see The Thessaloniki (C. C. A.) 267 F. 67), and by the House of Lords in Kish v. Taylor, supra, holding that a deviation caused by unseaworthiness due to improper and negligent loading of the ship by the master did not displace the bill of lading. This rule we adopt as most consonant with the reason and consequences of the rule that a voluntary deviation displaces the contract of affreightment. It follows that the clauses of the bill of lading remain effective and that petitioner may not recover the freight money. Allanwilde Corp. v. Vacuum Oil Co., \n248 \nU.S. 377\n, 39 S. Ct. 147, 3 A. L. R. 15.\n But for all damages legally attributable to the breach of warranty of seaworthiness petitioners may recover. The Caledonia, supra. For the delay caused by the embargo alone petitioners may not recover, both because it was within the exception of the bill of lading and because, while it continued, performance of the contract of affreightment would have been illegal. See Allanwilde Corp. v. Vacuum Oil Co., supra, 385 (39 S. Ct. 147 ); Carver, Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.)  237, 238, 343, 344.\n It was the embargo and not the unseaworthiness of the vessel, which delayed the voyage after the Baxter was repaired and ready for sea on January 14, 1918, and the unseaworthiness of the vessel did not cause the embargo. \n\n[277 U.S. 323, 334]\n\u00a0\n But it is urged that it is enough to sustain the recovery for the failure to complete the voyage that it was the unseaworthiness, for which respondent was responsible, that brought the vessel within the excepted peril. This view, although not without support (Green-Wheeler Shoe Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. R. R., 130 Iowa, 123, 106 N. W. 498, 5 L. R. A . (N. S.) 882, 8 Ann. Cas. 45; Michaels v. New York Central R. R., 30 N. Y. 564, 86 Am. Dec. 415; Condict v. Grand Trunk Ry., 54 N. Y. 500), does not generally prevail. See 2 Williston, Contracts,  1906, and cases cited.\n It was rejected by this court in Railroad Co. v. Reeves, 10 Wall. 176. There negligent delay in the transportation of goods by the carrier brought them within the path of a flood, which caused their destruction. The court held that the flood and not the negligent dealy was the proximate cause of the damage and that the rule 'cause proxima non remota spectatur' applied to contracts of common carriers as to others. There has been no departure from this rule and we see no reason for departing from it now. See Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Kellogg, \n94 U.S. 469\n; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Calhoun, \n213 \nU.S. 1\n, 29 S. Ct. 321; The Indrapura, supra; The Lusitania (D. C .) 251 F. 715, 732; The Turret Crown (D. C.) 282 F. 354, 360. There is no finding, nor is it suggested, that at the time when the contract of affreightment was entered into, or when the vessel broke ground, that the embargo could reasonably have been foreseen, or that there were any special circumstances charging petitioners with the knowledge or expectation that the unseaworthiness or consequent delay would bring the vessel within its operation. The respondent, having brought itself within the exception under its bill of lading, the burden is on petitioners to show that respondents' negligence was the cause of or contributed to the loss.

MCBRIDE(1928)\nNo. 569\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Simpson, 2d, and Walter Gordon Merritt, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry R. Coulomb, of Atlantic City, N. J., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 227, p. 822, Laws of New Jersey 1918, being an act to regulate the keeping of employment agencies, requires that every person operating an employment agency as defined by the statute must procure a license from the commissioner of labor. A penalty is imposed for failure to do so. The application for such license must be made in writing to the commissioner of labor, and, among other requirements, the applicant must 'file with the commissioner of labor, for his approval, a schedule of fees proposed to be charged for any services rendered to employers seeking employees, and persons seeking employment, and all charges must conform thereto. The schedule of fees may be changed only with the approval of the commissioner of labor.' The commissioner of labor may refuse to issue or may revoke any license for any good cause shown within the meaning and purpose of the act.\n Plaintiff in error filed with the state commissioner of labor a written application for a license to conduct an employment agency. All conditions of the statute were complied with; but the commissioner rejected the application upon the sole ground that, in his opinion, the fees proposed to be charged in respect of certain permanent positions were excessive and unreasonable. This action of the commissioner was brought up for review to the Supreme Court of the state, and that court construing the statute as empowering the commissioner to fix and limit the charges to be made by the applicant, nevertheless sustained it as constitutional under the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (N. J. Sup.) 133 A. 870. Upon appeal to the state court of errors and appeals, the judgment was affirmed. 137 A. 437. \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n That the state has power to require a license and regulate the business of an employment agent does not admit of doubt. But the question here presented is whether the due process of law clause is contravened by the legislation attempting to confer upon the commissioner of labor power to fix the prices which the employment agent shall charge for his services. The question calls for an answer under the last of the three categories set forth by this court in Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280; that is to say, Has the business in question been devoted to the public use and an interest in effect granted to the public in that use? Or, in other words, is the business one 'affected with a public interest,' within the meaning of that phrase as heretofore defined by this court? As was recently pointed out in Tyson & Borther v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 430\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, the phrase is not capable of exact definition; but, nevertheless, under all the decisions of this court from Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, it is the standard by which the validity of price-fixing legislation, in respect of a business like that here under consideration, must be tested.\n In the Tyson Case it was said (page 430 (47 S. Ct. 428)) that the interest meant was not 'such as arises from the mere fact that the public derives benefit, accommodation, ease, or enjoyment from the existence or operation of the business; and while the word has not always been limited narrowly as strictly denoting 'a right,' that synonym more nearly than any other expresses the sense in which it is to be understood.' The business must be such (page 434 (47 S. Ct. 429)) 'as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby, in effect, granted to the public.' And again (page 438 (47 S. Ct. 431)), after reviewing former decisions, it was said that:\n'Each of the decisions of this court upholding governmental price regulation, aside from cases involving legislation to tide over temporary emergencies, has turned \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration, which bore such a substantial and definite relation to the public interest as to justify an indulgence of the legal fiction of a grant by the owner to the public of an interest in the use.'\n\n In Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, page 537 (43 S. Ct. 633), it was said:\n'It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the Constitution, that the business of the butcher, or the baker, the tailor, the wood chopper, the mining operator or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by state regulation. ... One does not devote one's property or business to the public use or clothe it with a public interest merely because one makes commodities for, and sells to, the public in the common callings of which those above mentioned are instances.'\n\n In Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238, this court had under consideration an act of Congress fixing minimum wages for women and children in the District of Columbia. The legislation, so far as it affected women, was held invalid as contravening the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it was an arbitrary interference with the right to contract in respect of terms of private employment. It was said (page 546 (43 S. Ct. 397)) that, while there was no such thing as absolute freedom of contract, nevertheless, such freedom of contract was the general rule and restraint the exception, and that 'the exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances.'\n The business of securing employment for those seeking work and employees for those seeking workers is essentially that of a broker; that is, of an intermediary. While we do not undertake to say that there may not be a deeper concern on the part of the public in the business of an employment agency, that business does not differ in sub- \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n stantial character from the business of a real estate broker, ship broker, merchandise broker or ticket broker. In the Tyson Case, supra, we declared unconstitutional an act of the New York Legislature which sought to fix the price at which theater tickets should be sold by a ticket broker, and it is not easy to see how, without disregarding that decision, price- fixing legislation in respect of other brokers of like character can be upheld.\n An employment agency is essentially a private business. True, it deals with the public, but so do the druggist, the butcher, the baker, the grocer, and the apartment or tenement house owner, and the broker who acts as intermediary between such owner and his tenants. Of course, anything which substantially interferes with employment is a matter of public concern, but in the same sense that interference with the procurement of food and housing and fuel are of public concern. The public is deeply interested in all these things. The welfare of its constituent members depends upon them. The interest of the public in the matter of employment is not different in quality or character from its interest in the other things enumerated; but in none of them is the interest that 'public interest' which the law contemplates as the basis for legislative price control. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, page 536 (43 S. Ct. 630). Under the decisions of this court it is no longer fairly open to question that, at least in the absence of a grave emergency (Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra, pages 431, 437 (47 S. Ct. 426)), the fixing of prices for food or clothing, of house rental or of wages to be paid, whether minimum or maximum, is beyond the legislative power. And we perceive no reason for applying a different rule in the case of legislation controlling prices to be paid for services rendered in securing a place for an employee or an employee for a place.\n Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340\n, 36 S. Ct. 561, cited by defendant in error lends no support to the judgment below. That \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 358]\n\u00a0\n case involved the validity of a Michigan statute in respect of employment agencies. Section 5 of the act attempted to limit the fees which should be charged. The state Supreme Court held that the business was one properly subject to police regulation and control, but did not rule concerning the validity of section 5. This court held that it was within the power of the state to require licenses for employment agencies and prescribe reasonable regulations to be enforced by the commissioner of labor. But it was said ( page 344 (36 S. Ct. 562)):\n'Provisions of section 5 in respect of fees to be demanded or retained are severable from other portions of the act and, we think, might be eliminated without destroying it. Their validity was not passed upon by the Supreme Court of the state and has not been considered by us.'\n\n And we since have held definitely that the power to require a license for and to regulate the conduct of a business is distinct from the power to fix prices. 'The latter power is not only a more definite and serious invasion of the rights of property and the freedom of contract, but its exercise cannot always be justified by circumstances which have been held to justify legislative regulation of the manner in which a business shall be carried on.' Tyson & Borther v. Banton, supra, page 431 (47 S. Ct. 428). And see pages 440, 441 (47 S. Ct. 426).\n To urge that extortion, fraud, imposition, discrimination, and the like have been practiced to some, or to great, extent in connection with the business here under consideration, or that the business is one lending itself peculiarly to such evils, is simply to restate grounds already fully considered by this court. These are grounds for regulation, but not for price fixing as we have already definitely decided. Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra, 442-445 (47 S. Ct. 426).\n There are a number of states which have statutes like that now under consideration, and we are asked to give weight to that circumstance. It is to be observed, how- \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 359]\n\u00a0\n ever, that with the exception of the decision now under review none of these statutes has been judicially considered, except in the state of California, where the legislation was declared unconstitutional. Ex parte Dickey, 144 Cal. 234, 77 P. 924, 66 L. R. A. 928, 103 Am. St. Rep. 82, 1 Ann. Cas. 428; In re Smith, 193 Cal. 337, 223 P. 971. And it was said in oral argument, and not disputed, that, while legislation of this character existed in several states, generally it was not enforced, in some instances because the state's Attorney General had advised that the legislation was unconstitutional. In any event, under all the circumstances, and in the face of our prior decisions, we do not regard the mere existence in other states of statutory provisions like the one now under review as entitled to persuasive force.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD (concurring).\n I concur in this result upon the controlling authority of Tyson v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, which, as applied to the question in this case, I am unable to distinguish.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n The question is whether a state has constitutional power to require employment agencies to charge only reasonable fees for their services to those seeking employment. As the case is presented we must take it that the New Jersey commissioner of labor was right in holding that Ribnik's list of fees was unreasonably high.\n Under the decisions of this court not all price regulation, as distinguished from other forms of regulation, is forbidden. As those decisions have been explained, price regulation is within the constitutional power of a state Legislature when the business concerned is 'affected with a public interest.' That phrase is not to be found in the Constitution. Concededly it is incapable of any precise definition. It has and can have only such meaning as \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 360]\n\u00a0\n may be given to it by the decisions of this court. As I read those decisions, such regulation is within a state's power whenever any combination of circumstances seriously curtails the regulative force of competition, so that buyers or sellers are placed at such a disadvantage in the bargaining struggle that a Legislature might reasonably anticipate serious consequences to the community as a whole.

Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n, 29 S. Ct. 206; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, \n222 \nU.S. 225\n, 32 S. Ct. 74, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 529; Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160\n, 15 S. Ct. 586. The price regulation may embrace businesses 'which, though not public at their inception, may be fairly said to have risen to be such and have become subject in consequence to some government regulation.' Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. The use by the public generally of the specific thing or business affected is not the test. The nature of the service rendered, the exorbitance of the charges and the arbitrary control to which the public may be subjected without regulation, are elements to be considered in determining whether the 'public interest' exists. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra, 538 (43 S. Ct. 630). The economic disadvantage of a class and the attempt to ameliorate its condition may alone be sufficient to give rise to the 'public interest' and to justify the regulation of contracts with its members (Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, supra; McLean v. Arkansas, supra; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, supra), and obviously circumstances may so change in point of time or so differ in space as to clothe a business with such an interest which at other \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 361]\n\u00a0\n times or in other places would be a matter purely of private concern ( Block v. Hirsh, supra, 155 (41 S. Ct. 458)).\n I cannot say a priori that the business of employment agencies in New Jersey lacks the requisite 'public interest.' We are judicially aware that the problem of unemployment is of grave public concern; that the conduct of the employment agency business bears an important relationship to that larger problem and affects vitally the lives of great numbers of the population, not only in New Jersey, but throughout the United States; that employment agencies, admittedly subject to regulation in other respects ( Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340\n, 36 S. Ct. 561), and in fact very generally regulated, deal with a necessitous class, the members of which are often dependent on them for opportunity to earn a livelihood, are not free to move from place to place, and are often under exceptional economic compulsion to accept such terms as the agencies offer. We are not judicially ignorant of what all human experience teaches, that those so situated are peculiarly the prey of the unscrupulous and designing. In Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590\n, 37 S. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973, a statute of Washington which in effect attempted to abolish the business was held unconstitutional because employment agencies were deemed not 'inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare.' but, as was there emphasized, capable, under regulation, of being conducted in a useful and honest manner. But it was not questioned that the business was subject to grave abuses, involving frauds and impositions upon a peculiarly helpless class, among which the exaction of exorbitant fees was perhaps the least offensive. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, in an opinion in the present case, which was adopted by the Court of Errors and Appeals, said:\n'It is common knowledge that an employment agency is a business dealing with a great body of our population, native and foreign born, which is \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 362]\n\u00a0\n susceptible to imposition, deception, and immoral influences. ...'\n\n In dealing with the question of power to require reasonable prices in this particular business, we should remember what was specifically pointed out by the court in Tyson v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 438\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 431 (71 L. Ed. 718), that whether a business is affected with a 'public interest' turns 'upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration.' In the respects mentioned, or most of them, and in others to be pointed out, it seems to me that there is a marked difference between the character of this business and that of real estate brokers, ship brokers, merchandise brokers, and, more than all, of ticket brokers, who were involved in Tyson v. Banton, supra. There the attempt was made to limit the advance which brokers might charge over box office prices for theater tickets, an expedient adopted to break up their monopolistic control of a luxury, not a necessity. Those affected by the practices of the ticket brokers constituted a relatively small part of the population within a comparatively small area of the state of New York. They were not necessitous. The consequences of the fraud and extortion practiced upon them were not visited upon the community as a whole in any such manner as are fraud and imposition practiced upon workers seeking employment. Here the effort is made, as in Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, supra, McLean v. Arkansas, supra, Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, supra, and Erie R. R. v. Williams, \n233 \nU.S. 685\n, 34 S. Ct. 761, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1097, first, to protect from abuses a class unable to protect itself, for whose welfare the police power has often been allowed broad play, and, second, to mitigate the evils which unemployment brings upon the community as a whole.\n Some presumption should be indulged that the New Jersey Legislature had an adequate knowledge of such local conditions as the circumstances of those seeking employ- \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 363]\n\u00a0\n ment, the number and distribution of employment agencies, the local efficacy of competition, the prevalent practices with respect to fees. On this deserved respect for the judgment of the local lawmaker depends, of course, the presumption in favor of constitutionality, for the validity of a regulation turns 'upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business under consideration.' Tyson v. Banton, supra, 438 (47 S. Ct. 431). Moreover, we should not, when the matter is not clear, oppose our notion of the seriousness of the problem or the necessity of the legislation to that of local tribunals. 'This court, by an unbroken line of decisions from Chief Justice Marshall to the present day, has steadily adhered to the rule that every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of an act of Congress until overcome beyond rational doubt.' Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 544\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 396 (67 L. Ed. 785, 24 A. L. R. 1238). And the enactments of state Legislatures are entitled to no less respect. If, therefore, our consideration of the general conditions surrounding employment agencies, which it was thought in Brazee v. Michigan, supra, made them subject to regulation, was to go no further than that of the court, I should still have supposed that plaintiff in error had not sustained the burden which rests on him to show that this law is unconstitutional. Erie R. R. v. Williams, supra. But even if the presumption is not to be indulged, and the burden no longer to be cast on him who attacks the constitutionality of a law, we need not close our eyes to available data throwing light on the problem with which the Legislature had to deal. See Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 420-421, 28 S. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; McLean v. Arkansas, supra, 549 (29 S. Ct. 206).\n For 30 years or more the evils found to be connected with the business of employment agencies in the United States have been the subject of repeated investigations, official and unofficial, and of extensive public comment. They have been the primary reason for the \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 364]\n\u00a0\n establishment of public employment offices in the various states. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Quite apart from the other evils laid at the door of the private agencies, 2 the data supplied by these investigations and reports afford a substantial basis for the conclusion of the New Jersey Legislature that the business is peculiarly subject to abuses relating to fee charging, and \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 365]\n\u00a0\n that for the correction of these the restriction to a reasonable maximum charge is the only effective remedy. These data, to be gathered from numerous independent and public investigations, may be briefly summarized as follows:\n First. They show that the agencies, left to themselves, very generally charge extortionate fees. The Commission on Industrial Relations, created by Act of August 23, 1912, c. 351, 37 Stat. 415, reported to Congress at a time when prices were materially lower than today:\n'Fees are often charged out of all proportion to the service rendered. We know of cases where $5, $9, $10, and even $16 a piece has been paid for jobs at common labor. In one city the fees paid by scrubwomen is at the rate of $24 a year for their poorly paid work.'3\n\n Exorbitant fees are taken for merely registering the applicants, no effort whatever being made to find them work. \n4\n To stimulate \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 366]\n\u00a0\n the payment of such fees the agencies advertise for classes of laborers for whom no jobs are available. \n5\n According to the Massachusetts Commission to Investigate Employment Offices, the ordinary forces of competition seem powerless to prevent or remedy this situation, because but little capital is required to open an office, and because the clients of the agencies are constantly new. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n Second. These data show that the fees charged are often discriminatory. It is made known in slack season that but few jobs are available, and that to these will be referred the applicants who tender the larger 'extra fees' \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 367]\n\u00a0\n or 'presents.' \n7\n There is ground for the belief that this is a particular danger in New Jersey, for a large proportion of its agencies specialize in employees for hotels and resorts, where the positions are seasonal and temporary. \n8\n The whole supply of labor must, at the beginning and again at the end of the season, search for new positions at the same time.\n Third. Fee-splitting has been a recurrent subject of complaint. It 'is frequently practiced, part of the fee charged to the worker being paid over by the private employment agent to the employer or his foreman. This practice is closely akin to job selling by foremen and superintendents . ... Both 'fee splitting' and 'job selling' result in short time employment and frequent discharges, for each time a job is filled a new fee is 'split' or a fresh price exacted. The resultant wastage from accelerated labor turn-over, from extortionate and multiplied fees, from demoralization of workers, from unemployment and irregularity of employment, is incalculably great.' \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 368]\n\u00a0\n Public Employment Offices in the United States, U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin No. 241 (1918) p. 6.9 While their fees are unregulated, the private agencies are free to charge those seeking employment enough to cover both the charge for their service and the gratuity paid to the foreman or employer. A Legislature would certainly not be unreasonable in concluding that the fixing of a reasonable maximum fee was the appropriate and only effective method of assuring private agencies fair compensation while preventing them from abuses of this character.\n Fourth. It is reported that at times of widespread unemployment the private agencies are known to raise their fees out of all proportion to the reasonable value of their services. \n10\n There is a public interest at such times in \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 369]\n\u00a0\n bringing about a prompt readjustment of the labor supply to industry's need for labor. The additional barrier to a quick readjustment created by the agencies' raising of their rates affects that interest adversely. The establishment of a reasonable maximum rate11 is well calculated to obviate the abuse.\n Fifth. Finally, it is pointed out that the private agencies charge the employee and do not charge the employer for a service that is rendered to both. The convenience of being furnished with employees is similar to that of being directed to a position; but less effort is required to collect compensation for the whole service from the employee alone. His necessities are normally greater. His bargaining power is normally weaker. The setting of a maximum fee need not mean-in New Jersey does not mean- that an absolute limit is placed on the agency's return. The agency may still charge the employer in addition for such service as is rendered to him. \n12\n The establishment of reasonable fees is thus, in one aspect, merely a method of \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 370]\n\u00a0\n providing that the patrons of the agency shall be required to pay only for the service rendered to them.\n Legislation for the correction of these and other evils has been general throughout the United States. \n13\n Among the earliest comprehensive schemes for that purpose was the Act of June 19, 1906, c. 3438, 34 Stat. 304, adopted by Congress for the District of Columbia. \n14\n For numer \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 371]\n\u00a0\n ous classes of employees (including all domestic servants and farm help) in regulates (s 8) not only the fee which may be charged to the applicant for work, but also the amount that the agency may receive from the employer. It requires a refund of half the fee if a fair opportunity for work is not secured in four days, and a refund of the whole fee and transportation expenses if no employment of the kind asked was vacant at the place to which the applicant was directed.\n Among the states, 21 have limited the total fees that may be charged- 10 by fixing a stated maximum,15 and 11 by restricting the charge to a named percentage of the salary earned during some period. \n16\n In 8 states the maximum registration fee is fixed by statute, and that fee is required to be returned if no work is found for the applicant. \n17\n In 17 states, if no \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 372]\n\u00a0\n work is furnished, the agency must return the entire fee collected. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n It is of course true that the enactment of a particular type of legislation, even though general, and a widespread and competent opinion that it is wise and necessary, do not extablish its constitutionality. But that such legislation has been enacted and continued in force over considerable periods of time and in widely separated areas, and is supported by a concurrence of informed opinion, may not be disregarded in determining, first, whether the conditions peculiar to the business under consideration make it one in which, as in insurance companies, there is a paramount public concern; and, second, whether the regulation adopted is reasonably calculated to safeguard that interest. See Muller v. Oregon, supra, 420, 421 (28 S. Ct. 326); McLean v. Arkansas, supra.\n Examination of the various reports of public bodies and the legislation referred to can, I think, leave no doubt that the practices of the private agencies with respect to their fees presented a problem for legislative consideration different from any other that this court has passed on in ruling on the power to regulate prices, but certainly more akin to that in Munn v. Illinois, supra, and German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, supra, than to that in Tyson v. Banton, supra, and, unless we are to establish once and for all the rule that only public utilities may be \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 373]\n\u00a0\n regulated as to price, the validity of the statute at hand would seem to me to be beyond doubt. Certainly it would be difficult to show a greater necessity for price regulation.\n It is said that if there be abuses in this business, the business may be regulated but not by the fixing of reasonable prices, and that that was decided in Tyson v. Banton, supra. So far as the significant facts in that case are concerned, it bears little resemblance to this one. Ticket brokers and employment brokers are similar in name; in no other respect do they seem alike to me. To overcharge a man for the privilege of hearing the opera is one thing; to control the possibility of his earning a livelihood would appear to be quite another. And I shall not stop to argue that the state has a larger interest in seeing that its workers find employment without being imposed upon, than in seeing that its citizens are entertained. Here, too, if the business is subject to regulation, as seems to be admitted, the regulation which is appropriate and effective is some curtailment of the exorbitant fees charged and not some other form of control which would have no tendency to correct the evils aimed at.\n I cannot accept as vaild the distinction on which the opinion of the majority seems to me necessarily to depend, that granted constitutional power to regulate there is any controlling difference between reasonable regulation of price, if appropriate to the evil to be remedied, and other forms of appropriate regulation which curtail liberty of contract or the use and enjoyment of property. Obviously, even in the case of businesses affected with a public interest, other control than price regulation may be appropriate, and price regulation may be so inappropriate as to be arbitrary or unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional. To me it seems equally obvious that the Constitution does not require us to hold that a business, subject to every other form of reasonable regulation, \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 374]\n\u00a0\n is immune from the requirement of reasonable prices, where that requirement is the only remedy appropriate to the evils encountered. In this respect I can see no difference between a reasonable regulation of price and a reasonable regulation of the use of property, which affects its price or economic return. The privilege of contract and the free use of property are as seriously cut down in the one case as in the other.\n To say that there is constitutional power to regulate a business or a particular use of property because of the public interest in the welfare of a class peculiarly affected, and to deny such power to regulate price for the accomplishment of the same end, when that alone appears to be an appropriate and effective remedy, is to make a distinction based on no real economic difference, and for which I can find no warrant in the Constitution itself nor any justification in the opinions of this court.\n The price paid for property or services is only one of the terms in a bargain; the effect on the parties is similar whether the restriction on the power to contract affects the price, or the goods or services sold. Apart from the cases involving the historic public-callings, immemorially subject to the closest regulation, this court has sustained regulations of the price in cases where the Legislature fixed the charges which grain elevators, Brass v. Stoeser, supra; Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517\n, 12 S. Ct. 468; and insurance companies might make, German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, supra; or required miners to be paid per ton of coal unscreened instead of screened, McLean v. Arkansas, supra; Rail Coal Co. v. Ohio Industrial Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 338\n, 35 S. Ct. 359; or required employers who paid their men in store orders to redeem them in cash, Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, supra; Dayton Coal Co. v. Barton, \n183 \nU.S. 23\n, 22 S. Ct. 5; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224\n, 34 S. Ct. 856; or fixed the fees chargeable by attorneys appearing for injured employees before workmen's compensation commissions, \n\n[277 U.S. 350, 375]\n\u00a0\n Yeiser v. Dysart, \n267 \nU.S. 540\n, 45 S. Ct. 399; or fixed the rate of pay for overtime work, Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426\n, 37 S. Ct. 435, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1043; or fixed the time within which the services of employees must be paid for, Erie R. R. v. Williams, supra; or established maximum rents, Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 458; 16 A. L. R. 165; Marcus Brown Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S. Ct. 465; or fixed the maximum rate of interest chargeable on loans, Griffith v. Connecticut, \n218 \nU.S. 563\n, 31 S. Ct. 132. It has sustained restrictions on the other element in the bargain where Legislatures have established maximum hours of labor for men, Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n, 18 S. Ct. 383; or for women, Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412\n, 28 S. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; Hawley v. Walker, \n232 \nU.S. 718\n, 34 S. Ct. 479; Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671\n, 34 S. Ct. 469; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 \nU.S. 385\n, 35 S. Ct. 345; or prohibited the payment of wages in advance, Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169\n, 23 S. Ct. 821; Strathearn S. S. Co. v. Dillon, \n252 \nU.S. 348\n, 40 S. Ct. 350; or required loaves of bread to be of a certain size, Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 \nU.S. 578\n, 33 S. Ct. 182, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 284. In each of these cases the police power of the state was held broad enough to warrant an interference with free bargaining in cases where, despite the competition that ordinarily attends that freedom, serious evils persisted.\n Similar evils are now observed in the conduct of employment agencies. I see no reason why a state may not resort to the same remedy. There may be reasonable differences of opinion as to the wisdom of the solution here attempted. These I would be the first to admit. But a choice between them involves a step from the judicial to the legislative field. Erie R. R. v. Williams, supra, 699 (34 S. Ct. 764); German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, supra; Munn v. Illinois, supra, 132. That choice should be left where, it seems to me, it was left by the Constitution-to the states and to Congress.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As early as 1912 free employment offices were maintained by at least 15 states-Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachustts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin-and by municipalities in California, Montana, New Jersey, and Washington. The state of New York had maintained an office in New York City as early as 1896; and in Nebraska a statute providing for an office had been passed, but no appropriation had been made for its maintenance. See Statistics of Unemployment and the Work of Employment Offices, U. S. Bur. of Labor, Bull. No. 109, pp. 35, 36. The authors of the inquiry conducted for the Russell Sage Foundation reported: 'One conclusion drawn from (our) findings has been that we must have public bureaus to take the place of the private fee-charging agencies; that is, in so far as people are informed on the question and have expressed their sentiments, most of them appeared convinced that we should have public employment bureaus because of the abuses of some fee-charging agencies quite regardless of other considerations. In addition, however, the feeling has been growing that this service in the nature of the case should be free, and that the very fact of feecharging carries with it a dangerous temptation to abuse and fraud.'

No. 241 (1918) p. 6, it is declared:\n'If the private employment agencies had been conducted with ordinary honesty and efficiency, the striving for a greater degree of justice to the worker would not have been able to make any headway against the accepted doctrine of individualism, which assumes that privately conducted businesses are always preferable to publicly conducted businesses. The irregularities and abuses of the private employment agencies, however, became too notorious to be overlooked.\n\n'The charges usually preferred against private employment agencies concern the fees exacted, the practices in referring applicants to jobs, and the places where the employment agencies are frequently located. Fees for registration were, and still are, charged by many private employment agencies, although these agencies make no effort to render any service in return for the fee. If the registered applicant makes a complaint, he is asked to pay an extra fee on the promise of getting first consideration. The fees charged are oftentimes exorbitant.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Employment Bureaus, Willoughby, supra, pp. 3-4. The Act of June 19, 1906, c. 3438, 34 Stat. 304, 307, enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia, requires (section 8) a refund of one-half the fee, if a fair opportunity for employment is not secured within four days, and provides that 'the whole fee and any sums paid by the applicant for transportation in going to and returning from such employer shall be refunded within four days of demand, if no employment of the kind applied for was vacant at the place to which the applicant was directed.' \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Report of Mass.

Legislation enacted in New Jersey in 1907, which left the regulation of employment agencies to the municipalities, was found in practice to be ineffective, because of the laxity of local enforcement. Report of New Jersey Commission of Immigration, 1914, pp. 57-66.\n During a labor shortage the private agencies in New Jersey have been found to use a different device to stimulate fees artificially. After the war, many of the women drawn by it into industry failed to return to domestic work. In the consequent shortage of domestics, the agencies encouraged women to change jobs, collecting a new fee at each change. Report of New Jersey, Dept. of Labor, 1919, pp. 144-146. Section 9 of the act provided by Congress for the District of Columbia, supra, provides: 'That no such person (i. e., licensed employment agent) shall induce or attempt to induce any domestic employee to leave his employment with a view to obtaining other employment through such agency.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This practice has been reported as prevalent in reilroad building where it is known as the 'three gang system'-at any one time there is one gang, just discharged, on its way home; another at work, but on the point of being dismissed; a third, hired by the agency and on its way to the job. See Public Employment Offices, Harrison and Others, supra, p. 550. Compare Report of U. S. Bureau of Immigration, 1907, pp. 70, 71; Id., 1911, pp. 121, 122; Report of U. S.

II, pp. 321, 391-408, 443-449.\n The congressional act passed for the District of Columbia, supra, provides (section 8): 'No such licensed person shall divide fees with contractors or their agents or other employers or any one in their employ to whom applicants for employment are sent.' \n[\nFootnote 10\n] In the summer, when employment is plentiful, the fees are as low as 25 cents, and men are even referred to work free of charge. But this must necessarily be made up in winter when work is scarce. At such times, when men need work most badly, the private employment offices put up their fees, and keep the unemployed from going to work until they can pay $2, $3 , $5, and even $10 and more for their jobs. This necessity of paying for the privilege of going to work, and paying more the more urgently the job is needed, not only keeps people unnecessarily unemployed, but seems foreign to the spirit of American freedom and opportunity.'

I. p. 110. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The usual practice of the Legislatures is, of course, not to fix one fee to be charged, regardless of the type of position furnished, but to group employment offices according to their classes of clients, and promulgate different fee schedules for the different groups. See Report of Massachusetts Commission to Investigate Employment Offices, 1911, pp. 26- 28. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Some agencies have already done so.

UNITED STATES(1928)\nNo. 99\nArgued: December 1, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 331, 332]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Wm. Houston Kenyon, Archibald Cox, O. Ellery Edwards, and Douglas H. Kenyon, all of New York City, and Joseph W. Cox, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 331, 335]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Anchor Company, brought under the Act of June 25, 1910 (chapter 423, 36 Stat. 851 (35 USCA  68; Comp. St.  9465)), as amended July 1, 1918 (chapter 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705), to recover for the infringement of letters patent No. 1,228,120 for a cargo beam, granted May 29, 1917, to Melchior Lenke, and assigned by Lenke to Thomas E. Chappell, and by Chappell to the Anchor Company.\n The Court of Claims first decided that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the United States. Thereafter the court made a second decision, on December 7, 1925, in which it found as an additional fact that, through the contractors who manufactured for the United States, the United States had installed, on or before January 1, 1919, 810 cargo beams covered by the Lenke patent, and that it did not thereafter install any more; that the use of the Lenke cargo beams by the United States resulted in a saving in the expense of installation of cargo beams used by it, amounting in the case of each beam to 2,000 pounds of metal, with a value of 6 1\/2 cents per pound; that the single advantage which the United States gained by the use of the beams was the saving in cost of the same and the convenience resulting from their novelty.\n Upon the additional findings of fact, the government contended that the former judgment should be set aside, \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n and a new one entered dismissing the plaintiff's petition, for the reason that the assignment of the claims for infringement to the plaintiff was void and of no effect under section 3477 of the Revised Statutes (31 USCA  203). The Court of Claims on the second hearing yielded to this contention and dismissed the petition.\n A cargo beam is a beam employed in combination with other elements to carry the weight of cargo to be removed from the hold of vessels alongside a pier or wharf and deposited on the pier or in the warehouses fronting on the same. Such beams are old and have been used for years. The method existing prior to this invention was the use of two channel beams, spaced several inches apart, firmly riveted together at the top and bottom by means of angle irons or plates, and rigidly affixed at either end to two uprights extending upward through the roof of the warehouse in brackets designed for the purpose. The record showed that a beam adaptable for the purpose weighed 3,300 pounds, and must possess the full strength of withstanding the pull of cargo weights from both a vertical and diagonal angle.\n Lenke conceived the idea of substituting for the fixed beam a single I-beam of about 1,300 pounds in weight. At each end of the I-beam he attached laterally a strong bar, by means of rivets and angle irons, providing holes near its upper and, through which holes he introduced pivots, thereby enabling the cargo beam to swing into any angle from which the load was applied. Lenke fastened U-bolts into the center or neutral zone of the beam to receive the hoisting tackle. The real worth of the invention lay in the lightness of the cargo beam he used, because the operator could present it so as to make the strain on the beam to be vertical, even when force was applied from an angle.\n The patent was a combination patent, and in view of the prior art was limited to the exact terms of the \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 339]\n\u00a0\n claims, which made it quite narrow, as its course through the Pattent Office clearly demonstrated.\n It is argued, on behalf of the United States, that Lenke's invention was unpatentable, because it embodied nothing more than a natural and normal modification of existing ideas. Such modifications and their advantage were all very clear after the fact; but the old beams had been in use for a number of years, and a heavy weight of metal had been used, when, by Lenke's device, it was cut down two-thirds. Lenke's cargo beam almost universally superseded the old one. The United States used it, and it was installed in nearly every pier in the country. No one else had foreseen its advantage. Lenke offered it as a solution of the problem at a minimum cost with a maximum efficiency. The United States conceded in the Court of Claims that Lenke's patent was novel, in the sense that there was nothing in the prior art exactly like it, and that it was useful. While thus, in a way, he improved an existing idea, he developed a new idea. The question of its patentability was worked out in the Court of Claims, and all the judges concurred in upholding its validity, and did not change their conclusion in the second judgment. We see no reason for differing from that conclusion.\n The Court of Claims based its second judgment against the plaintiff on the strength of section 3477 of the United States Revised Statutes, as construed by this court in Brothers v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 88, 89\n, 39 S. Ct. 426. The section reads as follows:\n'All transfers and assignments made of any claim upon the United States, or of any part or share thereof, or interest therein, whether absolute or conditional, and whatever may be the consideration therefor, and all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof, shall be absolutely null and void, unless they are freely made and executed in the presence of at least two attest- \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 340]\n\u00a0\n ing witnesses, after the allowance of such a claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof. Such transfers, assignments, and powers of attorney, must recite the warrant for payment, and must be acknowledged by the person making them, before an officer having authority to take acknowledgments of deed, and shall be certified by the officer; and it must appear by the certificate that the officer, at the time of the acknowledgment, read and fully explained the transfer, assignment, or warrant of attorney to the person acknowledging the same.'\n\n In the Brothers Case, Mr. Justice Pitney said the claim of Brothers for compensation for a patent he had secured by assignment could not apply to an 'unliquidated claim against the government arising prior to the time he became the owner of the patent. Rev. St.  3477.'\n Counsel for the petitioner here insist that this statement was not necessary to the decision because the conclusion in that case was clearly made to depend on the noninfringement of the patent and that the reference to section 3477 could only be regarded as obiter dictum. It does not make a reason given for a conclusion in a case obiter dictum, because it is only one of two reasons for the same conclusion. It is true that in this case the other reason was more dwelt upon and perhaps it was more fully argued and considered than section 3477, but we cannot hold that the use of the section in the opinion is not to be regarded as authority, except by directly reversing the decision in that case on that point, which we do not wish to do.\n An elaborate argument has been made to show that the section should not apply to the assignment of claims for infringements of a patent, for the reason that a claim for infringements is not a common-law chose in action, but grows out of rights created by the statutes covering patents; the provisions for their assignment and for suits by \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 341]\n\u00a0\n the assignee are to be found in sections 4898, 4919, 4921 (35 USCA  47, 67, 70; Comp. St.  9444, 9464, 9467), and other related sections. Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, \n261 \nU.S. 24, 42\n, 43 S., 43 S. Ct. 254. But there is no conflict between the patent sections and section 3477. The latter section was passed to protect the government and prevent frauds upon the Treasury. Western Pac. R. Co. v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 271, 275\n, 45 S. Ct. 503; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 655, 657\n, 41 S. Ct. 611; Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 \nU.S. 556, 559\n, 560 S.. And it would seem that the danger of exploiting and harrassing the government with the use of assignments of claims for patent infringement was within the general purpose of that section.\n We come, then, to the question whether section 3477 and the Brothers Case apply to the case before us, and that requires an interpretation of the amending act of 1918, and its operation upon the rights of the assignee and owner of the patent and its claims for infringement. Exceptions to the general language of section 3477 have been recognized by this court, because not within the evil at which the statute aimed. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, supra; Western Pac. R. Co. v. United States, supra; Goodman v. Niblack, supra; Price v. Forrest, \n173 U.S. 410\n, 421-423, 19 S. Ct. 434; Parrington v. Davis (D. C.) 285 F. 741, 742. We think that the situation created by the provisions of the amending act of 1918 is such that section 3477 does not apply to all of the assigned claims of the petitioners for infringement under that act. The Act of June 25, 1910 (chapter 423, 36 Stat. 851), provided that, whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States should hereafter be used by the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use the same, such owner might recover reasonable compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims. The act contained a number of provisos, only one of which is important here, namely, that in any such suit the \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 342]\n\u00a0\n United States might avail itself of any and all defenses, general or special, which might be pleaded by a defendant in an action for an infringement, as set forth in title 60 of the Revised Statutes or otherwise.\n This court held March 4, 1918, in Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Bldg. Co. v. International Curtis Marine Turbine Co., \n246 \nU.S. 28, 42\n, 45 S., 38 S. Ct. 271, that the act of 1910 did not effect a license to the United States or the contractor, making the patented device, to make or use the invention, and that the contractor could be sued for an injunction and for infringement in spite of the operation of that act.\n On April 20, 1918, the Acting Secretary of the Navy wrote a letter to the chairman of the committee on naval affairs of the Senate, in which he said, referring to the Cramp Case, that the department was-\n'confronted with a difficult situation as the result of a recent decision by the Supreme Court affecting the government's rights as to the manufacture and use of patented inventions, and it seems necessary that amendment be made of the Act of June 25, 1910. ... The decision is, in effect, so far as it is of importance here, that a contractor for the manufacture of a patented article for the government is not exempt, unless he is only a contributory infringer, from injunction and other interference through litigation by the patentee.\n\n'A prior decision of the Supreme Court, that in the case of Crozier v. Krupp (\n224 \nU.S. 290\n, 32 S. Ct. 488), had been interpreted as having the opposite meaning and the department was able up to the time of the later decision, on March 4th last, to proceed satisfactorily with the procuring of such patented articles as it needed, leaving the matter of compensation to patentees for adjustment by direct agreement, or, if necessary, by resort to the Court of Claims under the above-mentioned act of 1910. Now, however, manufacturers are exposed to expensive litigation, involving the possibilities of prohibitive injunction payment of royalties, rendering of accounts, and payment of punitive damages, and they \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 343]\n\u00a0\n are reluctant to take contracts that may bring such severe consequences. The situation promised serious disadvantage to the public interests, and in order that vital activities of this department may not be restricted unduly at this time, and also with a view of enabling dissatisfied patentees to obtain just and adequate compensation in all cases conformably to the declared purpose of said act, I have the honor to request that the act be amended by the insertion of a proper provision therefor in the pending naval appropriation bill.'\n\n In response to this communication, the act of 1918, amending the act of 1910, was adopted. See Wood v. Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co. (D. C.) 296 F. 718, 720, 721, and Congressional Record, 65th Congress, Second Session, Proceedings of June 18, 1918, p. 7961. The amendment (chapter 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705) reads as follows:\n'That whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used or manufactured by or for the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same, such owner's remedy shall be by suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture.'\n\n This is followed by the same provisos as in the act of 1910, which need not be repeated here.\n The purpose of the amendment was to relieve the contractor entirely from liability of every kind for the infringement of patents in manufacturing anything for the government, and to limit the owner of the patent and his assigns and all claiming through or under him to suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture. The word 'entire' emphasizes the exclusive and comprehensive character of the remedy provided. As the Solicitor General says in his \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 344]\n\u00a0\n brief with respect to the act, it is more than a waiver of immunity and effects an assumption of liability by the government.\n Under the act of 1910, the remedy of the owner of a patent, where the United States had used the invention without his license or lawful right to use it, was to sue for reasonable compensation in the Court of Claims, and that remedy was open to Lenke for the cargo beams covered by his patent, installed and used by the United States before July 1, 1918\n\n\n The evidence does not show at what time during the year 1918 the beams were installed. The first finding is that Lenke wrote to an officer in the Quartermaster's Department on duty at the army supply base at Brooklyn, on December 31, 1918, complaining that the Lenke cargo beam was being used by the government at that supply base without permission from the patentee, but nothing happened but a fruitless correspondence.\n The findings of the Court of Claims show that, on January 1, 1919, 810 of the beams had been installed at the instance of the government, but how many were installed after July 1, 1918, when the law in question was passed, has not been found by the Court of Claims.\n On September 29, 1920, the Lenke patent was assigned by Lenke to one Thomas E. Chappell, who in turn on March 7, 1921, assigned it to the plaintiff company, in accordance with the statute, and the assignment in each case covered all rights of action for past infringements of the patent and all rights to recoveries by suit for damages, profits, and royalties for infringements of every kind whatsoever.\n It is settled that, but for the act of 1918, the two assignments vesting title in the Anchor Company would enable it to recover from the contractor for all his infringements. Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, supra; Gordon v. Anthony, 16 Blatchf. 234, Fed. \n\n[275 U.S. 331, 345]\n\u00a0\n Cas. No. 5,605; Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252, 256\n, 261 S., 11 S. Ct. 334; Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494; Robinson on Patents, vol. 3,  937, p. 122. If now section 3477 applies, and these assignments are rendered void, the effect of the act of 1918 is to take away from the assignee and present owner, not only the cause of action against the government, but also to deprive it of the cause of action against the infringing contractor for injury by his infringement. The intention and purpose of Congress in the act of 1918 was to stimulate contractors to furnish what was needed for the war, without fear of becoming liable themselves for infringements to inventors or the owners or assignees of patents. The letter of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, upon which the act of 1918 was passed, leaves no doubt that this was the occasion for it. To accomplish this governmental purpose, Congress exercised the power to take away the right of the owner of the patent to recover from the contractor for infringements. This is not a case of a mere declared immunity of the government from liability for its own torts. It is an attempt to take away from a private citizen his lawful claim for damage to his property by another private person, which but for this act he would have against the private wrongdoer. This result, if section 3477, Rev. Stat., applies and avoids the assignment, would seem to raise a serious question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1918 under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. We must presume that Congress in the passage of the act of 1918 intended to secure to the owner of the patent the exact equivalent of what it was taking away from him. It was taking away his assignable claims against the contractor for the latter's infringement of his patent. The assignability of such claims was an important element in their value and a matter to be taken into account in providing for their just equivalent. If section 3477 applied, such equivalence was impossible.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 331, 346]\n\u00a0\n It is our duty in the interpretation of federal statutes to reach a conclusion which will avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality. Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341\n, 47 S. Ct. 611. Moreover, we should seek to carry out in our dealing with the act of 1918 and Revised Statutes,  3477, the very important congressional purpose of the former, as already explained, in the promotion of the war as a special legislative intent. It is our duty to give effect to that special intent, although it be not in harmony with a broad purpose manifested in a general statute avoiding assignment of claims against the government enacted some 80 years ago. In re Rouse, Hazard & Co. (C.C. A.) 91 F. 96, 100, 101; Townsend v. Little, \n109 \nU.S. 504, 512\n, 3 S. Ct. 357; Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 428\n, 35 S. Ct. 119. This is in accord with general rules of interpretation, as shown in these authorities, and reconciles the section 3477, Revised Statutes, and the act of 1918, if we hold, as we do, that section 3477 does not apply to the assignment of a claim against the United States which is created by the act of 1918, in so far as the act deprives the owner of the patent of a remedy against the infringing private contractor for infringements thereof and makes the government indemnitor for its manufacturer or contractor in his infringements.\n Such a conclusion requires us to reverse the case and remand it to the Court of Claims for additional findings to show how many of the patented beams were made by contractors and furnished to the United States after the passage of the Act of July 1, 1918, and what would have been a reasonable royalty therefor.\n The question of the amount of or the rule for measuring the recovery we do not decide, but leave that for further argument and consideration by the Court of Claims, because of the novel and only partial application of section 3477, Rev. Stat.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROCHE v. MCDONALD(1928)\nNo. 38\nArgued: October 14, 1927Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lucius G. Nash and Beverly Clarke Mosby, both of Spokane, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. G. Graves, of Spokane, Wash., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error is brought to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington which is challenged on the ground that the full faith and credit prescribed by section 1 of article 4 of the Constitution was not given to a judgment of a court of the State of Oregon on which the plaintiff in error relied. As this does not present a ground for the writ of error under section 237 (a) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Jurisdictional Act of 1925, 1 this writ is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. But since the papers show adequate reason for invoking a review by a petition for certiorari, that writ is granted,2 and we proceed to the consideration of the case on the merits.\n The parties to this suit have been for many years residents of Washington. On June 24, 1918, one Dart recovered a judgment for $12,500 against McDonald in a superior court of Washington. In February, 1924, Dart assigned this judgment to Roche. In March MeDonald being then temporarily employed in Oregon, Roche brought suit against him upon this judgment in a circuit court of that State. He was personally served with a summons, appeared and demurred to the complaint. This demurrer was overruled. He then elected to plead no further and did not answer the complaint. Subsequently, in October, 1924-more than six years after the rendition of the Washington judgment-judgment was rendered \n\n[275 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n against him in default of answer for the amount of the original judgment, with interest.\n Shortly thereafter Roche brought this suit against McDonald, upon the Oregon judgment, in the superior court of Washington. McDonald answered, denying the validity of the Oregon judgment under a Washington statute which provided that after six years from the rendition of any judgment it should cease to be a charge against the judgment debtor, and no suit should be had extending its duration or continuing it in force beyond such six years. \n3\n Roche replied, setting up and relying upon the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution.\n The superior court entered judgment for McDonald. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Washington, which held that under the Washington statute the original judgment expired at the end of six years from its rendition and could not be extended by another suit; that having been rendered when the original judgment had become a nullity, the Oregon judgment had no legal foundation, and, as it would have been void and of no effect if rendered under like circumstances by a court of Washington, could be given no force or effect when sued upon in Washington; and that under the due faith and credit clause the courts of Washington 'are not bound to give full faith and credit to the Oregon judgment according to its literal terms, but are privileged and have the duty to view that judgment in the light of the foundation upon which it rests and the judgment law of our own state.' 136 Wash. 322, 239 P. 1015, 44 A. L. R. 444.\n It is settled by repeated decisions of this Court that the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution requires that the judgment of a State court which had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter in suit, shall be given in the courts of every other State the same credit, validity and effect which it has in the State where it was \n\n[275 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n rendered, and be equally conclusive upon the merits; and that only such defenses as would be good to a suit thereon in that State can be relied on in the courts of any other State. Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 481, 484; Hampton v. McConnel, 3 Wheat. 234, 235; D'Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165, 175; Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 123; Hancock National Bank v.

This rule is applicable where a judgment in one State is based upon a cause of action which arose in the State in which it is sought to be enforced, as well as in other cases; and the judgment, if valid where rendered, must be enforced in such other State although repugnant to its own statutes. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 302; Fruntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 231, 236\n, 28 S. Ct. 641; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 371, 10 A. L. R. 716.\n In Christmas v. Russell, supra, the defendant, a resident of Mississippi, executed there a promissory note, which was endorsed by the payee to the plaintiff, a resident of Kentucky. After action on this note had been barred by the Mississippi statute of limitation, the defendant having come into Kentucky on a visit, was there sued on the note. His defense on the statute of limitations of Mississippi was overruled, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff. The plaintiff then brought suit upon this Kentucky judgment in the Federal Circuit Court of Mississippi, where the defendant made defense under another statute of Mississippi, which provided that no action should be maintained on any judgment rendered against a resident of the State by any court without the State where the cause of action would have been barred by limitation if the suit had been brought within the State. The defense was overruled, and judgment entered for the plaintiff. This was affirmed here on the ground that under the full faith and credit clause this Mississippi statute was unconstitutional and void as affecting the right of the plaintiff to enforce the \n\n[275 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky judgment; the Court saying that since that judgment was valid in Kentucky and conclusive between the parties there, it was not competent for any other State to authorize its courts to open the merits and review the cause, or to enact that such a judgment should not receive the same faith and credit that by law it had in the courts of the State from which it was taken.\n In Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, the original cause of action arose in Mississippi out of a gambling contract in cotton futures. The laws of Mississippi made dealing in futures a misdemeanor, and provided that such contracts should 'not be enforced by any court.' The controversy had been submitted to arbitration, and an award made against the defendant. Thereafter, finding the defendant temporarily in Missouri, the plaintiff brought suit there upon the award. The court refused to allow the defendant to show the nature of the transaction and its illegality under the laws of Mississippi, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. Suit was then brought upon this Missouri judgment in a court of Mississippi. Judgment was entered for the defendant which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. This Court, in reversing that judgment, said:\n'The doctrine laid down by Chief Justice Marshall was 'that the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect in every other court in the United States, which it had in the State where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such State, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court of the United States.' Hampton v. McConnel, 3 Wheat. 234 (4 L. Ed. 378). ... Whether the award would or would not have been conclusive, and whether the ruling of the Missouri court upon that matter was right or wrong, there can be no question that the judgment was conclusive in Missouri on the validity of the cause of action. ... A judgment is conclusive as to all the media concludendi, United States v. California \n\n[275 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n & Oregon Land Co., \n192 U.S. 355\n (24 S. Ct. 266); and it needs no authority to show that it cannot be impeached either in or out of the State by showing that it was based upon a mistake of law. Of course a want of jurisdiction over either the person or the subject-matter might be shown. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n (23 S. Ct. 237); Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 U.S. 186\n (20 S. Ct. 873). But as the jurisdiction of the Missouri court is not open to dispute the judgment cannot be impeached in Mississippi even if it went upon a misapprehension of the Mississippi law.'\n\n This case was cited and followed in American Express Co. v. Mullins, \n212 \nU.S. 311, 314\n, 29 S. Ct. 381, 15 Ann. Cas. 536, holding that under the full faith and credit clause a judgment in one State was conclusive as to all the media concludendi, an could not be impeached in another State by showing that it was based upon a mistake of law.\n In Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, supra, a suit was brought in Illinois upon an Alabama judgment based upon a cause of action which under an Illinois statute could not be brought or prosecuted in that State. This Court, in holding that the Illinois statute was repugnant to the full faith and credit clause, said:\n'In Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 U.S. 230\n (28 S. Ct. 641) it was held that the courts of Mississippi were bound to enforce a judgment rendered in Missouri upon a cause of action arising in Mississippi and illegal and void there. The policy of Mississippi was more actively contravened in that case than the policy of Illinois is in this. Therefore the fact that here the original cause of action could not have been maintained in Illinois is not an answer to a suit upon the judgment. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 (18 L. Ed. 475); Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n (32 S. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292).'\n\n The Fauntleroy Case is directly controlling here. The court of Oregon had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter of the suit. Its judgment was valid and conclusive in that State. The objection made to enforce- \n\n[275 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n ment of that judgment in Washington is, in substance, that it must there be denied validity because it contravenes the Washington statute and would have been void if rendered in a court of Washington; that is, in effect, that it was based upon an error of law. It cannot be impeached upon that ground. If McDonald desired to rely upon the Washington statute as a protection from any judgment that would extend the force of the Washington judgment beyond six years from its rendition, he should have set up that statute in the court of Oregon and submitted to that court the question of its construction and effect. And even if this had been done, he could not thereafter have impeached the validity of the judgment because of a misapprehension of the Washington law. In short, the Oregon judgment, being valid and conclusive between the parties in that State, was equally conclusive in the courts of Washington, and under the full faith and credit clause should have been enforced by them.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is reversed; and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Writ of error dismissed; certiorari granted; reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 43 Stat. 936, c. 229 (28 USCA  344); printed as an Appendix to the Revised Rules of this Court, \n266 U.S. 687\n. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 237(c) of the Judicial Code, as amended. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Laws 1897, c. 39; Remington's Compiled Statutes,  459, 160. \n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSACKLEY v.

Holt, both of Boston, Mass., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 260, 265]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin H. Abbot, Jr., and Arthur D. Hill, both of Boston, for defendants in error.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 260, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error are beneficiaries of a trust created by deed of Peter C. Brooks. After the death of the settlor the trustees, who, with certain Massachusetts tax officials, are defendants in error, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts a petition for instructions which joined the beneficiaries of the trust and the officials as respondents, and asked a determination that the Massachusetts statutes taxing inheritances did not affect the property passing to the beneficiaries under the trust, or, if applicable, were 'unconstitutional.' The beneficiaries joined in the prayer of the bill and it was opposed by the state officials. The Supreme Judicial Court held the taxing acts applicable and valid. We may disregard the ambiguity of the trustees' contention below that the statutes were 'unconstitutional,' in so far as the state court understood that the Federal Constitution was the basis for the objection and in its opinion sustained the statutes under that instrument. Cissna v. Tennessee, 246 U. S. \n\n[276 U.S. 260, 268]\n\u00a0\n 289, 38 S. Ct. 306; compare Miedreich v. Lauenstein, \n232 \nU.S. 236\n, 34 S. Ct. 309. To that extent the case is properly here on writ of error. Judicial Code,  237(a), being 28 USCA  344 (Comp. St.  1214).\n In brief and argument here plaintiffs in error have stated various constitutional objections to the taxing acts. But as on the record none of them before the Supreme Judicial Court appear to have been based on the Federal Constitution, we consider only the single objection discussed as a federal question by that court in its opinion, viz., that the statutes as applied deprive plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law because retroactive as to them.\n On various dates between 1905 and 1907 Peter C. Brooks by indenture transferred to the trustees, defendants in error, or their predecessors, certain property upon trust, to pay the income to him for life or, at his option, to allow it to accumulate, and upon the death of himself and his wife to pay the income to his children, the plaintiffs in error, without any liability for their debts and without power of alienation or anticipation, with gifts over.\n The trust instrument provided that its terms might be changed and the trust terminated in whole or in part by Peter C. Brooks, with the concurrence of one trustee. Before his death, on January 27, 1920, the trust was in fact thrice altered, the last time in 1919 by providing that during the life of Peter C. Brooks the income should be accumulated and added to the principal, so that from that date his interest in the trust was terminated, except for the power with one trustee to alter or terminate it.\n At the time of the several transfers there were no Massachusetts statutes imposing an inheritance or transfer tax upon property passing to children, but before the death of Peter C. Brooks the statutes now assailed were enacted. By St. Mass. 1909, c. 527,  8, printed in the \n\n[276 U.S. 260, 269]\n\u00a0\n margin,1 the transfer of property passing to any one on the exercise of a power of appointment or the failure to exercise it is made taxable as though a disposition or transfer of property taxable under the provisions of the statute taxing inheritances. St. Mass. 1907, c. 563.\n St. Mass. 1916, c. 268,  1, amending St. Mass. 1907, c. 563,  1, as amended, imposes a tax on all property passing by will, intestate succession, or gift 'made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or donor.' By section 4 of this act the tax is made applicable only to property or interests therein 'passing or accruing upon the death of persons who die subsequently to the passage hereof.'\n In this and earlier cases the Massachusetts court has held that the tax authorized by these statutes is a tax upon 'succession' which includes the 'privilege enjoyed by the beneficiary of succeeding to the possession and enjoyment of property.' See Attorney General v. Stone, 209 Mass. 186, 190, 95 N. E. 395; Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Mass. 113, 124, 38 N. E. 512, 26 L. R. A. 259; Crocker v. Shaw, 174 Mass. 266, 267, 54 N. E. 549. It has held \n\n[276 U.S. 260, 270]\n\u00a0\n also that the provisions of the trust instrument for change or termination of the trust by Peter C. Brooks with the consent of one trustee created a power of appointment within the meaning of St. Mass. 1909, c. 527,  8, and that the nonexercise of the reserved power in Brooks' lifetime as well as the fact that the interest of the beneficiaries took effect 'in possession or enjoyment' after his death within the meaning of St. Mass. 1916, c. 268,  1, required the imposition of the tax as of the date of his death upon the entire interest in the trust passing to the plaintiffs in error. This construction of the statutes by the state court we accept, Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454; Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 27 S. Ct. 550, as we do its construction of the trust deed. Nickel v. Cole, \n256 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 41 S. Ct. 467; Moffitt v. Kelly, \n218 \nU.S. 400\n, 31 S. Ct. 79, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1179\n\n\n The plaintiffs in error contend that as interpreted the statutes deprive them of property without due process because they are taxed on an interest they had already received before the enactment of the taxing acts. It is said that they had vested interests or remainders subject only to being divested by the exercise of the reserved power, which never happened; that as their remainders vested before the enactment of the taxing statutes these cannot constitutionally be applied to them under the rule laid down by this court in Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710.\n In Nichols v. Coolidge it was held that under the estate tax sections of the Revenue Act of 1919 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/4 b-6336 3\/4 d, 6336 3\/4 i, 6336 3\/4 j)-which tax the privilege of transmission, Nichols v. Coolidge, supra; New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660-property of which a donor had made an outright conveyance several years before the enactment of the statute could not, on his death after its enactment, be included as part of his taxable gross estate at its value at the time of his death. But we are here concerned, not with a tax on the privilege of \n\n[276 U.S. 260, 271]\n\u00a0\n transmission, not with an attempt to tax a donor's estate for an absolute gift made when no tax was thought of, and to do so at the probably appreciated value which the gift now bears, but with a tax on the privilege of succession, which also may constitutionally be subjected to a tax by the state whether occasioned by death, Stebbins v. Riley, supra, or effected by deed, Keeney v. New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139; Chanler v. Kelsey, supra; Nickel v. Cole, supra. The present tax is not laid on the donor, but on the beneficiary; the gift taxed is not one long since completed, but one which never passed to the beneficiaries beyond recall until the death of the donor; and the value of the gift at that operative moment, rather than at some later date, is the basis of the tax.\n So long as the privilege of succession has not been fully exercised it may be reached by the tax. See Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 543\n, 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215; Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S. Ct. 213; Chanler v. Kelsey, supra; Moffitt v. Kelly, supra; Nickel v. Cole, supra. And in determining whether it has been so exercised technical distinctions between vested remainders and other interests are of little avail, for the shifting of the economic benefits and burdens of property, which is the subject of a succession tax, may even in the case of a vested remainder be restricted or suspended by other legal devices. A power of appointment reserved by the donor leaves the transfer, as to him, incomplete and subject to tax. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473. The beneficiary's acquisition of the property is equally incomplete whether the power be reserved to the donor or another. And so the property passing to the beneficiaries here was acquired only because of default in the exercise of the power during the donor's life and thus was on his death subject to the state's power to tax as an inheritance.\n Without considering the other statutes involved, we need not go further than to say that the statute of 1909, \n\n[276 U.S. 260, 272]\n\u00a0\n imposing the tax because of the failure to exercise the power of appointment, does not deprive plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 8. Whenever any person shall exercise a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made prior to September first, nineteen hundred and seven, such appointment when made shall be deemed to be a disposition of property by the person exercising such power, taxable under the provisions of chapter five hundred and sixty- three of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and seven, and of all acts in amendment thereof and in addition thereto, in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had been bequeathed or devised by the donee by will; and whenever any person possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a disposition of property taxable under the provisions of chapter five hundred and sixty-three of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and seven and all acts in amendment thereof and in addition thereto shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omission of failure. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITY MORTGAGE CO. v. POWERS(1928)\nNo. 32\nArgued: October 12, 1928Decided: December 10, 1928\n\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John E. Benton, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter S. Dillon, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Florida Furniture Company was adjudicated bankrupt in the Southern district of Florida. Among its assets was real estate in Georgia, acquired by purchase from the Hanson Motor Company. An ancillary receiver appointed in the Northern district of Georgia took possession of this property. It was subject to a loan deed (see Scott v. Paisley, \n271 \nU.S. 632\n, 46 S. Ct. 591) given to secure notes of the Hanson Company for $90,000 and interest, which the furniture company had assumed and agreed to pay. The trustee in bankruptcy applied for leave to sell the property free from the lien. The secured notes were held at the time of the adjudication and thereafter by the Security Mortgage Company. An order was served upon it to show cause why the trustees' application should not be granted. It appeared, but made no opposition. Leave to sell was granted, preserving to the lien creditor its rights in the proceeds of the sale. Under that order, the property was sold, and the mortgage company became the purchaser at a price exceeding the amount of all liens. It asked to be allowed as a credit against the purchase price, among other things, the sum of $9,442.40 for attorney's fees.\n The secured indebtedness was represented by a principal note and 10 coupon interest notes. Each note contained the following clause:\n'With interest after maturity until paid at eight per cent. per annum with all costs of collection, including ten per cent. as attorney's fees, if collected by law or through an attorney at law.'\n\n So far as appears, the mortgage company did not employ \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n an attorney until after it had been served with the order to show cause, on the trustee's application for leave to sell the property. There had been no default before the adjudication. Thereafter, a coupon interest note matured and was not paid. Before the leave to sell was granted, the mortgage company, because of this default, gave notice to the Hanson Company of its election to declare the principal note due. It also gave to the Hanson Company notice in writing that it intended to bring suit in the city court of Atlanta and to claim the attorney's fees, unless the indebtedness was paid. Twelve days later, the mortgage company brought such a suit against the Hanson Company, without attempting to join the bankrupt, the receiver or the trustee. It does not appear that notice of the acceleration of the principal note, or of the intention to sue, or of the bringing of the suit against the Hanson Company was given to the bankrupt, the trustee, or the receiver. Prior to the sale of the property by the trustee, judgment was entered against the Hanson Company for the principal and interest and for $9,442.40 attorney's fees. That judgment declared those amounts to be a special lien upon the property.\n Over the objection of the trustee, the claim for attorney's fees was allowed by the referee as a credit against the purchase price. The District Judge disallowed it without writing an opinion. The certificate of the referee set forth the facts, and the parties stipulated that the 'certificate contains all of the facts necessary to a clear understanding of the issue made on appeal to the Circuit Court' of Appeals. That court affirmed the judgment. 21 F.(2d) 965. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n276 \nU.S. 610\n, 48 S. Ct. 214. Whether disallowance of the credit for attorney's fees was error is the sole question for decision. \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n Under section 67 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  107) the trustee takes property subject to valid liens existing at the time of the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings. The mortgage company makes no contention that the judgment in the state court establishes as res judicata either the claim for attorney's fees or the existence of the lien therefor. It concedes that by no action in the state court, and by no act of the mortgage company, could a lien be attached to the property after it had passed to the trustee (see Murphy v. Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562\n, 29 S. Ct. 154), and that the bankruptcy court must determine for itself whether a lien exists and the amount of the indebtedness secured thereby (see Hebert v. Crawford, \n228 \nU.S. 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 484; Chicago Board of Trade v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 44 S. Ct. 232). The proceedings in the state court are relied upon merely to show compliance with the condition which section 4252 of the Georgia Code makes a prerequisite to the enforcement of any contract to pay attorney's fees. See Stone v. Marshall & Co., 137 Ga. 544, 73 S. E. 826; Turner v. Peacock, 153 Ga. 870, 879, 113 S. E. 585.\n The provision of the Georgia Code is this:\n'Obligations to any attorney's fees upon any note or other evidence of indebtedness, in addition to the rate of interest specified therein, are void, and no court shall enforce such agreement to pay attorney's fees, unless the debtor shall fail to pay such debt on or before the return day of the court to which suit is brought for the collection of the same: Provided, the holder of the obligation sued upon, his agent, or attorney notifies the defendant in writing, ten days before suit is brought, of his intention to bring suit, and also the term of the court to which suit will be brought.'\n\n The validity of the lien claimed by the mortgage company for attorney's fees must be determinated by the law of Georgia; for the contract was there made and was secured by real estate there situate. Humphrey \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n v. Tatman, \n198 \nU.S. 91\n, 25 S. Ct. 567. See Benedict v. Ratner, \n268 \nU.S. 353, 359\n, 45 S. Ct. 566. The construction of the contract for attorney's fees presents, likewise, a question of local law. See Farmers' & M. Bank v. Fed. Reserve Bank, \n262 \nU.S. 649, 660\n, 43 S. Ct. 651, 30 A. L. R. 635. Whether the liability is, under the circumstances, enforceable against the proceeds of the sale raises federal questions peculiar to the law of bankruptcy. The character of the obligation to pay attorney's fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in bankruptcy, either as a provable claim or by way of a lien upon specific property. The obligation is held to be enforceable by action in personam in the federal courts for Georgia, Perry v. John Hancock Life Insurance Co. (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 250.\n The mortgage company contends that, although the collection of the note was made not through the suit in the state court, but through the uncontested sale in the bankruptcy court, it should be deemed a collection 'by law or through an attorney' within the meaning of the contract. Many decisions of the courts of the state lend support to that contention. They hold that attorney's fees are recoverable, not like costs as an incident of the suit, but as a part of the principal debt;1 that by the giving of notice of intention to sue, the commencement of the suit and the failure of the debtor to pay on or before the return day, a vested right arises which a later payment of the debt could not affect;2 that the liability for attorney's fees is not dependent upon the collection having been made through a suit brought in compliance with the Code; 3 and that it may be enforced against the \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n land held as security; although the debtor has become insolvent, McCall v. Herring, 116 Ga. 235, 238, 239, 42 S. E. 468; or the property has passed to an administrator, Harris v. Powers, 129 Ga. 74, 58 S. E. 1038, 12 Ann. Cas. 475; or to a receiver, Guarantee Trust & Banking Co. v. American National Bank, 15 Ga. App. 778, 782-784, 84 S. E. 222.4 The trustee does not question that the Hanson Company became personally liable for the attorney's fees, despite the proceedings taken in bankruptcy. His objections go only to the enforcement of the liability against the proceeds of the property sold.\n First. The trustee contends that the credit for the attorney's fees was precluded by provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. He insists that, at the time of the adjudication, the liability was contingent, since at the time there had not been any default; and under section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act ( 11 USCA  103) a contingent claim is not provable. \n5\n But the mortgage company does not seek to prove the claim in bankruptcy. It asks to have it allowed as a part of the principal debt, which is secured by a lien upon the property sold. The federal courts for Georgia have, in a series of cases, refused to permit this to be done, on the ground that the liability was contingent at the time of the adjudi- \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n cation. See In re Weiland (D. C.) 197 F. 116; In re Ledbetter (D. C.) 267 F. 893; In re Hotel Equipment Co. (D. C.) 297 F. 842, 845; In re Stamps (D. C.) 300 F. 162. Compare In re Gimbel (C. C. A.) 294 F. 883. We find nothing in the Bankruptcy Act to justify such a refusal. The lien was not inchoate at the time of the adjudication. It had already become perfect when the principal note and the loan deed securing it were given. Property subject to a lien to secure a liability still contingent at the time of bankruptcy is not discharged from lien by the adjudication. The secured obligation survives; and if it is that of a third person is usually unaffected by the bankruptcy. When by the happening of the event the contingent liability becomes absolute, the lien becomes enforceable,6 though this occurs after the adjudication.\n Second. The trustee contends that allowance of the credit is barred by section 67d, because the liability for attorney's fees, not having become absolute until after the adjudication, is excluded by the provision which allows outstanding liens 'to the extent of such present consideration only.' The contention has support in In re Mobile Chair Co. ( D. C.) 245 F. 211.7 But it was rejected, and we think properly, in In re Rosenblatt (D. C.) 299 F. 771. The contingent obligation to pay attorney's fees was a part of the original transaction. The consideration for the lien was not the attorney's services, but the $90,000 advanced by the mortgage company, and this was a present consideration. See Bank of Lumpkin v. Bank, 35 Ga. App. 340, 133 S. E. 307.\n Third. The trustee contends that under the Bankruptcy Act the claim must be disallowed, because, by the \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n Georgia Code, the contract was void unless and until the statutory condition had been complied with; that, consequently, at the time of the adjudication, no valid contract existed; and that the bankrupt's estate cannot be affected by a validation, equivalent to the making of a wholly new contract, occurring thereafter. This seems to be the view taken by the federal courts for Georgia. See In re Stamps (D. C.) 300 F. 162, 164. The question depends primarily upon the construction of section 4252 of the Georgia Code, and thus primarily upon the local law. The language of the statute lends some color to the trustee's contention. No case in a court of the state has been called to our attention in which consideration of this contention was had. Those which discuss the significance of the word 'void,' as used in this section, throw little light upon it. \n8\n Despite the language employed, we are of opinion that the Legislature did not contemplate validation of a void contract, but merely added a statutory condition to the written contract to pay attorney's fees.\n Fourth. Two further possible objections to the allowance of the attorney's fees are suggested. The first is lack of notice to the trustee of the action of the mortgage company which resulted in the judgment in the state court recovered against the Hanson Company. The principal note was payable in 1930, with a provision for acceleration in case of default. The mortgage company's election to declare it immediately due, for default in payment of the interest coupon, was exercised after it had been made a party to the trustee's application for leave to sell-a a proceeding which would presumably result in payment of the debt. The referee did not find whether \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n or not the mortgage company gave the trustee notice of its election to accelerate the maturity of the principal; or notice that the suit had been brought. The mortgage company then knew that the bankrupt had agreed with the Hanson Company to pay the note and that the property had become primarily liable for the debt. If it failed to give the trustee notice of the election and of the intention to bring suit, we think that it is not entitled to the credit for attorney's fees. For, if he had been notified, the trustee might have arranged to pay the note on or before the return day of the suit against the Hanson Company. The purpose of the Georgia statute is clear. It is to protect the debtor, in spite of default, from any liability for attorney's fees, unless he fails to pay after the lapse of the ten days from receiving notice of intention to sue and such further time as must intervene between the commencement of the suit and the return day. Harris v. Powers, 129 Ga. 74, 88, 58 S. E. 1038, 12 Ann. Cas. 475; Edenfield v. Bank of Millen, 7 Ga. App. 645, 648, 67 S. E. 896. The Legislature cannot have intended that the creditor should be able to impose the additional liability for attorney's fees, without giving to the real debtor the notice and opportunity to pay which the statute contemplated that a debtor should have. This objection also involves primarily a question of local law; and no decision directly in point has been found. But decisions applying the Georgia statute to somewhat similar situations support this conclusion. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. The remaining suggested objection is this: The trustee asserts that, at the time of the commencement of the suit against the Hanson Company, it was absolutely insolvent and without assets, and that the sole purpose of bringing the suit against it was to increase, by the amount of the attorney's fees, the claim payable in bankruptcy \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 159]\n\u00a0\n under the lien. It is settled that the mere fact of the debtor's insolvency under the state law does not prohibit the rendering of a judgment for attorney's fees. 'Such a condition,' says the court in Harris v. Powers, 129 Ga. 74, 86, 58 S. E. 1038, 1043 (12 Ann. Cas. 475) 'may make it more difficult, and sometimes impossible, for a creditor to realize upon his judgment; but he is not debarred from the privilege of obtaining it.' The case at bar presents, however, additional facts. It is asserted that the suit against the Hanson Company was brought, not for the purpose of collecting the debt, but solely for the purpose of enhancing the amount which was obtainable without suit, through the lien upon the proceeds of the property. If this is true, the statutory provision designed for the protection of the debtor was employed solely as a means of oppression. We will not assume, in the absence of a decision by a Georgia court, that the Legislature intended to permit such use.\n Neither of the two objections to the allowance of the credit last discussed appears to have been considered by the referee or by either of the lower courts. Nor does the certificate of the referee contain the specific findings of fact necessary to support either of them. The Court of Appeals rests its affirmance of the judgment denying the credit for attorney's fees upon provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which we hold are not applicable, or upon a construction of the Georgia statute which we deem erroneous. Under these circumstances, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, with directions to remand the case to the District Court. But the District Court shall be directed to treat the stipulation concerning the certificate as failing to include elements essential to a final adjudication; to determine whether or not either of these two objections, which we hold meritorious if sustained by the facts is so sustained; and, if so sustained, the credit for attorney's fees shall be disallowed. If the \n\n[278 U.S. 149, 160]\n\u00a0\n District Court finds that neither of said objections is so sustained, credit for the attorney's fees shall be allowed, for the amount due and secured by the lien, in conformity with this opinion. \n10\n\u00a0\n\nREVERSED.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Royal v.

Judgment was given for the plaintiff, and the case is now pending on writ of error in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. That court has certified to this questions of law concerning which it asks instructions for the proper decision of the cause. Judicial Code,  239 (28 USCA  346). \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 577]\n\u00a0\n The certificate discloses that defendants in error are the assignees of a departmental oil and gas lease of land belonging to Miller Tiger, a full blood Creek Indian. The leased land was purchased for Tiger while a minor by his guardians, with the permission of the county court of Okmulgee county, Oklahoma. The purchase price came from the accumulated royalties of a departmental lease of his restricted alloted lands. The purchase was made of a non-Indian citizen of Oklahoma and the deed, in compliance with conditions exacted by the Secretary of the Interior and the county court, provided that the land 'should not be alienated or leased during the lifetime of the grantee prior to April 26, 1931, without the consent of and approval by the Secretary of the Interior.' Before the purchase in 1915 the land had been subject to state, county, and municipal taxation. Since then local ad valorem taxes on the land have been paid without objection by the United States Indian agency. The tax now in question was levied and collected under Comp. Stat. Okl. 1921,  9814, which imposes on those engaged in the production of oil and gas a tax equal to 3 per cent. of the gross value of the oil and gas produced 'less the royalty interest.' The questions certified are as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Had the Secretary of the Interior, on October 24, 1915, when this land was purchased, power to exempt from such state taxation land purchased under his supervision for a full-blood Creek Indian with trust funds of that Indian, where the land so purchased was, at that time, subject to all state taxes?\n\n\n (2)\n Is that tax a forbidden tax upon a federal instrumentality?\n In Sunderland v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 226\n, 45 S. Ct. 64, a restriction against alienation like that in the present case imposed by the Secretary on lands purchased for a Creek \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 578]\n\u00a0\n Indian, as were Tiger's, under section 1, c. 199, of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, was held to be a valid exercise of the power of the Secretary to remove restrictions from the land of full-blood Indians 'wholly or in part, ... 'under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe.\" In an earlier case, McCurdy v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 263\n, 38 S. Ct. 289, this court had held that a similar restriction upon lands similarly purchased for an Osage Indian could not have the effect contended for there, and here, of exempting the land from state taxation for the reason that under the applicable provisions of a different statute, section 5, c. 8o, Act of April 18, 1912, 37 Stat. 86, the Secretary was without authority to impose the restriction. And, in United States v. Ransom, \n263 \nU.S. 691\n, 44 S. Ct. 230, affirming (C. C. A.) 284 F. 108, it was held, on the authority of McCurdy v. United States, supra, that the state had power to tax lands purchased for a Creek Indian citizen with restrictions against alienation imposed by the Secretary under section 1 of the Act of May 27, 1908, which was the statute later passed on in Sunderland v. United States, supra. The construction to be placed on these decisions is that the lands now in question, and hence the interest of the lessee in them, are not such instrumentalities of the government as will be declared immune from taxation in the absence of an express exemption by Congress and that the mere act of the Secretary in imposing the restriction is not the exercise of any power which may reside in Congress to exempt them from taxation.\n What governmental instrumentalities will be held free from state taxation, though Congress has not expressly so provided, cannot be determined apart from the purpose and character of the legislation creating them. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S. Ct. 172. The end sought and the mode of attaining it adopted by Congress in the legislation providing for the welfare of the Indians by setting \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 579]\n\u00a0\n apart, by allotment or otherwise, tribal lands or the public domain, restricted for their benefit, led to the conclusion that those lands and the uses of them were so intimately connected with the performance of governmental functions as clearly to require independence of all state control so complete that nothing short of an express declaration by Congress would have subjected them to state taxation.\n Governmental agencies similarly held to be exempt are national banks, First National Bank of Hartford v. Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548\n, 47 S. Ct. 462; bonds of the national government, Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 467. Such were and still are the restricted allotted or tribal lands of the Indians. Neither leases of those lands, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453; nor the exploitation of the land by the lessee, Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., \n247 \nU.S. 503\n, 38 S. Ct. 426; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, \n248 \nU.S. 549\n, 39 S. Ct. 183; Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S. Ct. 592; nor his income from the lease, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, may be taxed by the state.\n The early legislation affecting the Indians has as its immediate object the closest control by the government of their lives and property. The first and principal need then was that they should be shielded alike from their own improvidence and the spoliation of others but the ultimate purpose was to give them the more independent and responsible status of citizens and property owners. The present statute which enabled Miller Tiger to become the owner of the lands leased to the plaintiff is typical of the latter course of Indian legislation, which discloses a purpose to accomplish that end not only by the gradual relinquishment of restrictions upon the lands originally allotted to the Indianas, but by encouraging their acquisition of other property and gradually enlarging their control over it until independence should be achieved. See McCurdy v. United States, supra. \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 580]\n\u00a0\n The act under which Tiger's allotted and was leased is entitled 'An act for the removal of restrictions from part of the lands of allottees of the Five Civilized Tribes, and for other purposes.' It frees from all restriction the lands of all allottees, of less than three-quarters Indian blood. Section 1 empowers the Secretary of the Interior to remove the restrictions from the lands of fullblood Indians 'wholly or in part, under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe.' Section 2 permits the allottees of lands from which restrictions have not been removed to lease them for a period of five years, 'Provided, that leases of restricted lands for oil, gas or other mining purposes, ... may be made, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise.' Under section 4 'all land from which restrictions have been or shall be removed shall be subject to taxation and all other civil burdens as though it were the property of other persons than allottees of the Five Civilized Tribes.' In this, as in other Indian legislation, opportunity is afforded for their emancipation by imposing upon them duties as well as giving them the privileges of citizens and property owners, including the duty to pay taxes.\n In a broad sense all lands which the Indians are permitted to purchase out of the taxable lands of the state in this process of their emancipation and assumption of the responsibility of citizenship, whether restricted or not, may be said to be instrumentalities in that process. But they are far less intimately connected with the performance of an essential governmental function than were the restricted allotted lands, and the accomplishment of their purpose obviously does not require entire independence of state control in matters of taxation. To hold them immune would be inconsistent with one of the very \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 581]\n\u00a0\n purposes of their creation, to educate the indians in responsibility, and would present the curious paradox that the Secretary by a mere conveyancer's restriction, permitted by Congress, had rendered the land free from taxation and thus actually relieved the Indians of all responsibility. There are some instrumentalities which, though Congress may protect them from state taxation, will nevertheless be subject to that taxation unless Congress speaks. See Goudy v. Meath, \n203 \nU.S. 146, 149\n, 27 S. Ct. 48; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362, 371\n, 32 S. Ct. 499; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319, 323\n, 36 S. Ct. 298; Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5; Choctaw, O. & G. R. R. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531, 537\n, 41 S. Ct. 582; Central Pac. R. R. v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 126\n, 16 S. Ct. 766. These lands we take to be of that character.\n Little need be said as to the power of the Secretary of the Interior to exempt the land and its uses from taxation. The power, if it exists, is one conferred by Congress, but neither it nor the Secretary has in terms purported to make or authorize such an exemption.\n The Act of May 27, 1908, contains no express exemption from taxation of the proceeds of restricted lands, but section 4 expressly subjects lands from which restrictions have been removed to state taxation. This section was adopted in response to representations that the revenue of the state of Oklahoma was insufficient for state purpose, that large areas of lands within the state allotted to Indians were exempt from taxation as agencies of the federal government and that Indian citizens were enjoying the benefit of local government without taxation. Report of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, S. Rep. No. 575, 60th Cong. 1st Sess.; Report of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, H. Rep. No. 1454, 60th Cong. 1st Sess.\n At the time of this legislation restrictions on some allotted lands had been removed by reason of the expira- \n\n[276 U.S. 575, 582]\n\u00a0\n tion of the restricted period. There were also allotments on behalf of allottees dying before allotment which in the hands of their heirs were unrestricted. See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286\n, 31 S. Ct. 578. It cannot be assumed that Congress at a time when it was withdrawing allotted lands from their former exemption in order that Indian citizens might assume the just burdens of state taxation, intended to extend a tax exemption by implication. In any case the Secretary of the Interior has never, by rule or regulation or other action, purported to exempt such lands from state taxation. No such action is to be implied from his authorized action in restricting the power of the Indian grantee to alienate the land. See United States v. Ransom, supra; United States v. Brown (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 564; United States v. Gray (C. C. A.) 284 F. 103; United States v. Mummert (C. C.

The Court of Claims on its findings of fact and conclusions of law gave judgment dismissing the petition. 58 Ct. Cl. 302. This court denied an application for certiorari October 10, 1927 (\n275 \nU.S. 528\n, 48 S. Ct. 20, 72 L. Ed. -). The present appeal was taken under Act of Congress approved March 4, 1927, c. 522, 44 Stat. part 3, p. 1847. It specifically granted to appellants one year from date within which to appeal, and was intended we think to confer a right of appeal as distinguished from the right to petition for certiorari within three months of the judgment, conferred by sections 3 and 8 of the Jurisdictional Act of February 13, 1925 (28 USCA  288, 350).\n Appellants ask review by this court of four items of their claim, all of which were denied by the court below. All involve the question, among others, whether under the special act conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Claims the authority of that court was limited to adjudicating the rights of appellants arising under treaties and statutes of the United States, in accordance with accepted principles of law and equity, or whether it could go behind those treaties and statutes and allow recovery of amounts not authorized to be paid by them, on grounds of inadequacy of consideration and mistake. \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 428]\n\u00a0\n The four items of claim now presented differ in some respects from the claims set up in the petition. The facts now relied on, so far as disclosed by the findings, to which the consideration of this court is limited, may be summarized as follows:\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Appellants' Claim for Additional Compensation for Lands Ceded Under the Treaty of 1858\n\n\n This claim is, in substance, founded upon an asserted difference between the value of certain lands of petitioners and the amount allowed and paid for them under treaties of the United States with the Indians and subsequent action taken under them. The Court of Claims found that the petitioners were two bands of the Sioux Indians, having their habitat prior to July 3, 1851, along the upper Minnesota river. On that date they negotiated a treaty with the United States, later modified by the Senate of the United States, and as modified ratified by the Indians and the United States government in September, 1852. 10 Stat. 952, 958. The treaty ceded to the United States all the lands of petitioners in the territory of Minnesota and Iowa.\n By article III as originally drafted, reservations for the petitioners were set apart along the Minnesota river and following the negotiation of the treaty the petitioners, together with two other bands, the Wahpakoota and Medawakanton Indians, were removed to those reservations. These provisions for reservations for the four bands were stricken out of the treaty as ratified, and a new provision substituted that the Indians should be paid 10 cents an acre for these lands, payment to be in lieu of the reservations as originally provided for in article 3 of the treaty as negotiated, the sum so paid to be added to the trust fund for the Indians provided for in other sections of the \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 429]\n\u00a0\n treaty. The sum so paid and allotted to the trust fund amounted to $112, 000. The President of the United States was authorized to set apart another reservation for these bands of Indians outside of the ceded territory, but no other reservation was in fact so set apart under the provisions of this treaty.\n By Treaty of June, 1858, 12 Stat. 1031, 1037, it was stipulated that those portions of the reservations lying south of the Minnesota river should constitute reservations for the four bands with provisions for allotment, and that the disposition to be made of the portions of the reservations on the north side of the river should be left to the United States Senate for decision. Senate Resolution of June 27, 1860, 12 Stat. 1042, provided that the Indians should be allowed 30 cents an acre for the lands lying on the north side of the river. These lands consisted of 469, 000 acres, for which the Indians were paid $170,880, payment being provided for by the Act of March 2, 1861, c. 85, 12 Stat. 221, 237.\n In August, 1862, and until 1864, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands participated in an outbreak of the Sioux Indians, during which many white settlers were massacred, and large amounts of property destroyed. In consequence, Congress, by Act of February 16, 1863 (12 Stat. 652), abrogated all treaties between them and the United States, declared all their lands and rights of occupancy within the state of Minnesota and all annuities and claims previously accorded to them forfeited, and provided for payment of the damages suffered by citizens in consequence of the outbreak from funds of the Indians in the hands of the government. By Act of March 3, 1863 (12 Stat. 819), lands in the reservation on the south side of the Minnesota river were sold, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands ultimately receiving from the sale $647,457. The Court of Claims found that the value of these lands on March 3, 1863, was $1.25 \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 430]\n\u00a0\n an acre. The appellants argue here that, as these lands were worth $1.25 an acre March 3, 1863, the lands on the north side of the river were worth that amount when sold for 30 cents an acre three years before, June 27, 1860, and that they are now entitled to recover the difference, aggregating $541,120, between the value so ascertained and the amount actually received from the sale, on the ground that there must have been a material mistake of the parties as to the value of the land, and that the jurisdictional act under which this suit was brought authorized the recovery of the value of the land as of March 3, 1863.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Appellants' Claim for Compensation Arising Under the Act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 819.\n Following the Sioux Indian outbreak of 1862, Congress, by Act of March 3, 1863, c. 119, 12 Stat. 819, provided that the President should set apart for the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands, among others, unoccupied lands outside the limits of any state sufficient to provide each member willing to adopt the pursuit of agriculture with 80 acres of agricultural land. Shortly afterwards such lands were so designated and set apart at Crow Creek on the Missouri river in Dakota territory. At this time, as a result of military operations against the Indians, 295 full-blood Indians of the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands, and 112 half-breeds of the four bands, were military prisoners at Ft. Snelling. They, with prisoners of other bands were removed to the reservation at Crow Creek, arriving there about May 30th of that year, and lands were then finally set apart for them in the following July. Military operations were continued until 1864, during which most of the other members of the bands were driven out of the state \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 431]\n\u00a0\n of Minnesota to points west of the Missouri river and into Canada. After the cessation of military operations, these other members of the two bands, numbering in 1866 between 600 and 800, gathered and settled near Ft. Wadsworth in the eastern part of Dakota territory, where, with the acquiescence of the government, they remained until 1867, when the Lake Traverse and Devil's Lake Reservations were set apart for them.\n In the meantime an unsuccessful effort had been made by the government to negotiate a treaty with these fragments of the bands for the extinguishment of their claim to lands in the Dakota territory, which claims were considered doubtful because the lands were claimed by other Indians. It does not appear that any material numbers of additional members of the bands went to the Crow Creek Reservation, or how many, if any, were willing to adopt the pursuit of agriculture.\n By article 2 of the Treaty of February 19, 1867 (15 Stat. 506), the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands ceded to the United States the right to construct wagon roads, railroad and telegraph lines, and other public improvements across the lands claimed by them and described in the treaty, and in consideration of the 'confiscation of all their annuities, reservations and improvements' by the government, it was provided that there should be set apart a permanent reservation for such members of the bands as had not been sent to the Crow Creek Reservation. Such reservations were set apart, which became known as the Lake Traverse and Devil's Lake Reservations. On the basis of these findings, appellants contend that under the Act of March 3, 1863, they were entitled to recover the value of an allowance of 80 acres of agriculture land for each member of the bands, aggregating 322,080 acres of land, which, at $1.25 an acre, found by the Court of Claims to be the value at that date, amounts to $402, 600. \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 432]\n\u00a0\n III.\n Appellants' Claim for Compensation for Lands Alleged to Have Been Ceded but Not Paid For Under the Treaty of September 20, 1872.\n By Act of June 7, 1872, c. 325, 17 Stat. 281, the Secretary of the Interior was directed to report to Congress what title or interest the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands had in any portion of the land described in the second article of the Treaty of February 19, 1867, under which the Lake Traverse and Devil's Lake Reservations were set apart, and also 'whether any, and if any, what compensation ought in justice and equity to be made to the said bands of Indians respectively for the extinguishment of whatever title they may have to said lands.' Under the statute, the Secretary appointed a commission to make an investigation of the Indians' title to the land, and, if it found such title to be valid and complete, to negotiate for the relinquishment of the title upon terms 'at once favorable to the government and just to the Indians.'\n On October 3, 1872, the commission reported that prior to the treaty of February 19, 1867, the title to the tract of the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands was doubtful, as other bands of Sioux Indians claimed a common interest in the lands, but that the United States had, by that treaty, recognized the title of the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands, and was by it estopped from denying their title. The commission reported that it estimated the tract of land to have an area of over 8,000,000 acres and that the value of the lands should be fixed at the sum of $800,000, although the Indians urged $200,000 more than this sum as the proper value, and one of the commissioners was of the opinion that $800,000 was more than should be allowed. \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 433]\n\u00a0\n The commission submitted with its report a proposed treaty which it had negotiated with the Indians under date of September 20, 1872 ( Kappler's Indian Laws and Treaties, vol. 2, p. 1057), under which the bands were to cede all their interest in the lands as well as all lands in the territory of Dakota, except the Lake Traverse and Devil's Lake Reservations. The principal, but not the only consideration, was the $800, 000, payable to the Indians in annual installments of $80,000 each, without interest.\n By act of February 14, 1873, c. 138, 17 Stat. 437, 456, Congress ratified and confirmed that portion of the treaty providing for the cession of the lands and the payment of $800,000, and appropriated $80,000 for the first installment payment. The treaty, as thus amended, and confirmed by Congress, was ratified by the Indians May 2, 1873 (Kappler's Indian Laws and Treaties, vol. 2, p. 1059). The stipulated annual installments were appropriated and paid, the appropriation acts providing that the several installments were 'for the relinquishment by said Indians of their claim to or interest in the lands described in the second article of the treaty made with them February nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven.' 18 Stat. 167, 441; 19 Stat. 192, 287; 20 Stat. 81, 310; 21 Stat. 127, 497; 22 Stat. 81.\n In making the treaty or agreement of September 20, 1872, it was the belief and understanding of the parties that the approximate area of the tract of land to be sold and ceded by the Indians was 8,000,000 acres. In fact, the actual area of the land, as later determined, was 11,000,000 acres. The Court of Claims found that the value of the land was not satisfactorily shown by the evidence either on March 3, 1863, or at the time of the making of the agreement or treaty.\n Appellants contend that there was a mutual mistake of fact as to the quantity of land ceded, and that the \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 434]\n\u00a0\n Court of Claims should have awarded compensation at the rate of 10 cents an acre for the 3,000,000 acres of land in excess of the 8,000,000 acres which was supposed to be the approximate area of the land at the time of the agreement.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n Appellants' Claim for Payment of the Principal of the Trust Fund Created Under the Treaty of July 23, 1851.\n The treaty of July 23, 1851, provided for the creation of a trust fund to be paid by the government to the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands for the cession by them of lands to the government under this treaty. It was provided that the fund should be held by the government and 5 per cent. interest on it paid annually by the government to the Indians for a period of 50 years, which payments when completed were to be full payment of and to extinguish the trust fund. Under the treaty as submitted to the Senate for ratification, the amount of the trust fund was designated as $1,360, 000, but, under the treaty as amended by the Senate and ratified by the Indians, this amount was increased to $1,472,000.\n Until the Indian outbreak of 1862 and the Act of February 16, 1863, the government paid the stipulated annual payments, and, notwithstanding the forfeiture of their rights by the Act of February 16, 1863, the government has, under subsequent acts of Congress, accounted to the Indians for the remaining payments covering the entire 50-year period, less such amounts as were paid to citizens for damages sustained by them by reason of the outbreak.\n The petitioners claim the right to recover the full principal sum set apart for them in addition to the installments paid, which, alone, the treaty authorized, on the \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 435]\n\u00a0\n ground that, as the specified fund was designated as a trust fund, the obligation of the government with respect to it could not be discharged by the payment of an amount equivalent to annual interest upon the fund for 50 years, and also because the Court of Claims found that some members of the two bands did not understand at the time the treaty was made that the payment of interest on the trust fund for 50 years was to be in full payment of the principal, and did understand that at the end of the 50- year period the principal was also to be paid over to the Indians.\n It will be observed that of the four claims, claims I, III, and IV are based on alleged mistakes which are urged as a sufficient basis for disregarding the express provisions of the treaties and statutes concerned; claim I being based on an alleged mistake as to the value of the land purchased under a treaty, claim III being based on a supposed mistake as to the amount of land purchased by the government for a lump sum under a treaty, and claim IV being based upon an alleged mistake of individual members of the bands as to the amount to be paid under the Treaty of July 23, 1851, although the Court of Claims found that it did not appear that their representatives, the chiefs and headmen who negotiated the treaty, did not understand the provisions of it.\n It is also to be noted that there are no specific findings, supporting the claims, that the stipulated payments referred to in claims I, III, and IV were based on mistake or that different amounts would have been stipulated for and paid, had the parties or either of them been aware of the supposed mistakes or the equitable considerations now pressed upon us. To supply the lack of such findings, petitioners are compelled to rely on inferences which they seek to draw from the facts as found and already stated in this opinion. \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 436]\n\u00a0\n If we were to assume that the act conferring jurisdiction on the Court of Claims in this case is broad enough to allow a recovery based upon mistakes or other considerations inducing the treaties and acts of Congress with which we are now concerned, we should find it difficult to discern in the findings any basis for the inferences necessary to support a recovery on such a theory. But we think it plain that that act only gave authority to the Court of Claims to hear and determine claims 'for the amount due or claimed to be due said bands from the United States under any treaties or laws of Congress.' It does not purport to alter or enlarge any rights conferred on petitioners by the treaties or laws of the United States or authorize any recovery except in accordance with the legal principles applicable in determining those rights under laws and treaties of the United States. See United States v. Old Settlers, \n148 \nU.S. 427, 468\n, 469 S., 13 S. Ct. 650; United States v. Mille Lac Chippewas, \n229 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 33 S. Ct. 811.\n To give the relief now sought, it would be necessary to render a judgment predicated upon the abrogation of express provisions of the treaties and statutes concerned and the substitution for them of other provisions which Congress has never enacted or authorized. These are political, not judicial, powers. The act does not purport to bestow such powers on the Court of Claims, and it would require resort to a violent and inadmissible presumption to infer any such purpose in the act. Cf. United States v. Old Settlers, supra; and see Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 353, 367\n, 23 S. Ct. 216.\n The second claim stands upon a somewhat different footing, but here also are wanting findings of fact essential to support the claim. The Act of March 3, 1863, directed the President to set aside for the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands lands sufficient in extent to enable them to assign to each member of the band 'who is willing to adopt the pursuit of agriculture, eighty acres of agricultural land,' \n\n[277 U.S. 424, 437]\n\u00a0\n but there is no finding showing how many, or that any of the Indians were willing to follow the pursuit of agriculture after the adoption of the Act of March 3. Hence there is no foundation for any recovery which might be awarded on the basis of allotments to which only those members of the band were entitled who were willing to follow the pursuit of agriculture.\n So far as those members of the band in amity with the United States were concerned, the findings show that they were provided for in the Crow Creek Reservation, set apart under the act of Congress. Appellant's present claim extends to those who were then in active hostility to the United States, the subject of its military operations, and who were fleeing from capture by the military arm of the government. The Act of March 3, 1863, passed at the very time of these operations, could not, we think have been intended for the benefit of those Indians who were then in open hostility to the government, and who for that reason did not avail of its benefits or comply with the conditions.\n Nor can it now be deemed the basis of any claim for damages against the United States cognizable by a court-a conclusion at which we arrive quite independently of any consideration of the fact that the United States later made provision for these hostile and fugitive members of the two bands in the Lake Traverse and Devil's Lake Reservations. Jurisdiction over them and their tribal lands was peculiarly within the legislative power of Congress, and may not be exercised by the courts, in the absence of legislation conferring rights upon them such as are the subject of judicial cognizance. See Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, supra, 565 (23 S. Ct. 216 ); Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 294\n, 23 S. Ct. 115; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 483\n, 19 S. Ct. 722, 43 L. Ed 1041. This the jurisdictional Act of April 11, 1916, plainly failed to do.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That all claims of whatsoever nature which the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands of Sioux Indians may have or claim to have against the United States shall be submitted to the Court of Claims, with the right to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party, for the amount due or claimed to be due said bands from the United States under any treaties or laws of Congress; and jurisdiction is hereby, conferred upon the Court of Claims to hear and determine all claims of said bands against the United States and also any legal or equitable defense, set-off, or counterclaim which the United States may have against said Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands of Sioux Indians, and to enter judgment, and in determining the amount to be entered herein the court shall deduct from any sums found due said Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands of Sioux Indians any and all gratuities paid said bands or individual members thereof subsequent to March third, eighteen hundred and sixty-three: Provided, that in determining the amount to be entered herein, the value of the land involved shall not exceed the value of such land on March third, eighteen hundred and sixty-three.

CO. v. HAGLUND(1928)\nNo. 472\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Denman, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ira S. Lillick and J. F. Sullivan, both of San Francisco, Cal ., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two suits in admiralty, which were brought in the federal court for northern California, arose out of a collision between the ferryboat Thoroughfare and the steamship Enterprise in charge of the tug Relief, in the channel of San Antonio Creek, known as the Oakland Estuary, which resulted in damages to the Thoroughfare and the Enterprise, and the killing of Ernest Haglund, a workman on the Enterprise. In No. 472 the administratrix of Haglund's estate libelled the Southern Pacific Company, the owner of the Thoroughfare, and the Rolph Navigation & Coal Company, the owner of the Relief, for the damages arising from his death. In No. 473 the Moore Shipbuilding Company libelled the Thoroughfare for the damages to the Enterprise; and the Southern Pacific Company, as claimant of the Thoroughfare, brought in as third party respondents the Enterprise, the Relief and the Rolph Navigation & Coal Company, to answer for the damages to the Thoroughfare. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The suits were tried on the same evidence as to the responsibility for the collision, and were consolidated for hearing in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court found that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the Thoroughfare, without fault on the part of the Relief or the Enterprise, and entered decrees against \n\n[277 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n the Southern Pacific Company for the damages to the Enterprise and the death of Haglund. These decrees were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 19 F.(2d) 878.\n The channel of the Estuary, the great artery of commerce between San Francisco and Oakland, is 500 feet wide. The collision occurred about noon, on a clear day. The Enterprise, a steam freighter 320 feet long, which was undergoing repairs at the yard of the Moore Shipbuilding Company on the north bank of the Estuary, was let down stern foremost on a marine railway into the waters of the Estuary, and lay at right angles across the channel. She was without power, had no lookout, and had been placed by the Shipbuilding Company in charge of the Relief to be berthed at a nearby wharf on the Company's plant. \n2\n The Thoroughfare, a steam ferryboat, was then approaching at her full speed of 13 miles an hour on an easterly course through the Estuary. When about 2,900 feet away she sounded a single blast of her whistle. This was not answered by the Relief, which was then engaged in stopping the sternway of the Enterprise towards the south side of the channel. When the Thououghfare had approached within about 1,000 feet of the Enterprise, the Relief had arrested the movement of the Enterprise and was holding her dead in the water, with her stern about 100 feet from the south edge of the channel, leaving an ample opening for the passage of the Thoroughfare. At this distance the Thoroughfare again sounded a single blast of her whistle, indicating an intention to direct her course to starboard and pass in the rear of the Enterprise. This was accepted by the Relief by a like single blast. At this time the master of the Relief was aware of the presence at a considerable distance on the other side of \n\n[277 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n the Enterprise of the tug Union3 which, with a tow, was approaching on a westerly course near the south edge of the channel. The master of the Thoroughfare, whose view was then intercepted by the Enterprise, was not aware of the presence of the Union. After the Relief gave her answering signal the Thoroughfare continued to advance at full speed, for about 1, 000 feet, heading for the 100 foot opening between the stern of the Enterprise and the edge of the channel, and not knowing what vessels might be encountered on the other side. Meanwhile the Enterprise remained at rest without any change in position. Just as the Thoroughfare was about to pass she saw the Union approaching on the other side and blew two whistles to indicate her intention of passing on the starboard side of the Union after she got clear of the Enterprise. This was accepted by two blasts from the Union. But before clearing the Enterprise the Thoroughfare suddenly changed her course to port, and struck the Enterprise. There was no occasion for this change to port. The Thoroughfare was not then in peril; the Union was about 900 feet away and had already slowed down; and the Thoroughfare would have had ample time and space after clearing the Enterprise in which to go to port and pass on the starboard side of the Union in accordance with the previous exchange of signals. And the Thoroughfare could herself have stopped within 300 feet.\n We agree with the view of both the lower courts that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the Thoroughfare, which not only approached the passageway in the rear of the Enterprise at full speed, without knowing whether she would encounter any vessel on the other side, but needlessly commenced the execution of the passing movement with the Union before she had cleared the \n\n[277 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n Enterprise; and that there was no contributing fault on the part of the Relief or the Enterprise.\n The Relief was not at fault in accepting the passing signal of the Thoroughfare. This was merely an assent to the proposed passage in the rear of the Enterprise, expressing an understanding of what the Thoroughfare proposed to do and an agreement not to endanger or thwart it by permitting an interfering change in the position of the Enterprise. See Atlas Transp. Co. v. Lee Line Steamers (C. C. A.) 235 F. 492, 495. And the Relief, being in a position to fully carry out its agreement, was under no obligation to decline the passing signal because of the approach of the Union on the other side and to sound instead a warning signal. There was nothing in the situation to indicate that the approach of the Union would prevent the Thoroughfare from passing safely, if, as the Relief had the right to assume, it were navigated with due care. See Atlas Transp. Co. v. Lee Line Steamers (C. C. A.) 238 F. 349, on petition for rehearing. The doctrine of The F. W. Wheeler (C. C. A.) 78 F. 824, that a moving tug is in fault in accepting, without warning, a passing signal when she knows that the passage is obstructed by her grounded tow whose movement she cannot control, has no application here.\n Nor was the Enterprise at fault in not having a lookout. The rule stated in The Ariadne, 13 Wall. 475, 478, as to the responsibility of a moving vessel for the failure of her lookout to discover an approaching vessel in time to avoid a collision, does not apply to a vessel in the position of the Enterprise, which was at rest, without power; and the absence of a lookout upon her did not in any manner contribute to the collision.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Another tug, the Hercules, belonging to the Rolph Navigation & Coal Company, which was also impleaded, is not here involved. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Relief was assisted by the tug Hercules referred to in note 1, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Union is not brought into these suits. \n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPRINGER v.

Gen., for Government of Philippine Islands.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 189, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, presenting substantially the same question, were argued and will be considered and disposed of together. In each case an action in the nature of quo warranto was brought in the court below challenging the right to hold office of directors of certain corporations organized under the legislative authority of the Philippine \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 198]\n\u00a0\n Islands; No. 564 involving directors of the National Coal Company, and No. 573 involving directors of the Philippine National Bank.\n The National Coal Company was created by Act 2705, approved March 10, 1917, subsequently amended by Act 2822, approved March 5, 1919. The Governor General, under the provisions of the amended act, subscribed on behalf of the Philippine Islands for substantially all of the capital stock. The act provides:\n'The voting power of all such stock owned by the government of the Philippine Islands shall be vested exclusively in a committee, consisting of the Governor General, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.'\n\n The National Bank was created by Act 2612, approved February 4, 1916, subsequently amended by Act 2747, approved February 20, 1918, and Act 2938, approved January 30, 1921. The authorized capital of the bank, as finally fixed, was 10,000,000 pesos, consisting of 100,000 shares, of which, in pursuance of the legislative provisions, the Philippine Government acquired and owns 97,332 shares; the reaminder being held by private persons. By the original act the voting power of the government-owned stock was vested exclusively in the Governor General, but by the amended acts now in force that power was 'vested exclusively in a board, the short title of which shall be 'board of control,' composed of the Governor General, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.' The Governor General was also divested of the power of appointment of the president and vice president of the bank, originally vested in him, and their election was authorized to be made by the directors from among their own number. Provision was also made for a general manager, to be appointed or removed by the board of directors with the advice and consent of the board of control. The manager was to be chief executive of the bank, with an annual \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 199]\n\u00a0\n salary to be fixed by the board of directors with the approval of the board of control. Further duties were conferred upon the board of control in connection with the management of the bank which it does not seem necessary to set forth.\n It is worthy of note that this voting power has been similarly devolved by the Legislature upon at least four other corporations: The National Petroleum Company, by Act 2814; the National Development Company, by Act 2849; the National Cement Company, by Act 2855; and the National Iron Company, by Act 2862-and the suggestion of the Solicitor General that this indicates a systematic plan on the part of the Legislature to take over, through its presiding officers, the direct control generally of nationally organized or controlled stock corporations would seem to be warranted.\n In pursuance of the first-quoted provision, petitioners in No. 564 were elected directors of the National Coal Company by a vote of the government-owned shares cast by the Presidnet of the Senate and the Speaker of the House; and, in purusance of the second quoted provision, petitioners in No. 573 were elected directors of the National Bank in the same way. The Governor General, challenging the validity of the legislation, did not participate in either election. While there are some differences between the two actions in respect of the facts, they are differences of detail which do not affect the substantial question to be determined.\n On behalf of the Philippine government, respondent in both cases, it is contended that the election of directors and managing agents by a vote of the government-owned stock was an executive function intrusted by the Organic Act of the Philippine Islands to the Governor General, and that the acts of the Legislature divesting him of that power and vesting it, in the one case, in a 'board,' and, in the other, in a 'committee,' the majority of which in \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 200]\n\u00a0\n each instance consisted of officers and members of the Legislature, were invalid as being in conflict with the Organic Act. The court below sustained the contention of the government and entered judgments of ouster against the petitioners in each case.\n The congressional legislation referred to as the Organic Act is the enactment of August 29, 1916, c. 416, 39 Stat. 545 (48 USCA  1001 et seq .), which constitutes the fundamental law of the Philippine Islands, and bears a relation to their governmental affairs not unlike that borne by a state Constitution to the state. The act contains a Bill of Rights, many of the provisions of which are taken from the Federal Constitution. It lays down fundamental rules in respect of taxation, shipping, customs duties, etc. Section 8 of the act (48 USCA  1041) provides:\n'That general legislative power, except as otherwise herein provided, is hereby granted to the Philippine Legislature, authorized by this act.'\n\n And by section 12 (48 USCA  1043) this legislative power is vested in a Legislature, to consist of two houses, one the Senate and the other the House of Representatives. Provision is made (sections 13, 14 and 17 ( 48 USCA  1044, 1045, 1048)) for memberships, terms, and qualifications of the members of each house. By section 21 (48 USCA  1111) it is provided 'that the supreme executive power shall be vested in an executive officer, whose official title shall be 'the Governor General of the Philippine Islands.\" He is given 'general supervision and control of all of the departments and bureaus of the government in the Philippine Islands as far as is not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.' He is made 'responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of the Philippine Islands and of the United States operative within the Philippine Islands.' Other powers of an important and comprehensive character also are conferred upon him. By section 22 (48 USCA  1114) the executive departments of the Philippine government, as then authorized by law, are continued until otherwise provided by the Legislature. The Legislature is authorized by appropriate legislation to \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 201]\n\u00a0\n 'increase the number or abolish any of the executive departments, or make such changes in the names and duties thereof as it may see fit,' and 'provide for the appointment and removal of the heads of the executive departments by the Governor General.' Then follows the proviso:\n'That all executive functions of the government must be directly under the Governor General or within one of the executive departments under the supervision and control of the Governor General.'\n\n Section 26 (48 USCA  1071-1074, 1078) recognizes the existing Supreme Court and courts of first instance of the Islands, and continues their jurisdiction as heretofore provided, with such additional jurisdiction as should thereafter be prescribed by law.\n Thus the Organic Act, following the rule established by the American Constitutions, both state and federal, divides the government into three separate departments-the legislative, executive, and judicial. Some of our state Constitutions expressly provide in one form or another that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever separate and distinct from each other. Other Constitutions, including that of the United States, do not contain such an express provision. But it is implicit in all, as a conclusion logically following from the separation of the several departments. See Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168, 190\n, 191 S.. And this separation and the consequent exclusive character of the powers conferred upon each of the three departments is basic and vital-not merely a matter of governmental mechanism. That the principle is implicit in the Philippine Organic Act does not admit of doubt. See Abueva v. Wood, 45 Phil. Rep. 612, 622, 628, et seq.\n It may be stated then, as a general rule inherent in the American constitutional system, that, unless otherwise expressly provided or incidental to the powers conferred, the Legislature cannot exercise either executive or judicial power; the executive cannot exercise either legislative or \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 202]\n\u00a0\n judicial power; the judiciary cannot exercise either executive or legislative power. The existence in the various Constitutions of occasional provisions expressly giving to one of the departments powers which by their nature otherwise would fall within the general scope of the authority of another department emphasizes, rather than casts doubt upon, the generally inviolate character of this basic rule.\n Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement. The latter are executive functions. It is unnecessary to enlarge further upon the general subject, since it has so recently received the full consideration of this court. Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 21.\n Not having the power of appointment, unless expressly granted or incidental to its powers, the Legislature cannot ingraft executive duties upon a legislative office, since that would be to usurp the power of appointment by indirection, though the case might be different if the additional duties were devolved upon an appointee of the executive. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 300\n, 301 S., 13 S. Ct. 361. Here the members of the Legislature who constitute a majority of the 'board' and 'committee,' respectively, are not charged with the performance of any legislative functions or with the doing of anything which is in aid of the performance of any such functions by the Legislature. Putting aside for the moment the question whether the duties devolved upon these members are vested by the Organic Act in the Governor General, it is clear that they are not legislative in character, and still more clear that they are not judicial. The fact that they do not fall within the authority of either of these two constitutes logical ground for concluding that they do fall within that of the remaining one of the three among \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 203]\n\u00a0\n which the powers of government are divided. Compare Myers v. United States, supra, pages 117, 118 (47 S. Ct. 25).\n Assuming, for present purposes, that the duty of managing this property, namely, the government-owned shares of stock in these corporations, is not sovereign but proprietary in its nature, the conclusion must be the same. The property is owned by the government, and the government in dealing with it, whether in its quasi sovereign or its proprietary capacity, nevertheless acts in its governmental capacity. There is nothing in the Organic Act, or in the nature of the legislative power conferred by it, to suggest that the Legislature in acting in respect of the proprietary rights of the government may disregard the limitation that it must exercise legislative and not executive functions. It must deal with the property of the government by making rules, and not by executing them. The appointment of managers (in this instance corporate directors) of property or a business, is essentially an executive act which the Legislature is without capacity to perform directly or through any of its members.\n Whether the members of the 'board' or the 'committee' are public officers in a strict sense, we do not find it necessary to determine. They are public agents at least, charged with the exercise of executive functions and, therefore, beyond the appointing power of the Legislature. Stockman v. Leddy, 55 Colo. 24, 129 P. 220, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 1052, involved a case very much like that now under consideration. The state Legislature had created a committee of its own members to investigate the rights of the state in the flowing waters therein. The committee was authorized to determine what steps were necessary to be taken to protect the rights of the state, to employ counsel, etc. There was no claim that the investigation was for the purpose of ascertaining facts to aid in future legislation or to assist the Legislature in its legislative capacity, but it was for the pur- \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 204]\n\u00a0\n pose of enabling the committee itself to reach a conclusion as to what should be proper to do in order to protect the rights of the state. The court, in holding the act unconstitutional, said (page 31 (129 P. 223)):\n'In other words, the General Assembly not only passed an act-that is, made a law-but it made a joint committee of the Senate and the House as its executive agent to carry out that law. This a clear and conspicuous instance of an attempt by the General Assembly to confer executive power upon a collection of its own members.'\n\n And the court held that this was invalid under the provisions of the state Constitution respecting the tripartite division of governmental powers. See, also, Clark v. Stanley, 66 N. C. 59, 8 Am. Rep. 488; State ex rel. Howerton v. Tate, 68 N. C. 546.\n Petitioners seek to draw a parallel between the power of Congress to create corporations as appropriate means of executing governmental powers and the acts of the Philippine Legislature here under consideration. To what extent the powers of the two bodies in this respect may be assimilated we need not stop not to determine, since the power of the Legislature to create the two corporations here involved is not doubted. But it is argued further that Congress, in creating corporations for governmental purposes, has sometimes devolved the voting power in such corporations upon persons other than executive officers. In the case of the Smithsonian Institution, cited as an example, Congress provided for a governing Board of Regents composed in part of members of the Senate and of the House. There are tow or three other instances in respect of nonstock organizations of like character. On the other hand, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, in the case of governmentally organized or controlled stock corporations, Congress has uniformly recognized the executive authority in their management, generally providing in express terms that the shares shall be voted \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 205]\n\u00a0\n by an executive officer, and in no instance attempting to grant such power to one or more of its members. Many instances of this kind are cited by the Solicitor General, but it is not necessary to repeat his enumeration. It is enough to say that, when we consider the limited number of acts of Congress which fall within the first class spoken of above, as well as the peculiar character of the institutions dealt with, and the contrary attitude of Congress toward corporations of a different character, such acts cannot be regarded as lending support to a construction of the Constitution which would justify congressional legislation like that here involved. As this court said in Myers v. United States, supra, pages 170- 171 (47 S. Ct. 43):\n'In the use of congressional legislation to support or change a particular construction of the Constitution by acquiescence, its weight for the purpose must depend not only upon the nature of the question, but also upon the attitude of the executive and judicial branches of the government, as well as upon the number of instances in the execution of the law in which opportunity for objection in the courts or elsewhere is afforded. When instances which actually involve the question are rare, or have not in fact occurred, the weight of the mere presence of acts on the statute book for a considerable time, as showing general acquiescence in the legislative assertion of a questioned power, is minimized.'\n\n And we are further of the opinion that the powers asserted by the Philippine Legislature are vested by the Organic Act in the Governor General. The intent of Congress to that effect is disclosed by the provisions of that act already set forth. Stated concisely, these provisions are: That the supreme executive power is vested in the Governor General, who is given general supervision and control over all the departments and bureaus of the Philippine government; upon him is placed the responsi- \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 206]\n\u00a0\n bility for the faithful execution of the laws of the Philippine Islands; and, by the general proviso, already quoted, all executive functions must be directly under the Governor General or within one of the executive departments under his supervision and control. These are grants comprehensive enough to include the powers attempted to be exercised by the Legislature by the provisions of law now under review. Myers v. United States, supra.\n It is true that section 21 contains a specific provision that the Governor General shall appoint such officers as may now be appointed by the Governor General, or such as he is authorized by this act to appoint, or whom he may hereafter be authroized by law to appoint. And it is said that the effect of this is to confine the Governor General's powers of appointment within the limits of this enumeration. The general rule that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others is subject to exceptions. Like other canons of statutory construction, it is only an aid in the ascertainment of the meaning of the law, and must yield whenever a contrary intention on the part of the lawmaker is apparent. Where a statute contains a grant of power enumerating certain things which may be done and also a general grant of power which, standing alone, would include these things and more, the general grant may be given full effect if the context shows that the enumeration was not intended to be exclusive. See, for example, Ford v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 593, 611\n, 47 S. Ct. 531, Portland v. N. E. T. & T. Co., 103 Me. 240, 249, 68 A. 1040; Grubbe v. Grubbe, 26 Or. 363, 370, 38 P. 182; Swick v. Coleman, 218 Ill. 33, 40, 75 N. E. 807; Lexington ex rel. v. Commercial Bank, 130 Mo. App. 687, 692, 108 S. W. 1095; McFarland v. M., K. & T. Ry. Co., 94 Mo. App. 336, 342, 68 S. W. 105.\n Applying these principles, we are unable to accept the contention that the enumeration here in question is exclusive in the face of the general provisions already quoted, and particularly of that one which declares that \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 207]\n\u00a0\n all executive functions are vested directly in the Governor General or under his supervision and control. It is true that this provision is in the form of a proviso, and it is argued that it is therefore nothing more than a definition by negation of the power given to the Legislature in the same section. But an analysis of the section, which is reproduced so far as pertinent in the margin,1 shows, though not wholly beyond doubt, that the power given to the Legislature is itself a proviso. In other words, both the grant of power to the Legislature and the grant of power to the Governor General are in form provisos to the general provisions of section 22 which precede them. It is difficult to assign to either proviso the general purpose of that form of legislation, which is merely to qualify the operation of the general language which precedes it. We think rather that both provisos are to be construed as independent and substantive provisions. As this court has more than once pointed out, it is not an uncommon practice in legislative proceedings to include independent pieces of legislation under the \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 208]\n\u00a0\n head of provisos. See Georgia Banking Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 9 S. Ct. 47; White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545, 551\n, 24 S. Ct. 171; Cox v. Hart, \n260 \nU.S. 427, 435\n, 43 S. Ct. 154.\n Finally, it is urged that, since no action has been taken by Congress under section 19 of the Organic Act (48 USCA  1052-1054), requiring all laws enacted by the Philippine Legislature to be reported to Congress, which reserves the power to annul them, the legislation now under review has received the implied sanction of Congress, and should not be disturbed. Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 446, is cited in support of this contention. In that case jurors were summoned into the legislative courts of the territory of Utah under the provisions of acts of Congress applicable only to the courts of the United States. This court held that the jurors were wrongly summoned, and a challenge to the array should have been sustained. The court, however, proceeded also to examine the jury law enacted by the territorial Legislature, and declared it to be valid. In the course of the opinion it was said that, since the simple disapproval by Congress at any time would have annulled that law, it was not unreasonable to infer that it was approved by that body. In the later case of Clayton v. Utah Territory, \n132 \nU.S. 632\n, 10 S. Ct. 190, an act of the same territory, providing for the appointment of certain officers was held to be void as in contravention of a provision of the territorial Organic Act vesting in the Governor the power to appoint such officers. Dealing with the same point here made, this court said ( page 642 (10 S. Ct. 194)):\n'It is true that in a case of doubtful construction the long acquiescence of Congress and the general government may be resotred to as some evidence of the proper construction, or of the validity, of a law. This principle is more applicable to questions relating to the construction of a statute than to matters which go to the power of the Legislature to enact it. At all events, it can hardly be admitted as a general proposition that under the power of \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 209]\n\u00a0\n Congress reserved in the organic acts of the territories to annul the acts of their Legislatures the absence of any action by Congress is to be construed to be a recognition of the power of the Legislature to pass laws in conflict with the act of Congress under which they were created.'\n\n The inference of an approval by Congress from its mere failure to act at best rests upon a weak foundation. And we think, where the inference is sought to be applied, as here, to a case where the legislation is clearly void as in contravention of the Organic Act, it cannot reasonably be indulged. To justify the conclusion that Congress has consented to the violation of one of its own acts of such fundamental character will require something more than such inaction upon its part as really amounts to nothing more than a failure affirmatively to declare such violation by a formal act.\n Whether the Philippine Legislature, in view of the alternative form of the provision vesting all executive functions directly under the Governor General or within one of the executive departments under his supervision and control, might devolve the voting power upon the head of an executive department or an appointee of such head, we do not now decide. The Legislature has not undertaken to do so; and, in the absence of such an attempt, it necessarily results that the power must be exercised directly by the Governor General or by his appointee, since he is the only executive now definitely authorized by law to act.\n The judgments in both cases are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n The great ordinances of the Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white. Even the more specific of them are found to terminate in a penumbra shading gradually from one extreme to the other. Property must not be taken without compensation, but with \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 210]\n\u00a0\n the help of a phrase (the police power), some property may be taken or destroyed for public use without paying for it, if you do not take too much. When we come to the fundamental distinctions it is still more obvious that they must be received with a certain latitude or our government could not go on.\n To make a ruld of conduct applicable to an individual who but for such action would be free from it is to legislate-yet it is what the judges do whenever they determine which of two competing principles of policy shall prevail. At an early date it was held that Congress could delegate to the courts the power to regulate process, which certainly is lawmaking so far as it goes. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42. Bank of the United States v. Halstead, 10 Wheat. 51. With regard to the Executive, Congress has delegated to it or to some branch of it the power to impose penalties, Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320\n, 29 S. Ct. 671; to make conclusive determination of dutiable values, Passavant v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 214\n, 13 S. Ct. 572; to establish standards for imports, Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470\n, 24 S. Ct. 349; to make regulations as to forest reserves, United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S. Ct. 480; and other powers not needing to be stated in further detail. Houston v. St. Louis Independent Packing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 479\n, 39 S. Ct. 332; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S. Ct. 367; Ex parte Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526\n, 17 S. Ct. 444. Congress has authroized the President to suspend the operation of a stature, even one suspending commercial intercourse with another country, Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S. Ct. 495, and very recently it has been decided that the President might be given power to change the tariff, J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States (April 9, 1928) \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S. Ct. 348. It is said that the powers of Congress cannot be delegated, yet Congress has established the Interstate Commerce Commission, which does legislative, judicial and executive acts, only softened by a quasi, makes regulations, Inter-Mountain Rate Cases, \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 211]\n\u00a0\n \n234 \nU.S. 476, 486\n, 34 S. Ct. 986, issues reparation orders and performs executive functions in connection with Safety Appliance Acts, Boiler Inspection Acts, etc. Congress also has made effective excursions in the other direction. It has withdrawn jurisdiction of a case after it has been argued. Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506. It has granted an amnesty, notwithstanding the grant to the President of the power to pardon. Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 16 S. Ct. 644. A territorial Legislature has granted a divorce. Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S. Ct. 723. Congress has declared lawful an obstruction to navigation that this court has declared unlawful. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421. Parallel to the case before us Congress long ago established the Smithsonian Institution to question which would be to lay hands on the Ark of the Covenant; not to speak of later similar exercises of power hitherto unquestioned, so far as I know.\n It does not seem to need argument to show that however we may disguise it by veiling words we do not and cannot carry out the distinction between legislative and executive action with mathematical precision and divide the branches into wateright compartments, were it ever so desirable to do so, which I am far from believing that it is, or that the Constitution requires.\n The only qualification of such latitude as otherwise would be consistent with the three-fold division of power, is the proviso in section 22 of the Organic Act 'that all executive functions of the government must be directly under the Governor General or within one of the executive departments,' etc. Act of August 29, 1916, c. 416, 39 Stat. 553, U. S. C. tit. 48,  1114. That does not appear to me to govern the case. The corporations concerned were private corporations which the legislature had power to incorporate. Whoever owned the stock the corporation did not perform functions of the government. This \n\n[277 U.S. 189, 212]\n\u00a0\n would be plain if the stock were in private hands, and if the government bought the stock from private owners the functions of the corporations would not be changed. If I am right in what I have said I think that ownership would not make voting upon the stock an executive function of the government when the acts of the corporation were not. I cannot believe that the Legislature might not have provided for the holding of the stock by a board of private persons with no duty to the government other than to keep it informed and to pay over such dividends as might accrue. It is said that the functions of the board of control are not legislative or judicial and therefore they must be executive. I should say rather that they plainly are no part of the executive functions of the government but rather fall into the indiscriminate residue of matters within legislative control. I think it would be lamentable even to hint a doubt as to the legitimacy of the action of Congress in establishing the Smithsonian as it did, and I see no sufficient reason for denying the Philippine Legislature a similar power.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS agrees with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n I think the opinion of the majority goes much beyond the necessities of the case.\n The Organic Act is careful to provide:\n'That all executive functions of the government must be directly under the Governor General or within oen of the executive departments under the supervision and control of the Governor General.'\n\n A good reason lies behind this limitation which does not apply to our federal or state governments. From the language employed, read in the light of all the circumstances, perhaps it is possible to spell out enough to overthrow the challenged legislation. Beyond that it is unnecessary to go. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 22. That, except as provided otherwise in this act, the executive departments of the Philippine government shall continue as now authorized by law until otherwise provided by the Philippine Legislature.

CITY OF SOUTH BEND, IND.(1928)\nNo. 208\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 163, 164]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dudley M. Shively, of South Bend, Ind., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Iden S. Romig, of South Bend, Ind., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By ordinance adopted in 1921, South Bend, Ind., prohibited with exceptions not here material, the operation on its streets of any motorbus, for hire unless licensed by the city. Sprout, a resident of that state, operated regularly a bus with seats for twelve persons between points within South Bend and the city of Niles, Mich. He paid the state registration fee, but refused to apply for a city license. In 1923, he was prosecuted by the city in a local court for violation of the ordinance and defended on the ground that it was invalid as applied to him. The case was heard on agreed facts. Sprout claimed, among other things, that the ordinance violated the commerce clause and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These claims were overruled; a penalty of $50 was imposed; and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 198 Ind. 563, 153 N. E. 504. (Rehearing denied, 154 N. E. 369, 49 A. L. R. 1198). The case is here on writ of error. Compare John P. King Manufacturing Co. v. City Council of Augusta, No. 392, \n277 \nU.S. 100\n, 48 S. Ct. 489, this day decided. \n\n[277 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n The ordinance prescribes license fees varying with the seating capacity of the bus. That for a bus with seats for twelve persons is $50 a year. Before the license can issue, the applicant must file with the city a contract of liability insurance providing for the payment of any final judgment that may be rendered for damages to property or the person resulting from the negligent operation of the bus within the city. The amount of insurance required is limited to a liability of $1,000 to any one person and of $2,500 for damages arising from a single accident. The insurance must be furnished by a company authorized to do business within the state. These requirements apply alike to busses operating wholly within the city and to those operating from points within it to points without. The ordinance makes no distinction between busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, those engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, and those engaged in both classes of commerce. Nor does the ordinance, in its requirement of liability insurance, distinguish in terms between liability to passengers travelling interstate and other liability resulting from negligent operation.\n The claim that the ordinance violates the Fourteenth Amendment is rested mainly upon the ground that Sprout is required to furnish insurance issued by a company authorized to do business in Indiana. That contention may be quickly disposed of. The provision limiting the insurance to such companies is obviously a reasonable one so far as Sprout is concerned. Compare La Tourette v. McMaster, \n248 \nU.S. 465, 468\n, 39 S. Ct. 160. The further objection that the requirement discriminates against insurance companies not authorized to do business within the state is not open to the plaintiff in error. Cronin v. Adams, \n192 \nU.S. 108, 114\n, 24 S. Ct. 219; Erie R. R. Co. v. Williams, \n233 \nU.S. 685, 705\n, 34 S. Ct. 761, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1097; Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 149\n, 39 S. Ct. 237.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n The claim that the ordinance violates the commerce clause presents questions requiring serious consideration. Sprout did not carry passengers from one point in South Bend to another. He was not a local carrier. Primarily his business was interstate. But the agreed facts show that he was not engaged exclusively in interstate commerce. The distance from the north city limits of South Bend to Niles is about nine miles. Half of this distance lies within Indiana. Along the highway traversed within that state lie many suburban residences and one village tributary to South Bend. Sprout purported to offer transportation from that city only to persons destined to points in Michigan. He required that all passengers from South Bend pay the fare to some Michigan point. But, in fact, he served suburban passengers. He made stops habitually at points within Indiana in order to permit passengers from South Bend to leave the bus before the state line was reached. The legal character of this suburban bus traffic was not affected by the device of requiring the payment of a fare fixed for some Michigan point or by Sprout's professing that he sought only passengers destined to that state. The actual facts govern. For this purpose, the destination intended by the passenger when he begins his journey and known to the carrier, determines the character of the commerce. Compare Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. Hancock, \n253 \nU.S. 284\n, 40 S. Ct. 512; Baltimore & Ohio S. W. R. R. Co. v. Settle, \n260 \nU.S. 166, 171\n, 43 S. Ct. 28. The suburban traffic was intrastate commerce.\n The Supreme Court of Indiana, Sprout v. City of South Bend, 198 Ind. 563, 153 N. E. 504, 49 A. L. R. 1198, did not pass upon the question whether Sprout, by reason of the suburban traffic, was engaged also in intrastate traffic. Nor did it consider whether his rights as an interstate carrier would be affected by his engaging also in intrastate business. It affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the broad ground that, since Sprout made use of the streets in 'the \n\n[277 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n indiscriminate solicitation and acceptance of passengers,' he was 'within the police power of the state to license and regulate both driver and vehicle by way of providing for the safety, security and general welfare of the public.'\n It is true that, in the absence of federal legislation covering the subject, the state may impose, even upon vehicles using the highways exclusively in interstate commerce, nondiscriminatory regulations for the purpose of insuring the public safety and convenience; that licensing or registration of busses is a measure appropriate to that end; and that a license fee no larger in amount than is reasonably required to defray the expense of administering the regulations may be demanded. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135\n, 47 S. Ct. 548; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 702. Compare Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S. Ct. 632. These powers may also be exercised by a city if authorized to do so by appropriate legislation. Compare Erb v. Morasch, \n177 \nU.S. 584, 585\n, 20 S. Ct. 819; Mackay Telegraph Co. v. Little Rock, \n250 \nU.S. 94, 99\n, 39 S. Ct. 428. Such regulations rest for their validity upon the same basis as do state inspection laws, Patapsco Guano Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n171 \nU.S. 345\n, 18 S. Ct. 862; Red 'C' Oil Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n222 \nU.S. 380\n, 32 S. Ct. 152, and municipal ordinances imposing on telegraph companies, though engaged in interstate commerce, a tax to defray the expense incident to the inspection of poles and wires. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. New Hope, \n187 \nU.S. 419\n, 23 S. Ct. 204; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 258\n, 39 S. Ct. 265; Mackay Telegraph Co. v. Little Rock, \n250 \nU.S. 94, 99\n, 39 S. Ct. 428. But it does not appear that the license fee here in question was imposed as an incident of such a scheme of municipal regulation; nor that the proceeds were applied to defraying the expenses of such regulation; nor that the amount collected under the ordinance was no more than was reasonably required for such a purpose. It follows that the exaction of the license fee \n\n[277 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n cannot be sustained as a police measure. Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 \nU.S. 160, 164\n, 23 S. Ct. 817; Postal- Telegraph Cable Co. v. New Hope, \n192 \nU.S. 55\n, 24 S. Ct. 204; Barrett v. New York, \n232 \nU.S. 14, 32\n, 34 S. Ct. 203. Compare Foote & Co. v. Stanley, \n232 \nU.S. 494, 503\n, 34 S. Ct. 377.\n It is true also that a state may impose, even on motor vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, a reasonable charge as their fair contribution to the cost of constructing and maintaining the public highways. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, No. 197, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 230, decided February 20, 1928. And this power also may be delegated in part to a municipality by appropriate legislation. Compare St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 \nU.S. 92, 98\n, 13 S. Ct. 485; Id., \n149 \nU.S. 465\n, 13 S. Ct. 990. An exaction for that purpose may be included in a license fee. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 U.S. 160\n, 168-169, 37 S. Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 702. But no part of the license fee here in question may be assumed to have been prescribed for that purpose. A flat tax, substantial in amount, and the same for busses plying the streets continuously in local service and for busses making, as do many interstate busses, only a single trip daily, could hardly have been designed as a measure of the cost or value of the use of the highways. And there is no suggestion, either in the language of the ordinance or in the construction put upon it by the Supreme Court of Indiana, that the proceeds of the license fees are, in any part, to be applied to the construction or maintenance of the city streets. Compare Tomlinson v. City of Indianapolis, 144 Ind. 142, 43 N. E. 9, 36 L. R. A. 413; City of Terre Haute v. Kersey, 159 Ind. 300, 64 N. E. 469, 95 Am. St. Rep. 298; Hogan v. City of Indianapolis, 159 Ind. 523, 65 N. E. 525.\n It follows that on the record before us the exaction of the license fee cannot be sustained either as an inspection fee or as an excise for the use of the streets of the city. It remains to consider whether it can be sustained as an occupation tax. A state may, by appropriate legisla- \n\n[277 U.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n tion, require payment of an occupation tax from one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce.

Compare Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 257\n, 39 S. Ct. 265. But in order that the fee or tax shall be valid, it must appear that it is imposed solely on account of the intrastate business; that the amount exacted is not increased because of the interstate business done; that one engaged exclusively in interstate commerce would not be subject to the imposition; and that the person taxed could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate business.

Ct. 265. The Supreme Court of Indiana, far from construing the ordinance as applicable solely to busses engaged in intrastate commerce, assumed that it applied to busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, and that Sprout was so engaged. The privilege of engaging in such commerce is one which a state cannot deny. Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 407\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. 286; Bush & Sons Co. v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 417\n, 45 S. Ct. 326, 327. A state is equally inhibited from conditioning its exercise on the payment of an occupation tax.\n Objection under the commerce clause is made also to the requirement of liability insurance. There being grave dangers incident to the operation of motor vehicles, a state may require users of such vehicles on the public \n\n[277 U.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n highways to file contracts providing adequate insurance for the payment of judgments recovered for certain injuries, resulting from their operation.

Such provisions for insurance are not, even as applied to busses engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, an unreasonable burden on that commerce, if limited to damages suffered within the state by persons other than the passenger. Whether the insurance here prescribed is, because of its scope, obnoxious to the commerce clause, we need not inquire. Compare Barrett v. New York, \n232 \nU.S. 14, 33\n, 34 S.

Huffman Lewis, both of Shreveport, La., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause was heard by a specially constituted District Court-three judges. Judicial Code,  238, 266 (28 USCA  345, 380). It dismissed the bill and directed that the costs, together with 10 per cent. damages, be assessed against appellant. The opinion of the court, considered with the argument here, so plainly demonstrates the lack of merit in the claims advanced that we need not discuss them at length.\n The appellant owns a line of railroad lying partly in Bossier parish, La.; also all stock of the corporate owner of the bridge over Red river at Bossier City. Purporting to proceed as directed by the state statute, the police jury of that parish undertook to create from the major part of its territory a consolidated road district, to issue bonds thereof to pay for constructing a highway therein and to lay an ad valorem tax upon all property within the district to meet the obligation. Appellant asked for an injunction prohibiting any attempt to \n\n[277 U.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n collect the taxes levied and assessed for the year 1926. None of the alleged grounds for relief is substantial.\n In Louisiana the police jury, subordinate to the state Legislature, is the governing body of the parish. A statute of the state empowers these juries to create road districts from such portions of their parishes as they may determine, and, with the approval of a popular vote, to construct roads and issue bonds to pay therefor.\n The validity of this statute is challenged upon the ground that it fails to provide the taxpayer with proper opportunity to be heard. A sufficient short answer is that under the repeated decisions here this is not essential. Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester County, \n261 \nU.S. 155\n, 43 S. Ct. 261; Hancock v. Muskogee, \n250 \nU.S. 454\n, 39 S. Ct. 528. But here in fact the appellant had abundant opportunity to present objections to the proposed plan.\n We find nothing in the Constitution of Louisiana, when reasonably construed, which inhibited the collection in 1926 of a tax partly intended to supply funds to meet installments of principal and interest upon bonds maturing in March, 1927\n\n\n As the assailed tax was general and ad valorem, its legality does not depend upon the receipt of any special benefit by the taxpayer.\n The local statutes provided ample opportunity for the appellant to contest the valuation of its property for taxation purposes.\n Without doubt a local legislative body, when properly authorized, may lay general ad valorem taxes upon all property within its jurisdiction, including that of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce, without violating the Federal Constitution. That such taxation does not amount to regulation of interstate commerce is settled doctrine.\n The decree below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD PIPE LINE CO. v.

MILLER COUNTY HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE DIST.(1928)\nNo. 577\nArgued: April 20, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. Wm. H. Arnold, of Texarkana, Ark., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry Moore, Jr., of Texarkana, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS announced the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, begun in the United States District Court, Western District of Arkansas, May 21, 1924, seeks an injunction to restrain the Miller county highway and bridge district from attempting to collect road improvement taxes upon petitioner's property.\n Apparently, petitioner, complainant in the original bill, owns 25 miles of pipe, laid in two parallel and adjacent lines through respondent district, used for interstate transportation of oil; also, for use in connec- \n\n[277 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n tion therewith, some miles of telegraph and telephone wire, of small value, strung upon leased poles. The total average original cost of the pipe lines (constructed partly in 1909 and partly in 1915) was less than $9,000 per mile. The officers of the district seem to have assessed benefits to be received by all this property from proposed improvements to highways at $ 60,000. Claiming that the assessment was 'wholly unwarranted, unlawful, grossly disproportionate and palpably arbitrary and in discrimination against the property,' the bill asked for an injunction, etc.\n After answer, much proof was taken. The District Court made the following findings of fact and law:\n\n\n (1)\n That the construction of the highway has not added anything and will add nothing to the value of the property of plaintiff taxed for its construction and maintenance.\n\n\n (2)\n The construction of the highway of defendant has not added and will not add anything to the revenue which is obtained by plaintiff by the transportation of oil through its pipe lines.\n\n\n (3)\n The levy of a tax of $5,000 a mile upon plaintiff's right of way, the pipe line and telegraph and telephone wires and lines in the Miller county highway and bridge district, is not laid upon the same plan that is followed with regard to other lands in the district.\n\n\n (4)\n The levy of $5,000 a mile is palpably arbitary.\n\n\n (5)\n The alleged benefit to plaintiff's property by the construction of the highway is speculative and conjectural.\n\n\n (6)\n Plaintiff is not estopped from maintaining this suit.\n\n\n (7)\n The act of the Legislature of Arkansas, purporting to validate generally the levy of the tax made by the defendant upon the property in the district, is not effective to validate the levy upon plaintiff's right of way and pipe lines, because, as to plaintiff's property, such levy is arbitrary. \n\n[277 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n And upon these findings it ordered an injunction as prayed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rendered a written opinion April 18, 1927 (19 F. (2d) 3), wherein it held that the pipe lines were real property, subject to assessment for benefits like other realty, and that the evidence indicated petitioner's lines received some benefit from the improved highways; also 'that the procedure by which the value of the particular property of the appellee was arrived at and the amount of the benefits determined does not commend itself to us as altogether fair, nor is the tax imposed against appellee entirely equitable as between it and other property owners within the district; but this, standing alone, is not decisive of the question.' After citing a number of cases decided here and in the lower federal courts, it further said:\n'The tendency of these very late authorities is to greatly narrow the constitutional grounds of objection to assessments of this character. They forbid us to weigh the benefits against the burdens, and require us to hold in the instant case that under all the circumstances there was sufficient justification for the legislative determination that appellee's property was benefited.'\n\n It made no ruling upon the claim set up by the district that, as petitioner had failed to avail itself of the appeal to commissioners, provided by the statute, it could not maintain the bill.\n While it may be that the pipe lines received some small benefit from the road improvements, we regard the assessment actually made against them as arbitrary and unreasonable in amount.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals announced its conclusion without knowledge of our opinion in Road Improvement District No. 1, etc., v. Missouri Pacific R. Co. (April 18, 1927) \n274 \nU.S. 188\n, 47 S. Ct. 563. Its opinion indicates that, if our views there stated had been known a different conclusion might have been reached. In the circumstances, it seems \n\n[277 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n best to reverse the challenged decree and remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals for a new hearing, as though upon the original appeal, and for such other action as may be necessary properly to protect the rights of the parties.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSISSIPPI, FOR USE OF ROBERTSON v. MILLER(1928)\nNo. 206\nArgued: January 20, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. Stokes V. Robertson, of Jackson, Miss., for petitioner.\n Mr. Marion W. Reily, of Meridian, Miss., for defendant. \n\n[276 U.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The record presents for decision the question whether, as applied in this case, chapter 170, Laws 1924, amending section 7068 of Hemingway's Annotated Code of Mississippi contravenes the clause of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution, which declares that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligtion of constracts.\n The suit was brought by the state, in the circuit court of Hinds county, for the use of Robertson, hereinafter called plaintiff, who in 1923 and prior years had been the state revenue agent. It is against his immediate successor in office, Miller, whom we shall call defendant, and the surety on his official bond. The purpose is to recover commissions on certain amounts collected by defendant on account of past-due taxes for which plaintiff while in office had brought suits. Plaintiff claims under statutory provisions that were in force while he was in office, and defendant claims under the act here in question, which was passed after the expiration of plaintiff's term. Section 7056 of the Code authorized the state revenue agent to appoint deputies and to sue for past-due taxes. Section 7066 declared:\n'Neither the state nor any county, municipality, or levee board shall be chargeable with any fees or expenses on account of any investigation or suit made or instituted by the state revenue agent; and he shall not receive any salary; but he shall be entitled to retain, as full compensation for his services and expenses, twenty per centum of all amounts collected and paid over by him. ...'\n\n Section 7068 directed the successor to allow suits theretofore commenced to be conducted in his name and provided that:\n'The person who commenced the suit shall pay all attorney's fees and expenses thereof, and receive the commissions, if any.'\n\n Acting under these sections, plaintiff appointed deputies to assist in making collections and agreed to pay them one-half the commission allowed by law. He employed \n\n[276 U.S. 174, 176]\n\u00a0\n an attorney to bring suits and agreed to pay him one-fourth of such sommissions. There remained a fourth for plaintiff, 5 per cent. of the amounts collected. Certain suits which were brought by plaintiff to collect past-due income taxes and privilege taxes, were pending when his term expired. He notified defendant of the agreements he had made with his deputies and attorney. Some amounts sued for remained unpaid until after the passage of chapter 170 on February 29, 1924. That act amends section 7068. Section 1 authorizes every suit brought by the outgoing agent and then pending to be conducted in the name of the successor upon the motion and petition of the latter directed to the court showing that he has investigated its merits and believes it is just and should be maintained, and the section declares that contracts of the former agent with his attorneys and employees shall be binding on the successor. Section 2 provides that:\n'The expenses of all suits where the successor of the revenue agent has joined therein as above provided shall be paid by them equally and all fees and commission legally derived thereform shall be shared equally between them.'\n\n After the passage of that act, there was paid by various taxpayers to the defendant $9,784.07, on account of past-due taxes claimed in suits brought by plaintiff. It does not appear that defendant took any step to have any of these suits carried on; but, claiming to be entitled to a part of them under chapter 170, he refused to pay over the commissions for the use of plaintiff, his deputies and attorney. Then plaintiff brought this suit to recover 5 per cent. of the amount so collected by defendant, that being the portion of the commissions remaining for him after deducting the amounts which his deputies and attorney were entitled to have under their agreements with him. The circuit court gave plaintiff judgment for one- half the amount sued for. He appealed to the Supreme Court, and there contended that, if applied in this case, \n\n[276 U.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n chapter 170 would impair the contract obligation of the state that he be paid for services rendered before its enactment, and would therefore violate the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. The court overruled his contention, applied the enactment retroactively, and affirmed the judgment. 144 Miss. 614, 109 So. 900.\n If chapter 170 had not been passed, plaintiff, his deputies, and attorney would have been entitled to 20 per cent. of the amounts collected by defendant. Under the statutes in force in 1923, the commissions were earned by the investigation to discover past-due taxes and the institution of suits to coerce delinquent taxpayers, and such commissions became payable upon the collection of taxes sued for. In its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court said (page 623 (109 So. 903)):\n'It is the law, as contended by appellant, that, where the revenue agent brings a suit for taxes due the state or any of its political subdivisions, and afterwards the taxes are paid by the defendant taxpayer, the revenue agent is entitled to the commissions allowed him by the statute'-citing Garrett v. Robertson, 120 Miss. 731, 83 So. 177; Robertson v. Shelton, 127 Miss. 360, 90 So. 83; Miller v. Henry, 139 Miss. 651, 103 So. 203; Miller v. Johnson, 144 Miss. 201, 109 So. 715.\n\n And chapter 170 did not operate to take from plaintiff's deputies and attorney any part of their shares of the commissions. Miller v. Johnson grew out of the suits and collections that form the basis of this case. Johnson (Johnston) was the attorney who brought plaintiff's suits against taxpayers. He sued Miller, defendant here, and was given judgment for his 5 per cent. of the amounts collected. The Supreme Court decided that under chapter 170 Miller was authorized to prosecute the suits brought by plaintiff, that the taxes sued for having been paid, it must be held that there was merit in the suits and that those employed by plaintiff were entitled to compensation under their contracts. Cf. Miller v. Hay, 143 Miss. 471, 109 So. 16.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n The state court had to determine whether defendant was entitled to one- half the commissions remaining after deducting the shares of plaintiff's deputies and attorney. Plainitff was authorized under section 7068 before amendment, to carry on in the name of his successor the suits he had commenced, and was required to pay all expenses. In the absence of chapter 170, defendant would have had no authority in respect of the suits. That enactment authorized the revenue agent to look into the merits of pending suits brought by his predecessor and 'submit to the courts in which the same were pending the question whether such suits should be prosecuted or not.' 144 Miss. 626 (109 So. 904). In the interval between the bringing of the suits by plaintiff and payments by taxpayers to defendant, the Legislature conferred on his successor an authority not theretofore given, and, apparently deeming the contemplated services to be necessary and valuable, declared that expenses should be borne and commission divided equally between the revenue agent who brought the suit and his successor. The act did not empower defendant to do anything upon which plaintiff's right to the commissions depended. It authorized something not contemplated by the statute in effect when plaintiff brought the suits and became entitled to the commissions. As it does not appear that defendant took any step authorized by chapter 170, presumably the collections resulted from the bringing of the suits without more. See Johnson v. Miller, supra; Garrett v. Robertson, supra, 743 (83 So. 177). As applied by the state courts, the new law operated to take part of the commissions earned by plaintiff and to hand it over to his successor on account of an unexerted authority to apply to the court to have the suits carrie on-a step never before deemed necessary or contemplated in connection with collections of such taxes.\n It is well understood that the contract clause does not limit the power of a state during the terms of its officers to pass and give effect to laws prescribing for the \n\n[276 U.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n future the duties to be performed by, or the salaries or other compensation to be paid to, them. Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402. But, after services have been rendered by a public officer under a law specifying his compensation, there arises an implied contract under which he is entitled to have the amount so fixed. And the constitutional protection extends to such contracts just as it does to those specifically expressed. The selection of plaintiff to be the revenue agent amounted to a request or direction by the state that he exert the authority and discharge all the duties of that office. In the performance of services so required of him plaintiff made the investigations and brought the suits to discover and collect the delinquent taxes. Under the statutes then in force as construed by the highest court of the state, he thereupon became entitled to the specified percentages of the amounts subsequently collected on account of the taxes sued for. The retroactive application of chapter 170 would take from him a part of the amount that he had theretofore earned. That would impair the obligation of the implied contract under which he became entitled to the commissions. This case is ruled by Fisk v. Jefferson Police Jury, \n116 \nU.S. 131\n, 6 S. Ct. 329.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NEW MEXICO v. STATE OF TEXAS(1928)\n\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n Messrs. Frank W.

SEATTLE TITLE TRUST CO. v. ROBERGE(1928)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n Messrs. Corwin S. Shank and Glenn J. Fairbrook, both of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. C. Van Soelen, Thomas J. L. Kennedy, and Arthur Schramm, Jr., all of Seattle, Wash., for defendant in error. \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Since 1914, the above-named trustee has owned and maintained a philanthropic home for aged poor. It is located about 6 miles from the business center of Seattle, on a tract 267 feet wide, extending from Seward Park avenue to Lack Washington, having an average depth of more that 700 feet and an area of about 5 acres. The home is a structure built for and formerly used as a private residence. It is large enough to accommodate about 14 guests, and usually it has had about that number. The trustee proposes to remove the old building and in its place, at a cost of about $100,000, to erect an attractive 2 1\/2-story fire proof house large enough to be a home for 30 persons. The structure would be located 280 feet from the avenue on the west and about 400 feet from the lake on the east, cover 4 per cent. of the tract, and be mostly hidden by trees and shrubs. The distance between it and the nearest building on the south would be 110 feet, on the north 160, and on the west 365.\n A comprehensive zoning ordinance (No. 45382) passed in 1923 divided the city into six use districts, and provided that, with certain exceptions not material here, no building should be erected for any purpose other than that permitted in the district in which the site is located (section 2). The land in question is in the 'first residence district.' The ordinance permitted in that district single family dwellings, public schools, certain private schools, churches, parks and playgrounds, an art gallery, private conservatories for plants and flowers, railroad and shelter stations (section 3a). And, upon specified conditions, it also permitted garages, stables, buildings for domestic animals, the office of physician, dentist, or other professional person when located in his or her dwelling (section 3b), fraternity, sorority, and boarding houses, a community clubhouse, a memorial building, nurseries, greenhouses, and buildings necessary \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 118]\n\u00a0\n for the operation of public utilities (section 3c). It declared that the section should not be construed to prohibit the use of vacant property in such district for gardening or fruit raising, or its temporary use for fairs, circuses, or similar purposes (section 3e). By an ordinance (No. 49179) passed in 1925, section 3c was amended by adding:\n'A philanthropic home for children or for old people shall be permitted in first residence district when the written consent shall have been obtained of the owners of two-thirds of the property within four hundred (400) feet of the proposed building.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[278 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n Subsequently the trustee, without having obtained consents of other landowners in accordance with the provision just quoted, applied for a permit to erect the new home. It is the superintendent's official duty to issue permits for buildings about to be erected in accordance with valid enactments and regulations. He denied the application solely because of the trustee's failure to furnish such consents. Then the trustee brought this suit in the superior court of King county to secure its judgment and writ commanding the superintendent to issue the permit; and it maintained throughout that the ordinance, if construed to prevent the erection of the proposed building, is arbitrary and repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. That court held that the amended ordinance so construed is valid and dismissed the case. Its judgment was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 144 Wash. 74, 256 P. 781.\n\n The trustee concedes that our recent decisions require that in its general scope the ordinance be held valid.

Is the delegation of power to owners of adjoining land to make inoperative the permission, given by section 3(c) as amended, repugnant to the due process clause? Zoning \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n measures must find their justification in the police power exerted in the interest of the public. Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., supra, 387 of 272 U. S. (47 S. Ct. 118). 'The governmental power to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of the landowner by restricting the character of his use, is not unlimited and, other questions aside, such restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.' Nectow v. Cambridge, supra, page 188 of 277 U. S. (48 S. Ct. 448). Legislatures may not, under the guise of the police power impose restrictions that are unnecessary and unreasonable upon the use of private property or the pursuit of useful activities. Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 137\n, 14 S. Ct. 499; Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590, 594\n, 37 S. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973; Meyer v.

Ct. 426.\n The right of the trustee to devote its land to any legitimate use is property within the protection of the Constitution. The facts disclosed by the record make it clear that the exclusion of the new home from the first district is not indispensable to the general zoning plan. And there is no legislative determination that the proposed building and use would be inconsistent with public health, safety, morals or general welfare. The enactment itself plainly implies the contrary. The grant of permission for such building and use, although purporting to be subject to such consents, shows that the legislative body found that the construction and maintenance of the new home was in harmony with the public interest and with the general scope and plan of the zoning ordinance. The section purports to give the owners of less than one-half the land within 400 feet of the proposed building authority- \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n -uncontrolled by any standard or rule prescribed by legislative action-to prevent the trustee from using its land for the proposed home. The superintendent is bound by the decision or inaction of such owners. There is no provision for review under the ordinance; their failure to give consent is final. They are not bound by any official duty, but are free to withhold consent for selfish reasons or arbitrarily and may subject the trustee to their will or caprice. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 366\n, 368 S., 6 S. Ct. 1064. The delegation of power so attempted is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 33 S. Ct. 76, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1123; Browning v. Hooper, \n269 \nU.S. 396\n, 46 S. Ct. 141.\n Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526\n, 37 S. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594, involved an ordinance prohibiting the putting up of any billboard in a residential district without the consent of owners of a majority of the frontage on both sides of the street in the block where the board was to be erected. The question was whether the clause requiring such consents was an unconstitutional delegation of power and operated to invalidate the prohibition. The case was held unlike Eubank v. Richmond, supra, and the ordinance was fully sustained. The facts found were sufficient to warrant the conclusion that such billboards would or were liable to endanger the safety and decency of such districts. Pages 529, 530 of 242 U. S. (37 S. Ct. 190). It is not suggested that the proposed new home for aged poor would be a nuisance. We find nothing in the record reasonably tending to show that its construction or maintenance is liable to work any injury, inconvenience or annoyance to the community, the district or any person. The facts shown clearly distinguish the proposed building and use from such billboards or other uses which by reason of their nature are liable to be offensive.\n As the attempted delegation of power cannot be sustained, and the restriction thereby sought to be put upon \n\n[278 U.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n the permission is arbitrary and repugnant to the due process clause, it is the duty of the superintendent to issue, and the trustee is entitled to have, the permit applied for.\n We need not decide whether, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, it is within the power of the state or municipality by a general zoning law to exclude the proposed new home from a district defined as is the first district in the ordinance under consideration.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The pertinent provisions of the ordinance as amended follow:\n The title is:\n An ordinance regulating and restricting the location of trades and industries; regulating and limiting the use of buildings and premises and the height and size of buildings; providing for yards, courts or other open spaces; and establishing districts for the said purposes.\n Section 2:\n (a) For the purpose of regulating, classifying and restricting the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings designed, erected or altered for specified uses, the city of Seattle is hereby divided into six (6) use districts, namely: First residence district, second residence district, business district, commercial district, manufacturing district and industrial district.\n (b) The boundaries of the aforesaid districts are laid out and shown upon the map designated 'Use Map,' filed in the office of the city comptroller and ex-officio city clerk. ...

Co.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff brought this action in the circuit court for Clatsop county, Oregon, as beneficiary of a policy by which the defendant had insured the life of her husband, Anton Stipcich. The case was removed for diversity of citizenship to the United States District Court for Oregon. The company defended principally on the ground that \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n 'Stipcich, after applying for the insurance and before the delivery of the policy and payment of the first premium, had suffered a recurrence of a duodenal ulcer, which later caused his death, and that he failed to reveal this information to the company.\n It was shown on the trial by uncontradicted evidence that after his application Stipcich consulted two physicians and that they told him that an operation for the removal of the ulcer was necessary. Plaintiff then made tender of evidence to the effect that Stipcich had communicated this information to Coblentz, the defendant's agent who had solicited the policy, and that the visit to the second doctor was made at Coblentz' request to confirm the diagnosis of the first.\n The proffered evidence was excluded, and at the close of the whole case, and over plaintiff's objection, the court directed a verdict for the defendant (8 F.(2d) 285), stating that it did so because Stipcich was under a duty to inform the defendant of his knowledge of the serious ailment of which he had learned after making application for insurance, and that he had failed in that duty since his communication of the facts to Coblentz did not amount to notice of them to the insurance company. The case was taken on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That court certified to this certain questions of law presented by the case. Judicial Code,  239 (28 USCA  346), Without answering, we ordered the entire record to be sent up and the case is here as though on writ of error (48 S. Ct. 205, 72 L. Ed. -).\n An insurer may, of course, assume the risk of such changes in the insured's health as may occur between the date of application and the date of the issuance of a policy. Where the parties contract exclusively on the basis of conditions as they existed at the date of the application, the failure of the insured to divulge any later known changes in health may well not affect the policy. Mutual Ben. Life Insurance Co. v. Higginbotham, \n95 U.S. 380\n. See New York \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n Life Insurance Co. v. Moats (C. C. A.) 207 F. 481; Grier v. Insurance Co., 132 N. C. 542, 44 S. E. 28. Compare Gardner v. North State Mutual Life Insurance Co., 163 N. C. 367, 79 S. E. 806, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 714, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 652. But there is no contention here that the parties contracted exclusively on the basis of conditions at the time of the application. Here both by the terms of the application and familiar rules governing the formation of contracts no contract came into existence until the delivery of the policy, and at that time the insured had learned of conditions gravely affecting his health, unknown at the time of making his application.\n Insurance policies are traditionally contracts uberrimae fidei and a failure by the insured to disclose conditions affecting the risk, of which he is aware, makes the contract voidable at the insurer's option. Carter v. Boehm, 3 Burrows, 1905; Livingston v. Maryland Insurance Co., 6 Cranch, 274; McLanahan v. Universal Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 170; Phoenix Life Insurance Co. v. Raddin, \n120 \nU.S. 183, 189\n, 7 S. Ct. 500 (30 L. Ed. 644); Hardman v. Firemen's Insurance Co. (C. C.) 20 F. 594.\n Concededly, the modern practice of requiring the applicant for life insurance to answer questions prepared by the insurer has relaxed this rule to some extent, since information not asked for is presumably deemed immaterial. Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Mechanics' Savings Bank & Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 72 F. 413, 435-441, 38 L. R. A. 33, 70. See Clark v. Manufacturers' Insurance Co., 8 How. 235, 248, 249. Compare Phoenix Life Insurance Co. v. Raddin, \n120 \nU.S. 183, 190\n, 7 S. Ct. 500 (30 L. Ed. 644).\n But the reason for the rule still obtains, and with added force, as to changes materially affecting the risk which come to the knowledge of the insured after the application and before delivery of the policy. For even the most unsophisticated person must know that, in answering the questionnaire and submitting it to the insurer, he is furnishing the data on the basis of which the com- \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 317]\n\u00a0\n pany will decide whether, by issuing a policy, it wishes to insure him. If, while the company deliberates, he discovers facts which make portions of his application no longer true, the most elementary spirit of fair dealing would seem to require him to make a full disclosure. \n1\n If he fails to do so the company may, despite its acceptance of the application, decline to issue a policy, Canning v. Farquhar, 16 Q. B. D. 727; McKenzie v. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., 26 Ga. App. 225, 105 S. E. 720; or, if a policy has been issued, it has a valid defense to a suit upon it, Equitable Life Assurance Society v. McElroy (C. C. A.) 83 F. 631, 636, 637. Compare Traill v. Baring, 4 De G., J. & S. 318; Allis-Chalmers Co. v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n Maryland, 114 L. T. 433. Compare Piedmont & Arlington Life Insurance Co. v. Ewing, \n92 U.S. 377\n.\n This generally recognized rule, in the absence of authoritative local decision, we take to be the law of Oregon. Its application here is not affected by Oregon Laws,  6426 (1) (c), which provides that the policy shall set forth the entire contract between the parties. The defendant in insisting that Stipcich was under an obligation to disclose his discovery to it is not attempting to add another term to the contract. The obligation was not one stipulated for by the parties, but is one imposed by law as a result of the relationship assumed by them and because of the peculiar character of the insurance contract. The necessity for complying with it is not dispensed with by the failure of the insurer to stipulate in the policy for such disclosure.\n The evidence proffered and rejected tended to show that the insured, in good faith, made the required disclosure to Coblentz who, for some purposes, admittedly represented the defendant. If he represented it for this purpose the evidence should have been received. Coblentz was the licensed agent of respondent under Oregon Laws,  6425, which provides that every life insurance company doing business in the state 'shall give written notice to the insurance commissioner of the name and residence of, and obtain from him a license for every person appointed by it to act as its agent within this state, which license shall state, in substance, that the company is authorized to do business in this state and that the person named therein is constituted an agent of the company for the transaction of business in this state. ...' The insured knew no other agent of defendant and dealt with Coblentz alone. So far as appears, no other person or agency was designated under the statute or held out by the defendant as representing it in connection with \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n Stipcich's application for insurance or the delivery of the policy or as the appropriate person or agency to receive information concerning either of them. The insured delivered the application to Coblentz and later paid to him the first premium, receiving in return the policy and a receipt executed by Coblentz in defendant's name. In communicating to him the information as to his changed condition of health Stipcich acted only in what must have appeared to him the most natural and obvious way to supplement the information already given in his written application.\n Defendant relies on the established rule, here expressed in part at least in the printed clause of the application, incorporated in the policy and printed in the margin,2 that the authority of a soliciting agent to receive the application and transmit it to the company and to deliver the policy when issued, does not include power to vary the terms of the contract, to waive conditions or to receive information sought by questions in the application other than that embodied in it. But Coblentz, when the insured communicated the information to him, did not purport to vary any term of waive any condition of the proposed insurance contract; he did not acquiesce in a variation of the application; nor in connection with the preparation of the written application did he receive any information not written into it. The insured merely communicated information, supplementing the application, to the designated agent of the company for the transaction of business in the state, as the most natural and appropriate channel of communication to the company. \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n In insisting that it was entitled to information of the insured's change of health after the application, but that such information could not be effectively communicated to its agent to receive the application and transact business with insured preliminary to the acceptance of the risk, defendant is not aided by the stipulations of the policy and any doubts as to the agent's implied authority to receive it must be resolved in the light of the Oregon statutes. Oregon Laws,  6435, reads as follows:\n'Any person who shall solicit and procure an application for life insurance shall, in all matters relating to such application for insurance and the policy issued in consequence thereof, be regarded as the agent of the company issuing the policy and not the agent of the insured, and all provisions in the application and policy to the contrary are void and of no effect whatever.'\n\n Provisions of this character are controlling when inconsistent with the terms of a policy issued after their enactment. National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71\n, 43 S. Ct. 32; Continental Life Insurance Co. v. Chamberlain, \n132 \nU.S. 304\n, 10 S. Ct. 87; Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., \n205 \nU.S. 489\n, 27 S. Ct. 578. Here the statute does more than provide that the soliciting agent in matters relating to the application and policy does not represent the insured. In connection with those matters it makes him the agent of the company, a phrase which would be meaningless unless the statute when applied to the facts of the case indicated in what respects he represented the company. Here the statute in terms defines the scope of his agency to the extent that he is stated to represent the company 'in all matters relating to such application for insurance and the policy issued in consequence' of it. We need not inquire what are the outer limits of that authority, but we think this language plainly makes him the representative of the company in connection with all those matters which, in the usual \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n course of effecting insurance are incidental to the application and the delivery of the policy.\n Within the requirements of the statute the company may provide by stipulations in the application or other appropriate notice for a suitable method of giving the information, by writing, in a supplemental application or otherwise, or may stipulate, as is not unusual, that the insurance shall not attach on delivery of the policy unless the insured is in good health. To say that under this statute the company's agent to solicit and receive the application and deliver the policy is not its agent also to receive disclosures which supplement the application and which vitally affect the validity of the insurance if not disclosed, is to disregard its language and ignore the obvious purpose of such legislation to require the company to provide some agency within the state with which the insured may safely deal in matters relating to his application. See Continental Life Insurance Co. v. Chamberlain, supra.\n Much reliance is placed by respondent on Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hilton-Green, \n241 \nU.S. 613\n, 36 S. Ct. 676, where a somewhat similar statute was involved. But there answers known by the insured and the agent to be false were written into the signed application by the agent. Such fraudulent representations known and participated in by the insured obviously could not have estopped the company, but there is nothing in the present case to suggest that the insured was a party to or intended any concealment from the company.\n The defendant also argues that it is not affected by the disclosures to the agent because the application provided:\n'That any statement made to or by, or any knowledge on the part of, any agent, medical examiner or any other person as to any facts pertaining to the applicant shall not be considered as having been made to or brought to the \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the company unless stated in either part A or B of this application.'\n\n But when Stipcich learned of his condition and told Coblentz about it, neither of them had possession of the application. That had been filled out and sent to the home office of respondent in New York, and disclosure 'in either part A or B of this application' of a fact which did not occur until after the application was completed was obviously impossible. It is said that compliance with this provision, even though impossible, was a condition precedent to the securing of insurance. But narrow and unreasonable interpretations of clauses in an insurance policy are not favored. They are prepared by the insurer and if, with equal reason, open to two constructions, that most favorable to the insured will be adopted. Mutual Insurance Co. v. Hurni Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 44 S. Ct. 90, 31 A. L. R. 102; Thompson v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n136 \nU.S. 287\n, 10 S. Ct. 1019; American Surety Co. v. Pauly, \n170 \nU.S. 133, 144\n, 18 S. Ct. 552 (42 L. Ed. 977). The clause must therefore be taken to apply to information given or available when the application was prepared and as inapplicable to knowledge affecting the risk which insured acquired and communicated after the application was signed and delivered to the company's agent.\n The only questions certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the only questions pressed upon us here involve the correctness of the rulings of the trial court to which we have alluded. But the respondent's answer sets up that certain answers given in the written application as to the insured's recovery from his earlier illness, its recurrence, and with respect to consultation of physicians, were false and known by him to be false when he signed the application. It is now suggested that Stipcich in his application made a positive misrepresentation regarding a visit to a physician the day before he applied for insurance. If that were clearly established we would consider it neces- \n\n[277 U.S. 311, 323]\n\u00a0\n sary to affirm the judgment below, although we think the rulings on which it was based erroneous. But the particular questions and portions of the record relied on, in the light of the medical testimony, are not free from ambiguity. The point is not elaborated in the briefs of either party and was not pressed upon us on the argument. At no time in the entire course of the litigation does the effect of the answers appear to have received any consideration independently of the supposed failure to make sufficient disclosure to the company of knowledge acquired by the insured after the application. Nor, in the absence of the testimony as to the disclosure made to Coblentz, are we able to say what its bearing may be on the alleged misstatements in the application. Under such circumstances we must decline to pass upon this defense. Compare Southeastern Express Co. v. Robertson, \n264 \nU.S. 541\n, 44 S. Ct. 424; Ewing v. Howard, 7 Wall. 499, 503 (19 L. Ed. 293). The truthfulness of the answers and their effect will be open for consideration on the new trial.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The rule that changes in conditions material to the risk which occur between the opening of negotiations for insurance and the issuance of a policy must be divulged became first established in early British marine insurance.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR(1928)\nNo. 274\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederic E. Fuller, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Mark H. Wight and John H. Dunbar, both of Olympia, Wash., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits present the same questions, were heard together, and may be disposed of in one opinion, as they were below.\n They were brought to restrain the enforcement of an order, legislative in character, made by a state bureau-the objection to the order being that it is repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States in that it impinges on the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. The order was upheld by the trial court and by the Supreme Court of the state. 141 Wash. 172, 251 P. 130. The cases are here on writs of error sued out under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344(a).\n The order is a statute of the state within the meaning of that section, and therefore our jurisdiction is invoked in the right mode. John P. King Manufacturing Co. v. Augusta, \n277 \nU.S. 100\n, 48 S. Ct. 489, just decided, and cases there cited.\n The order requires each of the plaintiffs from time to time to report the number of men employed by it in the work about to be described; together with the wages paid to them, and to pay into the state's workmen's compensation fund, out of which injured employees are compensated, premiums or assessments based on such wages. \n\n[277 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff is one suit is conducting logging operations, a part of which consists in putting sawlogs into booms, after they have been thrown into a navigable river, so that they conveniently may be towed elsewhere for sale. The men are employed in the booming work. The plaintiff in the other suit conducts a sawmill on the bank of a navigable river. Logs are towed in booms to a point adjacent to the mill, and then anchored. The booms afterwards are taken apart, and the logs are guided to a conveyor extending into the river, and then drawn into the mill for sawing. The men are employed in taking apart the booms and guiding the logs to the conveyor. In both instances the place of work is on navigable water-in one it is done before actual transportation begins and in the other after the transportation is completed.\n It is settled by our decisions that, where the employment, although maritime in character, pertains to local matters, having only an incidental relation to navigation and commerce, the rights, obligations, and liabilities of the parties, as between themselves, may be regulated by local rules which do not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interfere with its uniformity.

King Manufacturing Co. v. City Council of Augusta, \n277 \nU.S. 100\n, 48 S. Ct. 489, 72 L.

Treating these writs of error as \n\n[277 U.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n petitions for certiorari (see Gaines v. Washington, \n277 \nU.S. 81\n, 48 S. Ct. 468, decided this day), we think that the petitions should be denied. The trivial character of the questions presented illustrates again the wisdom of not granting, in cases involving the orders of administrative boards, a review as of right-with its attendant right to oral argument. It is true that each of these cases presents a question involving the Federal Constitution. But in both the controlling principle is well settled, and the question presented is simply whether on the particular facts it is applicable. Obviously such a question is of no general importance. The number of administrative boards, state and municipal, with like power to issue orders is now very large. Each board issues many orders. And each order may, by its application to varying facts, give rise to many distinct constitutional questions. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.

It named as defendants the five leading packers; namely, Swift & Co., Armour & Co., Morris & Co., Wilson & Co., Inc., and the Cudahy Packing Company. And it joined with them 80 other corporations and 50 individuals, all but four of whom were associated with some one of the five defendants above named. The petition charged the defendants with attempting to monopolize a large proportion of the food supply of the nation and with attempting to extend the monopoly by methods set forth. It stated that the purpose of the suit was to put an end to the monopoly described and to deprive the defendants of the instrumentalities by which they were perfecting their attempts to monopolize. It sought a comprehensive injunction and also the divestiture of the instrumentalities described. \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n Simultaneously with the filing of the petition, all the defendants filed answers which denied material allegations of the bill. There was filed at the same time a stipulation, signed by all the parties to the suit, which provided that the court might, without finding any fact, enter the proposed decree therein set forth. On the same day a decree in the form so agreed upon was entered. To this decree all parties filed assents. In its opening paragraph, the decree embodied a clause of the stipulation to the effect that, while the several corporations and individual defendants 'maintain the truth of their answers and assert their innocence of any violation of law in fact or intent, they nevertheless, desiring to avoid every appearance of placing themselves in a position of antagonism to the government, have consented and do consent to the making and entry of the decree now about to be entered without any findings of fact, upon condition that their consents to the entry of said decree shall not constitute or be considered an admission, and the rendition or entry of said decree, or the decree itself, shall not constitute or be considered and adjudication that the defendants or any of them have in fact violated any law of the United States.'\n The decree declared, among other things, that the court had jurisdiction of the persons and the subject-matter, and 'that the allegations of the petitioner state a cause of action against the defendants under the provisions' of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and supplementary legislation. It granted comprehensive relief in accordance with the prayer of the bill. The details will be discussed later. The decree closed with this provision:\n'Eighteenth. That jurisdiction of this cause be, and is hereby, retained by this court for the purpose of taking such other action or adding at the foot of this decree such other relief, if any, as may become necessary or appro- \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n priate for the carrying out and enforcement of this decree and for the purpose of entertaining at any time hereafter any application which the parties may make with respect to this decree.'\n\n None of the original parties to the suit made any application to the court between the date of the entry of the consent decree and November 5, 1924; but three intervening petitions were filed-that of the Southern Wholesale Grocers' Association, allowed September 10, 1921, that of the National Wholesale Grocers' Association, allowed November 5, 1921, and that of the California Co-operative Canneries, allowed September 13, 1924. See California Co-op. Canneries v. United States, 55 App. D. C. 36, 299 F. 908. On November 5, 1924, two motions to vacate the decree were filed in the cause. One was by Swift & Co. and the subsidiary corporations and individual defendants associated with it; the other by Armour & Co. and the subsidiary corporations and individual defendants associated with it. The allegations of the two motions were identical; and each prayed that the consent decree be declared void. The grounds of invalidity relied upon will be stated later. On May 1, 1925, the two motions to vacate the consent decree were overruled. From the order overruling them, Swift & Co. and Armour & Co., with their respective associates, took appeals to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.\n On May 28, 1926, the United States filed in that court a motion to dismiss the appeals for want of jurisdiction, contending that an appeal lay only directly to this court. On January 3, 1927, the Court of Appeals of the District entered an order dismissing the appeals. Promptly thereafter, Swift & Co., Armour & Co., and their respective associates, moved that court to stay the mandate and to transfer the appeals to this Court, pursuant to the Act of September 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837, incorporated in the Judicial Code as  238(a). On \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n January 31, 1927, the Court of Appeals vacated its opinion and order, and restored the case for reargument upon the question of its jurisdiction of the appeals and for argument on its jurisdiction to transfer the appeals to this court. Thereafter, having heard argument, the Court 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936. On October 17, court, under section 251 of the Judicial Code as existing prior to the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 S. Stat. 936. On October 17, 1927, this court, having heard argument on the certificate, ordered that the entire record in the cause be sent here, as provided in the same section. On that record the case is before us. Many questions are presented.\n An objection of the government to the jurisdiction of this court must first be considered. The Expediting Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823, U. S. C. tit. 15,  29 (15 USCA  29), provides that, from a final decree in a suit in equity brought by the government under the Anti- Trust Act, an appeal lies only directly to this court. The government suggests that under the Expediting Act no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal from the order denying the motion to vacate; that the Court of Appeals consequently was powerless to certify questions relating to the merits; that this court by ordering up the record, as provided in section 251 of the Judicial Code, did not acquire jurisdiction to decide questions which could not lawfully have been certified under that section; that the case may not be treated as here on transfer, because the Court of Appeals of the District is not a Circuit Court of Appeals within the meaning of the Act of 1922; and that this court is therefore without power to pass on the merits of the cause. Swift and Armour answer that the motions to vacate the consent decree are not subject to the provisions of the Expediting Act because they are not a part of the suit filed February 27, 1920, under the Anti-Trust Act, but constitute a new suit. Compare Stevirmac Oil \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 323]\n\u00a0\n & Gas Co. v. Dittman, \n245 \nU.S. 210\n, 38 S. Ct. 116. The argument is that the original suit ended with the entry of the consent decree, or at all events, at the expiration of the term, or at the end of the 60 days from the entry of the decree allowed by the Expediting Act for an appeal. We need not inquire whether an independent suit to set aside a decree entered upon the Anti-Trust Act is subject to the provisions of the Expediting Act. The consent decree provided by paragraph eighteenth for 'entertaining at any time hereafter any application which the parties may make with respect to this decree.' Swift and Armour made these motions to vacate in the original suit; they arose out of the three proceedings for intervention filed after entry of the consent decree, and they were entitled in the original cause.\n The court of Appeals of the District was therefore without jurisdiction to entertain the appeals. We think, however, that it was a Circuit Court of Appeals within the meaning of the Transfer Act; and, as the judgment appealed from was entered before the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, the appeals should have been transferred to this Court. Compare Pascagoula National Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, \n269 \nU.S. 537\n, 46 S. Ct. 119; Salinger v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 542, 549\n, 47 S. Ct. 173; Rossi v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 636\n, 47 S. Ct. 90; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 181, 186\n, 47 S. Ct. 550. The want of a formal order of transfer would not have been fatal to our taking jurisdiction of the whole case, had it come before us on writ of error or appeal. Wagner Electric Manufacturing Co. v. Lyndon, \n262 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 43 S. Ct. 589; Waggoner Estate v. Wichita County, \n273 \nU.S. 113, 116\n, 47 S. Ct. 271. It is no more so now, when we have required the record to be sent up to us. We treat the case as here.\n The decree sought to be vacated was entered with the defendants' consent. Under the English practice a consent decree could not be set aside by appeal or bill of \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 324]\n\u00a0\n review, except in case of clerical error. Webb v. Webb, 3 Swanst. 658; Bradish v. Gee, 1 Amb. 229; Daniell, Chancery Practice (6th Am. Ed.) 973- 974. In this Court a somewhat more liberal rule has prevailed. Decrees entered by consent have been reviewed upon appeal or bill of review where there was a claim of lack of actual consent to the decree as entered ( Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ketchum, \n101 U.S. 289\n, 295; White v. Joyce, \n158 \nU.S. 128, 147\n, 15 S. Ct. 788); or of fraud in its procurement (Thompson v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., \n168 \nU.S. 451\n, 18 S. Ct. 121); or that there was lack of federal jurisdiction because of the citizenship of the parties. (Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ketchum, supra). Compare Fraenkl v. Cerecedo, \n216 \nU.S. 295\n, 30 S. Ct. 322. But 'a decree, which appears by the record to have been rendered by consent is always affirmed, without considering the merits of the cause.' Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 5 S. Ct. 460. Compare United States v. Babbitt, \n104 U.S. 767\n; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 35 S. Ct. 543. Where, as here, the attack is not by appeal or by bill of review, but by a motion to vacate, filed more than four years after the entry of the decree, the scope of the inquiry may be even narrower. Compare Kennedy v. Georgia Bank, 8 How. 586, 611, 612. It is not suggested by Swift and Armour that the decree is subject to infirmity because of any lack of formal consent, or fraud, or mistake. But eight reasons are relied on as showing that, in whole or in part, it was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\n First. At the time the questions were certified, there was a contention that the Supreme Court of the District lacked jurisdiction of the Subject-matter, because it is not a District Court of the United States within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Act. After entry of the case in this court, that contention was disposed of by Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n274 \nU.S. 145\n, 47 S. Ct. 557. Now, it is conceded that the Supreme Court of the District has power \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 325]\n\u00a0\n to administer relief under the Anti-Trust Act; but the claim is made that in this proceeding it was without jurisdiction, because the petition was addressed to the 'Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting in equity,' instead of to the special term of that court 'as the District Court of the United States.' The argument has compelled inquiry into legislation affecting the courts of the District, enacted from time to time during a long period. It would not be profitable to discuss the details of the legislation. We are of opinion that this suit under section 4 of the Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  4), which could only have been brought in a court of equity, was properly brought in the Supreme Court of the District, sitting in equity. This conclusion has support in established practice in analogous cases. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Second. It is contended that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction because there was no case or controversy within the meaning of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution. Compare Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 251; Little v. Bowers, \n134 \nU.S. 547\n, 10 S. Ct. 620; South Spring Hill Gold Mining Co. \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 326]\n\u00a0\n v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 300\n, 12 S. Ct. 921; California v. San Pablo & Tulare R. R. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 308\n, 13 S. Ct. 876. The defendants concede that there was a case at the time when the government filed its petition and the defendants their answers; but they insist that the controversy had ceased before the decree was entered. The argument is that, as the government made no proof of facts to overcome the denials of the answers, and stipulated both that there need be no findings of fact and that the decree should not constitute or be considered an adjudication of guilt, it thereby abandoned all charges that the defendants had violated the law; and hence the decree was a nullity. The argument ignores the fact that a suit for an injunction deals primarily, not with past violations, but with threatened future ones; and that an injunction may issue to prevent future wrong, although no right has yet been violated. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, \n185 \nU.S. 65, 82\n, 22 S. Ct. 585; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 536\n, 45 S. Ct. 571, 39 A. L. R. 468. Moreover, the objection is one which is not open on a motion to vacate. The court had jurisdiction both of the general subject-matter-enforcement of the Anti-Trust Act-and of the parties. If it erred in deciding that there was a case or controversy, the error is one which could have been corrected only by an appeal or by a bill of review. Compare Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ketchum, \n101 U.S. 289\n, 297. On a motion to vacate, the determination by the Supreme Court of the District that a case or controversy existed is not open to attack. Compare Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3 Wheat. 591; McCormick v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 192, 199; Kennedy v. Georgia Bank, 8 How. 586, 611, 612; Des Moines Navigation Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., \n123 \nU.S. 552, 557\n, 8 S. Ct. 217; Dowell v. Applegate, \n152 \nU.S. 327\n, 14 S. Ct. 611; Cutler v. Huston, \n158 \nU.S. 423, 430\n, 15 S. Ct. 868; New Orleans v. Fisher, \n180 \nU.S. 185, 196\n, 21 S. Ct. 347; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. McCabe, \n213 \nU.S. 207\n, 29 S. Ct. 430.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 311, 327]\n\u00a0\n Third. It is contended that the consent decree was without jurisdiction because it was entered without the support of facts. The argument is that jurisdiction under the Anti-Trust Acts cannot be conferred by consent; that jurisdiction can exist only if the transactions complained of are in fact violations of the act; that merely to allege facts showing violation of the anti-trust laws is not sufficient; that the facts must also be established according to the regular course of chancery procedure; that this requires either admission or proof; and that here there was no admission but, on the contrary, a denial of the allegations of the bill, and a recital in the decree that the defendants maintain the truth of their answers, assert their innocence, and consent to the entry of the decree without any finding of fact, only upon condition that their consent shall not constitute or be considered an admission. The argument ignores both the nature of injunctions, already discussed, and the legal implications of a consent decree. The allegations of the bill not specifically denied may have afforded ample basis for a decree limited to future acts. Deputron v. Young, \n134 \nU.S. 241, 250\n, 251 S., 10 S. Ct. 539. If the court erred in finding in these allegations a basis for fear of future wrong sufficient to warrant an injunction, its error was of a character ordinarily remediable on appeal. Such an error is waived by the consent to the decree. United States v. Babbitt, \n104 U.S. 767\n; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 35 S. Ct. 543. Clearly it does not go to the power of the court to adjudicate between the parties. Voorhees v. Bank of the United States, 10 Pet. 449; Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308; Christianson v. King County, \n239 \nU.S. 356, 372\n, 36 S. Ct. 114.\n Fourth. It is contended that, even if the decree is not void as a whole, parts of it must be set aside as being in excess of the court's jurisdiction. This is urged in respect to the first and the ninth paragraphs, which are said to \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 328]\n\u00a0\n be too vague and general. The first enjoins the corporation defendants from 'in any manner maintaining or entering into any contract, combination, or conspiracy ... in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or from ... monopolizing or attempting to monopolize ... any part of such trade or commerce.' The ninth enjoins the corporation defendants from 'using any illegal trade practices of any nature whatsoever in relation to the conduct of any business in which they or any of them may be engaged.' It is insisted that, as a court's power is limited to restraining acts which violate or tend to violate laws, the acts to be enjoined must be set forth definitely; and that these paragraphs are so general in terms as to make the defendants liable to proceedings for contempt if they commit any breach of the law. The paragraphs, if standing alone, might be open on appeal to the objection that they are too general to be sanctioned. Compare Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 396\n, 401 S., 25 S. Ct. 276. But they do not stand alone. They are to be read in connection with other paragraphs of the decree and with the allegations of the bill. Barnes v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., \n122 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 7 S. Ct. 1043; City of Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259, 269\n, 34 S. Ct. 95. When so read, any uncertainties are removed. Moreover, the defendants by their consent lost the opportunity of raising the question on appeal. Obviously the generality of a court's decree does not render it subject to a motion to vacate.\n Fifth. It is contended that paragraphs second to eighth of the decree are void because of their comprehensiveness. These paragraphs enjoin the defendants from holding directly or indirectly (without the consent of the court) any interest in any public stockyard, or any stockyard terminal railroad, or any stockyard market journal published in the United States, and enjoin the defendants, except as there provided, from engaging or being interested in \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 329]\n\u00a0\n the business of manufacturing, buying, selling, or handling any one of 114 enumerated food products or any one of 30 other named articles of commerce; from selling meat at retail; from selling milk or cream; from holding any interest in any public cold storage plant; from using their distributive systems (including branch houses, refrigerator cars, route cars, and autotrucks) in any manner for the purpose of handling any of the many articles above referred to; and from having more than a half interest in or control of any business engaged in manufacturing, jobbing, selling, transporting, or delivering any one of most of the articles above referred to.\n The argument is that the power to issue an injunction is limited by the scope of the transactions prohibited by sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-3); that the defendants are here enjoined, not only from remaining in these lawful businesses named, but also from ever re-entering them; that none of these 'unrelated' lines of business are unlawful in themselves; that none can be restrained unless, by a finding of the essential facts, the connection with the conspiracy is established; that no such facts have been found; that the parties cannot by consent confer jurisdiction to issue an injunction broader than the facts warrant; and that an injunction so broad as that entered involves usurpation by the judicial branch of the government of the function of Congress. Compare United States v. New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 611, 621\n, 44 S. Ct. 225. Here again, the defendants ignore the fact that by consenting to the entry of the decree, 'without any findings of fact,' they left to the court the power to construe the pleadings, and, in so doing, to find in them the existence of circumstances of danger which justified compelling the defendants to abandon all participation in these businesses, to divest themselves of their interest therein, and to abstain from acquiring any interest hereafter.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 311, 330]\n\u00a0\n Sixth. The defendants make a further contention concerning paragraphs second to eighth, which differs little from that just answered. It is urged that the decree is void, because it obliges the defendants to abandon completely certain business which are inherently lawful and forbids them from entering into other businesses which may be lawfully conducted; and that to do this is not merely unauthorized by, but is contrary to, the common law and the Anti-Trust Act. Compare Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Co. (1897) A. C. 535; United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. (C. C. A.) 85 F. 271, 46 L. R. A. 122. But the court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties. And even gross error in the decree would not render it void. Compare Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193; Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n; Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n; In re Coy, \n127 \nU.S. 731, 756\n, 8 S. Ct. 1263.\n Seventh. It is contended that the decree is void because the injunction is not limited to acts in interstate commerce. This objection is in essence like the two preceding ones. The argument is that each of the businesses named in paragraphs second to eighth is susceptible of being carried on in intrastate commerce alone; that some of these businesses, for instance retail meat markets, are distinctly intrastate in character; that there was no finding of an interweaving of intrastate and interstate transactions as in United States v. New York Central R. R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 457, 464\n, 47 S. Ct. 130, or that the intrastate transactions had any relation to interstate operations, as in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 397\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, and Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229; and that, therefore, the prohibition of intrastate transactions was an overstepping of federal powers which renders the decree a nullity. Again, the argument fails to distinguish an error in decision from the want of power to decide. The allegations of a conspiracy to obstruct interstate commerce brought the case within \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 331]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of the court. The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., \n228 \nU.S. 22\n, 33 S. Ct. 410; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 304\n, 44 S. Ct. 96; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593, 608\n, 46 S. Ct. 367, 45 A. L. R. 1370. Compare Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schendel, \n270 U.S. 611\n, 616-617, 46 S. Ct. 420. If the court, in addition to enjoining acts that were admittedly interstate, enjoined some that were wholly intrastate and in no way related to the conspiracy to obstruct interstate commerce, it erred; and, had the defendants not waived such error by their consent, they might have had it corrected on appeal. But the error, if any, does not go to the jurisdiction of the court. The power to enjoin includes the power to enjoin too much. Compare Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S. Ct. 641\n\n\n Eighth. Finally, it is urged that the decree is void, because the Attorney General had no power to agree to its entry. Compare Kelley v. Milan, \n127 \nU.S. 139, 159\n, 8 S. Ct. 1101. The argument is that the utmost limit of his authority was to agree to a decree which would prohibit the defendants from doing specific acts which constitute contracting, combining, conspiring, or monopolizing in violating of the anti-trust law; that he was without authority to enter into a contract by which citizens of the United States were prohibited absolutely and forever from engaging in the lawful business of conducting stockyards, storage warehouses, or the manufacture and distribution of many named food and other products, and by which many corporations and individuals would be forever taken out of the field of competition with others engaged in the same lines of business. Whether it would follow that the defendants are entitled to have the decree vacated because of such lack of authority, we need not decide. For we do not find in the statutes defining the powers and duties of the Attorney General any such limitation on the exercise of his discretion as this contention involves. His \n\n[276 U.S. 311, 332]\n\u00a0\n authority to make determinations includes the power to make erroneous decisions as well as correct ones. Compare United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 U.S. 273\n, 278-280, 8 S. Ct. 850; Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165\n, 13 S. Ct. 271; Kern River Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, 42 S. Ct. 60; Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 42 S. Ct. 309, 22 A. L.

TAYLOR(1928)\nNo. 186\nArgued: January 18, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John May, of New Orleans, La., and Edmund L. Jones, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Eugie V. Parham, of New Orleans, La., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n March 12, 1925, plaintiff in error, a stevedoring corporation, was unloading a vessel lying in the Mississippi at a dock in New Orleans. George Taylor was in its employ as a longshoreman and came to his death while engaged in that work. Defendant in error is his widow and brought this suit in the civil district court of Orleans Parish under the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Law1 to recover compensation for herself and children. The district court gave judgment for them; the Court of Appeal affirmed; and its presiding judge, after the state Supreme Court had denied a writ of certiorari, allowed the writ of error that brings the case here.\n Plaintiff in error maintained below and here insists that this is a case exclusively within the admiralty and mari- \n\n[276 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n time jurisdiction, and that, while the state Compensation Law is broad enough to apply to longshoremen unloading vessels, its application in this case violates section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, which extends the judicial power of the United States 'to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,' and also that clause of section 8 of article 1, which authorizes Congress to make laws for carrying into effect the powers granted by the Constitution.\n At the time of the accident, cargo was being hoisted out of the hold to deck skids and thence swung to trucks operated upon a stage that rested solely upon the wharf and projected a few feet over the water to or near the side of the vessel. The petition of defendant in error alleged, and she introduced evidence to show, that deceased was standing on the stage when a sling, loaded with five sacks of soda, weighing 200 pounds each, was being lowered over the side by means of a winch on the vessel; that the sling was swinging back and forth, and, while deceased was trying to catch and steady it, the sling struck him and knocked him off the stage into the water, where some time later he was found dead. At the trial plaintiff in error maintained that deceased was not struck, but accidentally fell into the river. The issues were decided in favor of defendant in error, and the evidence is amply sufficient to sustain the finding.\n Deceased was engaged in maritime work under a maritime contract. If the cause of action arose upon the river, the rights of the parties are controlled by maritime law, the case is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and the application of the Louisiana Compensation Law violated section 2 of article 3. But, if the cause of action arose upon the land, the state law is applicable. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, 33; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N.

Plain- \n\n[276 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n tiff in error concedes that the stage and wharf on which deceased was working are to be deemed an extension of the land (Cleveland Terminal R. R. v. Steamship Co., \n208 \nU.S. 316, 321\n, 28 S. Ct. 414, 13 Ann. Cas. 1215; Industrial Comm. v. Nordenholt Co., \n259 \nU.S. 263, 275\n, 42 S. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013), and that the state law would apply if he had been injured or killed by falling on the landing place. It argues that as no claim was made for injuries sustained while deceased was on land and as the suit was solely for death that occurred in the river, the case is exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. But this is a partial view that cannot be sustained. The blow by the sling was what gave rise to the cause of action. It was given and took effect while deceased was upon the land. It was the sole, immediate and proximate cause of his death. The G. R. Booth, \n171 \nU.S. 450, 460\n, 19 S. Ct. 9.

Toulmin, Jr., both of Dayton, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Clifford L. Anderson, of Atlanta, Ga., and M. A. Keller, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Temco Electric Company, a corporation of the state of Ohio, filed this bill in equity against the Apco Manufacturing Company, a corporation of the state of Rhode Island, charging that the Apco Company had wronged the Temco Company by infringement of a patent for a shock absorber fitted for a Ford motor car, issued to Ralph P. and Wm. S. Thompson, assignors of one-third to Oliver P. Edwards, and assigned by them to the Temco Company, and owned by it. The Apco Company answered, denying the validity of the patent and its infringement, averring that it was inoperative, and that the shock absorber which the Apco Company was making was made under a patent to one William Storrie, applied for March 18, granted September 17, 1918, and numbered 1,279,035. The answer further set out the names of certain patents which were said to be anticipations of the patent upon which the suit was brought.\n The District Court held that the patent was a very narrow patent, and that claim No. 3 was invalid because it lacked words of description enough to make it operative. Deferring, however, to the decision of the District Judges and of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, it sustained the three claims of the patent, but declined to grant a preliminary injunction. Though of opinion that the infringement had not been shown, nevertheless it en- \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n tered a decree in favor of the appellee out of deference to two decisions of the Circuit Court of Appeals. K-W Ignition Co. v. Temco Electric Motor Co., 243 F. 588, and the same case reported again in 283 F. 873. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit declined to follow the two decisions of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, and reversed the judgment of the District Court. There had been a cross-appeal brought by the appellee to reverse the District Court in its holding that the third claim was invalid, and that cross-appeal was denied. 11 F.(2d) 109. The case has been brought here by certiorari. \n271 \nU.S. 653\n, 46 S. Ct. 483\n\n\n The patent sued on was issued to Ralph P. Thompson and William S. Thompson, of Leipsic, Ohio, assignors of one-third to Oliver P. Edwards, of Leipsic, Ohio. The application was filed October 10, 1912, and the patent was issued September 9, 1913, and numbered 1,072,791, and has since been assigned by the patentees to the Temco Company. The object of the patentees was to provide a shock absorber which would make riding in an automobile easy. They professed to accomplish this by supplying a set of quick-acting coiled springs in connection with the set of slow-acting and friction-retarded leaf springs originally built into the vehicle. The compression and recoil of the two sets of springs occurred at different times, in consequence of which their respective pulsations were not synchronous. The result was said, in the specifications, to be that the shock to the road wheel and axle was first absorbed by the coiled spring, and therefrom was transmitted to the body of the car, and to the occupants through the slow-acting leaf spring. As the compression and recoil of the leaf spring were not the same as those of the coiled spring, the recoil of the coiled spring began to take place before the full effect of the shock to the road wheel could be transmitted through the leaf spring. This seesawing action, as it were, between the quick-acting coiled spring \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n and the slow-acting leaf spring, the specifications said, caused a large portion of the effect from vibrations to be nullified by the action of one and reaction of the other of these springs taking place simultaneously, thus absorbing within the spring element the sharper vibrations. The device was intended to be specially adapted for attachment to Ford automobiles. Its availability was claimed to be such that the owner of a Ford car, without the services of a mechanic, and without disturbing the operation or construction of the car, might, with slight instruction, remove the usual hanger which suported each end of each leaf spring, and insert in its stead the plaintiff's attachment.\n The absorber consisted of an upright metal guide, whose lower end was rigidly attached to the car axle, and provided a platform for the lower end of a coiled or torsion spring, inclosed in a cylindrical metal casing or hanger, bearing against and supported by the upper end of the coiled spring, and so was capable of upward and downward sliding movement on the guides; the stanchions or guides being adapted to maintain the verticle direction of the sliding movement of the absorber or torsional spring, and to limit the end movements of the leaf springs along the axle.\n When the patent was issued there was a great demand to purchase the device and use it, and under the patentees, or under the K-W Ignition Company, which had a contract with the patentees, there were made and sold up-wards of 134,000 sets of the shock absorbers, and about $2,250,000 was from time to time paid to the patentees for these absorbers, so that from 1912, for 10 years or more, a very large business was done in the sale and use of the patented device. There was litigation over it, especially in the districts of the Sixth Circuit, where the validity of the patent was generally sustained; the first case having been heard by a former justice of this court while a Dis- \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n trict Judge of the Northern District of Ohio. His opinion is recorded in the record. The case not only involved the validity of the patent, which after some hesitation he sustained because of its general adoption and success, but also presented a question whether the defendants in that case, the K-W Ignition Company, were not so bound by contract with the patentees as to estop them from defending against the patent. The District Judge held, however, that the contract had expired, and the obligations growing out of it had also expired, so that the issue tried was that of the validity of the patent. The District Court's decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and the case was sent back for an accounting, and an accounting was had against the defendant in that case, and a judgment given for $292,938 against the K-W Ignition Company, which was a defendant there. In the present suit, the bill set up this litigation in Ohio as evidence of the validity of the patent, but a straight issue of validity was also made, and all the defenses known were advanced.\n The District Judge in Ohio in the K-W Ignition Case was affected in his decision, that the Thompson patent involved invention, by the way in which the public eagerly took it and its marked success, and so, indeed, was the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. So are we.\n The attack now made upon the patent is that it has been proved to be ineffective by 10 years' actual use, some injuries to the shock absorbers resulting from striking of the parts of the motor machine against the metal guides and cylindrical metal hangers in which the torsional spring is moved up and down. It appears that the real owners of the patent, realizing that there were defects in the operation of the absorber that should be remedied, applied to the Patent Office for a patent which should substitute for the stanchions or guides, on which the hanger around the torsional spring moved up and down in a verticle direction, a fixed radius link. The torsional spring of the \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n patent inclosed within the casing or hanger attached to the upright guide did not, in moving or sliding up and down, retain a vertical direction, but was sometimes tilted over by the weight of the car and its load. The change proposed, in regard to this, was that, while the spring should be placed outside the upright or stanchion at the bottom of the spring, the upright stem or guide or stanchion inside the spring should be maintained in a vertical position by the addition of a radius link united to another by a toggle joint, which fixed the guide rigidly and would hold the coil spring up permanently in a vertical position. This permitted a widening of the coil spring at the bottom, so as to make it conical, and gave the spring more stability in its vertical position. The difference between a conical coil spring and one that is not conical does not make the two structures different in any respect but in degree of stability only.\n The proposal of the plaintiff patentees to remove a defect by the substitution of the radius link for the metal guide and casing and hanger led to an interference proceeding with one William Storrie, who claimed to have hit upon this change first, and in that interference proceeding in the Patent Office Storrie was given a patent for the absorber with that radius link. Except for the radius link, there is no difference in operation and result. The springs in a Ford car equipped with the defendant's device receive the shocks in the same order, operate in the same manner, and produce the same results as those in a Ford car on which the springs of the plaintiff's patent are used. The function which the casing of the torsional spring and the hanger perform is exactly the same as that of the torsional spring and the radius link introduced in the Storrie patent, under which the answer and the facts show the defendant's device was licensed and operates.\n Storrie, as patentee, said in his specifications that his invention related to means for absorbing the vibrations \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n and shocks in vehicle springs to such an extent as not to cause annoyance to the rider and strain to the springs of the vehicle, which would tend to cause such springs to crack or otherwise become disabled; that the invention provided a shock absorber embodying an expansible helical spring and supporting means therefor of novel formation; one of such supports being secured to the axle and the other being shackled or otherwise attached to the vehicle spring, the parts being arranged to control the vibrations or shocks not taken up quick enough by the main spring, and thereby overcome the objectionable features therein mentioned. And then follow 12 different claims, most of which refer to a radius link pivoted to the support between the torsional spring and the main or laminated spring of the vehicle.\n The claim made for the invention is that the real gist if it is in the arrangement of the parts, all of which were old, so that the first vibration and shock would be taken up from the axle by the torsional spring, and then, having been divided up into vibrations, would be communicated through the torsional spring and the absorber to the leaf spring, and 'dampened down,' as the expression is, by its slower action, so as really to take up and absorb and make to disappear the shocks otherwise directly communicated from the road and the axle to the leaf spring. It is argued that, as these were all old parts, there was nothing new in the patent. We have examined the art with a view to considering that particular point. We think that the theory that the Thompson patent had and has its real value in the function of the torsional spring directly to take up all the vibrations from the road and axle, and quickly to divide them for the dampering effect of the slow-moving leaf spring of the car, was a sound one. There have been citations of early patents showing previous attempts of the same kind, but we have not been pointed out to one in which the torsional spring was so \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n arranged as to take all the road vibrations and divide them up before reaching the main car spring, except those which have come after the Thompson original patent. This is true of the Bussing, whether German, English, or French patents, the Peugeot patent, and the Cosset patent. It is true that by taking some of these structures or devices, notably the Bussing English patent, it may be possible to show how, by turning over on its back the specified device, the torsional spring could be made partly and ineffectively to perform this function; but, as described in this or other cited patents, there is no suggestion or recommendation of the arrangement in Thompson's. They-all of them-use the main or leaf spring to take directly all or part of the vibrations from the axle, and rely on the torsional spring to soften vibrations after they have passed or are passing through the main spring. The leaf spring in the Warner patent, not only takes the greater road shocks directly, but the entire spring arrangement is primarily built and put in at the factory, while the axle is split into two parts and the device is not made a separate or separable part, a feature which is an important and needed advantage to adapt the absorber to use in a Ford car.\n We may properly note, as bearing upon the issue whether there was something substantial in the elaborated claim of the Thompson specifications, that the defendants below called as a witness Mr. Storrie, and that upon cross-examination he said that the defendant's device was within the Storrie patent, and he made it clear that, without the torsional spring to divide and neutralize the vibrations from the axle and ground, the good effect of the leaf spring to 'dampen out' the vibrations from the road could not be gained.\n With respect to the Storrie patent, it is said that the patent in suit is not broad enough to justify an allowance of equivalents, which would make the radius link an equivalent to the casing and hanger of the Thompson absorber. \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 328]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that, if it is not an equivalent, it is at least an improvement on the Thompson patent in suit, and that this is what Thompson was seeking when the interference proceedings were had. It was upon that theory, that the Storrie patent was an improvement on the Thompson patent, that the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, in the suit between the Temco Company and the K-W Ignition Company decided that it could allow only recovery for royalties and not for profits. 283 F. 873, 876, 877. It is well established that an improver cannot appropriate the basic patent of another, and that the improver without a license is an infringer, and may be sued as such. Cochrane v. Deener, \n94 U.S. 780\n, 787; Cantrell v. Wallick, \n117 \nU.S. 689, 694\n, 6 S. Ct. 970; Yancey v. Enright (C. C. A.) 230 F. 641, 647; Reed v. Hughes Tool Co. (C. C. A.) 261 F. 192, 194.\n We cannot concur with the District Judge in this case, or with the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in the conclusion that there was no merit in this patent, when its usefulness was demonstrated by 10 years' use in such large numbers and by such profitable business. We must consider that the Storrie patent was really an appropriation of the original design of the Thompson patent, whether it be, as we think it was, a patentable improvement thereon, or the mere equivalent of the casing and hanger.\n It is argued that an estoppel works as against the Temco Company by the action of one of the Thompsons and an assignor of its patent, because in applying for the second patent in what turned out to be the interference proceeding he had said that the radius link device which was applied for related to an improvement 'over' the construction disclosed in the original patent granted to them. If Thompson had said it was an improvement 'upon,' it would have been satisfactory; but the word 'over' is supposed to indicate that he was making an \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 329]\n\u00a0\n application for a different patent. This is too fine a turn in language. In attempting to distinguish the new invention, which he was seeking to have patented, he had said that the claims of the new patent were 'obviously different in mechanical construction and functional results.' This is said to estop the plaintiff from claiming that the Storrie radius link, which won in the interference proceeding, is only an improvement on the patent in suit, as the basic patent upon which the Storrie patent was an improvement. But it was said in the Thompson application for a second patent in the Patent Office that the invention sought was of the general type disclosed, possessing certain advantages not possessed by the construction of the prior patent, and it was specifically stated therein that the radius link form was an improvement over a construction disclosed in the first Thompson patent, No. 1,072,791.\n We have had to depend for knowledge of the contents of the application by Thompson for his second patent on the quotations in the briefs. This record has been so badly prepared, and so much has been omitted in the printing, that we should really reject the argument by the defendants as to estoppel altogether, because the record as printed contains nothing upon which it can be based.\n The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case held that claim No. 3 of the patent in suit was void, because inoperative and having no description upon which it could be properly used as a claim. The claim is as follows:\n'In automobile construction, wherein coiled springs are used auxiliary to leaf springs for absorbing shock to the road wheels, the combination of upright stanchions with the axle of the ground wheels, said stanchions being attached to the outer ends of said axle, leaf spring extending above the axle and between the stanchions, and supporting the chassis frame, the said stanchions being \n\n[275 U.S. 319, 330]\n\u00a0\n adapted to limit the end motion of the leaf springs and thereby prevent side sway of the chassis frame, hangers for the outer ends of said leaf springs, said hangers having a vertical movement and being guided therein by said stanchions, and coiled springs interposed between said leaf spring hangers and said axle of the ground wheels.'\n\n The District Court in its opinion said:\n'For want of any statement as to how the leaf spring and helical spring are to be connected to and guided by the stanchions, I think claim 3 is incomplete and void.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit said of the claim:\n'Appellee (the petitioner) has filed a cross-appeal, and insists that the claim which the district court disallowed is valid. That claim is about as vague as it could be made. As pointed out by the District Judge, it fails to specify the means by which the leaf and helical springs can be connected to and guided by the stanchion. To sustain a claim as general as this is would be to allow a patent for a 'result and not for the mechanism producing it.\"\n\n Reading the claim with the specifications and the drawings, which are both clear (Howe Machine Co. v. National Needle Co., \n134 \nU.S. 388, 394\n, 10 S. Ct. 570), its addition to the combination of coiled springs interposed between the leaf spring hangers having vertical movement and guided by stanchions comprehends the link as shown in the drawings, or any suitable connection between each leaf spring and its hanger and casing surrounding the coiled spring, which is interposed between the leaf spring and the axle and ground wheel. It does not seem to us that the claim is vague; nor do we find nullifying incompleteness in it. Turrill v. Railroad Co., 1 Wall. 491, 510; Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 795; McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 12 S. Ct. 76. Walker on Patents (5th Ed.)  185. Neither did the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit nor did the District Courts of that Circuit so find.\n\n\n[275 U.S. 319, 331]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion requires a reversal of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, including its ruling on the cross-appeal as to claim No. 3, and a remanding of the case to the District Court for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & N. O. R. CO. v. NORTHSIDE BELT RY. CO.(1928)\nNo. 231\nArgued: February 28, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 475, 476]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. H. Tallichet and H. M. Garwood, both of Houston, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Mr. John Walsh, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 475, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under the laws of Texas, Cullinan secured a charter for the Northside Belt Railway Company with power to build and operate, as a common carrier, a terminal railway from a private plant to another local railroad. The line was to be about five miles long and wholly within that state. The Northside Company instituted proceedings in a Texas court to acquire by condemnation a right of way, for a short distance, over unused land owned by the Texas & New Orleans Railroad Company, an interstate carrier. Thereupon, the latter brought, under paragraphs 18 to 22 of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by Transportation Act 1920, c. 91 ,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 478 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St.  8563), this suit in the federal court for Southern Texas. The prayer was to enjoin the Northside Company from continuing the condemnation proceedings and also from constructing, maintaining or operating the railroad over the plaintiff's land, This relief was sought solely on the ground that the defendant had not obtained from the Interstate Commerce Commission the certificate of public convenience and necessity prescribed in those paragraphs of the Transportation Act.\n A restraining order applied for upon the filing of the bill was denied. No application was made for an interlocutory injunction. The defendant answered that it was exclusively an intrastate carrier and as such was not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. The case was fully heard on the merits by the District Court. It appeared that, before this suit was begun, judgment had been entered in the condemnation proceedings; that the amount of the compensation awarded had been paid into court (as provided by the law of the state); and that the Northside Company had entered into possession of the \n\n[276 U.S. 475, 478]\n\u00a0\n premises taken. It appeared that, before process was served upon the defendants, the line had been constructed over the strip of land in question. And it also appeared that, at the time of the hearing, the line had not yet been completed; that the defendant had not engaged or offered to engage in interstate commerce; and that it could not possibly engage in such commerce until the completion of its line.\n The District Court found and held that the Northside Company was an intrastate carrier only; that its construction would not burden interstate commerce directly or indirectly; and that paragraphs 18 to 22 were not applicable to the construction of an intrastate railroad not yet engaging in interstate commerce. On that ground, the trial court denied the injunction and ordered the bill dismissed without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff 'to hereafter apply for an injunction against the respondent if its activities in the future shall bring it properly within the purview' of those paragraphs. 8 F.(2d) 153.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree of the District Court, without passing upon the merits of the case. It held that the cause had become moot, because 'the only relief prayed for was action by the court restraining the doing of things which have been done since the suit was brought.' This conclusion was based on its own finding that 'before the decree appealed from was entered, a judgment condeming said land was rendered in said condemnation suit, and appellee had constructed its railroad over said land and was operating the same.' 16 F.(2d) 782. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n274 \nU.S. 734\n, 47 S. Ct. 768\n\n\n The finding of fact upon which the Court of Appeals rested its judgment was clearly erroneous. There is no basis in the record for the finding that the railroad was in operation. The part of the railroad over the plaintiff's \n\n[276 U.S. 475, 479]\n\u00a0\n land had been constructed; but the railroad had not been completed. No part of it had been operated; and apparently it was physically impossible to operate it in interstate commerce until completed. Paragraph 20 of section 402 specifically provides that unauthorized operation as well as construction may be enjoined. Moreover, the facts erroneously found would not, if true, have rendered the case moot. For where a defendant, with notice of the filing of a bill for an injunction, proceeds to complete the acts sought to be enjoined, the court may, by mandatory injunction, compel a restoration of the status quo. Tucker v. Howard, 128 Mass. 361, 363; Town of Platteville v. Galena & Southern Wisconsin R. Co., 43 Wis. 493, 506-507.\n The decree of the District Court was, however, properly affirmed for the reason indicated by that court. The purpose of paragraphs 18 to 22 is to prevent interstate carriers from weakening themselves by constructing or operating superfluous lines, and to protect them from being weakened by another carrier's operating in interstate commerce a competing line not required in the public interest. See Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; Railroad Commission of California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376; Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263; Alabama & Vicksburg R. Co. v. Jackson & Eastern R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 535. Compare Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452. The mere fact that a railroad lies wholly within one state, and is to be built by an independent corporation, does not, of course, prevent the application of paragraphs 18 to 22. If it undertakes to engage in interstate commerce, its operation becomes immediately a matter of national concern and it comes within the purview of those paragraphs. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n But Congress did not in terms prohibit wholly intrastate carriers from building lines to be used wholly in intrastate commerce. As long as the Northside Company confines its operations to intrastate commerce, it will not violate the federal law. Compare Texas v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204\n, 42 S. Ct. 281; Railroad Commission of Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79\n, 44 S. Ct. 247. \n\n[276 U.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff admits that operation of the Northside line has not begun. But it insists that under the laws of Texas every common carrier not only may, but must, if requested, engage also in interstate business, and it argues that this makes the Northside Company subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. Texas Rev. Stat. 1925, art. 6407. Obviously, the law of Texas could not require the \n\n[276 U.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n Northside Company to engage in interstate commerce, if by doing so it violated any law of the United States. Compare Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404\n, 48 S. Ct. 189. Here, there was as yet no threat to use the line in interstate commerce; and it was shown that the line could not possibly be so used until completed. There was clearly no imminent danger that irreparable injury would result from its mere construction. Under these circumstances, to deny the injunction and dismiss the bill without prejudice was, at least, a permissible exercise of the court's discretion.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the following cases the Interstate Commerce Commission has granted or denied certificates of convenience and necessity for the construction and operation of a new line, built by a corporation not theretofore a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, and lying wholly within the limits of one state: Application of Michigan Northern R.

ALLEN(1928)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank H. Sullivan and James C. Jones, both of St. Louis, Mo., and Walter A. Eversman, of Toledo, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Holland R. Polak, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 27, 1922, petitioner's railway system was being operated by a receiver as a common carrier of interstate commerce. Respondent was a car checker in the service of the receiver, and, while employed in such commerce in petitioner's railroad yard at Madison, Ill., he was struck and injured by a shunted car. He brought this action in the circuit court of St. Louis, Missouri, claiming Damages under the Employers' Liability Act. U. S. C. tit. 45. c. 2,  51 (45 U.S.C.A.  51; Comp. St.  8657). The amended petition alleged that plaintiff's injuries were caused by the defendant's failure to maintain an adequate space between the tracks in the yard and by the negligent failure of other employees to warn him of the approach of the car. After the suit was commenced, the receiver was discharged and the railroad was returned to petitioner. The latter assumed the obligations of the receiver and was substituted for him as defendant. There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. The defendant, alleging numerous grounds, moved for a new trial. It was denied. The case was \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n taken to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was affirmed. Allen v. Ross, 292 S. W. 732. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 688\n, 47 S. Ct. 457.\n The yard where plaintiff was injured included a lead track and, connected with it, a number of parallel switch tracks, the centers of which were about 12 feet apart. Plaintiff had been regularly employed there as car checker for about 18 months, and his hours were from 11 in the evening to 7 in the morning. His work required him to be in the yard while switching was being done, and to go from place to place to check and list cars that had been switched and arranged on various tracks for the purpose of making up trains. At the time of the accident, he was checking a string of cars that had been placed on track 5 and was between it and track 4, about 125 yards from the lead. A switching crew was at work in the yard. The engine was on the lead attached to from 20 to 25 cars that were between it and switch 4. Two cinder cars were detached from the end, while the string of cars was being pushed by the engine. They were shunted by means of the switch to track 4, and by their own momentum moved to the place where plaintiff was struck. The yard was not artificially lighted. It was an ordinary starlight night, without moon. The shunted cars moved at moderate speed-4 to 6 miles per hour-and made noise enough to be heard at a distance of one or two car lengths. They were unlighted and unattended and no person warned plaintiff of their approach.\n The act of Congress under which plaintiff seeks recovery took possession of the field of liability of carriers by railway for injuries sustained by their employees while engaged in interstate commerce, and superseded state laws upon that subject. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. This case is governed by that act and the principles of the common law as applied in the courts of the United States. The plaintiff cannot recover in the \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n absence of negligence on the part of defendant. Seaboard Air Line v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 502\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475. And, except as specified in section 4 of the act ( 45 USCA  54; Comp. St.  8660), the employee assumes the ordinary risks of his employment, and, when obvious or fully known and appreciated by him, the extraordinary risks and those due to negligence of his employer and fellow employees.

If, upon an examination of the record, it is found that as a matter of law the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the essential findings of fact, the judgment will be reversed. C. M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 474\n, 46 S. Ct. 564\n\n\n The court authorized the jury to find defendant guilty of negligence if the space between the tracks was found to be so narrow that when track 5 was occupied plaintiff was in danger of being struck by cars moving on track 4. It was shown, as stated by the Supreme Court, that the clearance between the car that plaintiff was checking on track 5 and the moving cars on track 4 was about 2 feet and 9 inches without considering the grab- irons on the cinder cars which projected 4 1\/2 inches from each corner. While this space was sufficient to enable plaintiff to keep out of the way of the moving cars, the danger attending his work would have been lessened if the distance between the tracks had been greater. The work of checking cars in a yard at night where switching is being done is necessarily attended by much danger. But fault or negligence may not be inferred from the mere existence of danger or from the fact that plaintiff was struck and injured by the moving car. Defendant did not owe to plaintiff as high a degree of care as that due from carriers to their passengers or others coming on their premises for the transaction of business. The reason for the distinction is that plain- \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n tiff's knowledge of the situation and the dangers existing because of the narrow space between the tracks was at least equal to that chargeable against the defendant. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Aeby, \n275 \nU.S. 426\n, 48 S. Ct. 177. The rule of law which holds the employer to ordinary care to provide his employees a reasonably safe place in which to work did not impose upon defendant an obligation to adopt or maintain any particular standard for the spacing or construction of its tracks and yards. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 45 S. Ct. 169. Carriers, like other employers, have much freedom of choice in providing facilities and places for the use of their employees. Courts will not prescribe the space to be maintained between tracks in switching yards, nor leave such engineering questions to the uncertain and varying opinions of juries. Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co., \n122 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 7 S. Ct. 1166; Randall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 478, 482\n, 3 S. Ct. 322; Washington, etc., Railroad Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 570\n, 10 S. Ct. 1044. Having regard to plaintiff's knowledge of the situation, it is clear that the evidence when taken most favorably to him is not sufficient to warrant a finding that defendant failed in any duty owed him in respect of the space between the tracks. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Aeby, supra. The court erred in submitting that question to the jury.\n And the court authorized the jury to find defendant negligent in failing to cause the engine bell to be rung and in sending the cars along track 4 without a light and unattended. The opinion below declares that the starting or running of the switch engine without ringing a bell or blowing a whistle was evidence of negligence, and that if, according to the practice, cars could be shunted dangerously near to the place where plaintiff was working, without any warning to him or \"knowledge of such custom or practice on his part,\" the system of doing the work was \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n not reasonably safe and plaintiff was not provided with a reasonably safe place in which to work and did not assume the risk. Obviously the ringing of the bell when and after the cinder cars were uncoupled or when the engine started or while it was running would not have been useful as a warning to plaintiff. When the cars were detached, he was from 300 to 400 feet from the lead track and the engine was at the other end of the string of cars. The decision on this point is contrary to the rule followed in the federal courts. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, \n145 U.S. 418\n; 12 S. Ct. 835, was a case presenting a situation similar to that here involved. It is there said (page 420 (12 S. Ct. 836)):\n\"The ringing of bells and the sounding of whistles on trains going and coming, and switch engines moving forwards and backwards, would have simply tended to confusion.\"\n\n And see Rosney v. Erie R. Co. (C. C. A.) 135 F. 311, 315; Connelley v. Pennsylvania R. Co. (C. C. A.) 201 F. 54, 57, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 867. And there is no support for the assumption that plaintiff was without knowledge of the switching practice followed in that yard or that the movement in question created an unusual hazard. On the evidence it must be held that he knew how switching was done there; and, in the absence of proof that he was exposed to some unusual danger by reason of a departure from the practice generally followed, it cannot be held that defendant was in duty bound to give him warning. The members of the switching crew had a right to believe that he would keep out of the way of the shunted car. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, supra.\n In any event plaintiff assumed the risk. He was familiar with the yard and the width of the space between the tracks and knew that cars were liable to be shunted without warning to him. The dangers were obvious and must have been fully known and appreciated by him. Boldt v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., supra; Ches. & Ohio Ry. \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n v. Nixon, supra; Randall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., supra; Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co., supra.\n The amended petition alleged that the employees in charge of the engine and cars \"saw, or by the exercise of ordinary care could have seen, plaintiff between said tracks, and in a position of peril and oblivious thereof in time thereafter, by the exercise of ordinary care, with the means and appliances at hand, to have either held said cars stationary, or after having started said cars, stopped them, or slackened the speed thereof in time ... to have avoided striking and injuring plaintiff, but that said ... employees failed and neglected so to do.\" Defendant requested the court to charge that plaintiff was not entitled to recover on that ground. The court refused and submitted the question to the jury.\n Defendant contends that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a determination of that issue in favor of the plaintiff. Immediately prior to the switching movement in question, the engine working on the lead was headed westerly attached to the easterly end of the string. The crew consisted of a foreman, two switchmen-one in the field and the other following the engine-the engineer and fireman. The plaintiff was then at the place of the accident. There is no claim that he was not about his work in the usual way or that he could not have avoided the cars if he had known they were coming. A slight movement on his part would have been enough. When the engine pushed the string westerly along the lead to give the cinder cars momentum, the field man was on the south side of the lead and turned switch 4 to shunt them to that track. There is no evidence that he saw plaintiff or knew where he was while the switching movement was being made. The foreman of the crew was on the north side near the westerly end of the string of cars. He lifted the coupling pin to detach the cinder cars and gave sig- \n\n[276 U.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n nals for the starting and stopping of the engine in order to give them the desired impulse. He saw the lantern carried by plaintiff on the north side of the cars on track 5 and assumed that plaintiff was at work there. Plaintiff's son was the other switchman. He was on the north side near the middle of the string of cars and received from the foreman and transmitted to the engineer the signals for the starting and stopping of the engine. He also saw plaintiff's lantern. Neither engineer nor fireman knew where plaintiff was. The mere fact that the foreman and plaintiff's son saw the lantern and knew that plaintiff was checking cars on track 5 is not sufficient. There is nothing to sustain a finding that plaintiff was in any danger other than such as was usually incident to his employment or that any member of the crew knew or had any reason to believe that he was oblivious of the situation. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Ackerman (C. C. A.) 144 F. 959, 962. In the absence of knowledge on their part that he was in a place where he was liable to be struck and oblivious of that danger, they were not required to vary the switching practice customarily followed in that yard or to warn or to take other steps to protect him. There is no evidence to sustain the allegation that the other employees saw, or negligently failed to discover, plaintiff in a 'position of peril and oblivious thereof.' There was no foundation for a finding in favor of the plaintiff on that issue. Cf. Inland & Seaboard Coasting Co. v. Tolson, \n139 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 559 S., 11 S. Ct. 653; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v.

Section 239 of the Judicial Code, Act Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  346; Comp. St.  1216).\n On October 22, 1926, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska, the defendant, Glen Murray, pleaded guilty to certain violations of the National Prohibition Act. On October 25, 1926, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment at the Douglas \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 351]\n\u00a0\n county jail, at Omaha. On the same day he was delivered by the United States marshal, in pursuance of the sentence, to the jail keeper, and commenced serving it. On October 26th, the next day, and during the same term of court, the District Court entered an order placing him on probation, which read as follows:\n'Ordered and adjudged that said defendant, Glen Murray, be placed on probation for the period of two (2) years, under the personal supervision of Robert P. Samardick, who is hereby appointed and constituted probation officer in this case.'\n\n The United States took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals by writ of error. The question certified to this court by that court was as follows:\n Did the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska have authority under the Act of March 4, 1925, 43 Stat. at Large, c. 521, p. 1259, to make during the term at which sentence was imposed the order placing the defendant in error upon probation after he had commenced to serve sentence?\n On November 21, 1923, Frederick A. Cook was indicted in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas; he was convicted on 12 counts charging him with using the United States mails in executing a scheme to defraud within section 215 of the United States Criminal Code (18 USCA  338), and was sentenced by a district judge designated from another district and circuit to a total of 14 years and 9 months and to pay a total fine of $12,000. He was thereafter confined in the county jail of Tarrant county, Texas, where he remained until after his case had been appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the sentence in February, 1925. In April, 1925, he was transported to the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, to serve his sentence, where he has been confined ever since. In February, 1927, he applied to the regular judge of the district \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 352]\n\u00a0\n where he had been sentenced to enter an order placing him on probation for a period of five years in the care of a special probation officer under the Probation Act. The application was granted on March 17, 1927. The warden of the penitentiary was directed to release Cook from custody, and one W. Erskine Williams was appointed probation officer to whom Cook should report every six months. The record contains an elaborate opinion of the District Judge upholding his power to make the order.\n Objecting to the order, the United States sued out a writ of error to the District Court from the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that the Probation Act did not empower the District Court to grant probation to Cook, that the power conferred in the act was not exercisable in a case which had passed beyond the court's control by the rendition of a final judgment and the expiration of the term during which such judgment was rendered. 19 F.(2d) 826. We brought the case here by a writ of certiorari October 31, 1927. \n275 \nU.S. 516\n, 48 S. Ct. 86, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The first question which we must consider, and which, if we decide in favor of the Government, controls both cases and disposes of them, is whether there is any power in the federal courts of first instance to grant probation under the Probation Act, after the defendant has served any part of his sentence. The Probation Act, 43 Stat. 1259, c. 521, provides in its first and second sections as follows:\n'That the courts of the United States having original jurisdiction of criminal actions, except in the District of Columbia, when it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public, as well as the defendant, will be subserved thereby, shall have power, after conviction or after a plea of guilty of nolo contendere for any crime or offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment, to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and to place the defendant upon \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 353]\n\u00a0\n probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as they may deem best; or the court may impose a fine and may also place the defendant upon probation in the manner aforesaid. The court may revoke or modify any condition of probation, or may change the period of probation: Provided, that the period of probation, together with any extension thereof, shall not exceed five years.\n\n'While on probation the defendant may be required to pay in one or several sums a fine imposed at the time of being placed on probation and may also be required to make restitution or reparation to the aggrieved party or parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had, and may also be required to provide for the support of any person or persons for whose support he is legally responsible.\n\n'Sec. 2. That when directed by the court, the probation officer shall report to the court, with a statement of the conduct of the probationer while on probation. The court may thereupon discharge the probationer from further supervision and may terminate the proceedings against him, or may extend the probation, as shall seem advisable.\n\n'At any time within the probation period, the probation officer may arrest the probationer without a warrant, or the court may issue a warrant for his arrest. Thereupon such probationer shall forthwith be taken before the court. At any time after the probation period, but within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced, the court may issue a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested and brought before the court. Thereupon the court may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed.'\n\n Its subsequent sections provide for the appointment of one or more suitable persons to serve as probation officers \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 354]\n\u00a0\n and for their compensation and expenses, make it the duty of the probation officer to furnish to the person released a written statement of the conditions of probation; to keep informed concerning the conduct and condition of each person on probation, and report it to the court, to aid the persons on probation and to bring about improvements in their conduct and condition; to keep records of his work, accounts of the moneys collected from persons under his supervision, and give receipts therefor, and make monthly returns thereof; and to have the same power of arrest as is now exercised by a deputy marshal. The fifth section makes the act to take effect immediately.\n The report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives recommending the bill which became the act (Report No. 1377, 68th Congress, 2d Session), stated its purpose and continued:\n'Prior to the so-called Killitts Case, rendered in December, 1916, the District Courts exercised a form of probation either by suspending sentence or by placing the defendants under state probation officers or volunteers. In this case, however (Ex parte United States, \n242 U.S. 27\n (37 S. Ct. 72, L. R. A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355)), the Supreme Court denied the right of the District Courts to suspend sentence. In the same opinion the court pointed out the necessity for action by Congress if the courts were to exercise probation powers in the future. The language of the court is as follows:\n\n\"So far as the future is concerned, ... recourse must be had to Congress, whose legislative power on the subject is, in the very nature of things, adequately complete.'\n\n'Since this decision was rendered, two attempts have been made to enact probation legislation. In 1917, a bill was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee and passed the House. In 1920, the Judiciary Committee again favorably reported a probation bill to the House, but it was never reached for definite action.\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 347, 355]\n\u00a0\n 'If this bill is enacted into law, it will bring the policy of the federal government with reference to its treatment of those convicted of violations of its criminal laws in harmony with that of the states of the Union. At the present time every state has a probation law, and in all but 12 states the law applies both to adult and juvenile offenders.'\n The report contains a memorandum in support of the bill, of which the following are passages:\n'Probation is the method by which the court disciplines and gives an opportunity to reform to certain offenders without the hardship, the expense, and the risk of subjecting them to imprisonment. ...\n\n'It frequently happens that the same or a similar offense is committed by a hardened repeater who is deserving of no mercy at the hands of the court, and by a young boy, a first offender who has been led into crime by evil associates or bad environment, who after his detention and trial is thoroughly repentant and capable of becoming an upright citizen if extended a helping hand upon his release. ...\n\n'The parole laws and pardoning power of the President are not adequate to meet the need for a probation system. Under the parole law the defendant must be committed and serve at least one-third of the sentence in full. This usually means six months sentence and always means the branding of the delinquent as a convict and taking him away from his environment and associates in disgrace. The result of long experience with the probation system shows that it is far easier to reclaim an unhardened early offender without commitment to a prison than after it. The presidential power of pardon is subject to the same criticism and can naturally only be exercised in special cases.'\n\n By the Act of June 21, 1902, c. 1140, 32 Stat. 397,  1 (18 USCA  710) every person convicted of an offense against the United \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 356]\n\u00a0\n States and confined in the penitentiary or jail for a definite term, having faithfully observed all the rules, becomes entitled to a deduction of five days for each month of the first year of his imprisonment, and for the period between one year and three, of six days, and increasing allowance therefor until it reaches ten days, for each month in a sentence of ten years or more.\n The Probation Act gives power to grant probation to a convict after his conviction or after a plea of guilty, by suspending the imposition or suspending execution of the sentence. This probation is to be after conviction or plea of guilty. The question is-Before what time must it be granted? Two answers to this latter question are possible. It must be either grantable at any time during his whole sentence or be limited to a time before execution of the sentence begins. If the first answer is adopted, it would confer very comprehensive power on the district judges in the exercise of what is very like that of executive clemency in all cases of crime or misdemeanor. It would cover in most cases the period between the imposition of the sentence and the full execution of it. It would cover a period in which not only clemency by the President under the Constitution might be exercised but also the power of parole by a board of parole abating judicial punishment to the extent of two-thirds of it as to all crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. It seems quite unlikely that Congress would have deemed it wise or necessary thus to make applicable to the same crimes at the same time three different methods of mitigation.\n Nor can we suppose that Congress would wish to grant such extended power in all but life and capital cases to the District Judges and thus subject each to the applications of convicts during the entire time until the full ending of the sentences. This would seem unnecessary for \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 357]\n\u00a0\n the hard-worked District Judges with their crowded dockets. A more reasonable construction is to reconcile the provisions for probation, parole, and executive clemency, making them as little of a repetition as we can. Executive clemency must, of course, cover every form of relief from punishment. The parole statute provides a board to be invested with full opportunity to watch the conduct of penitentiary convicts during their incarceration, and to shorten it, not only by the regular monthly reduction of days, but by a larger diminution by parole.\n What was lacking in these provisions was an amelioration of the sentence by delaying actual execution or providing a suspension, so that the stigma might be withheld, and an opportunity for reform and repentance granted before actual imprisonment should stain the life of the convict. This amerlioration had been largely furnished by a power which trial courts, many of them, had exercised to suspend sentences. In some sections of the country it had been practiced for three-quarters of a century. By the decision in Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27\n, 37 S. Ct. 72, L. R. A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355, that remedy was denied. In that case, however, this court suggested legislation to permit probation. For eight years thereafter Congress was petitioned to enact it, and finally the Probation Act was passed.\n The great desideratum was the giving to young and new violators of law a chance to reform and to escape the contaminating influence of association with hardened or veteran criminals in the beginning of the imprisonment. Experience had shown that there was a real locus poenitentiae between the conviction and certainty of punishment, on the one hand, and the actual imprisonment and public disgrace of incarceration and evil association, on the other. If the case was a proper one, great good could be done in stopping punishment by putting the new criminal on probation. The avoidance of imprisonment at \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 358]\n\u00a0\n time of sentence was therefore the period to which the advocates of a Probation Act always directed their urgency. Probation was not sought to shorten the term. Probation is the attempted saving of a man who has taken one wrong step, and whom the judge thinks to be a brand who can be plucked from the burning at the time of the imposition of the sentence. The beginning of the service of the sentence in a criminal case ends the power of the court even in the same term to change it. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163. Such a limit for probation is a natural one to achieve its end.\n The words of the first section important upon this issue are:\n'Shall have power, after conviction or after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, ... to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and to place the defendant upon probation.'\n\n The words mean to suspend the imposition of sentence, or to suspend the execution of sentence, and that the placing of defendant upon probation is to follow the suspension of the imposition, or the suspension of the excution of sentence, without an interval of any part of the execution. That is a reasonable construction, and serves the well- understood purpose of the statute. The suspension of execution was the point in time to which the provision for probation was directed. We do not say that the language is not broad enough to permit a possibly wider construction, but we think this not in accord with the intention of Congress.\n This act has been before courts of first instance and Circuit Courts of Appeal a number of times, but we have found only one reported case, in addition to the decisions by the district courts in the present cases, in which it has been held that probation may be granted after the service of the sentence has begun. That case is United States v. Chafina, 14 F.(2d) 622, a District Court case. The other cases brought to our attention are not inconsistent with our ruling. Nex v. James, District Judge (C. C. A.) 7 F. \n\n[275 U.S. 347, 359]\n\u00a0\n (2d) 590; Kriebel v. United States (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 762; Evans v. District Judge for the Western District of Tennessee (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 64; Ackerson v. United States (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 268; Davis v. United States (D. C.) 15 F.(2d) 697; United States v. Young (D. C.) 17 F.(2d) 129; United States v. Davis (D. C.) 19 F.(2d) 536.\n With this interpretation of the statute it must be decided that the District Court neither in the Glen Murray Case nor in the Cook Case, had power to grant probation. It is true that there was but one day of execution of the sentence in the Murray Case, but the power passed immediately after imprisonment began and there had been one day of it served. The cause is remanded to the District Court, with instruction to reverse the order placing Murray upon probation and for further proceedings. In the Cook Case the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the order of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas granting to Cook probation, is affirmed.\n No. 394, reversed.\n No. 539, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNADILLA VALLEY RY.

Y., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Harold E. Caldine, an employee on the petitioner's railroad was killed in a collision and his administrator brought this action. The case is within the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the only question before us is whether the death resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the employees of the carrier, within the meaning of the Act. Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1; 35 Stat. 65; Code, title 45,  51 (45 USCA  51).\n Caldine was conductor of train No. 2 upon a single track that passed through Bridgewater. He had printed orders that his train was to pass train No. 15 in Bridgewater yard, and that train No. 15 was to take a siding there to allow No. 2 to pass. The order was permanent unless countermanded in writing by the superintendent. Its purpose to prevent a collision was obvious and there was no excuse for not obeying it. But this time after reaching Bridgewater instead of waiting there as his orders required him to do, Caldine directed his train to go on. The consequence was that at a short distance beyond the proper stopping place his train ran into train No. 15 rightly coming the other way, and he was killed. The facts relied upon to show that the collision was due in part to the negligence of other employees are these. The conductor of No. 15 generally, or when he was a little late in arriving at a station about two miles from Bridgewater would telephone to the station agent at Bridgewater that he was coming. He did so on the day of the collision. The station agent who received the message testified that he told the motorman of No. 2, but the motorman denied it. At all events the deceased, the conductor of No. 2, did not receive the notice. It is argued that the failure to inform the conductor, and the act of the motorman in obeying the conductor's order to start, if, as the jury might have found, he knew that train No. 15 was on the way, were negligence to which the injury was due at least in part. It is said that the motorman should have refused to obey the conductor and should have conformed to the rule, and that his act in physically starting the car was even more immediately connected with the collision than the order of the deceased.\n The phrase of the statute, 'resulting in whole or in part,' admits of some latitude of interpretation and is likely to be given somewhat different meanings by different readers. Certainly the relation between the parties is to be taken into account. It seems to us that Caldine or one who stands in his shoes is not entitled as against the Railroad Company that employed him to say that the collision was due to any one but himself. He was in command. He expected to be obeyed and he was obeyed as mechanically as if his pulling the bell had itself started the train. In our opinion he cannot be heard to say that his subordinate ought not to have done what he ordered. \n\n[278 U.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n He cannot hold the Company liable for a disaster that followed disobedience of a rule intended to prevent it, when the disobedience was brought about and intended to be brought about by his own acts. See Davis v. Kennedy, \n266 \nU.S. 147\n, 45 S. Ct. 33.\n Still considering the case as between the petitioner and Caldine it seems to us even less possible to say that the collision resulted in part from the failure to inform Caldine of the telephone from train No. 15. A failure to stop a man from doing what he knows that he ought not to do, hardly can be called a cause of his act. Caldine had a plain duty and he knew it. The message would only have given him another motive for obeying the rule that he was bound to obey. There was some intimation in the argument for the respondent that the rule had been abrogated. The courts below assumed that it was in force and we see no reason for doubting that their assumption was correct.\n We have dealt with the difficulties that led the Court of Appeals to a different conclusion and are of opinion that the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES SHIPPING BOARD EMERGENCY FLEET CORP. v.

Griffiths, both of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are consolidated libels in personam, brought in admiralty by the respondents against the Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation in the Federal District Court for Northern California, in October, 1922, and November, 1923, to recover the value of goods shipped by them in December, 1919, and January, 1920, from San Francisco to ports in Wales and Holland, on the West Aleta, a merchant vessel owned by the United States and operated by the Fleet Corporation. \n1\n The libels alleged that the vessel deviated from the agreed voyage, passing the destined ports without entering and proceeding on a voyage to a port in Germany, and that in the course and by reason of such deviation the vessel stranded upon an island in the North Sea and became a total loss, with all \n\n[276 U.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n her cargo. The Fleet Corporation filed exceptions to the libels on the ground, among others, that they were filed more than one year after the Suits in Admiralty Act2 had gone into effect, and that by and under the provisions of that act and particularly section 5 thereof the alleged causes of action were barred. These exceptions were overruled. 295 F. 372. The Fleet Corporation then answered, relying on the liberties clause in the bills of lading, denying that there had been any deviation, and alleging that the loss was caused by risks and perils for which it was not liable under the bills of lading and the Harter Act. \n3\n The District Court, on the hearing, finding that there had been an unauthorized deviation and that had been an unauthorized deviation and the Suits in Admiralty Act, entered decrees in favor of the libelants for the value of the goods, with interest at the rate of 7 per cent. 7 F. (2d) 893. These were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that there had been an unwarranted deviation and that the Suits in Admiralty Act was not applicable, since its purpose was to substitute an action in personam for one in rem, and no suit in rem could have been brought as the vessel had been wrecked off the coast of a foreign country and was a total loss. 12 F . (2d) 721.\n The first contention of the Fleet Corporation is that these suits were barred by the limitation contained in section 5 of the Suits in Admiralty Act.\n That act, whose main provisions are set forth in the margin,4 was approved and went into effect on March 9, \n\n[276 U.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n 1920-several months after the alleged causes of action had arisen and more than a year before the libels were brought. It provided that no vessel owned by the United States or any corporation in which the United States or its representatives own the entire outstanding capital stock, or in the possession of or operated by or for the United States or such corporation, should be subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process, section 1; that where such vessel was employed as a merchant vessel and a proceed- \n\n[276 U.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n ing in admiralty could be maintained if it were privately owned or operated, a libel in personam might be brought against the United States or such corporation, as the case might be, section 2; and that suits based on causes of action arising prior to the act should be brought within one year after it went into effect, section 5.\n It is unquestioned that the Fleet Corporation is one which may be sued by a libel in personam under the provisions of the act. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n In Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, \n272 U.S. 675\n, 689-692, 47 S. Ct. 289 (1927), we held that, while the main purpose of the act was to exempt from seizure and arrest merchant vessels of the United States operated by it and its subordinate shipping corporations and to substitute for a suit in rem one in personam attended with the incidents of a proceeding in rem in which the personal liability of the United States took the place of the vessel, the act also had a wider effect and created a broader personal obligation of the United States, as the owner of an offending vessel, like that of a private owner, which might be enforced in admiralty by a libel in personam in cases where there was no basis for an action in rem.\n In view of this decision the libelants do not now contend, as in the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the act merely authorized a libel in personam as a substitute for a proceeding in rem. And the question here presented as to the effect of the act is whether, as the Fleet Corporation contends, the remedy given against it by a libel in personam in admiralty under the provisions of the act, is exclusive; or whether, as the libelants contend, this remedy is not exclusive and the Fleet Corporation may also, as a private corporation, be sued in admiralty by a libel in personam, independently of the provisions of the act.\n The act not only authorizes libels in personam to be brought in admiralty against the United States or the designated corporations on causes of action arising out of the possession or operation of merchant vessels, sections 1, 2, but fixes the venue in such suits, section 2; requires service on the United States or the corporation to be made upon the United States attorney, with notice to the Attorney General, section 2; applies to the suits the principles of law and rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties, section 3; limits the rate of interest which may \n\n[276 U.S. 202, 213]\n\u00a0\n be included in a money decree against the United States or the corporation, to 4 per cent. unless otherwise stipulated, section 3; exempts the United States or the corporation from the giving of any bond or admiralty stipulation, and provides that those previously given in any admiralty cause shall be canceled upon the assumption of liability by the United States, section 3; requires suits based on causes of action that had arisen before the act to be brought within one year after it goes into effect, and all other suits within two years after the cause of action arises, section 5; directs that the final judgments rendered in the suits, as well as those in previous admiralty causes in which the United States assumes liability, shall be paid by the accounting officers of the United States out of money in the Treasury, for which an appropriation is made, sections 3, 8; requires the Attorney General to report to each session of Congress all final judgments rendered against the United States or the corporation; and specifically repeals 'the provisions of all other acts' inconsistent with the act, section 13.\n The act plainly relates to causes of action which had previously arisen,6 as well as to those subsequently arising. It provides a remedy in admiralty for adjudicating and satisfying all maritime claims arising out of the possession of operation of merchant vessels of the United States and the corporations, in which the obligation of the United States is substituted for that of the corporations. To that end it furnishes a complete system of administration, applying to the United States and the corporations alike, by which uniformity is established as to venue, service of process, rules of decision and procedure, rate of interest, and periods of limitation; and not only provides that the \n\n[276 U.S. 202, 214]\n\u00a0\n judgments against the corporations, as well as those against the United States, shall be paid out of money in the Treasury, but repeals the inconsistent provisions of all other acts.\n In view of these provisions of the act we cannot doubt that it was intended to furnish the exclusive remedy in admiralty against the United States and the corporations on all maritime causes of action arising out of the possession or operation of merchant vessels. And nothing in its legislative history indicates a different purpose.\n It follows that after the passage of the act no libel in admiralty could be maintained against the United States or the corporations on such causes of action except in accordance with its provisions; and that as the libels in these cases were not brought against the Fleet Corporation within the period prescribed by section 5 they were barred. And although, as the libelants point out, this was not 'pleaded in any of the answers,' it was aptly and sufficiently pleaded in the exceptions to the libels, which correspond to demurrers in actions at law.\n Whether in addition to furnishing an exclusive remedy in admiralty, the act also prevents a resort to any concurrent remedies against the United States or the corporations on like causes of action in the Court of Claims or in courts of law, is a question not presented by these cases and upon which, although referred to in the argument, we express no opinion. And it is unnecessary to determine other contentions of the Fleet Corporation relating to the questions of deviation and laches.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; and the cause will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the libels.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The process was served on the Fleet Corporation. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 41 Stat. 525, c. 95, U.

WESTERN U.(1928)\nNo. 113\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[275 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Gardner P. Lloyd, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. John W. Davis and Francis R. Stark, both of New York City, and Paul E. Lesh, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By Post Roads Act July 24, 1866, c. 230, 14 Stat. 221, Rev. Stat.  5263-5266 (47 USCA  1-3, 6; Comp. St.  10072-10075), the United States offered privileges of great value to any telegraph company which should elect to accept its provisions. In return, it required, by section 2 of the act (now 47 USCA  3; Comp. St.  10075):\n'That telegraphic communications between the several departments of the government of the United States and their officers and agents shall, in their transmission over the lines of any of said companies, have priority over all other business, and shall be sent at rates to be annually fixed by the Postmaster General.'\n\n Each year since the passage of the act the government rates have been so fixed. For the fiscal years beginning July 1, 1921 and July 1, 1922, they were fixed for domestic telegrams substantially at 40 per cent. of the commercial rate, and for cablegrams at 50 per cent. of the commercial rate.\n The Western Union accepted the provisions of the act on June 8, 1867. Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n96 U.S. 1\n, 4; Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 U.S. 460\n. The Fleet Corporation was organ- \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n ized April 16, 1917. From that date to May, 1922, it was accorded, without question, the government rate on all messages sent by it. Then the Western Union claimed the right to the commercial rates for all its messages. The claim was resisted. Thereafter messages of the Fleet Corporation continued to be marked by it 'Government Rate'; but they were received under an agreement that the acceptance of the message and of payment therefor at the government rate should be without prejudice to the right of the Western Union to recover the additional amount claimed. This suit was brought, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to recover, for the months of June and July, 1922, the difference between the amount paid and the commercial rate. Of this amount, $1,071.16 was for messages sent to some official or agent of the Fleet Corporation or of the Shipping Board or to some other department or official of the government; $336.43, for messages addressed to private persons. A stipulation waiving the jury was filed; the case was heard on an 'agreed statement of facts'; the court found the facts to be as there stated; and a judgment entered for the full amount was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District. 56 App. D. C. 337, 13 F.(2d) 308. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n273 \nU.S. 681\n, 47 S. Ct. 236.\n The question whether messages transmitted for the Fleet Corporation after May 31, 1922, shall be paid for at the commercial rates or at the lower government rates is one of statutory construction. The Post Roads Act had been in force, without amendment, more than 55 years before the transactions here involved. Throughout that period, the rights of the government and the Western Union concerning the transmission of messages had been governed by the act, unaffected by any special contract, and there had been a uniform practice in applying it. That practice should be stated before discussing the specific facts relating to the Fleet Corporation. For the \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n construction given to the act by the United States, and acquiesced in by the Western Union, having been both contemporaneous and thereafter consistently and widely applied, is not only persuasive, but, in our opinion, decisive of the case. United States v. Alabama Great Southern R. R. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 615\n, 12 S. Ct. 306. Compare District of Columbia v. Gallaher, \n124 \nU.S. 505, 510\n, 8 S. Ct. 585.\n Continuously since June 8, 1867, the Western Union has extended the right of priority in transmission and the government rate, not only to each of the great Executive Departments presided over by a member of the Cabinet (and to the several bureaus, divisions, and officers thereof), but also to the judicial and the legislative branches, to the government of the District of Columbia, and to the following corporations existing at the time of the passage of the Post Roads Act: The Smithsonian Institution, organized pursuant to Act Aug. 10, 1846, c. 178, 9 Stat. 102, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteers, organized pursuant to Act March 3, 1865, c. 91, 13 Stat. 509, and Act March 21, 1866, c. 21, 14 Stat. 10. The Western Union has also extended, from time to time, the same preferences to at least the following minor independent departments established after the date of the acceptance by it of the provisions of the Post Roads Act: Civil Service Commission, Act Jan. 16, 1883, c. 27, 22 Stat. 403; Interstate Commerce Commission, Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 383; Bureau of American Republics (now the Pan-American Union), Act July 14, 1890, c. 706, 26 Stat. 272, 275; Panama Canal, Act April 28, 1904, c. 1758, 33 Stat. 429; Federal Reserve Board, Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6, 38 Stat. 251, 260; Federal Trade Commission, Act Sept. 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717 (15 USCA  41-51); Inter-American High Commission, United States Section, Act Feb. 7, 1916, c. 20, 39 Stat. 8; Bureau of Efficiency, Act Feb. 28, 1916, \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n c. 37, 39 Stat. 14, 15 (Comp.

So far as appears by the record, there has been no denial of the government rate at any time to any department, office, or division of the government as organized, except that to the Fleet Corporation here in question.\n The extension of the government rate to each of the above-named departments was made by the Western Union, as a matter of course, upon application therefor by the government, and has been continued ever since. The government rate was applied to all messages sent on official business of the government and chargeable to any of the departments named, whatever the nature of its organization, whatever its functions, and whatever the character of the official business. In extending priority and the lower rates, no distinction has ever been made between messages sent to persons within the several departments and those outside. And, obviously, the im- \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n portance to the United States of securing both priority and the lower rate for official messages sent by it, is the same whoever the addressee. Messages sent by the government, but not on official business exclusively, have been paid for by the private person interested; and the payment has been made at the commercial rate. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The Western Union has never questioned the right of the Shipping Board to the government rate on any official messages sent by it. It concedes that all the messages here in question relate to activities which the Shipping Board itself might legally have conducted; that all the messages were sent on its official business; that the Board was authorized by Congress to employ the Fleet Corporation as its agency to perform the particular activities in connection with which they were sent; that the messages were not to be paid for out of any segregated portion of Fleet Corporation money; that payment of the commercial rates would involve, indirectly, as additional charge on the public treasury; and that, so far as concerns the character of the message or of the business, the government rate was chargeable for all the messages, if for any of them. The claim that the government rates do not apply to messages of the Fleet Corporation is rested in part upon the fact that it is, in form, a private corporation; in part upon the fact that it is an agency of the Shipping Board, as distinguished from a bureau or division; in part upon the fact that, to a considerable extent \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n it is engaged in a business which involves competition with private shipowners. These arguments do not support the claim; but they make necessary a statement of the facts concerning the organization and activities of the Fleet Corporation.\n The Fleet Corporation was organized by the United States Shipping Board pursuant to specific authority conferred by the Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451,  11, 39 Stat. 728, 731 (46 USCA  810; Comp. St.  8146f). The legislation concerning it, its relation to the Shipping Board, its character and the scope of its activities are shown in the Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246\n, 39 S. Ct. 460, United States v. Strang, \n254 \nU.S. 491\n, 41 S. Ct. 165, Sloan Shipyards Corporation v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, 258 U. S, 549, 42 S. Ct. 386, United States v. Walter, \n263 \nU.S. 15\n, 44 S. Ct. 10, and United States ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. McCarl, \n275 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 12. Besides powers conferred upon the Fleet Corporation by the General Corporation Law of the District of Columbia (31 Stat. 1280 et seq., as amended), it was vested, by delegation from the President, with the powers conferred upon him by Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, Act April 22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535, and Act Nov. 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020, 1022 (Comp. St .  3115 1\/16 d). Executive Orders No. 2664, July 11, 1917; No. 2888, June 18, 1918; No. 3018, December 3, 1918; No. 3145, August 11, 1919. These specific powers and duties were transferred to the Shipping Board by Merchant Marine Act, 1920, June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988.\n Since the passage of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, the Fleet Corporation has been the agency through which the Shipping Board has performed its principal functions. The activities have consisted largely of maintaining and liquidating property acquired for the United States during the World War, of settling claims arising therefrom, and of operating, or causing to be operated, vessels not disposed of. Besides other activities, the Fleet Corporation \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n has operated directly, and has been interested in the operation of, vessels owned by the United States. Some of these government vessels have been operated in competition with American vessels privately owned. But in operating vessels, as in making sales, the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation were required by the Merchant Marine Act to proceed with a view to aiding in the development of an adequate merchant marine to serve, among other things, 'as a naval or military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency, ultimately to be owned and operated privately by citizens of the United States.' Section 1 (46 USCA  861; Comp. St.  8416 1\/4). These services of the Fleet Corporation were obviously of a public nature. It has never done any business, or conducted any operation, except on behalf of the United States.\n First. It is argued that the government rate should be denied because the Fleet Corporation is a private corporation. In form, it is such. But all of its $50,000,000 capital stock was subscribed and paid for by the Shipping Board on behalf of the United States. All has been so held by it ever since. The United States alone has had a financial interest in its capital stock. The United States alone has contributed the additional money needed from time to time for the conduct of its business. The Fleet Corporation has, of course, received from others moneys in payment for property sold, as charter hire, for shipping services, or in settlement of claims. But, as the business of the Fleet Corporation has been conducted continuously at a large loss, the sums so received did not supply capital. They served merely to reduce, to that extent, the amount of the deficit being incurred and, hence, the amount of the additional money which the United States was required to contribute. \n2\n Payment by the \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n Fleet Corporation of the commercial rate for messages would necessarily increase the charges upon the public treasury to the same extent, and in the same manner, as would the charge of the commercial rate in respect to the business done for the United States directly by the Shipping Board or that done for it by some other department of the government. An important, if not the chief, reason for employing a corporate agency was to enable the government to employ commercial methods and to conduct the operations with a freedom supposed to be inconsistent with accountability to the Treasury under its established procedure and with its control over the financial operations of the United States. United States ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. McCarl, \n275 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 12. It obviously was not the intention of the government in employing a corporate agency to deprive itself of the right of priority of transmission and of the lower rate secured through the Post Roads Act.\n Second. It is argued that in sending a message the Fleet Corporation contracted on its own behalf; that this contract gave to the Western Union the right to sue the corporation; and that by such contract there was secured the right to rely upon the credit of the corporation and to satisfy the debt out of its properties. All this may be admitted; but if affords no reason for denying that the Fleet Corporation is a department of the United States within the meaning of the Post Roads Act. Actually, the Fleet Corporation had no individual credit. As an agency of the Shipping Board it had control of certain properties and moneys required in the conduct of its \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n business. But it had no actual capital. Long before June 1, 1922, the $50, 000,000 which the United States supplied in payment of the capital stock, had been sunk in the business. \n3\n By, and pursuant to, Merchant Marine Act, 1920, the title to most of the property used by the Fleet Corporation was transferred to the Shipping Board or to the United States. All moneys other than amounts needed for current operation are required to be covered into the Treasury of the United States. The Fleet Corporation has had no means of paying either the large outstanding claims against it or of paying the deficits continuously being incurred, other than the moneys supplied by the United States through the annual appropriations. It is, of course, immaterial that the charge upon the public treasury is an indirect one; and the fact that the Fleet Corporation receives some gross income from shipping services is also without legal significance. Many departments receive fees, or some other form of compensation, for services rendered to private persons. See 14 Ops. Attys. Gen. 278.\n Third. It is argued that the Fleet Corporation should be denied the government rate, because it competes, in respect to some of its operations, with private shipping. But in operating ships it is performing a function of the government. The conduct of business in competition \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n with private interests may, of course, be for a public purpose. Standard Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, No. 91, \n275 \nU.S. 504\n, 48 S. Ct. 155, 72 L. Ed . -, decided December 5, 1927. Other departments which compete with private business have long enjoyed the government rate without question. The post office has since 1872 competed with bankers through money orders; since 1910 with savings banks by receiving deposits on interest; since 1913 with express companies through the parcel post. The War Finance Corporation has since 1918 competed with the private bankers. The War Department has by its Mississippi river barge lines competed since 1920 with the railroads. Equally with all of these, the Fleet Corporation is acting for and on behalf of the United States.\n Fourth. It is faintly argued that the Western Union is entitled to the commercial rates, because, since Act June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539, 544, which broadened the scope of the Act to Regulate Commerce so as to include telegraph companies, telegraph rates are no longer a matter of contract; that they have the force of law (Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Brothers & Co., \n256 \nU.S. 566\n, 41 S. Ct. 584); and that any deviation from the lawful rate would involve an undue preference to the government and an unjust discrimination against its competitors, the private shipping concerns. It may be doubted whether the prescribed rule requiring equality of treatment would ever be violated by giving to the government preferential rates. Compare Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318\n, 43 S. Ct. 583. But it is a sufficient answer to say that it clearly was not the intention of Congress by the act of 1910 to abrogate or modify the scope or affect the application of the Post Roads Act.\n Fifth. It is urged that, if the Fleet Corporation is granted the government rate, it may likewise be claimed by every instrumentality of the government. Instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve \n\n[275 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest. Compare Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 907. The Fleet Corporation is entitled to the government rate, not because it is an instrumentality of the government, but because it is a department of the United States within the meaning of the Post Roads Act. In respect to messages sent, on the government's business, no distinction can properly be made between those of the Shipping Board and those of the Fleet Corporation.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Thus, a Treasury Regulation, adopted April 2, 1918, provides: '(10) Government telegraph rates, established conformably to law, are intended to apply to official government business exclusively, and no private individual, association, company, or corporation should in any way be benefited thereby. In cases where it becomes necessary to use the telegraph on any business in the special interest of any private person or persons, in which the government has no interest, the party for whom the service is performed will be required to pay for the messages both ways at commercial rates.'

Woolsey, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Silas Blake Axtell, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 29, 1921, at New Orleans, La., respondent Adams signed articles for services as oiler on the Steel \n\n[275 U.S. 388, 389]\n\u00a0\n Trader during a voyage from that city to East Indian ports and return, at $ 80 per month. December 12, 1921, after the voyage began, and while at Port Arthur, Tex., he was discharged without fault on his part and without his consent. He received before a shipping commissioner the wages earned and $ 80 more. The vessel returned to New Orleans May 19, 1922. Thereafter Adams instituted this proceeding in rem, wherein he sought to recover as damages the stipulated wages from December 12, 1921, to May 19, 1922, plus $2.50 per day for subsistence. The trial court granted recovery for the amount of such wages ($414.50), less $80, with interest from May 19, 1922 (10 F. ( 2) 248, 250), and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that action (13 F. ( 2d) 614).\n The only matter for our consideration is the proper interpretation and construction of section 4527, Rev. St. U. S. (section 21, c. 322, Act of June 7, 1872, 17 Stat. 266; U. S. C. title 46,  594 (46 USCA  594; Comp. St.  8318)), which follows:\n'Any seaman who has signed an agreement and is afterward discharged before the commencement of the voyage or before one month's wages are earned, without fault on his part justifying such discharge, and without his consent, shall be entitled to receive from the master or owner, in addition to any wages he may have earned, a sum equal in amount to one month's wages as compensation, and may, on adducing evidence satisfactory to the court hearing the case, of having been improperly discharged, recover such compensation as if it were wages duly earned.'\n\n Chapter 322, Act of June 7, 1872-68 sections-prescribes elaborate regulations concerning employment, wages, treatment, and protection of seamen. Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co. v. Byrne, \n239 \nU.S. 459, 460\n, 36 S. Ct. 132. Section 21 became section 4527, R. S., without material change.\n The trial court held that section 4527 applies only to a wrongful discharge before commencement of the voyage. \n\n[275 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that 'the language of R. S.  4527, is consistent with an intention to treat the amount required to be paid to the wrongfully discharged seaman as compensation for the service already rendered by him,' and that payment thereof does not absolve from liability for breach of the shipping articles.\n We think both courts adopted improper views. According to the plain language employed, the section in question applies where the discharge takes place before the commencement of the voyage or before one month's wages are earned. Also we think, in the specified circumstances, payment of wages actually earned, with an additional sum equal to one month's wages, satisfies all liability for breach of the contract of employment by wrongful discharge. The legislation was intended to afford seamen a simple, summary method of establishing and enforcing damages.\n Mr. Conger, who reported the bill, which later became the Act of June 7, 1872, for the committee and had charge of it in the House of Representatives, there stated:\n'The bill is substantially the Shipping Commissioner's Act of England ( the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1854) with such changes as have been deemed necessary to adapt it to this country. ...' Congressional Globe of March 20, 1872, p. 1836\n\n\n\n The Shipping Act of 1854 provides:\n'Sec. 167. Any seaman who has signed an agreement, and is afterwards discharged before the commencement of the voyage, or before one month's wages are earned, without fault on his part justifying such discharge and without his consent, shall be entitled to receive from the master or owner, in addition to any wages he may have earned, due compensation for the damage thereby caused to him, \n\n[275 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n not exceeding one month's wages, and may, on adducing such evidence as the court hearing the case deems satisfactory of his having been so improperly discharged as aforesaid, recover such compensation as if it were wages duly earned.'1\n\n Speaking of section 167 in Tindle v. Davison (Queen's Bench Div. 1892) 66 L. T. N. S. 372, 374, Wright, J., said:\n'... The meaning of the section is that, when a seaman is improperly discharged, he is to have due compensation up to a month's wages in lieu of his right of action, unless he has earned a month's wages, in which case the section does not apply.'\n\n The word 'compensation,' in section 4527, distinctly indicates that payment of a sum equal to one month's wages was intended to constitute the remedy for invasion of the seaman's right through breach of his contract of employment in the circumstances specified. 'Damages consist in compensation for loss sustained. ... By the general system of our law, for every invasion of right there is a remedy, and that remedy is compensation. This compensation is furnished in the damages which are awarded.' Sedgwick's Damages (9th Ed.) vol. 1, p. 24. See, also, Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S. Ct. 966. The provision that such sum may be recovered 'as if it were wages duly earned' permits the seaman to enforce payment by the \n\n[275 U.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n special and summary methods provided for collecting his ordinary wages.\n In Calvin v. Huntley (1901) 178 Mass. 29, 32, 59 N. E. 435, we think the Supreme Court of Massachusetts properly interpreted section 4527, and in respect of it rightly said:\n'It speaks not of punishment, but of compensation; its object is to protect the seaman from loss rather than to punish the master for discharging him. The remedy is given to the seaman alone, and its plain purpose is to furnish a clear and well defined rule of damages as between him and the master for a breach of contract in which the seaman and the master or owner are the only persons interested. ...\n\n'Nor does the rule of damages seem unreasonable. The shipping contract calls upon the seaman to go to various places, sometimes far from home, and it may be, for instance as in this case was the actual fact, that he may be discharged in a port distant from that where he signed the articles, or where he cannot immediately secure any other employment on board ship or elsewhere, and that in all fairness he should recover more than the amount due him for wages earned. Hence it might be deemed advisable to have this indefinite element made definite by a general law with reference to which the parties may conclusively be presumed to have contracted, and which therefore should be taken to be the law of the contract. The object of the statute is not to punish but to provide a reasonable rule of compensation for a breach of contract. We think the statute not penal but remedial. ...'\n\n The decree of the District Court must be reversed. The cause will be remanded there for further proceedings in conformity with opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 162, British Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which corresponds to section 167, Act of 1854, provides: 'If a seaman, having signed an agreement, is dicharged otherwise than in accordance with the terms thereof before the commencement of the voyage, or before one month's wages are earned, without fault on his part justifying that discharge, and without his consent, he shall be entitled to receive from the master or owner, in addition to any wages he may have earned, due compensation for the damage caused to him by the discharge not exceeding one month's wages, and may recover that compensation as if it were wages duly earned.' \n\n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. CAMBRIDGE LOAN & BUILDING CO.(1928)\nNo. 46\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. T. H. Lewis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. L. L. Hamby, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the respondent to recover the amount of taxes for the years 1918 through 1923, paid under duress, from which it says that it was exempt by the Acts under which the taxes were levied. It recovered \n\n[278 U.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n in the Court of Claims and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court, April 9, 1928 (\n276 \nU.S. 614\n, 48 S. Ct. 420).\n The respondent is incorporated under the laws of Ohio, by which it is recognized as a building and loan association, and it has conducted its business in accordance with the laws of that State. The Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18,  231, 40 Stat. 1057, 1076, exempts from the taxes is question '(4) Domestic building and loan associations and cooperative banks without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit.' The Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136,  231, 42 Stat. 227, 253, exempts '(4) Domestic building and loan associations substantially all the business of which is confined to making loans to members; and cooperative banks without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit.' These are the statutes concerned. No definition is given of building and loan associations, and the question is what scope is to be given to the words.\n The rudimentary form of such associations is supposed to be a society raising by subscription of its members a fund for making advances to members in order to enable them to build or buy houses of their own. A member is entitled to borrow on sufficient security an amount equal to his subscription for shares and when the shares are paid up by the instalment payments required and the profits of the company his indebtedness is cancelled. The Government argues that the essence of these societies, what gives them their quasi public character and the only thing that warrants exempting them from taxes, is that their single purpose is to enable people to get homes of their own. When one of them yields to the temptation to enlarge its operations and to make a little money outside, the Government says, it loses its title to its distinctive name and to the exemption that the statute gives. The respondent received a large proportion of \n\n[278 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n deposits from persons who were not members and it paid interest upon the same, and it also made considerable loans to such persons until the passage of the Act of 1921. Even when the borrower was a stockholder he was required only to subscribe for from one to five shares regardless of the amount of the loan. It is argued that thus the society became a mere money-making institution like an ordinary bank.\n But for such an association to start it must have some money to lend, and the typical member does not have it. Long before Congress dealt with loan and building associations, an esteemed writer upon the subject had insisted on the reasonableness of allowing them to issue full paid stock with fixed dividends, both in his book and upon the bench. Endlich, Building Associations, 2d. Ed. (1895),  462. Folk v. Capital Savings & Loan Association, 214 Pa. 529, 534, 544, 63 A. 1013 (1906). The same author recognized depositors,  56, and with more or less qualification the right to lend to outsiders,  314, et seq., and to borrow,  297, et seq. Under the Ohio statute the respondent has these powers, and still, as we have said, is called a building and loan association by that State. The same name was commonly used in other States and similar powers were given with more or less restriction. When Congress exempted such associations from the income tax of course it was speaking of existing societies that commonly were known as such, not of ideals that would have been hard to find. And this is not left to inference alone. Some corporations having been taxed under the Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112, which exempted 'domestic building and loan associations organized ... exclusively for the mutual benefit of their members', the Act of February 26, 1917, c. 129, 39 Stat. 1491, 1493, directed the tax to be refunded as 'illegally collected' and included the respondent among the corporations named. This Act followed and by implication sanctioned decisions to similar \n\n[278 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n effect in Herold v. Park View Building & Loan Association (C. C. A.) 210 F. 577; Parkview Building & Loan Ass'n v. Herold (D. C.) 203 F. 876; Central Building, Loan & Savings Co. v. Bowland (D. C.) 216 F. 526.\n This interpretation was adhered to for the Act of 1909 and succeeding Acts including that of 1918 now before us until a few months before the Act of 1921. It was incorporated in Regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue approved by the Secretary of the Treasury as late as January 28, 1921, and up to then no taxes had been levied or paid. In June of that year however the Regulations were modified so as to declare the societies taxable if the amounts borrowed from and lent to nonmembers were out of proportion to the borrowing needs of the members and otherwise to limit the use of such societies as a mask to escape taxation. The present taxes are upheld by the Government on the ground that the respondent is such a mask. It is argued that even admitting all that has been said thus far, a State cannot make a bank exempt merely by calling it a building and loan association. No doubt extravagant cases might be imagined. But these associations are well known and a State is not likely to be party to a scheme to enable a private company to avoid federal taxation by giving it a false name. The statutes speak of 'domestic' associations, that is, associations sanctioned by the several States. They must be taken to accept with the qualifications expressly stated what the States are content to recognize, unless there is a gross misuse of the name. The State of Ohio has recognized and still recognizes the respondent as belonging to the class which its name indicates. Very possibly the company has strained its privileges to near the limit but we are not prepared to condemn the nomenclature adopted by the State. When the Act of 1921 was passed and added the words 'substantially all the business of which is confined to making loans to members' the respondent conformed to the \n\n[278 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n statute, by requiring membership as a condition to a loan. The statute did not limit loans to the amount of stock subscribed for. We may add that the net dividends are distributed to members at an equal rate to all.\n We deem it plain that no taxes were warranted before the Act of 1921, and are of opinion that the taxes under that also were not justified, although as we have said the rights of the company were pressed somewhat far. In coming to this result we have not though it necessary to go into details of disputed significance, thinking it enough to state the point of view from which we regard the case.\n The assessment was not made until September 18, 1924, up to which time the respondent not unreasonably had supposed itself exempt, and then was taxed retrospectively for the five years before the one then current. In the meantime the respondent has distributed its money in dividends to its members and they presumably have paid income taxes on the dividends received. The statute of limitations had run or was running against them when the Government at the last moment filed a motion to remand that would have delayed the case and would have given the statute a further chance to run. The facts alleged in the motion sufficiently appear in the findings of the Court of Claims and so far as material have been assumed in the discussion of the case.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. GOLDMAN(1928)\nNo. 723\nArgued: April 10, 1928Decided: May 14, 1928\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert R. Nevin, of Dayton, Ohio, for defendants in error.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An information presented by the United States to the District Court charged Jacob A. Goldman and others with criminal contempts committed by violating an injunction that had been granted by the court in a suit in equity brought by the United States against the National Cash Register Co. and others to enforce the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15). On motion of the defendants in error, the information was dismissed as to them on the ground that under section 25 of the Clayton Act1 the prosecution was \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n barred by the statute of limitations of one year. The United States sued out this direct writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The questions here are: 1st, Whether this Court has jurisdiction under the writ of error; and 2d, if so, whether the one-year statute of limitations is applicable.\n The information showed upon its face that the alleged contempts were committed by the defendants in error more than one year, but less than three years, prior to its presentment. They entered pleas of not guilty. In anticipation of and preparation for the trial a special examiner was appointed to take, transcribe and report to the court such testimony as the parties might offer, with the provision and understanding that at the trial the parties might rely on such portion of this testimony as might be desired and also introduce additional testimony, either oral or documentary. The testimony taken by the examiner was lodged with the District Judge, and, in accordance with a nunc pro tunc order, indorsed as 'Filed with the court pending trial in open court.' Before the trial the defendants in error3 moved to dismiss the charges against them on the ground that it appeared on the face of the information that the proceeding for contempt was instituted more than one year after the date of the alleged acts complained of. The United States demurred to this motion on the ground that, treating it as a special plea in bar, the matters therein contained were not sufficient in law to bar the prosecution of the information. The court, likewise treating the motion to dismiss as a special plea in bar raising the question of the statute of limitations, overruled the demurrer and dismissed the information as to the defendants in error on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 235]\n\u00a0\n 1. The Criminal Appeals Act provides that a writ of error may be taken by the United States from the District Courts direct to this Court 'in all criminal cases, in the following instances, to wit: ... From the decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.' The defendants in error challenge our jurisdiction under the present writ of error upon the grounds that this is not a criminal case, that the judgment was not one sustaining a special plea in bar, and that they had been put in jeopardy. We cannot sustain this contention.\n While a proceeding instituted by the United States for the punishment of a criminal contempt committed by a violation of an injunction is not 'a criminal prosecution' within the provisions of the Sixth Amendment relating to venue in a jury trial, Myers v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 95, 105\n, 44 S. Ct. 272, such a criminal contempt is 'an offense against the United States' whose prosecution is subject to the statute of limitations applicable to such offenses, Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604, 611\n, 34 S. Ct. 693, 58 L. Ed, 1115, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1044, and which, as such an offense, may be pardoned by the President under article 2 of the Constitution, Ex parte Grossman, \n267 \nU.S. 87, 115\n, 45 S. Ct. 332, 38 A. L. R. 131. The only substantial difference between such a proceeding for criminal contempt and a criminal prosecution is that in the one the act complained of is the violation of a decree and in the other the violation of a law. Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 42, 67\n, 45 S. Ct. 18, 35 A. L. R. 451. In Gompers v. United States, supra, 610 (34 S. Ct. 695), this court said, in language which was quoted with approval in Ex parte Grossman, supra, 116 (45 S. Ct. 335):\n'It is urged ... that contempts cannot be crimes, because, although punishable by imprisonment and therefore, if crimes, infamous, they are not within the protection of the Constitution and the amendments giving a right to trial by jury, etc., to persons charged with such crimes. ... It does not follow that contempts of the class under consideration are not \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n crimes, or rather, in the language of the statute, offenses, because trial by jury as it has been gradually worked out and fought out has been thought not to extend to them as a matter of constitutional right. These contempts are infractions of the law, visted with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure, ... and that at least in England it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way.'\n\n And we think it clear that informations brought by the United States for the punishment of criminal contempts constituting offenses against the United States are 'criminal cases' within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act, in as real and substantial a sense as ordinary criminal prosecutions for the punishment of crimes. See Bessette v. Conkey Co., \n194 U.S. 324\n, 335, et seq., 24 S. Ct. 665.\n Whether the judgment sustaining the motion of the defendants in error and dismissing the information on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations, was a 'judgment sustaining a special plea in bar' within the meaning of the act, is to be determined not by form but by substance. United States v. Thompson, \n251 \nU.S. 407, 412\n, 40 S. Ct. 289. The material question in such cases is the effect of the ruling sought to be reviewed. It is immaterial that the plea was erroneously designated as a plea in abatement instead of a plea in bar, United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 209, or that the ruling took the form of granting a motion to quash which was in substance a plea in bar, United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 \nU.S. 85, 86\n, 37 S. Ct. 68, 3 A. L. R. 516; United States v. Thompson, supra, 412 (40 S. Ct. 289). Here the motion to dismiss raised the bar of the statute of limitations upon the facts appearing on the face of the information, and was equivalent to a special plea in bar \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n setting up such facts. And the effect of sustaining the motion was the same as if such a special plea in bar had been interposed and sustained.\n It is also clear that as the court had merely entered a preliminary order for the taking of testimony for use at the trial, and had not commenced its sitting for the trial, the defendants in error had not then been placed in jeopardy.\n\n 2. \nFinding, therefore, that we have jurisdiction under the writ of error, we proceed to consider the contention of the United States that the prosecution of the information was not barred by the limitation of one year prescribed in section 25 of the Clayton Act.\n In Gompers v. United States, supra, 611, decided in May, 1914, it was settled that prosecutions for criminal contempts committed by violations of injunctions, were barred by the general three years' limitation applicable to non-capital crimes under R. S.  1044.4 And the sole question to be considered is whether this has been changed by section 25 of the Clayton Act, passed in October, 1914\n\n\n The provisions of the Clayton Act relating to the punishment of criminal contempt are in sections 21 to 25, inclusive (28 USCA  386-390). Section 21 provides:\n'That any person who shall willfully disobey any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any district court of the United States ... by doing any act or thing therein, or thereby forbideen to be done by him, if the act or thing so done by him be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States, or under the laws of any State in which the act was committed, shall be proceeded against for his said contempt as hereinafter provided.'\n\n Section 22 relates to the procedure, trial, punishment, etc., in proceedings for the punishment of 'such contempt'; section 23 to the allowance of writs of error. \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 238]\n\u00a0\n Section 24 provides:\n'That nothing herein contained shall be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within section twenty-one ... may be punished in conformity to the usages at law and in euqity now prevailing.'\n\n And section 25 provides:\n'That no proceeding for contempt shall be instituted against any person unless begun within one year from the date of the act complained of, nor shall any such proceeding be a bar to any criminal prosecution for the same act or acts. ...'\n\n Although section 25 is broad enough, upon its face, to provide a period of limitation of one year in all criminal contempts, we think that, when construed in the light of the context and read in connection with the preceding sections, it does not relate to the proseuction for criminal contempts of the character here involved. The act, as stated in Michaelson v. United States, supra, 66 (45 S. Ct. 20), is 'of narrow scope,' and 'carefully limited to the cases of contempt specifically defined.'\n Section 21 relates only to the prosecution for the disobedience of orders, decrees, etc., by doing any forbidden act which is of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under a Federal statute or State law. And section 24 specifically declares that 'nothing herein contained,'-meaning evidently no provision in the act relating to prosecutions for criminal contempts-shall be construed to relate to contempts committed in disobedience of any order, decree, etc., entered in any suit brought in the name or on behalf of the United States; but that these and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within \n\n[277 U.S. 229, 239]\n\u00a0\n section 21, may be punished in conformity to the prevailing usages at law and in equity.\n It is plain, we think, that this specific exception in section 24 applies to section 25 relating to the period of limitations as well as to the other sections, and hence that the one year limitation prescribed by section 25 has no application to the proceeding in the present case, which was brought for the disobedience of a decree entered in a suit brought and prosecuted in the name and on behalf of the United States.\n We find nothing in the legislative historyof the act which indicates any different intention on the part of the Congress.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not sit in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 730, c. 323; U.

LENSON(1928)\nNo. 48\nArgued: October 24, 1928Decided: November 19, 1928\n\n\n\n Lieutenant of Staff Corps of Navy, in continuous service for 15 years with 3 1\/2 years' service as commissioned officer, held not entitled to fourth period pay under Act June 10, 1922, c. 212 (37 USCA  1, 4), where it was not shown that his total commissioned service equaled that of any lieutenant commander of the line of the navy drawing the pay of that period, notwithstanding Act March 3, 1883, c. 97,  1 (34 USCA  231). \n\n[278 U.S. 60, 61]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Messrs. George A. King and William B. King, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim by a lieutenant of the Staff Corps of the Navy, under the Act of June 10, 1922, c. 212, 42 Stat. 625 (Code, title 37,  1, 4; 37 USCA  1, 4) which went into effect on July 1, 1922, that by section 1 of that Act he is entitled to pay of the fourth period there mentioned from the date of the Act to April 23, 1924, amounting to $1,935.89. On the last date he had served seventeen years, as enlisted man and officer, and since then has received fourth period pay. The Court of Claims gave the claimant judgment for the sum named. A writ of certiorari was granted by this court on March 5, 1928. \n276 \nU.S. 612\n, 48 S. Ct. 320.\n As stated by his counsel the claimant had been in continuous service for over fifteen years when the Act took effect, about eleven years as enlisted man, six months as a warrant officer and three and a half years as commissioned officer. His first appointment in the permanent service in the Navy was as a lieutenant, junior grade, of the Staff Corps, corresponding to a first lieutenant in the \n\n[278 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n Army. The pay of the fourth period, $3,000, is given 'to lieutenants of the Staff Corps of the Navy, and lieutenants and lieutenants (junior grade) of the line and Engineer Corps of the Coast Guard whose total commissioned service equals that of lieutenant commanders of the line of the Navy drawing the pay of this period.' The absence of a comma after 'Coast Guard' is laid hold of to show that the qualification as to commissioned service applies only to the last clause and not to lieutenants of the Staff Corps of the Navy, but no intelligible reason is given for limiting it in that way. The length of commissioned service seems in reason as proper a consideration in determining the pay of one class as of the other. If then the claimant's total commissioned service must have equaled that of lieutenant commanders of the Navy drawing fourth period pay we are of opinion that his claim must fail.\n The pay of the fourth period is given by the same section to lieutenant commanders of the Navy, 'who have completed fourteen years' service, or whose first appointment in the permanent service was in a grade above that corresponding to second lieutenant in the Army.' The claimant points out that his first appointment corresponded, as we have said, to that of a first lieutenant in the Army. But the requirement is that his commissioned service should equal that of lieutenant commanders. If this could be satisfied by any service less than the fourteen years, the alternative would be that of a lieutenant commander drawing fourth period pay whose total service was not more than what the claimant can show.\n It is argued that by the Act of March 3, 1883, c. 97,  1, 22 Stat. 473 (Code, title 34,  231; 34 USCA  231), all service of the officer was put on the footing of commissioned service, and that by this same  1 of the Act of 1922 now before us, 'For officers in the service on June 30, 1922, there shall be included in the computation all service which is now counted \n\n[278 U.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n in computing longevity pay.' But when Congress with all this before it, specified commissioned service we must take it to have meant commissioned service, and not something else that for other purposes was just as good.\n The same paragraph of the same section gives pay of the fourth period to lieutenants of the Navy 'who have completed seventeen years' service.' Under that provision the claimant's service as an enlisted man is counted and he now gets the pay. But this brings out the contrast embodied in the words between service and commissioned service. Assuming that lieutenant commanders could make out their fourteen years by counting service rendered before they received commissions, still it is the commissioned service of the claimant that must equal that of the lieutenant commanders, and we repeat the claimant shows no case of a lieutenant commander whose service or even whose commissioned service was not more than about three years and a half. The statute is not very clear, but we are of opinion that the Government is right in denying the claim.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. MAGNOLIA PETROLEUM CO.(1928)\nNo. 283\nArgued: January 4, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Barry Mohun, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent was assessed and paid for 1916 an income tax of $105,571. 95 and for 1917 income and excess profits \n\n[276 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n taxes of $1,131,075.86 in excess of the amounts for which it was liable. October 11, 1923, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue so determined, and, November 22, 1923, the respondent received certificates showing such over assessments and treasury warrants for the return of these amounts. Each certificate included a statement that 'interest status will be determined as soon as necessary data can be assembled.'\n Section 1324(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which was then in force, authorized interest from the date of the payment of the taxes if paid under protest; but, if not paid under protest or pursuant to an additional assessment, it allowed interest to commence six months after the filing of claim for refund. Section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924, provided that interest on refunds should be computed from the date the taxes were paid. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n January 18, 1924, the Commissioner notified respondent that the interest payable on the refunds had been determined. July 2, 1924, after the passage of the Revenue Act of that year, the Commissioner wrote respondent that \n\n[276 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n the amounts stated in his letter of January 18, 1924-corrected by reason of an error as to the date of filing the claim for refund of 1917 taxes- would be paid, and on July 18, 1924, issued a treasury warrant to respondent for $35,369.05, being $19,171.21 on the refund of 1916 taxes and $16,197.84 on the refund of 1917 taxes. Respondent, saving its right to sue for additional interest, accepted payment of the amount specified, and later brought this suit. The Court of Claims held that the act of 1924 applied, calculated interest from dates of payment of the taxes, and gave judgment for $365,799.42. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n275 \nU.S. 512\n, 48 S. Ct. 28, 72 L. Ed. -.\n The petitioner maintains that the interest should be computed according to section 1324(a) of the act of 1921. Respondent contends that by section 1019 of the act of 1924 and contemporaneous repeal of section 1324(a), the basis of interest allowances was changed and that, as the interest had not yet been paid, respondent became entitled to an amount calculated according to the later enactment. Undoubtedly it was within the power of Congress to apply that basis to claims like those of respondent. But the question is whether the statute should be so construed. The date of 'allowance' was October 11, 1923, when the Commissioner approved the refunds. Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 46 S. Ct. 229. Under section 1324(a), 'upon the allowance' of the refunds, respondent became entitled to interest according to the rule then in force. Cf. Blair v. Birkenstock, \n271 \nU.S. 348, 350\n, 46 S. Ct. 506. Computation and payment were all that remained to be done. There is nothing to suggest that section 1019 was intended to change the rule as to refunds theretofore allowed. The language employed shows the contrary. The words are 'upon the allowance of ... refund ... interest shall be allowed ... from the date such tax was paid.' Statutes are not to be given retroactive effect or construed to change the status of claims fixed in accordance with earlier pro- \n\n[276 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n visions unless the legislative purpose so to do plainly appears. United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch, 399, 413; White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545, 552\n, 24 S. Ct. 171; Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454. Respondent calls attention to section 1100 of the act of 1924 (Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 t), repealing the act of 1921 and says that the saving clause therein does not extend to interest on refunds allowed under section 1324(a). But, save as given by Congress, respondent had no right to interest; as shown above, the basis prescribed by the later act was not substituted for that fixed by the earlier one; and, as respondent's right to have the rule prescribed by the act of 1921 applied is not questioned, we need not consider the effect of the repealing and saving clauses. It is clear that respondent is not entitled to allowances on the basis of the act of 1924, and that the judgment must be reversed.\n Respondent, assuming that the act of 1921 applies, insists that the facts found by the lower court show that the Commissioner's allowances of interest were erroneous and that it is entitled to much more than it has received.\n It appears from calculations made in its brief that if the basis contended for by the respondent be applied to the refund of the 1916 tax, respondent has been allowed and paid.$864.99 in excess of what it was entitled to have. As petitioner is not complaining of that, we need not consider the matter.\n As to the 1917 taxes, respondent filed returns May 18, 1918, but paid no tax thereon. May 27 following, it filed amended returns showing taxes of $1,966,600.87, and, on June 15, paid that amount under protest. Petitioner contends that the protest was not sufficient under section 1324( a) to support a claim for interest from the date of payment. On June 12, 1920, respondent filed a claim for the full amount paid; and, September 20, 1920, filed claim for $1,005,519.42. October 8, 1923, the Commissioner wrote respondent that its claim first filed would be allowed for $1,131, 075.86, and that the one last filed would be rejected \n\n[276 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n in full. January 18, 1924, the Commissioner wrote respondent concerning the interest allowance stating that no part of the claim first filed had been allowed, that $105,556.84 had been allowed on the basis of the claim last filed, and that $1,025,519.52 of the refund was 'attributable to points not raised in the claim.' The interest paid was calculated on the amount said to have been allowed on the latest claim for the period commencing March 20, 1921-six months after the filing of that claim-and ending October 11, 1923, the date of the allowance.\n If the protest was sufficient under section 1324(a), interest should have been calculated on the amount of the refund from the date of the payment of the taxes. The lower court held it valid. In order to meet the condition specified in section 1324(a), the payment must be made 'under a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis of and reasons for such protest.' The findings set forth its language. The grounds asserted were that the taxing acts were ambiguous, uncertain and unconstitutional; that they did not apply to respondent; that the regulations prescribed under them were not authorized, and that the method prescribed for applying the rates under the War Excess Profits Tax Act was arbitrary and unjust. It was not found that any part of the refund was allowed on any ground or for any reason specified in the protest. It requires no discussion to show that these general statements were not sufficient to constitute a basis for the allowance of interest from the date of the payment of the taxes. The protest gave no information and stated nothing that would aid in determining whether an overassessment had been made. It was not sufficients. Girard Trust Co. v. United States, supra, 172 (46 S. Ct. 229).\n Assuming the protest inadequate, respondent insists that it is entitled to interest on the full amount of the refund from six months after the filing of its first claim. But, as the merits of that contention depend upon am- \n\n[276 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n biguous findings above referred to, the lower court should again consider the case and make definite determination of the controlling facts and give judgment thereon.\n The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1324(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 316 (Comp.

C., for the United States. \n\n[276 U.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Aniello Manzi filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States October 15, 1913. He did December 19, 1914. On October 4, 1924, his widow Amalia, respondent herein, relying upon her husband's declaration, asked for citizenship. This was granted February 3, 1925, and certificate issued over the objection that her request came too late, more than seven years having passed since the husband made his declaration.\n January 9, 1926, the United States began this proceeding by a petition in the District Court for Rhode Island to cancel her certificate upon the ground that it had been illegally procured. That court dismissed the petition and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. (16 F.( 2d) 884.) The single question for our consideration is one of law: Whether it was unnecessary for respondent to declare her intention because her husband had declared his in 1913\n\n\n The Solicitor General maintains, and we think rightly, that while a widow may have the benefit of her husband's declaration, she must perfect her citizenship under the restrictions specified for him, including the requirement that request for naturalization must come not more than seven years after such declaration. The intention of Congress was to treat the action of the husband as though taken by the widow herself.\n The Act of June 29, 1906, 'to establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to provide for a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens throughout the United States' (34 Stat. 596), definitely prescribes the circumstances under which aliens may be naturalized. Its requirements are much more stringent than those found in former acts. \n\n[276 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n Section 4, par. 1 (8 USCA  373), directs that 2 years, at least, prior to his admission, and after he has reached the age of 18 years, the alien shall declare on oath that it is his bona fide intention to become a citizen, and then directs-\n'Second. Not less than two years nor more than seven years after he has made such declaration of intention he shall make and file, in duplicate, a petition in writing, signed by the applicant in his own handwriting and duly verified, in which petition such applicant shall state his full name, his place of residence (by street and number, if possible), his occupation, and, if possible, the date and place of his birth; the place from which he emigrated, and the date and place of his arrival in the United States, and, if he entered through a port, the name of the vessel on which he arrived; the time when and the place and name of the court where he declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States; if he is married he shall state the name of his wife and, if possible, the country of her nativity and her place of residence at the time of filing his petition; and if he has children, the name, date, and place of birth and place of residence of each child living at the time of the filing of his petition: Provided, That if he has filed his declaration before the passage of this Act he shall not be required to sign the petition in his own handwriting.' 8 USCA  379.\n\n'Sixth. When any alien who had declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States dies before he is actually naturalized the widow and minor children of such alien may, by complying with the other provisions of this Act, be naturalized without making any declaration of intention.' 8 USCA  375.\n\n'Sec. 27. That substantially the following forms shall be used in the proceedings to which they relate: \n\n[276 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n 'Declaration of Intention.\n\n'(Invalid for all purposes seven years after the date hereof.)' 8 USCA  409.\n\n The formula to be observed by a declarant is then set forth.\n Pertinent sections of the Revised Statutes, in effect prior to 1906, provided-\n'Sec. 2165. An alien may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States in the following manner, and not otherwise:\n\n'First. He shall declare on oath, before a circuit or district court of the United States, or a district or supreme court of the territories, or a court of record of any of the states having common- law jurisdiction, and a seal and clerk, two years, at least, prior to his admission, that it is bona fide his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, and, particularly, by name, to the prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of which the alien may be at the time a citizen or subject.'\n\n'Sec. 2168. When any alien, who has complied with the first condition specified in section twenty-one hundred and sixty-five, dies before he is actually naturalized, the widow and the children of such alien shall be considered as citizens of the United States, and shall be entitled to all rights and privileges as such, upon taking the oaths prescribed by law.'\n\n Manifestly, the act of 1906, demands much more of the widow of a deceased alien who had declared his intention before she can become a citizen than was necessary under section 2168, Revised Statutes. Although in certain circumstances she may obtain naturalization without her personal declaration of intention, she must comply with all other prerequisites.\n\n\n[276 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n Citizenship is a high privilege, and when doubts exist concerning a grant of it, generally at least, they should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant. Swan & Finch Co. v. United States, \n190 \nU.S. 143, 146\n, 23 S. Ct. 702. If Aniello had lived, his declaration of intention would have been valueless to him after seven years. The construction now suggested by respondent would prolong the efficacy of this application for her benefit during an indefinite period.\n The act of 1906 definitely directs that the petition for citizenship shall be filed within seven years after the declaration, and we find nothing in the words used or the legislative purpose which permits an extension of such time for the benefit of widows. United States v. Poslusny (C. C. A.) 179 F. 836, In re Schmidt (D. C.) 161 F. 231, and In re Shearer (D.

Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the original action commenced in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, Isaac Untermyer sought to recover of the United States collector of internal revenue the tax exacted of him, under the Act of June 2, 1924,  319 et seq. (26 USCA  1131 et seq.; Comp. St.  6336 4\/5  et seq.), on account of a gift which he made May 23, 1924. After his death the cause was revived in the name of the executors- petitioners herein-and was then heard upon an agreed statement of facts. Both sides moved for a directed verdict. Judgment went for the collector, and was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The questions now presented for consideration are similar to those involved in Boldgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105, decided here November 21, 1927\n\n\n The two causes differ in this: Blodgett's gifts were made during January, 1924, before the provisions for taxing such transfers were presented for the consideration of Congress; Untermyer made his gift May 23, 1924, some three months after those provisions were first presented and while the conference report upon the bill was pending. This report went to the Senate May 22, 1924, and three days thereafter the bill had finally passed \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 445]\n\u00a0\n both houses. The President approved it on June 2, 1924.\n Unless the difference in circumstances stated is material, the same rule of law must govern both cases.\n Two opinions were announced in Blodgett v. Holden. The one prepared by the present writer expressed the views of four of the eight Justices who participated in the consideration of the cause. After quoting the pertingent provisions of the statute, etc., the opinion declared:\n'So far as the Revenue Act of 1924 undertakes to impose a tax because of the gifts made during January, 1924, it is arbitrary and invalid under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.'\n\n We need not now further repeat what was there set out.\n In the light of arguments advanced by counsel in the present cause, the matter has been considered by all members of the Court, and a majority of them are of opinion that the gift tax provisions of the act of 1924 here challenged must be construed as applicable to gifts made during the entire calendar year 1924. And, further, that so far as applicable to bona fide gifts not made in anticipation of death and fully consummated prior to June 2, 1924, those provisions are arbitrary and invalid under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The mere fact that a gift was made while the bill containing the questioned provisions was in the last stage of progress through Congress we think is not enough to differentiate this cause from the former one and to relieve the legislation of the arbitrary character there ascribed to it. To accept the contrary view would produce insuperable difficulties touching interpretation and practical application of the statute and render impossible proper understanding of the burden intended to be imposed. The taxpayer may justly demand to know when and how he becomes liable for taxes-he cannot foresee and \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 446]\n\u00a0\n ought not to be required to guess the outcome of pending measures. The future of every bill while before Congress is necessarily uncertain. The will of the lawmakers is not definitely expressed until final action thereon has been taken.\n The judgment below must be reversed.\n Mr. Justice SANFORD concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n As I think the construction of the Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234,  319 ( 26 USCA  1131; Comp. St.  6336 4\/5 s), adopted by four of us in Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105, November 21, 1927, the proper one, I shall not go into the question of constitutionality beyond saying that I find it hard to state to myself articulately the ground for denying the power of Congress to lay the tax. We all know that we shall get a tax bill every year. I suppose that the taxing act may be passed in the middle as lawfully as at the beginning of the year. A tax may be levied for past privileges and protection as well as for those to come. Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 216\n, 36 S. Ct. 66; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 \nU.S. 351\n, 25 S. Ct. 44; Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323. I do not imagine that the authority of Congress to tax the exercise of the legal power to make a gift will be doubted any more than its authority to tax a sale. Apart from its bearing upon construction and constitutionality I am not at liberty to consider the justice of the act.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE agree with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE concur.\n To what Mr. Justice HOLMES has said, I add this.\n The Court construes the act as applying to all gifts made \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 447]\n\u00a0\n during the calendar year. Then it holds the act void as applied to a gift made during the ten-day period between the submission of the Conference Report to Congress and the approval of the act by the President. It holds the act void because the action of the lawmaking body is, in its opinion, unreasonable. Tested by the standard of reasonableness commonly adopted by man-use and wont-that action appears to be reasonable. Tested by a still higher standard to which all Americans must bow-long-continued practice of Congress repeatedly sanctioned by this Court after full argument-its validity would have seemed unquestionable, but for views recently expressed. No other standard has been suggested.\n For more than half a century it has been settled that a law of Congress imposing a tax may be retroactive in its operation. Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331; Lake Shore & M. S. Railroad Co. v. Rose, \n95 U.S. 78\n, 80; Western Union Railroad Co. v. United States, \n101 U.S. 543\n, 549; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 36 S. Ct. 236; Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 38 S. Ct. 543; Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 164\n, 44 S. Ct. 462. Each of the fifteen income tax acts adopted from time to time during that last 67 years has been retroactive, in that it applied to income earned, prior to the passage of the act, during the calendar year. \n1\n The Act of October \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 448]\n\u00a0\n 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, which taxed all incomes received after March 1, 1913, was specifically upheld in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, and in Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 38 S. Ct. 543. Some of the acts have taxed income earned in an earlier year. The Joint Resolution of July 4, 1864, No. 77, 13 Stat. 417, imposed an additional tax on imcomes earned during the calendar year 1863; this additional tax being imposed after the taxes for the year had been paid. In Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331, Mr. Justice Miller said: 'No one doubted the validity of the tax or attempted to resist it.' The Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, title 2, 40 Stat. 1057, 1058-1088 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 a et seq.), which taxed incomes for the calendar year 1918, was applied, without question as to its constitutionality, in United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S. Ct. 148, and numerous other cases.\n The Corporation Tax Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112 (Comp. St.  7280), applying to all net income for the calendar year was sustained in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220\n___ The Act of August 27, 1894, c. 349, 28 Stat. 509, 553, applied to incomes in the calendar year ending December 31, 1894. The Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166, applied to incomes received subsequent to March 1, 1913. The Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756 (Comp. St.  6336a et seq.), applied to all income of that year. The increased rates established by the Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300 (Comp. St.  6336aa et seq.), applied to incomes received during the calendar year commencing January 1, 1917. The Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1058 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 a et seq.), applied to incomes for the year 1918. Later Revenue Acts have been similarly retroactive with respect to the income tax: Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/8 a et seq.); Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 254 (26 USCA  931 et seq.; Comp. St.  6336 1\/6 et seq .); Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 10. \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 449]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 107, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. The Acts of March 3, 1917, c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000, and of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 302 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 a et seq.), imposing excess profits taxes on the profits earned during the calendar year, were so applied in La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377\n, 41 S. Ct. 528, in Greenport Basin & Construction Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 512\n, 43 S. Ct. 183, and in other cases. The validity of the Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, title 3, 40 Stat. 1057, 1088 (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 a et seq.), taxing excess profits earned during the calendar year 1918, has never been questioned. Compare Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., \n275 \nU.S. 215\n, 48 S. Ct. 71; Blair v. Oesterlein Machinery Co., \n275 \nU.S. 220\n, 48 S. Ct. 87; Porto Rico Coal Co. v. Edwards (D. C.) 275 F. 104; National Paper & Type Co. v. Edwards (D. C.) 292 F. 633. The Munition Manufacturer's Tax, imposed by the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, title 3, 39 Stat. 756, 780 (Comp. St.  6336 1\/4 a et seq.), applied to the 12 months ending December 31, 1916. Compare Carbon Steel Co. v. Lewellyn, \n251 \nU.S. 501\n, 40 S. Ct. 283; United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 435\n, 46 S. Ct. 131. The Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1126 (Comp. St.  5980n et seq.), which materially increased the capital stock tax, made the increase retroactive to July 1, 1918. In Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 164\n, 44 S. Ct. 462, these retroactive provisions were held to validate taxes erroneously essessed under an earlier act and paid before the passage of the act of 1919.\n Except for the peculiar tax involved in Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1184, no federal revenue measure has ever been held invalid on the score of retroactivity. The need of the government for revenue has hitherto been deemed a sufficient justification for making a tax measure retroactive whenever the imposition seemed consonant with justice and the conditions were not such as would ordinarily involve hardship. On this broad ground rest and cases in which a special assessment upon real estate has been upheld, although the benefit resulting from the improvement had been enjoyed and the cost thereof had been paid prior to any legislation attempting to authorize \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 450]\n\u00a0\n the assessment. Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207\n, 36 S. Ct. 66; also the cases in which special assessments upon real estate have been upheld, although the benefit had been conferred and the cost thereof had been paid before there was a valid authorization either of the improvement or of the assessment. Compare Charlotte Harbor & Northern Ry. Co. v. Welles, \n260 \nU.S. 8\n, 43 S. Ct. 3. Such retroactive legislation has been sustained, although the validating statute was not enacted until after the property benefited had passed to a bona fide purchaser without notice of any claim that it had been, or might be, assessed for a benefit. Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 \nU.S. 351\n, 25 S. Ct. 44. Compare Citizens' National Bank v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 443, 454\n, 30 S. Ct. 532. The right of the Philippine Government to retain import and export duties laid and collected without authority was sustained where thereafter Congress by retroactive legislation confirmed the unlawful action in collecting the duties. United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, 27 S. Ct. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688. Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., \n257 \nU.S. 226\n, 42 S. Ct. 71. Liability for taxes under retroactive legislation has been 'one of the notorious incidents of social life.' Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 \nU.S. 351, 360\n, 25 S. Ct. 44. Recently this Court recognized broadly that 'a tax may be imposed in respect of past benefits.' Forbes Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, \n258 \nU.S. 338, 339\n, 42 S. Ct. 325.\n The act with which we are here concerned had, however, a special justification for retroactive features. The gift tax was imposed largely to prevent evasion of the estate tax by gifts inter vivos, and evasion of the income tax by the splitting up of fortunes and the consequent diminution of surtaxes. If, as is thought by the Court, Congress intended the gift tax to apply to all gifts during the calendar year, its purpose may well have been to prevent evasion of the gift tax itself, by the making of gifts after its introduction and prior to its passage. Is Congress powerless to prevent such evasion by the vigilant \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 451]\n\u00a0\n and ingenious? This Court has often recognized that a measure may be valid as a necessary adjunct to a matter that lies within legislative power, even though, standing alone, its constitutionality might have been subject to doubt. Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192\n, 33 S. Ct. 44; Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 289\n, 40 S. Ct. 141; Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545, 560\n, 44 S. Ct. 628. If the Legislature may prohibit the sale of confessedly innocent articles in order to insure the effective prohibition of others, I see no reason why it may not spread a tax over a period in advance of its enactment sufficiently long to insure that the tax will not be evaded by anticipating the passage of the act. Compare United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 94\n, 39 S. Ct. 214. In taxation, as well as in other matters, 'the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured.' See Mr. Justice Holmes in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 241\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 262 (70 L. Ed. 557, 43 A. L. R. 1224). Under the rule now applied, even a measure framed to prevent evasion of a tax from a date when it is practically certain that the act will become law is deemed unreasonable and arbitrary.\n The problem of preventing loss of revenue by transactions intervening between the date when legislation is introduced and its final enactment is not a new one; nor it is one peculiar to the gift tax. Other nations have met it by a method similar to that which the Court holds to be denied to Congress. England long ago adopted the practice of making customs and excise duties retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year or to the date when the government's resolutions were agreed to by the House of Commons sitting as a committee of ways and means. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 440, 452]\n\u00a0\n A similar practice prevails in Ireland,3 in all the self-governing dominions,4 and to some extent in France and Italy. \n5\n In the United States, retroactive operation of the tariff has been repeatedly recommended by the Tariff Commission and by the Secretary of Commerce. \n6\n Legislation to that end was reported by the committee on ways and means of the House of Representatives. \n7\n No suggestion seems to have been made that such legislation would by its retroactive feature violate the due process clause. 8 \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 453]\n\u00a0\n For nearly a century after the adoption of the Constitution, this Court approached with great reluctance the exercise of its high prerogative of declaring invalid an act of Congress. In Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270, it is said with respect to a state statute:\n'It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity, and the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.'\n\n In the Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718, this Court \n\n[276 U.S. 440, 454]\n\u00a0\n said with respect to an act of Congress:\n'Every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the government cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule.'\n\n The presumption in favor of the validity of an act of Congress, often adverted to, has been acted upon as recently as United States v. Berwind- White Coal Mining Co., \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 727; and Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States (No. 242), \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S. Ct. 348, 72 L. Ed. -, this day decided. The presumption should be particularly strong where, as here, the objection to an act arises not from a specific limitation or prohibition on Congressional power but only out of the 'vague contours of the Fifth Amendment, prohibiting the depriving any person of liberty or property without due process of law.' Mr. Justice Holmes in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 568\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238. I find no reason for thinking that the presumption has been overcome. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of August 5, 1861, c. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309, applied to all incomes for the calendar year next preceding January 1, 1862. The Act of July 1, 1862, c. 119, 12 Stat. 432, 473, enacted higher rates, applicable to incomes for the year ending December 31, 1862. The Joint Resolution of July 4, 1864, No. 77, 13 Stat. 417, imposed an additional tax of 5 per cent. on incomes for 1863 which had already been taxed at the rates established by the Act of 1862. The Act of June 30, 1864, c. 173, 13 Stat. 223, 281, applied to incomes for the then current calendar year. The Act of March 3, 1865, c. 78, 13 Stat. 469, 479, which again raised the rates, applied to income for the year ending December 31, 1865. The Act of March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 477, also applied to income for the current calendar year. The Act of July 14, 1870, c. 255, 16 Stat. 256, 257, taxed incomes for the year commencing January 1, 1870, though the Acts of June 30, 1864, c. 173, 13 Stat. 223, 283, of July 13, 1866, c. 184, 14 Stat. 98, 138, and of March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 480, had provided that income arising after January 1, 1870, was to be free from tax. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The practice applies not only to tariff and excise measures, but to all kinds of impositions. For examples of the practice, compare: (a) As to tariffs and excises, Acts of May 25, 1855, 18 & 19 Vict., cc. 21, 22, retroactive to dates in April, 1855; Act of July 31, 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., c. 30,  26-29, retroactive to April 17, 1894; Act of April 29, 1910, 10 Edw. 7, c. 8,  81, 82, 84, retroactive to April 30, 1909; Act of December 23, 1915, 5 & 6 Geo. 5, c. 89,  1-12, retroactive to dates in September, 1915; Act of July 29, 1927, 17 & 18 Geo. 5, c. 10, retroactive to April 12, 1927; (b) as to income tax, Act of June 22, 1842, 5 & 6 Vict., c. 35, retroactive to April 5, 1842; Acts of May 12 and June 16, 1854, 17 & 18 Vict., cc. 10, 24, retroactive to April 6, 1854; Act of May 25, 1855, 18 & 19 Vict., c. 20, retroactive to April 5, 1855; Act of July 31, 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., c. 30,  33, retroactive to April 6, 1894; Act of April 29, 1910, 10 Edw. 7, c. 8,  65-66, retroactive to April 6, 1909; Act of July 29, 1915, 5 & 6 Geo. 5, c. 62,  10, retroactive to April 6, 1915; Act of December 23, 1915, 5 & 6 Geo. 5, c. 89,  20, raising by 40 per cent. the rates for the last six months of the current income tax year; (c) as to inheritance tax, Act of April 29, 1910, 10 Edw. 7, c. 8,  54, retroactive to April 30, 1909. The proposed taxes are provisionally collected from the date of the resolution of the House of Commons. As to customs and excises this is said to have rested on ancient usage. Highmore, the Customs Laws ( 3d Ed.) 61; (continued on p 452) \n May, Parliamentary Practice (11th Ed.) 589. In Bowles v. Bank of England, ( 1913) 1 Ch. 57, it was held that until the passage of the Finance Act a taxpayer was under no legal obligation to pay the sum provisionally assessed as income tax by the Treasury. By the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 3 Geo. 5, c. 3, a resolution of the committee on ways and means of the House of Commons relative to the imposition of any tax and declaring it to be in the public interest that the resolution should have statutory effect, is given the same force as an act of Parliament, provisional on the final enactment of the tax. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Act of May 21, 1927, retroactive to April 22, 1927. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See (a) as to Canada, Act of July 19, 1924, retroactive to April 11, 1924; (b) as to Newfoundland, Act of June 9, 1926, retroactive to May 19, 1926; (c) as to Australia, amendment to the tariff effective provisionally on November 25, 1927, and not yet finally approved; (d) as to New Zealand, Act of October 25, 1927, giving the force of law to all resolutions purporting to impose customs duties passed by the House of Representatives on or after September 13, 1927; (e) as to the Union of South Africa, motion of the Minister of Finance, April 5, 1926, 'that, subject to an act to be passed during the present session of Parliament, and to such rebates or remissions of duty as may be provided for therein, the customs duties on the articles as set forth in the accompanying schedule be increased to the extent shown therein.' This motion was embodied in Act No. 34, published in the Union Gazette Extraordinary of June 9, 1926. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Journal Office, December 31, 1926, p. 13,749; Interim Legislation, a Report by the Tariff Commission, pp. 34-36. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Interim Legislation, a report submitted by the Tariff Commission to the chairman of the committee on ways and means of the House of Representatives, April 16, 1917.

PRIESTER(1928)\nNo. 183\nArgued: January 17, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Raymond Stark, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. D. M. Powell, of Greenville, Ala., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent delivered to petitioner a message for transmission over its telegraph lines from a point in Alabama to a point in Louisiana by which respondent offered to sell to the addressee a quantity of pecans at fifty cents per pound. In the message as transmitted the word 'fifteen' was substituted for the word 'fifty.' Respondent, who in consequence of the error suffered damage in the sum of $352.10, brought suit in the circuit court of Butler county, Alabama, to recover for petitioner's negligence in failing to transmit the message as given. The company pleaded that (a) as the message was not a repeated message its liability was limited to the amount received for sending it, by the terms of the tariffs and classifications filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission under Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, amending Interstate Commerce Act ,  1 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St.  8563); and (b) as the message was not sent as a specially valued message the liability of the company was limited to $ 50 by the filed tariffs and classifications. Relevant parts of the tariff are printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[276 U.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n The demurrers to the pleas were overruled and judgment given for the defendant, the petitioner here, which was reversed by the state Court of Appeals, 18 Ala. App. 532, 93 So. 231, on the authority of Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. & Co., \n256 \nU.S. 566\n, 41 S. Ct. 584. Upon an amended complaint charging gross negligence a trial was had resulting in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for nominal damages, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the evidence did not establish gross negligence and that the trial court had rightly withdrawn that question from the jury. 20 Ala. App. 388, 102 So. 372. The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, ruling that although the filed tariff was a bar to the recovery of damages resulting from negligence, as decided in the Esteve Case, it did not preclude a recovery for gross negligence and that on the evidence the jury should have been allowed to say whether the negli- \n\n[276 U.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n gence of the defendant was gross. Ex parte Priester, 212 Ala. 271, 102 So. 376. On a retrial, judgment was again given for the plaintiff for the full amount demanded. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals which, following the previous opinion of the state Supreme Court, held that the tariff was not a defense to an action for damages resulting from gross negligence. 21 Ala. App. 587, 111 So. 199. The state Supreme Court denied certiorari, 215 Ala. 435, 111 So. 200. This court granted certiorari. Judicial Code, 237, subd. b (28 USCA  344); \n274 \nU.S. 727\n, 47 S.

But as the Supreme Court of Alabama, by denying the petition for certiorari, on the face of the record did not pass on the merits, the writ of this court in No. 183 was properly directed to the Court of Appeals, and that in No. 189 is dismissed.

Ct. 1098, relied upon by the Supreme Court of Alabama in the earlier appeal as supporting its distinction between ordinary negligence and gross negligence, a contract between the telegraph company and its patron, limiting the liability of the company if the message was not repeated, was upheld as a defense to an action seeking recovery for the negligent transmission of the message. Although it is suggested in the opinion (pages 17-19 (14 S. Ct. 1098)) that as a matter of public policy the company would not have been permitted to stipulate away its liability for gross negligence, the distinction was neither involved in the case nor applied by the court, nor has it been so applied. See Phildelphia & Reading R. R. v. Derby, 14 How. 468, 485, 486; \n\n[276 U.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n Steamboat New World v. King, 16 How. 469, 474; Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Arms, \n91 U.S. 489\n, 493-495.\n Since the decision in the Primrose Case the telegraph companies have been brought under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and their tariffs for all interstate service made subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Interstate Commerce Act,  1, as amended by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539 (49 USCA  1; Comp. St .  8563). By section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act it is provided that subject to the approval of the Commission messages received by telegraph companies for transmission may be classified into 'repeated, unrepeated ... and such other classes as are just and reasonable, and different rates may be charged for the different classes of messages.' The established rates for unrepeated messages thus became the lawful rates and the attendant limitation of liability became the lawful condition upon which messages might be sent. Unrepeated Message Case, 44 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 670; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. & Co., supra, 571 (41 S. Ct. 584); Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v.

What had previously been a matter of common-law liability, with such contractual restrictions as the states might permit, then became the subject of federal legislation to secure reasonable and just rates for all without undue preference or advantage to any. Since that end is attainable only by adherence to the approved rate, based upon an authorized classification, that rate 'represents the whole duty and the whole liability of the company.' Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. & Co., supra. Such being the basis of liability, we do not perceive any adequate ground upon which it may be enlarged merely by the application of a 'vituperative epithet' to the admitted \n\n[276 U.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n fault of the petitioner. Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Arms, supra, 494. For if it be assumed that we can weigh and measure degrees of negligence and that a public service company may not by contract alone limit its liability for gross negligence, so called, nevertheless we may not disregard a lawful exercise of the regulatory power which has made no distinction between degrees of negligence, nor may we, upon any theory of public policy, annex to the rate as made conditions affecting its uniformity and equality.\n The message here was unrepeated and the loss resulted from a mistake in transmission. The case thus comes within the express provision of clause 1 of the tariff, limiting the liability to the amount received for the service.\n The cause will be reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'ALL MESSAGES TAKEN BY THIS COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS:\n'To guard against mistakes or delays, the sender of a message should order it repeated, that is telegraphed back to the originating office for comparison.

GREAT SOUTHERN LUMBER CO.(1928)\nNo. 252\nArgued: Decided: April 16, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. J. Waguespack and A. T. Higgins, both of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. Generes Dufour, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for eastern Louisiana by Lena A. Williams, widow of L. E. Williams, in her own behalf and as tutrix of their minor child, against the Great Southern Lumber Company, to recover damages for the alleged unlawful killing of her husband. She had a verdict and judgment. (D. C.) 13 F.(2d) 246. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, and remanded the case for a new trial. 17 F.(2d) 468.\n The Lumber Company operated a sawmill in the city of Bogalusa, Louisiana, in which it employed about 2,500 men, white and colored. The sawmill was conducted as an 'open shop,' and although union laborers were employed individually, the Company did not deal with the union itself. Williams was president of the local union.\n The complaint alleged that a conspiracy had been formed between the Company, its officers, agents and others to kill Williams and destroy organized labor in the city, and that he was killed without just cause by a mob composed largely of officers, agents and employees of the Company acting within the scope of their employment. The Company denied this, and alleged that he was killed by a posse of peace officers of the city while he was unlawfully resisting them in attempting to serve warrants issued for the arrest of certain other persons.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, while stating that there was no direct evidence of the alleged conspiracy, did not pass upon the question whether the trial court had erred in denying the Company's request for a directed verdict, but reversed the judgment on the grounds of error in de- \n\n[277 U.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n clining to permit the introduction of certain evidence offered by the Company, and in admitting certain evidence of the plaintiff.\n The petitioner contends that these rulings of the trial court were correct; and that, even if erroneous, they were technical errors which did not affect the substantial rights of the Company or constitute grounds of reversal.\n For the purpose of determining these contentions it suffices to say that there was substantial evidence showing or tending to show the following facts: For some time there had been much disturbance in the city, arising apparently out of friction between the labor union and the Company as to its open shop policy, and an effort to unionize the colored laborers. One one occasion millwrights brought to the city to repair broken machinery which had caused the mill to shut down, had been forced to re- enter the train and leave the city. On another, certain laborers had been put in jail and a crowd of their sympathizers, some of whom were armed, had threatened a jail delivery. On another, the light and water plant, supplied by power from the Company's plant, had been forced to shut down temporarily. And frequently there had been disorders at meetings of the city commission. The general condition finally became so threatening to the public peace and safety that a number of business and professional men organized a League-to which no union members or persons connected with the Company were admitted-for the purpose of assisting the city authorities in maintaining law and order, and offered their services to the city as volunteer police to serve when occasion might require. On the advice of the city judge and attorney and the State district judge, this offer was accepted, and many members of the League were sworn in as such special police. The Commissioner of Public Safety and the Chief of Police also arranged with the manager of the Company that when so requested a siren whistle at the mill, which \n\n[277 U.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n had been customarily used as a fire alarm, should be sounded to summon the volunteer police. And on the occasion of the threatened jail delivery the volunteer police had been thus summoned and had caused the dispersal of the mob.\n For some weeks immediately prior to the killing of Williams there had been a shutdown of the mill due to the breakage of machinery and conditions in the city had quieted.\n In this state of affairs, on the day before Williams was killed, a city warrant was issued, on the complaint of a merchant who was a member of the volunteer police, against one Dacus, a colored man, on the charge of being a dangerous and suspicious character. Just what had been the connection of Dacus, if any, with the labor troubles does not clearly appear. On that day Dacus could not be found, and was not arrested. On the next day, however, he appeared on the streets of the city in company with two white men, O'Rourke and Bouchillon, associates of Williams in the labor union, who were armed with shot guns. The three together walked along the main street of the city, causing excitement among the bystanders, and entered upon the premises upon which Williams had his office and residence. A policeman who saw them immediately informed the Chief of Police of what had occurred. The court, however, did not permit the policeman to testify as to the language used by O'Rourke and Bouchillon, which he reported to the Chief of Police; nor the Chief of Police to testify as to the language thus reported to him. The Chief of Police, who was also informed of this occurrence by other citizens, obtained a city warrant for the arrest of O'Rourke and Bouchillon on the charge of disturbing the public peace, which, with the warrant for Dacus, was given to a paid police officer for service. Both the Chief of Police and the Commissioner of Public Safety, with whom he conferred, were of \n\n[277 U.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n opinion that in view of the existing conditions and the reported conduct of O'Rourke and Bouchillon, it was advisable, in view of the small number of paid police available, that the officer to whom the warrants were given should be accompanied by the Commissioner of Public Safety and by the volunteer police. At their request the Superintendent caused the siren whistle to be sounded, and many of the volunteer police assembled at the city hall. A posse consisting of the paid policeman with these volunteer police, headed by the Commissioner of Public Safety, then proceeded to Williams' office for the purpose of making the arrests. They were also accompanied or followed by several other people-some of whom were officers or employees of the Company-who had not been summoned as members of the posse.\n There was a direct conflict in the evidence as to what occurred when the posse reached Williams' office; some of the witnesses testifying to the effect that Williams and others in the office were killed by members of the party, without warning or provocation; and others testifying that Williams who was standing at the door of the office was notified that the purpose of the visit was to serve warrants on Dacus, O'Rourke and Bouchillon, and called upon to put down a pistol held by him and permit the arrests to be made, which he refused to do; and that a shot was then fired from the inside of the office, and this was followed by a fusilade from outside and inside the office, in which Williams was killed, and others, including O'Rourke and Bouchillon, were killed or wounded.\n\n 1. \nThe Company should have been permitted to show the language that was used by O'Rourke and Bouchillon and communicated to the Chief of Police. The offer of proof was to the effect that, as communicated to the Chief of Police, O'Rourke and Bouchillon while walking down the streets with shot guns, with Dacus between them, \n\n[277 U.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n said-using vile and opprobrious epithets-that they would like to see any white man who would come and take Dacus away, or the eye of any white man who would touch him. This plainly indicated a purpose to prevent by force the arrest of Dacus, and was a breach of the peace. A crucial issue in the case was whether the party that killed Williams was a mob, acting in concert with the Company, which had gone to his office for the purpose of killing him; or whether it was a bona fide posse of peace officers sent by the Chief of Police and the Commissioner of Public Safety to aid the officer in making the arrests. On this issue it was of prime importance to the Company to show the reason which the Chief of Police and the Commissioner of Public Safety had for sending the posse of voluntary police to assist in making the arrest, and not leave the bona fide nature of the posse-which was directly brought in issue-to depend merely upon the expression of their opinion without a full showing of the facts upon which that opinion was based. This was emphasized by the fact that while the district judge did not permit evidence of the threatening language used by O'Rourke and Bouchillon to go to the jury, he charged them that a citizen carrying arms publicly on the street committed no offense and was not subject to arrest; thus leaving the jury to infer that the conduct of O'Rourke and Bouchillon, unaccompanied by any evidence of threatening language, was entirely lawful, and not a justification for issuing the warrants against them or sending the posse of voluntary police to assist in the arrests. The exclusion of evidence as to the threatening language obviously prevented the Company from presenting its full and complete defense to the jury.\n\n 2. \nThe district court also permitted the plaintiff, over the objection of the Company, to testify that about ten or fifteen minutes after her husband had been killed and \n\n[277 U.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n the last shot had been fired, she heard one Carson, a member of the volunteer police force, say that 'they had come to kill Lem Williams, and they had killed him.' There was a direct conflict in the evidence as to whether Carson had been with the party at the time Williams was killed; the weight of the evidence being to the effect that he had been sent to another part of the city and had arrived after the killing. But, however this may be, the statement made by him as to the purpose the party had in coming, made after the killing had taken place and when the conspiracy, if one had existed, had accomplished its purpose, was hearsay, not part of the res gestae, and not admissible against the Company.\n\n 3. \nThe judgment was properly reversed on account of these errors. This was not affected by the provision of  269 of the Judicial Code, as amended in 1919,1 that in an appellate proceeding judgment shall be given after the examination of the entire record, 'without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' The errors in the exclusion and admission of evidence directly affected the substantial rights of the Company. Since the passage of this act, as well as before, an error which relates, not to merely formal or technical matters, but to the substantial rights of the parties 'is to be held a ground for reversal, unless it appears from the whole record that it was harmless and did not prejudice the rights of the complaining party.' United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 421\n, 46 S. Ct. 144, 148. Here it cannot be said from the entire record that the errors were harmless; but on the contrary they were material and of a highly prejudicial character.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 1181, c. 48; U.

James Walton, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and Clarence Miller, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.[ Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States \n277 U.S. 551\n (1928) ]\n\n\n[277 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Williamsport Wire Rope Company brought this action in the Court of Claims, on December 19, 1924, to recover the amount of an alleged overpayment of excess profits and war profits taxes for the calendar year 1918, laid under the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. The petition alleged the following facts: The company had conceded in its return, and had paid, a total tax of $306,381.77, for the year 1918. In April, 1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue levied upon it an additional assessment of $89,094.85, which the company paid under protest. On June 10, 1924, a portion of the sum so paid was refunded. Four days later the company filed a claim for a further refund of $100,000. The claim alleged that for reasons there set forth, which are \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n repeated in the petition, the company was entitled, under subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 327 of the Revenue Act of 1918, to have a special assessment made under section 328 of that act. \n1\n The Commissioner having failed to make the \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n refund within six months after demand, this suit was brought. The government demurred to the petition on the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, and the demurrer was sustained. 63 Ct. Cl. 463. The case is here on certiorari. \n275 \nU.S. 520\n, 48 S. Ct. 140, 72 L. Ed. -.\n In its petition for a writ of certiorari, the Williamsport Company alleged that its rights would presumably be determined by the decision in Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., a case then pending in this court; and the Solicitor General, being of the same opinion, did not feel justified in opposing the granting of the writ. Decision on the petition was postponed pending decision of the Oesterlein Case. That case (\n275 \nU.S. 220\n, 48 S. Ct. 87) was decided November 21, 1927. We there held that the exercise of the judgment or discretion of the Commissioner to allow or deny the special assessment provided for in sections 327 and 328 was subject to review by the Board of Tax Appeals, and that therefore the taxpayer was entitled to an order compelling the Commissioner to respond to the subpoena of the Board issued under section 900(i) of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 338 (26 USCA  1220; Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 b(i)), requiring him to answer interrogatories and to furnish information contained in the returns of other corporations. On November 28, the writ of certiorari in this case was granted. Thereupon the Williamsport Company moved, presumably in analogy to motions to \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n affirm under rule 6, that the judgment against it be reversed on the authority of the Oesteriein Case. The Solicitor General, while not opposing the motion, advised us that the Court of Claims had, since the decision of the Oesterlein Case, adhered to the view that it was without power to determine whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had erred in refusing to make a special assessment under sections 327 and 328. We then assigned the case for oral argument, without passing on the motion to reverse and remand.\n The contention here is that, since the Commissioner's action was made reviewable on appeal by the Board of Tax Appeals, it is and was always reviewable in an original proceeding before the Court of Claims. The argument is that Congress has conferred upon the Court of Claims jurisdiction over suits to recover taxes alleged to have been 'erroneously or illegally assessed or collected';2 that here its jurisdiction is invoked to recover taxes claimed to have been assessed illegally, because assessed under section 301 (Comp. St.  6336 7\/16 aa), instead of under sections 327 and 328; that it must therefore have power to determine whether conditions existed which entitled the company to the special assessment provided for by sections 327 and 328; that if it finds that such conditions did exist, it must also have power to determine the true amount of the tax computed as therein directed; and that if it appears that the tax actually paid exceeds that which would have been exacted under the special assessment, the court may award judgment for the difference. \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n Sections 327 and 328 were intended to broaden the powers of relief first conferred by section 210 of the War Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 307 (Comp. St.  6336 3\/8 k).3 It was 'believed necessary to provide a special method of determining the tax for those cases in which the ordinary method of assessment would result in grave hardship or serious inequality.' Senate Report, 65th Cong. 3d Sess. No. 617, p. 14. The special assessment is to be made under paragraph (a) when the Commissioner 'is unable to determine the invested capital.' It is to be made under paragraph (d) if he 'finds and so declares of record that the tax if determined without benefit of this section would ... work ... an exceptional hardship. ...' The task imposed on the Commissioner by sections 327 and 328 was one that could only to performed by an official or a body having wide knowledge and experience with the class of problems concerned. For the requirement of a special assessment under paragraph (d) of section 327, and its computation in all cases, are dependent on 'the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[277 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n To perform that task, power discretionary in character was necessarily conferred. \n5\n Whether, as provided in paragraph (d) of section 327, there are 'abnormal conditions'; whether, because of these conditions, computation under section 301 would work 'exceptional hardship'; whether there would be 'gross disproportion' between the tax computed under section 301 and 'that computed by reference to the representative corporations specified in section 328'; what are 'representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business'; which corporations are 'as nearly as may be, similarly circumstanced with respect to gross income, net income, profits per unit of business transacted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and circumstances'-these are all questions of administrative discretion.\n The soundness of the judgment exercised by the individual or body to whom the task was confided would depend largely upon the extent both of the knowledge of the special subject possessed and of the experience had in dealing with this particular class of problems. The conclusions reached would rest largely upon considerations not entirely susceptible of proof or disproof. Congress did not, by the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057), require the Commissioner to embody the results of his deliberation in findings of fact. The purpose of the meagre record prescribed by section 328(c) in case the Commissioner concludes to order a special assessment is apparently to protect the Treasury, \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n not the taxpayer. \n6\n For, if the Commissioner refuses to make the special assessment, he is not required to state the grounds of his refusal, or indeed, even to record the fact of such refusal. Thus the aims which induced Congress to enact sections 327 and 328, the nature of the task which it confided to the Commissioner, the methods of procedure prescribed, and the language employed to express the conditions under which the special assessment is required, all negative the right to a review of his determination by a court.\n It is true that where the Commissioner's action is rviewable judicially, his findings of fact in making an assessment, as distinguished from his determinations involving administrative discretion, constitute only prima facie evidence; and that, in cases arising under the internal revenue laws, such findings are commonly reviewable by courts in appropriate proceedings in which the facts become an issue. United States v. Rindskopf, \n105 U.S. 418\n, 422; Wickwire v. Reinecke, \n275 \nU.S. 101, 105\n, 48 S. Ct. 43. It is also true that in reviewing the Commissioner's findings on such matters as value (compare Castner, Curran & Bullitt, Inc., v. Lederer (D. C.) 275 F. 221; Little Cahaba Coal Co. v. United States (D. C.) 15 F.(2d) 863); allowances for depreciation (compare Cohen v. Lowe (D. C.) 234 F. 474; Camp Bird, Ltd. v. Howbert (C. C. A.) 262 F. 114), or the accuracy with which a taxpayer's books reflect his income (compare In re Sheinman (D. C.) 14 F.(2d) 323), courts may be confronted with problems requiring a high degree of technical knowledge for their solution. But such problems involve primarily the situation of a single taxpayer, and the controlling data can \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n easily be made available to the court. Here the considerations which demand special assessment under section 327(d) and those which govern its computation in all cases, are facts concerning the situation of a large group of taxpayers which can only be known to an official or a body having wide experience in such matters and ready access to the means of information.\n The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, if any, rests on statutory provisions which long antedate the Revenue Act of 1918. Its jurisdiction over suits to recover taxes is based on the clause in the original Act of February 24, 1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612 (Comp. St. s 1136(3)), empowering it to determine 'all claims founded upon any law of Congress.' United States v. Kaufman, \n96 U.S. 567\n, 569; Dooley v. United States, \n182 \nU.S. 222\n, 21 S. Ct. 762. Compare United States v. Emery-Bird-Thayer Co., \n237 \nU.S. 28\n, 35 S. Ct. 499. But we have held that the Court of Claims is without jurisdiction where the statute creating the claim expressly refers it for final determination to an executive department. United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S. Ct. 464. And that it is equally without jurisdiction where from an examination of all the terms of the statute it appears that Congress intended to vest final authority in an administrative agency. United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co ., \n249 \nU.S. 451\n, 39 S. Ct. 325; Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221\n, 45 S. Ct. 69. Long ago Congress conferred final authority upon such an agency in the enforcement of the appraisal provisions by which the amounts payable under the customs laws are determined. Compare Bartlett v. Kane, 16 How. 263, 272; Hilton v. Merritt, \n110 \nU.S. 97, 105\n, 3 S. Ct. 548; Passavant v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 214\n, 13 S. Ct. 572.\n Moreover, whatever jurisdiction is possessed by the Court of Claims to review determinations under sections 327 and 328, would be possessed also by the District Courts in suits against collectors and in actions against the United States, under section 24(20) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41(20). Thus the \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 562]\n\u00a0\n determinations of the Commissioner in this delicate and complex phase of revenue administration would be subjected to review by a large number of courts, none of which have ready access to the information necessary to enable them to arrive at a proper conclusion in revising his decisions; whose experience in passing upon questions of this character would be limited; and whose varying decisions would tend to defeat, rather than promote, that equality in the application of the revenue law which sections 327 and 328 were designed to ensure. We conclude that the determination whether the taxpayer is entitled to the special assessment was confided by Congress to the Commissioner, and could not, under the Revenue Act of 1918, be challenged in the courts-at least in the absence of fraud or other irregularities.\n It remains to consider whether jurisdiction to review the Commissioner's action was conferred upon the Court of Claims as a result of the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 336, which created the Board of Tax Appeals. There is nothing in that act which purports to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims or to extend the scope of judicial review over determinations of the Commissioner. The contention that it had this effect rests wholly on our decision in Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., \n275 \nU.S. 220\n, 48 S. Ct. 87. The contention fails to take account of the important differences between an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, on the one hand, and an original suit in the Court of Claims, or in a district court, on the other. The Board of Tax Appeals was created to perform the administrative functions theretofore discharged by the Committee on Appeals and Review, which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had established in his office. \n7\n See House Report 68th Cong. 1st Sess., No. \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 563]\n\u00a0\n 179, p. 7; Senate Report, 68th Cong. 1st Sess., No. 398, p. 8. The Committee had regularly reviewed determi- \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 564]\n\u00a0\n nations granting or denying special assessment under sections 327 and 328. 8 The granting of these powers of review to the Board of Tax Appeals did not change the character of the appeal. And it affords no reason to conclude that Congress intended that the Court of Claims and the District Courts should also be authorized to re-examine the decisions of the Commissioner on questions of the character here involved.\n It is true that, unlike the Committee, the Board of Tax Appeals is not a part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The Board is an independent agency. But by specific provision of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,  900(k) (26 USCA  1222; Comp. St.  6371 5\/6 b 43 Stat. 253, 338, it was defined as an agency 'in the executive branch of the government.' Compare Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals, \n270 \nU.S. 117, 121\n, 122 S., 46 S. Ct. 215. Its sole function consists in reviewing, on appeal, determinations of the Commissioner under the revenue laws. The fact that the Commissioner is a party to all cases before it enables the Board, by rules of procedure which it has developed, to leave to the Commissioner the initial determination of many questions requiring the use of facts not in the record. \n9\n Its limited, specialized functions en- \n\n[277 U.S. 551, 565]\n\u00a0\n able its members to acquire the extensive special knowledge and the specific experience essential to a sound exercise of judgment in dealing with questions arising under sections 327 and 328.10 As was said in the Oesterlein Case, supra, at page 226 (48 S. Ct. 87), there is no reason for thinking that Congress considered the Commissioner to be better qualified for making determinations under sections 327 and 328 than this administrative agency specially established to review his decisions.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 327.

In the case of a foreign corporation the tax shall be computed without deducting the specific exemption of $3,000 either for the taxpayer or the representative corporations.\n In computing the tax under this section the Commissioner shall compare the taxpayer only with representative corporations whose invested capital can be satisfactorily determined under section 326 and which are, as nearly as may be, similarly circumstanced with respect to gross income, net income, profits per unit of business transacted and capital employed, the amount and rate of war profits or excess profits, and all other relevant facts and circumstances.\n (b) For the purposes of subdivision (a) the ratios between the average tax and the average net income of representative corporations shall be determined by the Commissioner in accordance with regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary. ...\n (c) The Commissioner shall keep a record of all cases in which the tax is determined in the manner prescribed in subdivision (a), containing the name and address of each taxpayer, the business in which engaged, the amount of invested capital and net income shown by the return, and the amount of invested capital as determined under such subdivision. The Commissioner shall furnish a copy of such record and other detailed information with respect to such cases when required by resolution of either house of Congress, without regard to the restrictions contained in section 257.

Consequently, it was necessary for the Bureau to assemble, as promptly as possible, returns filed under these sections of the law and analyze them in the light of the facts disclosed by normal returns. Thousands of cases were examined in detail and subjected to comprehensive statistical studies to determine normal percentages of income to invested capital in different lines of business under varying conditions and circumstances in order that a mode of procedure might be defined for treatment of cases under sections 209 and 210.'

See Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1918, p. 13. Procedure as to the submission of question and preactice before the Board was established by Regulations 45, art. 1701 (T. D. 2831).

CHICAGO AUDITORIUM ASS'N(1928)\nNo. 561\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 274, 275]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, and Homer H. Cooper and Samuel Topliff, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[277 U.S. 274, 278]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter L. Fisher, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n[277 U.S. 274, 283]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, which was begun in a state court of Illinois by the Chicago Auditorium Association, is said to be in the nature of a bill to remove a cloud upon title. All of the parties, except a few of the defendants, are citizens of Illinois. These claimed that as to them there was a separable controversy, and they secured a removal of the whole cause to the federal court for northern Illinois. There Willing and other defendants moved to dismiss, on the ground that the bill was not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, and that the court 'is without jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the case made or at- \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 284]\n\u00a0\n tempted to be made by the bill.' The court was of opinion that the case presented questions which should be determined only upon answers and proofs, denied the motions to dismiss, without prejudice to any question raised by either party touching the motions, and directed the defendants to answer. After hearing the case fully on the evidence, the District Court dismissed the bill 'for want of equity jurisdiction in the court to grant any relief upon the pleadings and the evidence, but without prejudice to whatever rights the plaintiff may have ... when asserted in any appropriate proceeding or otherwise.' 8 F.(2d) 998.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the suit was cognizable in a court of equity as one to remove a cloud upon title, and it reversed the decree, with direction to the District Court to hear the evidence and determine the issues involved. 20 F.(2d) 837. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n275 \nU.S. 579\n, 48 S. Ct. 122, 72 L. Ed. -. Motions by Willing and others to remand the cause to the state court had been made in the District Court, on the ground that the controversy involved was single and entire as to all the defendants. The motions, which that court denied, were renewed in the Circuit Court of Appeals and again denied. We have no occasion to consider whether the alleged controversy was separable; for we are of opinion that the proceeding does not present a case or controversy within the range of judicial decision, as defined in article 3 of the Federal Constitution.\n The facts alleged and proved are these: The association, an Illinois corporation, was organized in 1886 for the purpose of constructing and maintaining in Chicago a building containing a large auditorium, galleries for exhibition of works of art, offices, and other rooms; to provide thereby, and otherwise, for the cultivation of music, the drama, and the fine arts, and for holding in Chicago political and other conventions; and to use the premises \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 285]\n\u00a0\n for any and all purposes of profit. To this end, the association became, in 1887, the ground lessee of five adjacent parcels of land for the term of 99 years, under five separate, substantially similar indentures. Three of the leases were later extended to the year 2085. On this land the association built, before 1889, the single monumental structure now standing, known as the Auditorium Building, which contains, besides the auditorium, a recital hall, studios, a hotel, and many business offices. The cost of construction and maintenance was defrayed by stock issues aggregating $2,000,000, and by issues of bonds of which $1,375,000 are outstanding.\n The building is now in fairly good condition, and continues to serve well the purposes for which it was constructed. The payments of rent and interest have been made regularly. Thus neither the public, the landlords, nor the bondholders have cause for dissatisfaction. But, for the stockholders, the investment has never been financially remurnerative. In 40 years only one dividend has been paid, and that was 1 1\/2 per cent. Considered as a financial investment, the building is now obsolete in design, and it is incapable of alteration without unjustifiable expense. The highest and best use of the property for the financial gain of the tenant would now be the replacement of this structure by a modern one adapted for business. The association desires to erect a large modern commercial building of greatly increased height, the cost of which may be as much as $15,000,000. Appropriate changes in its charter powers have been made. Recently some of the stock has been acquired by the president of the corporation at a small fraction of its par value.\n There is no provision in the leases which in terms gives the association the right to tear down this building and erect another in its place. It may be that the building, as and when constructed, became, and now is, property \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 286]\n\u00a0\n of the lessors. Compare Kutter v. Smith, 2 Wall. 491; Bass v. Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railway Co. (C. C. A.) 82 F. 857, 39 L. R. A. 711. The leases contain certain provisions which may be construed as denying, by implication, any right to tear down the building even to replace it by a better one. They declare that the building is security for payment of rent and for the performance of all other covenants imposed upon the tenant; that the tenant shall 'keep the building situated upon said demised premises ... in good repair, and in a safe and secure condition, ... and all rooms in said building in a good, safe, clean and tenantable condition and repair during the entire term of this lease'; that the tenant shall rebuild or repair the building, in event of damage or destruction by fire, upon the same plan as was followed in the original structure, or upon such other plans as are approved by the lessors; and that the landlords shall pay the tenant the appraised value of the improvements at the end of the term.\n Counsel for the association are of opinion that it has the legal right to tear down the building and to construct the new one, without first obtaining the consent of the several lessors and of the trustee for the bondholders, provided adequate security is furnished for the payment of the ground rent pending the completion of the new building. But the association deemed it advisable to obtain the consent of the lessors and of the trustee. To that end, negotiations were opened with Willing and one other of the lessors, and there was some talk of purchasing their interests. In the course of an informal, friendly, private conversation, Willing stated to the president of the association that his counsel had advised that the lessee had no right to tear down the Auditorium Building without the consent of the lessors and of the trustee for the bondholders. Several of the lessors were never approached by any one on behalf of the association. Nor was the trustee for the bondholders. After this talk with Willing, a year \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 287]\n\u00a0\n passed without further occurrence. Then the suit at bar was begun against all the lessors and the trustee for the bondholders.\n The bill alleged that:\n'Under the proper construction and interpretation of the terms, covenants, and conditions of said several leases, your orator is fully empowered and has the right to tear down and remove the present improvement as a part of and incidental to the erection of a new improvement of equal or greater value, not impairing in any way the security and property right of the said lessors or their successors and assigns, upon furnishing proper and adequate security during the removal of the present improvement and until the completion of the new improvement; but the defendants hereinafter named, or some of them, nevertheless claim and assert, and by reason of such claim and assertion certain persons with whom your orator is obliged to deal in the financing of its aforesaid plans are fearful, that the present building cannot be removed without a violation of the terms, covenants, and conditions of said leases. ... The aforesaid claims, fears and uncertainties respecting the rights of the parties to said leases, based upon the terms, covenants, and conditions of the leases of said property, have greatly impaired the value of the leasehold interests of your orator, and have made them unmarketable, and have prevented your orator from exercising its rights with respect to said leasehold interests so as to secure therefrom the highest and best use of its interest in the land, and the terms, covenants, and conditions of the said leases, in so far as they give color to said claims, fears, and uncertainties, are clouds upon the title of your orator, for the removal of and relief against which your orator has no adequate remedy in a court of law.'\n\n The bill prayed:\n'That this court will remove from the several leasehold interests of your orator the above mentioned claims and clouds based upon the alleged force and \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 288]\n\u00a0\n effect of the terms, covenants and conditions of the aforesaid leases, and will fully quiet and establish the title of your orator to the said leasehold properties with full right on the part of your orator to tear down and remove any and all buildings which for the time being may be upon said premises, upon giving proper security, ... and that said defendants may also be restrained and enjoined from taking any steps to prevent your orators from tearing down or removing the present building. ...'\n\n There is not in the bill, or in the evidence, even a suggestion that any of the defendants had ever done anything which hampered the full enjoyment of the present use and occupancy of the demises premises authorized by the leases. There was neither hostile act nor a threat. There is no evidence of a claim of any kind made by any defendant, except the expression by Willing, in an amicable, private conversation, of an opinion on a question of law. Then, he merely declined orally to concur in the opinion of the association that it has the right asserted. For that, or for some other reason, several of the defendants had refused to further the association's project. Other defendants had neither done nor said anything about the matter to any one, so far as appears. Indeed, several refrained, even in their answers, from expressing any opinion as to the legal rights of the parties.\n Obviously, mere refusal by a landlord to agree with a tenant as to the meaning and effect of a lease, his mere failure to remove obstacles to the fulfillment of the tenant's desires, is not an actionable wrong, either at law or in equity. And the case lacks elements essential to the maintenance in a federal court of a bill to remove a could upon title. The alleged doubt as to plaintiff's right under the leases arises on the face of the instruments by which the plaintiff derives title. Because of that fact, the doubt is not in legal contemplation a cloud, and the bill to remove it as such does not lie. It is true that the plight of \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 289]\n\u00a0\n which the association complains cannot be remedied by an action at law. But it does not follow that the association may have relief in equity in a federal court. What the plaintiff seeks is simply a declaratory judgment. To grant that relief is beyond the power conferred upon the federal judiciary. Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 47 S. Ct. 282. Compare Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burely Tobacco Growers' Ass'n, \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S. Ct. 291. The statement, made at the bar, that Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 450\n, 26 S. Ct. 427, supports the jurisdiction, is unfounded.\n It is true that this is not a moot case, like Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Wright, \n141 \nU.S. 696\n, 12 S. Ct. 103, and United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n, 40 S. Ct. 448; that, unlike Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 444\n, 43 S. Ct. 445, and Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S. Ct. 284, the matter which it is here sought to have determined is not an administrative question; that the bill presents a case, which if it were the subject of judicial cognizance, would in form come under a familiar head of equity jurisdiction; that, unlike Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, a final judgment might be given; that, unlike South Spring Hill Gold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 300\n, 12 S. Ct. 921, the parties are adverse in interest; that, unlike Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n, 42 S. Ct. 274, and Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S. Ct. 597, there is hre no lack of a substantial interest of the plaintiff in the question which it seeks to have adjudicated; that, unlike New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S. Ct. 122, the alleged interest of the plaintiff is hrer definite and specific; and that there is here no attempt to secure an abstract determination by the court of the validity of a statute, as there was in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 361\n, 31 S. Ct. 250, and Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 42 S. Ct. 261. But still the proceeding is not a case or controversy within the meaning of article 3 of the Constitution. The fact that the plaintiff's desires are thwarted by its own doubts, or by the \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 290]\n\u00a0\n fears of others, does not confer a cause of action. No defendant has wronged the plaintiff or has threatened to do so. Resort to equity to remove such doubts is a proceeding which was unknown to either English or American courts at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and for more than half a century thereafter.

Ct. 454.\nREVERSED.\n\n Concurring opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result. It suffices to say that the suit is plainly not one within the equity jurisdiction conferred by sections 24, 28, of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41, 71). But it is unnecessary, and I am therefore not prepared, to go further and say anything in support of the view that Congress may not constitutionally confer on the federal courts jurisdiction to render declaratory judgments in cases where that form of judgment would be an appropriate remedy, or that this \n\n[277 U.S. 274, 291]\n\u00a0\n Court is without constitutional power to review such judgments of state courts when they involve a federal question. Compare Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, \n274 U.S. 123\n, 130-134, 47 S. Ct. 511. 'It is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.' Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 295\n, 25 S.

United States, \n220 \nU.S. 523, 538\n, 31 S. Ct. 485. There is certainly no 'case or controversy' before us requiring an opinion on the power of Congress to incorporate the declaratory judgment into out federal jurisprudence. And the determination now made seems to me very similar itself to a declaratory judgment to the effect that we could not constitutionally be authorized to give such judgments-but is, in addition, prospective, unasked, and unauthorized under any statute. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSON v. PACIFIC MAIL S. S. CO.(1928)\nNo. 146\nArgued: January 6, 1928Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis T. Hengstler, of San Francisco, Cal. (Mr. Frederick W. Dorr, of San Francisco, Cal., on the brief), for Wilson and others.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Farnham P. Griffiths, Edward J. McCutchen, and Warren Olney, Jr., all of San Francisco, Cal., for Pacific Mail S. S. Co.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Twelve miles off the shore of California, 9:53 a. m., November 29, 1922, sky clear, sea smooth and uninterrupted, the Newport, an iron passenger steamer 337 feet long-2,643 tons-drove her prow amidships into the port side of the Svea, a wooden lumber steam schooner of 618 tons and 170 feet long. Both vessels were seriously injured. The owners of the Svea libeled the Newport, her owners and master, in the District Court, Southern District of California. They charged that the collision resulted from the sole fault of the Newport and her navigators and asked for full damages. A cross-libel admitted fault, but claimed that the other vessel contributed and prayed for application of the half-damage rule.\n The trial court concluded that the collision resulted solely from the gross negligence and plain fault of the Newport and granted a decree against her and the master-McKinnon-for all established damages. The Circuit Court of Appeals held there was mutual fault, divided the damages, and definitely declared that under the approved rule the master was responsible for the negli- \n\n[276 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n gence of subordinates without regard to his personal fault.\n Counsel for cross-petitioner McKinnon earnestly maintain that considering present conditions of navigation the master, when free from fault, ought not to be held liable for the action of others. But it is unnecessary now to discuss that question.\n Here the record fails to disclose that the master met the exacting duties voluntarily assumed. An amazing casualty occurred while he commanded, and presumably, at least, he participated in the admitted fault of his ship. Certainly, nothing short of very clear evidence of intelligent care could possibly absolve him.\n The day was fine; the horizon ten miles away. The Newport was proceeding eastward at nine knots with the Svea off her starboard side steaming northward at eight knots. They were approaching each other upon crossing courses and in full view for more than half an hour. Twenty minutes before the collision Capt. McKinnon quit the bridge of the Newport, leaving the third officer in charge. Of this subordinate he testified: 'This young man was just keeping his first watch on ship; he just shipped the day before, and was making his first voyage.' When upon the witness stand the captain failed to show what, if any, directions he gave, or that he took reasonable precaution to insure proper navigation in circumstances of obvious danger. He gave no excuse, nor did he indicate any necessity for leaving the bridge. It is impossible for us to say that he acted prudently.\n The International Rules for Navigation at Sea (Act 1890, c. 802, 26 Stat. 327, Act 1894, c. 83, 28 Stat. 82; U. S. C. tit. 33,  104, 106, 112, 121, p. 1055 (33 USCA  104, 106, 112, 121; Comp. St.  7858, 7860, 7866, 7868)) direct:\n'Art. 19. When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on \n\n[276 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.'\n\n'Art. 21. Where, by any of these rules, one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed.\n\n'Note.-When, in consequence of thick weather or other causes, such vessel findings herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giving-way vessel alone, she also shall take such action as will best aid to avert collision.\n\n'Art. 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.\n\n'Art. 29. Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner or master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.'\n\n The Newport kept her course and speed up to the moment of collision, and it is admitted that in so doing she was at fault. But her counsel claim that the Svea also was at fault in holding her course and speed, and that by acting differently she should have avoided the accident. The evidence does not support that view. Consideration must be given to the circumstances as they appeared at the time; not as they are now known. The Svea adhered to the fundamental rule. If in the difficult circumstances forced upon him her navigator, whose qualifications are not questioned, exercised his best judgment in not departing therefrom, the burdened vessel must accept the consequences. Having driven him into a perplexing \n\n[276 U.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n situation, the Newport cannot complain because he failed to make the most judicious choice between the hazards presented.\n Without stopping to set out the evidence, it is enough to say that we think there is no clear proof that the Svea failed in her duty. She tried in vain by repeated blasts to ascertain the Newport's intention. Her master could not possibly know the result of departing from the prescribed rule and we cannot say that he acted indiscreetly in following it.\n Big vessels may not insolently disregard smaller ones; supersize gives no right to domineer. The Newport was a handy vessel. By porting her helm or reversing her engines two minutes or less before the collision occurred she could have avoided it easily. There was nothing to show that she would not do one of these things until too late for the Svea's master to maneuver his vessel into safety.\n The applicable doctrine is plainly announced in The Delaware, \n161 \nU.S. 459, 469\n, 16 S. Ct. 516, 521 (40 L. Ed. 771):\n'The cases of The Britannia, \n153 U.S. 130\n (14 S. Ct. 795), and the Northfield, \n154 U.S. 629\n (Appx., 14 S. Ct. 1184), must be regarded, however, as settling the law that the preferred steamer will not be held in fault for maintaining her course and speed, so long as it is possible for the other to avoid her by porting, at least in the absence of some distinct indication that she is about to fail in her duty. If the master of the preferred steamer were at liberty to speculate upon the possibility, or even of the probability, of the approaching steamer failing to do her duty and keep out of his way, the certainty that the former will hold his course, upon which the latter has a right to rely, and which it is the very object of the rule to insure, would give place to doubts on the part of the master of the obligated steamer as to whether he would do so or not, and produce a timidity and feebleness of \n\n[276 U.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n action on the part of both, which would bring about more collisions than it would prevent.

BRAFFET(1928)\nNo. 344\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1928\n\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 560, 561]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter Edmund Burke, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent's intestate brought suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a mandatory injunction compelling the Secretary of the Interior to vacate his decision rejecting an application under R. S .  2347 (30 USCA  71) for the purchase of certain coal land included in \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n the school-land grant to Utah, and directing that a patent issue. The case was heard on bill and answer, from which it appears that the land in question is part of section 32 in a particular township in Utah. Section 32 of each township was included in the school-land grant to the state of Utah under the Enabling Act of July 16, 1894, c. 138, 28 Stat. 107, 109, which became effective on the admission of Utah into the Union, January 4, 1896. But the grant did not include any land that was known to be mineral. United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, 38 S. Ct. 193. In the offical government survey the land in question was reported by the surveyor as nonmineral. In May, 1902, the state sold the lands, and the purchaser later conveyed them to the Pleasant Valley Coal Company, which has since appeared as the record owner and paid taxes on them. On February 4, 1918, Braffet, respondent's intestate, filed in the local land office at Salt Lake City his application to purchase the lands as coal lands. At this time, and for many years before, the settled practice of the Land Office, under Rule 1 of the Regulations of March 6, 1903, 32 L. D. 39, had been to treat applications for purchase, under the mining laws, of parts of a section designated in the school-land grant, where made after the date when the grant would attach if the land was nonmineral, as a contest of the state's right.\n Braffet's application was so treated. The state was cited and answered, protesting the application, and setting up that the lands were not known coal lands on the date of the grant to it. The coal company intervened and made like answer. Braffet assumed the burden of the contest and offered evidence. At the conclusion of his case motions of the state and the coal company to dismiss were granted without the submission of testimony in their behalf. Braffet appealed to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, who reversed the action of the local land office, and, without affording the state or the \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 563]\n\u00a0\n coal company opportunity to offer evidence, directed that Braffet's contest be sustained and the protest of the state dismissed. The state and the coal company appealed to the Secretary, who, July 31, 1922, held that the local office had erred in dismissing the contest for insufficiency of evidence, and that the Commissioner had also erred in disposing of the case without affording the state and the coal company an opportunity to offer evidence. He remanded the cause to the local office to proceed with the contest. 49 L. D. 212.\n In the meantime the Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437, 438, 451 (30 USCA  181 et. seq.), had been enacted, authorizing the disposition of certain classes of mineral lands including coal lands of the United States only by lease by the Secretary of the Interior. Acting under this statute the Secretary, on June 4, 1923, executed a lease of the land to the coal company which, in contemplation of this action, had waived its claim under the state grant, expressly stipulating that its waiver was on condition that the lease be granted. The state in the meantime had withdrawn its protest to Braffet's application, without prejudice to the claim of the company, setting up that it had no benefical interest in the land by reason of its own conveyance to the coal company's grantor.\n Braffet's contest was dismissed January 8, 1924, and his application to reopen it was denied on March 24, 1924. Later, the present suit was brought. The decree of the Supreme Court of the District directed the Secretary to vacate his decision remanding the proceedings to the local office, and to issue a patent on payment of the purchase price. The Court of Appeals modified the judgment in respects not now material, but held that Braffet's application was valid and that the Secretary should be directed to issue a patent. 57 App. D. C. 192, 19 F. (2d) 666.\n The principal question presented is whether, by the application to purchase and by bringing and conducting the \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 564]\n\u00a0\n contest, Braffet acquired rights which could not be or were not extinguished by the action taken by the Secretary under the Leasing Act. In giving an affirmative answer, the Court of Appeals thought that, as the Secretary had ruled that Braffet had made a prima facie case before the Department, the abandonment by the state and the coal company of the protest and their assent that the mineral lease be given were equivalent to the allowance of his claim, and that the Secretary under the Leasing Act was without power to defeat the claim since it had then ripened into a vested right.\n After the Leasing Act, coal lands of the United States were subject to disposition by the Secretary only by lease 'except (under section 37) as to valid claims existent at date of the passage of this act and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated, which claims may be perfected under such laws, including discovery.' Braffet's application was for the purchase of mineral lands and not for a lease. It was not entitled to consideration under the Leasing Act, unless saved by the exception as a 'valid claim' existent at the date of the act.\n R. S.  2347 (30 USCA  71), under which the application was made, gives the 'right to enter ... vacant coal lands of the United States not otherwise appropriated or reserved by competent authority.' The departmental Regulations of March 6, 1903, 32 L. D. 39, withdrew school lands from entry with direction to local officers to treat applications for them in the same manner as contests. Rule 1 reads:\n'When a school section is identified by the government survey and no claim is at the date when the right of the state would attach, if at all, asserted thereto, under the mining or other public-land laws, the presumption arises that the title to the land has passed to the state, but this presumption may be overcome by the submission of a satisfactory showing to the contrary. Applications pre- \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 565]\n\u00a0\n sented under the mining laws covering parts of a school section will be disposed of in the same manner as other contest cases.'\n\n This rule has never been expressly repealed. The Department has consistently held that it is applicable to school lands (Charles L. Ostenfeldt, 41 L. D. 265; Santa Fe Pac. R. R. v. California, 34 L. D. 12), and that applications for tracts embraced in an entry of record give rise to no rights until the entry has been canceled of record (Walker v. Snider, 19 L. D. 467; Stewart v. Peterson, 28 L. D. 515, 519; Hiram M. Hamilton, 38 L. D. 597).\n The rule is an appropriate application to school-land grants of the established policy of the Department to treat as excluded from entry or pre-emption lands which may, in the execution of the laws of Congress, fall within the claims of others, a policy which avoids confusion and conflicting claims. Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 U.S. 330\n; Holt v. Murphy, \n207 \nU.S. 407, 414\n, 28 S. Ct. 212.\n Under both R. S.  2347 (30 USCA  71), conferring the right to purchase only 'vacant coal-lands of the United States not otherwise appropriated or reserved by competent authority,' and Rule 1, supra, as interpreted and applied by the Department, we think that Braffet, by his application, acquired no legal status other than that of a contestant and that this amounted to no more than a privilege of seeking to restore the lands to entry. The pending contest presented no obstacle to the withdrawal of the privilege by the United States. Compare Shepley v. Cowan, supra; Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187; The Yosemite Valley Case, 15 Wall. 77; Campbell v. Wade, \n132 \nU.S. 34, 37\n, 10 S. Ct. 9; United States v. Norton (C. C. A.) 19 F.(2d) 836; Alice M. Reason, 36 L. D. 279, 280-1; Instructions, 40 L. D. 415, 416, 417. Plainly it was withdrawn by the provisions of the Leasing Act, already quoted, unless saved by the exception 'in favor of valid claims existent at the date of passage.' Even if so saved, the land would have been \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 566]\n\u00a0\n restored to entry only if the contest were determined in respondent's favor, which was not done.\n But we think that the exception in section 37 (30 USCA  193) was not intended to save so nebulous and insubstantial a claim as that of the privilege of contesting the presumptive title of the state. The construction argued for would tend to defeat the purpose of the Leasing Act which was to prevent the sale of the mineral lands of the United States where substantial rights had not been acquired in them, and to permit their exploitation only by lessees paying royalties to the government. The reference in section 37 to valid claims 'thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated, which claims may be perfected under such laws, including discovery,' at least suggests that they embrace only such substantial claims as would on compliance with the provisions of the former law ripen into ownership; such claims as might be acquired under the mining laws by location, possession and development which, if continued to discovery and entry, would entitle the claimant to a patent. That such was the purpose is established by the congressional debates. 58 Cong. Rec. pt. 5, pp. 4577-4585, 66th Cong. 1st Sess.\n Here the claim of the contestant was not one which would necessarily ever come to fruition in ownership, for, if successful, he would not have been entitled to entry or patent in preference to any other citizen desiring to apply for the land. In the absence of a statute or a departmental regulation securing it, there is no preference right. Compare Hartman v. Warren (C. C.) 76 F. 157; Howell v. Sappington (C. C.) 165 F. 944; Charles L. Ostenfeldt, 41 L. D. 265, 267. As the provisions of the Leasing Act precluded the contestant, if successful, from purchasing the lands in question as coal lands, his contest was rightly dismissed, and it becomes unnecessary to consider the effect upon the proceedings in the Department of the withdrawal of the state's protest. \n\n[276 U.S. 560, 567]\n\u00a0\n Whether, if the situation were otherwise, the Secretary could by a mandatory injunction be directed to issue a patent, we need not consider. No decision of this Court has given sanction to such a direction.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWUCHTER v. PIZZUTTI(1928)\nNo. 142\nArgued: January 5, 1928Decided: February 20, 1928\n\n\n\n Mr. James D. Carpenter, of Jersey City, N. J., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 14]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jacob R. Mantell, of Summit, N. J., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[276 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity, under the Fourteenth Amendment, of a statute of New Jersey providing for service of process on nonresidents of the state in suits for injury by the negligent operation of automobiles on its highways.\n Pizzutti was driving a team of horses attached to a wagon on a public highway in New Jersey. Wuchter was a resident of Pennsylvania, who was following the wagon with his automobile. Wuchter drove his car so as to crash into the rear of the wagon, damaging it, and injuring Pizzutti and his horses. Pizzutti instituted a suit against Wuchter in the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Wuchter was served with process under the provisions of the act known as chapter 232 of the Laws of 1924 (P. L. 1924, p. 517), by leaving process with the secretary of the state. Wuchter interposed no defense. A judgment interlocutory was taken against him and a writ of inquiry of damages was issued. Although the statute did not \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n require it, notice of its proposed execution was actually served personally on Wuchter in Pennsylvania. Wuchter did not appear. A final judgment was entered. Wuchter then appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the act under which the process was served upon him was unconstitutional, because it deprived him of his property without due process of law, in contravention of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n Section 1 of the act complained of, under which the process was served in this case, was as follows:\n'From and after the passage of this act any chauffeur, operator or owner of any motor vehicle, not licensed under the laws of the state of New Jersey, providing for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles, who shall accept the privilege extended to nonresident chauffeurs, operators and owners by law of driving such a motor vehicle or of having the same driven or operated in the state of New Jersey, without a New Jersey registration or license, shall, by such acceptance and the operation of such automobile within the state of New Jersey, make and constitute the secretary of state of the state of New Jersey, his, her or their agent for the acceptance of process in any civil suit or proceeding by any resident of the state of New Jersey against such chauffeur, operator or the owner of such motor vehicle, arising out of or by reason of any accident or collision occurring within the state in which a motor vehicle operated by such chauffeur, or operator, or such motor vehicle is involved.'\n\n This is the first section of an act entitled.\n'An act providing for the service of process in the civil suits upon nonresident chauffeurs, operators, or nonresident owners whose motor vehicles are operated within the state of New Jersey, without being licensed under the provisions of the laws of the state of New Jersey, providing for the registration and licensing of drivers and operators and \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n of motor vehicles, requiring the execution by them of a power of attorney to the secretary of state of the state of New Jersey to accept civil process for them under certain conditions.'\n\n The second section provides that, where the car is unlicensed and there is an accident, the magistrate before whom the nonresident owner of such motor vehicle or its operator shall be brought shall require the nonresident, as a condition to his release on bail or otherwise, to execute a written power of attorney to the secretary of state, appointing such officer his lawful attorney for the acceptance of service in any civil suit instituted or to be instituted by any resident of the state of New Jersey against the nonresident for or on account of any claim arising out of the collision or accident.\n Section 3 provides that it shall be lawful to serve civil process upon a nonresident owner in such case upon any chauffeur or operator of the vehicle while the vehicle is being operated within the state by such chauffeur or operator, and that such service may be lawfully served upon any nonresident owner by serving the process upon any person over the age of 14 years who has custody of the authomobile, whether held by him as security or driven, provided, however, that a copy of such civil process also shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon such automobile. The only provision for other than service on the persons in charge of the car is by leaving the summons with the secretary of state without more, under section 1 of the act already quoted.\n By the general state motor law, as amended by chapter 211, Laws of 1924, provision is made for the registration and license of automobiles owned by nonresidents who use the highways of the state (P. L. 1924,  9, par. 4, p. 451). They are required to agree that original process against the owner made by leaving it in the office of the secretary of state shall have the same effect as if served on the owner within the state, and the statute \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 18]\n\u00a0\n provides that the commissioner of motor vehicles shall notify the owner of such motor car by letter directed to him at the post office address stated in his application for registration and license already filed with the commissioner.\n The act first above referred to, No. 232, under which process in this case was served, applies to the owners of automobiles who are not licensed, but who come into the state and use the highways of the state without registration, and is not to be confused with the license act or its provisions.\n It is settled by our decisions that a state's power to regulate the use of its highways extends to their use by nonresidents as well as by residents. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140. We have further held that, in advance of the operation of a motor vehicle on its highways by a nonresident, a state may require him to take out a license and to appoint one of its officials as his agent, on whom process may be served in suits growing out of accidents in such operation. This was under the license act or New Jersey, last above referred to, and not No. 232. Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. We have also recognized it to be a valid exercise of power by a state, because of its right to regulate the use of its highways by nonresidents, to declare, without exacting a license, that the use of the highway by the nonresident may be statute be treated as the equivalent of the appointment by him of a state official as agent on whom process in such a case may be served. Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S. Ct. 632\n\n\n The question made in the present case is whether a statute, making the secretary of state the person to receive the process, must, in order to be valid, contain a provision making it reasonably probable that notice of the service on the secretary will be communicated to the nonresident defendant who is sued. Chapter 232 of the Laws of 1924 makes no such requirement and we \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 19]\n\u00a0\n have not been shown any provision in any applicable law of the state of New Jersey requiring such communication. We think that a law with the effect of this one should make a reasonable provision for such probable communication. We quite agree, and, indeed, have so held in the Pawloski Case, that the act of a nonresident in using the highways of another state may be properly declared to be an agreement to accept service of summons in a suit growing out of the use of the highway by the owner of the automobile, but the enforced acceptance of the service of process on a state officer by the defendant would not be fair or due process unless such officer or the plaintiff is required to mail the notice to the defendant, or to advise him, by some written communication, so as to make it reasonably probable that he will receive actual notice. Otherwise, where the service of summons is limited to a service of the secretary of state or some officer of the state, without more, it will be entirely possible for a person injured to sue any nonresident he chooses, and through service upon the state official obtain a default judgment against a nonresident who has never been in the state, who had nothing to do with the accident, or whose automobile having been in the state has never injured anybody. A provision of law for service that leaves open such a clear opportunity for the commission of fraud (Heinemann v. Pier, 110 Wis. 185, 85 N. W. 646) or injustice is not a reasonable provision, and in the case supposed would certainly be depriving a defendant of his property without due process of law. The Massachusetts statute, considered in Hess v. Pawloski, really made necessary actual personal service to be evidenced by the written admission of the defendant. In Kane v. New Jersey, the service provided for by statute was by mail to the necessarily known registered address of the licensed defendant.\n In determining the reasonableness of provision for service we should consider the situation of both parties. The person injured must find out to whom the offending auto- \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 20]\n\u00a0\n mobile belongs. This may be a difficult task. It is easy when the operator of the automobile is present after the accident. That is provided for in the second section of this act by apprehending him or his operator. But the vehicle may be operated by some one who having committed the injury successfully escapes capture or identification. In such a case, the person injured must be left without a remedy by suit at law, as every one must be who does not know or cannot discover the person who injured him. The burden is necessarily on him to investigate and learn. In finding out who it was, and whether the person is of such financial responsibility as to warrant a suit, he almost necessarily will secure knowledge of his post office address or his place of residence, and thereby be enabled to point out how notice may be communicated to him. With this information at hand the state may properly authorize service to be made on one of its own officials, if it also requires that notice of that service shall be communicated to the person sued. Every statute of this kind, therefore, should require the plaintiff bringing the suit to show in the summons to be served the post office address or residence of the defendant being sued, and should impose either on the plaintiff himself or upon the official receiving service or some other, the duty of communication by mail or otherwise with the defendant.\n The cases, in which statutes have been upheld providing that nonresident corporations may properly be served by leaving a summons with a state official, where the corporation has not indicated a resident agent to be served, are not especially applicable to the present statute. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93\n, 37 S. Ct. 344; Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S. Ct. 255; Old Wayne Mutual Life Association v. McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8\n, 27 S. Ct. 236. Such corporations may be properly required to accept service through a public officer as a condition of their doing business in the state. Their \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 21]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the statutory requirement may perhaps prompt frequent inquiry as to suits against them, of their appointed agent or at the office of the public official to be served, but it could hardly be fair or reasonable to require a nonresident individual owner of a motor vehicle who may use the state highways to make constant inquiry of the secretary of state to learn whether he has been sued. Even in cases of nonresident corporations, it has been held that a statute directing service upon them by leaving process with a state official is void if it contains no provision requiring the official, upon whom the service may be made, to give the foreign corporations notice that suit has been brought and citation served. Southern Railway Co. v. Simon (C. C.) 184 F. 959, 961; Gouner v. Missouri Valley Bridge Co., 123 La. 964, 49 So. 657. In the latter case, the Louisiana court said in respect to such a law:\n'This law makes no provision whatever for the service on the defendant. The officer may decline to communicate with the person sued and give no notice whatever, not even by mail. A judgment might be obtained without the least knowledge of the person sued. Under the phrasing of the statute, the duty of the officer begins and ends in his office. If such a judgment were rendered, it could receive no recognition whatever at the place of the domicile. When a petition cannot legally be served on a defendant, the court can exercise no jurisdiction over him. The service defines the court's jurisdiction.'\n\n The question is mooted in Simon v. Southern R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115, 129\n, 35 S. Ct. 255, and the above language is quoted, but it was not found necessary to decide the point.\n It is instructive in this matter to refer to state authorities to observe their view of what is valid in statutory provision for service upon proposed defendants, corporate or otherwise, where personal service cannot be had. In Nelson v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., 225 Ill. 197, 80 N. E. 109, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1186, 116 Am. St. Rep. 133, the action was for personal injuries. The \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 22]\n\u00a0\n statute provided that service could be had upon the president of a company at the place of business in the county, but that if there was no officer in the county, then the company might be notified by publication and mail in like manner and like effect as is provided in the rules of chancery. Those rules required an affidavit showing the publication of a notice in a newspaper, and the mailing of the notice published. It was held that the service under the statute was valid as a reasonable one, for it was probable that the defendant would receive actual notice of the action before judgment was rendered against it.\n In Jefferson Fire Insurance Co. v. Brackin, 140 Ga. 637, 79 S. E. 467, the statute provided that an action could be brought against an insurance company in the county in which the contract was made, out of which the cause of action arose, although there was no agent doing business in the county at the time. Also, that service of summons might be made by leaving a copy of the writ at the place of business of the agent at the time the cause of action accrued. The latter provision in the actual case was said to be lacking in due process for the reason that there was no reasonable probability that the company would receive notice in cases where there was no longer a place of business in the county.\n In Pinney v. Providence Loan & Investment Co., 106 Wis. 396, 82 N. W. 308, 50 L. R. A. 577, 80 Am. St. Rep. 41, the suit was by the grantee of a tax deed against the defendant corporation and another, as the former owners of the land, to bar their rights. The corporation was organized under the laws of the state and had its principal place of business in the county. The statute provided that corporation should file the names of officers upon whom service might be made, and that in all cases prior to the filing of such a list, service might be had by delivering and leaving with the register of deeds of the county where the corporation had its principal \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 23]\n\u00a0\n place of business, a copy of the papers. Service in this case was had on the register of deeds accordingly. It was held that the statute was unconstitutional; that while the state might authorize constructive service on corporations, 'the method adopted should be reasonably calculated to bring notice home to some of the officers or agents of the corporation, and thus secure an opportunity for being heard.'\n In Town of Hinckley v. Kettle River R. Co., 70 Minn. 105, 72 N. W. 835, there was an action against the railroad company for the recovery of certain bonds or their value. The statute provided that when a corporation created by the laws of the state did not have an officer in the state upon whom legal service of process could be made, an action might be brought in a county where the cause of action arose or the corporation had property, and a service might be made by depositing a copy of the summons in the office of the secretary of state, which should be taken as a personal service on the corporation: Provided that whenever any process was served on the secretary of state, the same should be by duplicate copies, one of which should be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and the other mailed by him immediately, postage prepaid, to the office of the company, or to the president, or secretary as found by the articles of incorporation on file in the office of the state official. It was held that the statute provided for due process, there being a necessity for providing for substituted service on domestic corporations, when the officer could not be found within the state, and that the method adopted was appropriate and likely to communicate actual notice of the commencement of the action to the corporation.\n In McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 \nU.S. 90, 91\n, 37 S. Ct. 343, L. R. A. 1917F, 458, a person domiciled in Texas left the state to make his home in another state. An action for money was begun by pub- \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 24]\n\u00a0\n lication in a newspaper after his departure, and a judgment recovered and sustained by the state Supreme Court was held void by this court. This court said:\n'The foundation of jurisdiction is physical power, although in civilized times it is not necessary to maintain that power throughout proceedings properly begun, and although submission to the jurisdiction by appearance may take the place of service upon the person. ... No dubt there may be some extension of the means of acquiring jurisdiction beyond service or appearance, but the foundation should be borne in mind. Subject to its conception of sovereignty even the common law required a judgment not to be contrary to natural justice. ... And in states bound together by a Constitution and subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, great caution should be used not to let fiction deny the fair play that can be secured only by a pretty close adhesion to fact.'\n\n See, also, Roller v. Holly, \n176 \nU.S. 398\n, 20 S. Ct. 410.\n These cases and others indicate a general trend of authority toward sustaining the validity of service of process, if the statutory provisions in themselves indicate that there is reasonable probability that if the statutes are complied with, the defendant will receive actual notice, and that is the principle that we think should apply here.\n But it is said that the defendant here had actual notice by service out of New Jersey in Pennsylvania. He did not, however, appear in the cause and such notice was not required by the statute. Not having been directed by the statute it cannot, therefore, supply constitutional validity to the statute or to service under it. Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, \n237 \nU.S. 413, 424\n, 425 S., 35 S. Ct. 625; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Stock Yards Co., \n212 \nU.S. 132, 144\n, 29 S. Ct. 246; Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Wright, \n207 \nU.S. 127, 138\n, 28 S. Ct. 47, 12 Ann. Cas. 463; Security Trust Co. v. Lexington, \n203 \nU.S. 323, 333\n, 27 S. Ct. 87; Roller v. Holly, \n176 \nU.S. 398, 409\n, 20 S. Ct. 410; Stuart v. Palmer, \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 25]\n\u00a0\n 74 N. Y. 183, 188, 30 Am. Rep. 289; Berryhill v. Sepp. 106 Minn. 458, 119 N. W. 404, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 344. For these reasons, we think that the statute of New Jersey under consideration does not make provision for communication to be proposed defendant, such as to create reasonable probability that he would be made aware of the bringing of the suit.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs), dissenting.\n The rule of general law stated by the court seems to me sound. But I think the judgment should be affirmed. The objection sustained by the court-that the statute is void because it fails to provide that the secretary of state shall notify the nonresident defendant-is an objection taken for the first time in this court. It was not made or considered below, and it is not to be found in the assignments of error filed in this court. The only objection made or considered below was that the state court lacked jurisdiction, because the defendant had not been personally served within the state; in other words, that while the state might require the defendant to appoint the secretary of state as his agent to receive service, as held in Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30, service without such appointment is bad. When the case at bar was decided below, the validity of that objection was an open question. Before the case was reached for argument in this court, Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S. Ct. 632, settled that process other than personal service within the state may suffice to give jurisdiction over nonresident motorists. The objection now urged-that failure to prescribe that the secretary shall notify the nonresident denies due process-is an afterthought provoked by our decision in Hess v. Pawloski.\n The nature of our jurisdiction under section 237 of the Judicial Code ( 28 USCA  344) demands a rigorous adherence to the long-estab \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 26]\n\u00a0\n lished practice that objections not raised or considered below cannot be relied on here. First National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 363; Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 557; Bolln v. Nebraska, \n176 \nU.S. 83, 89\n, 20 S. Ct. 287; Detroit, Ft. Wayne & Belle Isle R. Co. v. Osborn, \n189 \nU.S. 383, 390\n, 391 S., 23 S. Ct. 540; Cox v. Texas, \n202 \nU.S. 446, 451\n, 26 S. Ct. 671; Haire v. Rice, \n204 \nU.S. 291, 301\n, 27 S. Ct. 281. It is immaterial that Wuchter made a general objection that the statute violated the due process clause. Compare Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n; Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 U.S. 193\n, 197-201, 19 S. Ct. 379; Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 632\n, 36 S. Ct. 473. The wisdom of that rule of practice is illustrated by what has happened in the case at bar. The reversal rests wholly upon a construction given to the New Jersey statute by this court. It construes the statute as not requiring the secretary of state to give notice to the defendant. Whether the Court of Errors and Appeals would have so construed the statute is at least doubtful. Had the objection been made there, it is possible-and indeed probable-that the highest court of New Jersey would have construed the statute as requiring the notice. Its able opinion shows that it appreciates fully the requirements of the due process clause. See, also, Redzina v. Provident Institution for Savings, 96 N. J. Eq. 346, 125 A. 133.\n For aught that appears, it may have been the uniform practice of the secretary to give notice whenever the address of the defendant was ascertainable. Such an administrative construction would carry great weight with the courts of New Jersey (State v. Kelsey, 44 N. J. Law, 1; Stephens v. Civil Service Commission, 101 N. J. Law, 192, 194, 127 A. 808), as it would with this court (United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos Y. Compania, \n209 \nU.S. 337\n, 28 S. Ct. 532). Moreover, the rule that a construction which raises a serious doubt as to the constitutionality of a statute will not be adopted if some other construction is open, is a rule commonly acted upon by the courts of New Jersey (Colwell v. May's \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 27]\n\u00a0\n Landing Water & Power Co., 19 N. J. Eq. 245, 249; Atlantic City Water Works Co. v. Consumers Water Co., 44 N. J. E.q. 427, 437, 15 A. 581; State v. Tachin, 92 N. J. Law, 270, 274, 106 A. 145), as it is in this court ( Texas v. Eastern Texas R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204, 217\n, 42 S. Ct. 281; Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n261 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 43 S. Ct. 387; South Utah Mines v. Beaver County, \n262 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 43 S. Ct. 577; Matthew Addy Co. v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 44 S. Ct. 300; Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 389\n, 390 S., 44 S. Ct. 391; Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238, 251\n, 45 S. Ct. 487; Hopkins v. Southern California Telephone Co., \n275 \nU.S. 393\n, 48 S. Ct. 180, No. 133, decided January 3, 1928). Compare Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252, 268\n, 6 S. Ct. 580; Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 657\n, 15 S. Ct. 207; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 34 S. Ct. 359. As was said in St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 35 S. Ct. 99, 105 ( 59 L. Ed. 265):\n'We ought not to indulge the presumption either that the Legislature intended to exceed the limits imposed upon state action by the Federal Constitution, or that the courts of the state will so interpret the legislation as to lead to that result.'\n\n See, also, Chicago, Terre Haute & Southeastern R. Co. v. Anderson, \n242 \nU.S. 283, 287\n, 37 S. Ct. 124.\n While this court has power to construe the statute, it is not obliged to do so. We have often recognized the propriety of remanding a case to a state court for the determination of a delicate question of state law. Gulf, Colorado & Santa F e Ry. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 506\n, 32 S. Ct. 542; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 291\n, 44 S. Ct. 323; Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n273 \nU.S. 126, 131\n, 47 S. Ct. 311; Cobb Brick Co. v. Lindsay, \n275 \nU.S. 491\n, 48 S. Ct. 34, 72 L. Ed. -. If the judgment is to be reversed, it should be specifically for the purpose of enabling the Court of Errors and Appeals to pass upon the objection first raised by the defendant in this court.\n In the case at bar, the objection is not lack of jurisdiction, but denial of due process because the statute did not require the secretary to notify the nonresident defend- \n\n[276 U.S. 13, 28]\n\u00a0\n ant. Notice was in fact given. And it was admitted at the bar that the defendant had, at all times, actual knowledge and the opportunity to defend. The cases cited by the court as holding that he could deliberately disregard that notice and opportunity and yet insist upon a defect in the statute as drawn, although he was in no way prejudiced thereby, seem hardly reconcilable with a long line of authorities. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 \nU.S. 230, 238\n, 239 S., 20 S. Ct. 620; Simon v. Craft, \n182 \nU.S. 427, 436\n, 437 S., 21 S. Ct. 836; Harris v.

Ct. 558. For the reasons stated, I do not need to attempt to reconcile them.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I agree that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded, but with leave to the state court to determine whether the notice given to the plaintiff in error by the secretary of state was required by the statute. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWYSONG v.
