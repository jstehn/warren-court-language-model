SMALL CO. v. AMERICAN SUGAR REFINING CO.(1925)\nNo. 101\nArgued: October 22, 1924Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edgar Watkins, Mac Asbill, Horace Russell and Frederick T. Saussy, all of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Orville A. Park, of Macon, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover for the breach of two contracts for the sale by a sugar refiner to a wholesale dealer of 35,000 pounds of refined sugar-the breach consisting in the buyer's refusal to accept the sugar when delivered. The plaintiff secured a verdict and judgment in the District Court; and the defendant prosecutes this direct writ of error, a constitutional question, among others, being involved.\n The contracts were alleged to have arisen out of written orders from the wholesale dealer and written acceptances by the refiner. Whether the acceptances conformed to the orders, and so resulted in contracts, was questioned by a demurrer to the petition, and also at the trial, and is the first matter presented by the assignments of error. The defendant asserts that there was a material variance in three particulars. One is that the orders contained no designation of the place from which the sugar was to be shipped, while the acceptances named New Orleans as the place. This closely approaches a mere quibble. The orders were addressed to the refiner at New Orleans and expressly gave it an option to ship from any of its refineries, one of which was at New Orleans. So, in naming that place as the one from which shipment would be made, the acceptances were in accord with the orders. Another asserted difference is that the orders fixed one price for the sugar, while the acceptances fixed another price. This is equally without substance. In the acceptances the basis on which the price was calculated was described a little differently from what it was in the orders; but there was \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n no difference in meaning. Besides, the price calculated on the indicated basis was set out in the price column in the orders and in the acceptances, and was the same in both. Lastly it is said that the orders gave the refiner a conditional right to supply such grades of sugar as it might have available at the time of shipment, while the acceptances omitted the words of condition and made the right absolute. This point, although having more color than the other two, must fail for reasons which will be stated.\n The orders and acceptances were both prepared by the refiner-a circumstance strongly suggesting they were intended to be in accord. After the acceptances were given, both parties in several ways affirmatively treated the orders as effectively accepted. Not until this action was brought was a variance suggested. In such circumstances a court should be solicitous to find, as the parties evidently did before they became hostile, an accord between the two instruments.\n The orders were given in July, 1920, and called for shipment of the sugar during September of that year. They set forth carefully the assortment of packages and grades of sugar desired, with the particular price of each, and then said:\n'Barrels or equivalent at price of 22 1\/2 cents, assortment to be furnished seller by buyer before September 1, 1920, but subject to such substitutions as seller may find necessary to make. In event assortment is not furnished prompt seller reserves right to ship such grades as it has available at the time of shipment.'\n\n The acceptances set forth the assortment of packages and grades, with prices, in the same way, and then said:\n'Seller reserves right to ship such grades as it has available at the time of shipment.'\n\n This provision in the acceptances is well constructed and can have but one meaning. But not so of the provision quoted from the orders. In any view it is neither grammatical \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n nor rightly punctuated. It was typewritten, and probably was prepared with the idea that the assortment of packages and grades would not be embodied in the orders, but would be furnished by the buyer later on. In fact, as just shown, the assortment was set forth in the orders. But, putting this aside, the context and the sense of the whole provision indicate that the clause, 'in event assortment is not furnished prompt,' was intended to be a part of and to qualify what precedes it rather than what follows. If that was the meaning intended, a mistake in punctuation by the typist should not be permitted to defeat it. Ewing v. Burnet, 11 Pet. 41, 54; Hammock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n105 U.S. 77\n, 84. The parties evidently treated it as the true meaning when the orders and acceptances were given, for their acts already recited have no other explanation. There is ample warrant therefore for regarding the full provision as reading:\n'Barrels or equivalent at price of 22 1\/2 cents. Assortment to be furnished seller by buyer before September 1, 1920, but subject to such substitutions as seller may find necessary to make in event assortment is not furnished promptly. Seller reserves right to ship such grades as it has available at the time of shipment.'\n\n In this view the orders and acceptances contained the same reservation of a right to ship available grades. A like conclusion in a like situation was reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in American Sugar Refining Co. v. Newman Grocery Co., 284 F. 835.\n To avoid any misapprehension, it is well to state at this point that, in fact, the refiner delivered the assortment of packages and grades specified in the orders and repeated in the acceptances.\n In its answer the defendant set up two defenses expressly based on the Lever Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276,  1, 4, as amended by the Act of October 22, 1919, c. 80, 41 Stat. 297,  1, 2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/8 E, 3115 1\/8 FF), AND ON ORDERS AND REGULATIONS MADE THERE \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n UNDER. one defense was to the effect that the plaintiff was not entitled to 'more than one cent per pound profit on what the sugar cost, which was the prima facie reasonable profit fixed by the president,' and in no event was entitled to 'more than a reasonable profit.' The other defense was to the effect that the contracts were unlawful, because they provided for delivery at a future time, more than thirty days away, and thereby 'tended to increase the price of sugar and to promote the hoarding thereof.' Each of these defenses was challenged by a demurrer on the grounds: First, that the facts alleged were not sufficient to constitute a defense under the Lever Act; and, secondly, that that act was in conflict with the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and void. The demurrers were sustained on the second ground; and the defendant assigns error on that ruling.\n As the Lever Act is a long one with various provisions, we assume that the District Court's ruling was confined to certain provisions in sections 4, 5, and 6 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff-3115 1\/8 gg), for they are all that could have any bearing. Section 25 (section 3115 1\/8 q), mentioned in the briefs, related only to coal and coke. Section 1 (section 3115 1\/8 e), likewise mentioned, provided for the issue of regulations and orders to carry out other sections, but did not alter or enlarge their prohibitions or requirements.\n Section 4 provided it should be 'unlawful for any person willfully ... to make any unjust or unreasonable ... charge in ... dealing in or with any necessaries,' or to agree with another 'to exact excessive prices for any necessaries.' In a series of cases, of which United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045, and Weeds Inc. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 109\n, 41 S. Ct. 306, are examples, this court held that provision invalid as contravening the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, among others, because it required that the transactions named should conform to a rule or standard which was so vague and indefinite that no one could know what \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n it was. By copious references to judicial pronouncements and proceedings the court illustrated that the terms 'unjust,' 'unreasonable,' and 'excessive' as applied to prices by that provision had no commonly recognized or accepted meaning. The ground of the decision is reflected by the following excerpt from the opinion in the first case (\n255 U.S. 89\n [41 S. Ct. 300]):\n'Observe that the section forbids no specific or definite act. It confines the subject-matter of the investigation which it authorizes [ by court and jury after the act] to no element essentially inhering in the transaction as to which it provides. It leaves open, therefore, the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against. In fact, we see no reason to doubt the soundness of the observation of the court below, in its opinion, to the effect that, to attempt to enforce the section would be the exact equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury.'\n\n The defendant attempts to distinguish those cases because they were criminal prosecutions. But that is not an adequate distinction. The ground or principle of the decisions was not such as to be applicable only to criminal prosecutions. It was not the criminal penalty that was held invalid, but the exaction of obedience to a rule or standard which was so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all. Any other means of exaction, such as declaring the transaction unlawful or stripping a participant of his rights under it, was equally within the principle of those cases. They have been so construed and applied by other courts in civil proceedings. Standard Chemicals, etc., Corporation v. Waugh Chemical Corporation, 231 N. Y. 51, 54, 131 N. E. 566, 14 A. L. R. 1054; Dunman v. South Texas Lumber Co. (Tex. Civ. App.) 252 S. W. 274, 275. In the first of these citations, the \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals of New York, referring to this court's ruling in the Cohen Grocery Co. Case, well said:\n'The ground on which it placed its judgment applies, and with like consequences, to civil suits as well. The prohibition was declared a nullity because too vague to be intelligible. No standard of duty had been established. ... The variant views of judges of the District Courts were quoted as evidence of the absence of a standard. If this is the rationale of the decision, its consequences are not limited to criminal prosecutions. A prohibition so indefinite as to be unintelligible is not a prohibition by which conduct can be governed. It is not a rule at all; it is merely exhortation and entreaty.'\n\n In Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242, 250\n, 42 S. Ct. 289, 292), a civil case arising out of the war-time rent law of the state of New York, this court referred to the Cohen Grocery Co. Case as 'dealing with definitions of crime' and declared it 'not applicable.' This brief reference is now pressed on our attention, special emphasis being laid on the words 'dealing with definitions of crime.' We appreciate their import, but must recognize that they do not adequately reflect the matter dealt with. As already shown, it was broader than they indicate; and of course they were not intended to qualify or limit the decision. The important part of the reference was the declaration that the decision was not applicable to the case then under consideration. The inapplicability resulted from a material difference between the cases. One dealt with a federal statute prohibiting the sale of sugar at unjust, unreasonable and excessive prices, and the other with a state statute directed against reserving unjust, unreasonable and oppressive rent in the leasing of real property in a city for dwelling purposes.\n The federal statute contained no provision pointing to what should be deemed a just, reasonable and not excessive price; and there was no accepted and fairly stable \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n commercial standard which could be regarded as impliedly taken up and adopted by the statute, as this court construed it. While sugar has a market value, that value is subject to fluctuations which individual manufacturers and dealers can neither control nor readily foresee. The price in one trade center is affected by that in others, and in all there are material variations, even in short periods. The tendency to vary is illustrated in the present record, which shows that the price advanced in the early part of 1920, reaching 26 cents a pound in June, then remained steady for a month or two, and then declined irregularly to about eight cents.\n The New York statute was not silent as to what should be deemed a just, reasonable and unoppressive reservation of rent. It recognized and named elements which would require consideration, and the state court construed it as prescribing a standard 'which permitted the landlord to receive a reasonable income on his investment,' valued as of the time when the rent was reserved. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, 194 App. Div. 482, 506, 186 N. Y. S. 5; s. c. 230 N. Y. 634, 130 N. E. 923. So, when the case came here the question presented in this connection was whether that standard was sufficiently definite to satisfy the requirement of due process of law in the Fourteenth Amendment. This court held that it was. Real property, particularly in a city, comes to have a recognized value, which is relatively stable and easily ascertained. It also comes to have a recognized rental value-the measure of compensation commonly asked and paid for its occupancy and use-the amount being fixed with due regard to what is just and reasonable between landlord and tenant in view of the value of the property and the outlay which the owner must make for taxes and other current charges. These are matters which in the course of business come to be fairly well settled and understood. A standard thus developed and accepted in actual practice, when made the \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n test of compliance with legislative commands or prohibitions, usually meets the requirement of due process of law in point of being sufficiently definite and intelligible.\n The difference which we have pointed out between the two statutes and between the matters sought to be regulated by them made it obvious that the decision on the validity of one statute had no bearing on the question of the validity of the other.\n As section 4 was invalid, whether taken as a civil regulation or as a criminal statute, it follows that in so far as the special defenses were based on it the demurrers were rightly sustained.\n Section 5 was not dependent on section 4; nor did this court consider its validity along with that of section 4. For present purposes, it may be described as (a) providing for the licensing of transactions in necessaries, including the manufacture, refining, distribution and sale of sugar; (b) as declaring that the president, on finding that any licensee was taking an unreasonable profit, might, by an order reciting his finding, require such licensee to discontinue taking the unreasonable profit, and might also determine what was a reasonable profit to be taken in lieu of the one found unreasonable; and (c) as providing that 'in any proceedings brought in any court such order of the president shall be prima facie evidence.'\n It is apparent that the section did not invest the president with general authority to fix the profit which might be taken on sales of sugar, but only with special authority, on finding that a licensee was taking an unreasonable profit, to require that such practice on the part of the licensee be discontinued and to determine what was a reasonable profit to be taken in place of the one condemned.\n The special defenses, while showing that the plaintiff was licensed to manufacture, refine and sell sugar, contained no allegation that the president had found that the \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff in selling its sugar was taking an unreasonable profit, nor any allegation of an order by the president requiring it to discontinue such a practice. Of course, the special defenses could not derive any support from that section when there had been no action by the president under it.\n One of the special defenses speaks of the president's having fixed one cent per pound as the profit which might be taken. But the reference is to an administrative regulation1 which had no application to sales by a manufacturer or refiner to a wholesale dealer, such as are in question here. Besides, that regulation was revoked May 31, 1919, before these contracts were made. There was an administrative regulation2 applicable to manufacturers and refiners which restricted them to taking not more than a fair and reasonable advance over cost; but this regulation was revoked January 26, 1919, before the contracts were made.\n The allegation that the contracts called for a delivery more than thirty days in the future, and therefore were unlawful as tending to increase the price and promote hoarding, was of no legal effect. While section 6 prohibited willful hoarding, and also certain acts done for the purpose of unreasonably increasing or diminishing the price, it did not prohibit a selling for delivery more than thirty days in the future. Nor did the special defenses set forth any facts which could be regarded as bringing the contracts within any prohibition of that section. Not improbably the pleader had in mind an administrative regulation3 applicable to manufacturers and refiners which forbade making contracts of sale under which \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n shipment was not to be made within thirty days. But no support can be derived from that regulation, for it was revoked January 26, 1919, prior to the making of these contracts.\n In so far therefore as the special defenses were based on sections 5 and 6 and the regulations cited, the demurrers were rightly sustained-and this regardless of any question respecting the validity of either of those sections or of any of the regulations.\n A short statement of the case shown by the evidence, in so far it is embodied in the record, will give a better understanding of the remaining questions.\n By the contracts, made in July, 1920, the plaintiff agreed to deliver the sugar to a carrier at New Orleans during September, or soon thereafter, for shipment to the defendant at Macon, Ga.; and the defendant agreed to accept delivery to the carrier, to pay the contract price, and to bear the carrier's charges. In August the market price of sugar took a downward turn and continued to decline to the end of that year. In September the plaintiff made the delivery to the carrier as agreed; and in due course the sugar reached Macon. The defendant then refused to accept it and wrote to the plaintiff saying:\n'For the good of whom it may concern we suggest that this carload of sugar be stored to save any additional cost (demurrage, etc.) against whoever might be affected.'\n\n The storage was effected as suggested with a Macon warehouseman, but was intended to be only temporary. Much correspondence ensued-the defendant repeating its refusal to take the sugar, and the plaintiff insisting the defendant was bound to take it and to bear the carrier's charges, etc. Finally, on November 30, the plaintiff sent to the defendant a notice saying:\n'As you have continued to refuse to take this shipment we must now inform you that unless you accept and pay for same at once we will resell this sugar for your account. When resale is made \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 245]\n\u00a0\n we will require you to remit the difference between contract price and price received on resale, as well as for all freight, storage and other charges incurred.'\n\n The defendant made no answer. The plaintiff then paid the several charges, took possession of the sugar and resold it in and around Macon- the last portion being sold December 20. There was an oversupply of sugar in the hands of wholesale dealers and others in that vicinity at the time, which made it difficult to effect a resale. But the plaintiff made an active and honest effort to make a fair sale and succeeded in obtaining the full market price prevailing in larger markets, plus the freight to Macon. The total amount realized, less storage and other charges not questioned, was $2,963.04. With this sum credited on the contract price there remained a balance of $5,111.70, which was demanded in the first count of the plaintiff's petition.\n On the trial the defendant sought to prove by jobbers and dealers in Macon that the price of sugar at Macon was higher in October and November than in December, and that in December particular sales were made at a higher rate than the plaintiff obtained on the resale-the purpose in offering this testimony being to discredit the fairness of the resale by the plaintiff. A preliminary examination of the witnesses disclosed that the market at Macon was greatly demoralized during that period; that jobbers and dealers were selling for what they could get regardless of cost, lest they might lose more through a further decline; that the buying was in relatively small quantities and was on what was termed a 'hand to mouth' plane; and that the particular sales in December were of such a character that they would shed no light on the fairness of the resale. On the plaintiff's objection, the court refused to permit the proffered testimony to go to the jury. Complaint is made of this ruling. In our opinion it constitutes no ground for a reversal. There were \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 246]\n\u00a0\n obvious infirmities in what was proposed to be shown about the market price in October and November; but we need not dwell on them, because, as will be explained later on, the state of the market in those months came to be quite immaterial. What was proposed to be shown about particular sales in December was rightly excluded. The sales were of a kind that did not tend to establish a standard by which to judge the plaintiff's resale. Besides, the real question was not whether the plaintiff got the best possible price, or as much as others got in special instances, but whether the resale was fairly made in a reasonably diligent effort to obtain a good price. To have admitted the proffered testimony would have tended to confuse and mislead the jury.\n At the trial the plaintiff took the position that when it delivered the sugar to the carrier at New Orleans its obligation under the contracts was fully performed and it became entitled to the contract price; that it could then have abandoned the sugar, but was not obliged to do so; that it had a vendor's lien thereon which could be availed of at any time before the sugar passed into the actual possession of the defendant; that it could realize on the lien by retaking the sugar and, after notice to the defendant, reselling the same for the latter's account and crediting the net proceeds on the contract price; and that it could recover the balance from the defendant. The District Court, in dealing with the first court of the petition, charged the jury to that effect-evidently believing it was conforming to Georgia statutes and decisions on the subject. No objection was made to that part of the charge nor was any exception taken to it; so we assume that it conformed to the local law and was applicable to the evidence. The court then proceeded to explain how that part of the charge should be applied, and in that connection said to the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the plaintiff retook possession under its vendor's lien, \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 247]\n\u00a0\n they should next consider whether the resale was made within a reasonable time, and in doing so should take as the starting point November 30, when the plaintiff gave notice of its purpose to retake and resell, and should consider only the period between that date and December 20, when the resale was concluded. The defendant's counsel excepted to this, the terms of the exception being:\n'We except to the court fixing November 30 as the time from which a reasonable time should be figured. I construe the plaintiff as being always in possession.'\n\n The defendant now insists the exception was well grounded. But we are of a different opinion. As the jury's verdict was for the plaintiff on the first count, they must have found that the plaintiff retook possession and made the resale under a vendor's lien. If it had such a lien under the law of Georgia-as we must assume in view of the unchallenged charge on that subject-the court plainly was right in saying the date when possession was taken under the lien was the starting point from which to reckon a reasonable time; and was also right in designating November 30 as that date. The suggestion in the exception that the plaintiff was 'always in possession' had no support in the evidence set forth in the record, for it shows that the plaintiff surrendered possession to the carrier at New Orleans and was not again in possession until after the notice of November 30 was given declaring the plaintiff's purpose to take possession and sell. According to the Georgia statute, which the District Court applied, the plaintiff was entitled to take possession under its lien at any time before 'actual receipt' of the sugar by the defendant. Parks' Ann. Code,  4132; Branan v. Atlanta & West Point R. R. Co., 108 Ga. 70, 73, 33 S. E. 836, 75 Am. St. Rep. 26. A duty to sell under the lien could not arise until possession was taken under it; and the reasonable time permitted for making a sale by way of realizing on the lien hardly would begin to run before. \n\n[267 U.S. 233, 248]\n\u00a0\n What we have just said explains why the testimony offered respecting the state of the market at Macon in October and November, before the plaintiff took possession under the lien, became immaterial.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Food Administration Special License Regulations, No. XI, A-5. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.

Late in July 150 barrels were shipped, accepted and paid for. About that time the market price began to decline and continued downward for the rest of the year. Late in August the seller shipped 150 barrels more, but when it reached Macon the buyer refused to accept it, suggested that it be stored 'for the benefit of whom it may concern,' which was done, and notified the seller that any further shipment would be similarly refused. Correspondence followed in which the seller sought to persuade the buyer to adhere to the contracts. Late in September, before the expiration of the time for completing delivery, the seller notified the buyer that, if \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 250]\n\u00a0\n the refusal to conform to the contracts was continued, the remaining 300 barrels, which included the 150 stored at Macon, would be resold for the account of the buyer and the latter would be held for the difference between the contract price and what was realized on the resale. The buyer persisted in the refusal and the sugar was resold.\n This action was brought by the seller to recover from the buyer the difference between the contract price and the amount obtained on the resale. In the District Court a verdict and judgment were given to the seller; and the buyer brought the case here on direct writ of error, a constitutional question being involved.\n One defense interposed by the answer was that the contracts were wanting in mutuality and therefore void. A demurrer to the defense was sustained, and this is assigned as error. Two clauses in the contracts are cited as making delivery optional with the seller, and therefore showing a want of mutuality. But in our opinion the clauses are not open to that construction. The contracts, signed by both parties, evidenced an agreement by the seller to deliver the sugar within a designated period at a fixed price, as well as an agreement by the buyer to take the sugar and to pay the price. They contemplated that the buyer might be accorded the privilege of calling for special deliveries, known as 'withdrawals,' during the prescribed period, if the seller was in a position reasonably to make them. And they contained alternative 'terms' of payment-'Cash before delivery less 2%, or cash in seven days less 2%.' The clauses in question then followed. One was, 'Terms and withdrawal subject to the approval of the seller's credit department.' Read in the light of established practices in the sugar trade, this clause meant that, when a shipment was made, the seller's credit department was to elect which of the alternative terms of payment should apply, and also that, if the buyer called for special deliveries, known as 'with drawals,' \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n that department was to determine whether such deliveries reasonably could be made and was to approve or disapprove them accordingly. The clause was essentially subsidiary and entirely consistent with the seller's definite agreement to make delivery within the period prescribed. The other clause was to the effect that, 'if the supply of raw material of the refinery manufacturing the sugar' should be interrupted by war conditions, embargoes, strikes or other like cause, and if delivery was thereby prevented, the seller should 'not be responsible.' There is nothing in this clause which affords any basis for saying that delivery was to be optional with the seller. On the contrary, it recognizes that he was obligating himself to make delivery. Its evident and only purpose was to relieve him from liability in the event that performance of the obligation was prevented by particular circumstances, in their nature beyond his control. It is idle to suggest, as was done in argument, that the clause would permit him to avoid delivery by merely selecting a refinery which by reason of war conditions, embargoes or strikes was already cut off from a supply of raw material. That would not be within either the letter or the spirit of the clause, but would be a palpable fraud and unavailing. Slater v. Savannah Sugar Refining Corporation, 28 Ga. App. 280, 284, 110 S. E. 759.\n The answer set up a special defense based on the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), prohibiting restraints and monopolies in interstate and foreign commerce. A demurrer to the defense was sustained and the ruling is assigned as error. But it was plainly right. In the first place, the contracts pertained only to intrastate commerce. They were negotiated in Georgia; the sugar was to be delivered from a refinery at Port Wentworth and shipped to Macon, both in Georgia; and no facts were alleged showing that interstate or foreign commerce was \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n affected. In the next place, and independently of the character of commerce involved, it was not shown that the contracts were in themselves invalid under the Anti-Trust Act, but only that they were collateral to a combination prohibited by it. In substance, the defense was that the seller and others had entered into a combination to manipulate interstate trade in refined sugar with a view to increasing the price; that the contracts were made during the life of the combination; and that the seller conformed the terms of sale to standards sanctioned by the combination. There was no allegation that it was not the owner of the sugar; nor any allegation that the buyer was a party to the combination or other than a stranger to it. The contracts disclosed the full transaction between the seller and buyer and contemplated that the sale should pass the title without any restriction on the right of the buyer to resell as it might choose. As has been pointed out in prior cases, there is nothing in the Anti-Trust Act which invalidates such a collateral contract or relieves the buyer from his obligation under it. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 550-552, 22 S. Ct. 431; Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Voight, \n212 U.S. 227\n, 257-259, 29 S. Ct. 280; Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn Products Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165, 177\n, 35 S. Ct. 398, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 118. It is only where the invalidity is inherent in the contract that the act may be interposed as a defense. With that exception the remedies which the act provides for violations of it are exclusive. Wilder Manufacturing Co. v. Corn Products Co., supra, 172, 175 (35 S. Ct. 398); Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 37 S. Ct. 718; Geddes v. Anaconda Mining Co., \n254 \nU.S. 590, 593\n, 41 S. Ct. 209.\n The answer also interposed a number of special defenses based on sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Lever Act, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ff-3115 1\/8 gg); chapter 80, 41 Stat. 297 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/8 e, 3115 1\/8 ff), and no particular orders and regulations issued under it. These defenses were held insufficient on demurrer-some on the ground that a part of the Lever Act was in conflict with the due \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some of the defenses were like those considered and rejected in Small Co. v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n267 \nU.S. 233\n, 45 S. Ct. 295, 69 L. Ed. --, just decided; and what was said of them there suffices to dispose of them here. The want of merit in the others is so obvious that they do not call for special notice. While the ruling on them is assigned as error, no attempt to support them is made in the brief.\n The sugar which was resold by the seller for the account of the buyer consisted of 105,000 pounds-the 52,500 pounds stored at Macon and a like quantity remaining at the refinery. The market at that time was unsettled. Wholesale dealers had an oversupply, and retail dealers were buying cautiously and in small quantities. Nevertheless the prices realized on the resales equaled the full market price for that general region for quantities such as were resold. The 52,500 pounds stored at Macon was resold October 11th and that at the refinery November 3d. In both instances the defendant was advised of the price offered by the intending purchaser and was given an opportunity to secure a purchaser at a better price, but none was brought in. A resale of the 52,500 pounds at the refinery was negotiated October 15th, but through some delay in transportation it was not consummated. Another sale was then negotiated and was completed November 3d at a little higher price.\n The defendant offered to prove by wholesale dealers in Macon the prices received by them on particular sales to retail dealers about the time of the resales; but the testimony was rejected, and we are asked to say that this was error. We think the ruling was right. The particular sales were in relatively small quantities, many of them under 300 pounds, and had no probative bearing on the fairness of the resales. The real question, as stated in Small Co. v. American Sugar Refining Co., supra, was whether the resales were fairly made in a reasonably \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n diligent effort to obtain a good price, and not whether the plaintiff got the best possible price, or as much as others got in particular instances. The unsettled state of the market and the difference between selling small quantities to retail dealers to satisfy immediate needs and selling large quantities to wholesale dealers who had an oversupply made it necessary to confine the evidence to the real question.\n On the conclusion of the evidence the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff; and the remaining question is whether this was error. The defendant insists that it was, because it took from the jury the question whether the resales were made within a reasonable time. The period for delivery under the contracts expired September 30th, and the court ruled that the duty to resell within a reasonable time arose at that time, which was practically conceded. One of the resales was made October 11th. Another was negotiated October 15th but fell through, and an effective one was made November 3d.\n The rule for testing the direction of a verdict, as often has been held, is that where the evidence is undisputed, or of such conclusive character that if a verdict were returned for one party, whether plaintiff or defendant, it would have to be set aside in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, a verdict may and should be directed for the other party. The view that a scintilla or modicum of conflicting evidence, irrespective of the character and measure of that to which it is opposed, necessarily requires a submission to the jury has met with express disapproval in this jurisdiction, as in many others. Improvement Co. v. Munson, 14 Wall. 442, 448; Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 122; Bowditch v. Boston, \n101 U.S. 16\n, 18; Anderson County Commissioners v. Beal, \n113 \nU.S. 227, 241\n, 5 S. Ct. 433; Delaware, etc., R. R. Co. v. Converse, \n139 \nU.S. 469, 472\n, 11 S. Ct. 569.\n We are of opinion that the evidence as set forth in the record conclusively established that the resales were \n\n[267 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n made within a reasonable time. The state of the market was such that it was difficult to make any sales; and the quantities to be sold enhanced that difficulty and also the need for care. The witnesses for the plaintiff described with much detail the efforts which were made, and the evidence as a whole reasonably admitted of no other conclusion than that the efforts were timely, well directed and persistent. Many bids were received, but almost all were so low that their acceptance would have meant a great sacrifice. The defendant was notified of the purpose to resell, but made no effort to advance it in point of time or to bring in a purchaser at an acceptable price. Considering the state of the market, the outcome appears to have justified both the time and care taken by the plaintiff.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAGNELLO v. U. S.(1925)\n\nArgued: April 23, 1925Decided: October 12, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Battle, Vandiver, Levy & Van Tine, of New York City ( Messrs. George Gordon Battle and Isaac H. Levy, both of New York City, of counsel), for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and William J. Donovan, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thomas Agnello, Frank Agnello, Stephen Alba, Antonio Centorino, and Thomas Pace were indicted in the District Court, Eastern District of New York, under section 37, Criminal Code, 35 Stat. 1088, 1096, c. 321 (Comp. St.  1020) for a conspiracy to violate the Harrison Act, 38 Stat. 785, c. 1, as amended by \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n sections 1006, 1007, 1008 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1130 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6287g, 6287l, 6287r). The indictment charges that defendants conspired together to sell cocaine without having registered with the collector of internal Revenue and without having paid the prescribed tax. The overt acts charged are that defendants had cocaine in their possession, solicited the sale of it, met in the home of defendant Alba at 138 Union street, Brooklyn, and made arrangements for the purpose of selling it, brought a large quantity of it to that place, and sold it in violation of the act. The jury found defendants guilty. Each was sentenced to serve two years in the penitentiary and to pay a fine of $5,000. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 290 F. 671.\n The evidence introduced by the government was sufficient to warrant a finding of the following facts: Paspuale Napolitano and Nunzio Dispenza, employed by government revenue agents for that purpose, went to the home of Alba, Saturday, January 14, 1922, and there offered by buy narcotics from Alba and Centorino. Alba gave them some samples. They arranged to come again on Monday following. They returned at the time agreed. Six revenue agents and a city policeman followed them and remained on watch outside. Alba left the house and returned with Centorino. They did not then produce any drug. After discussion and the refusal of Napolitano and Dispenza to go to Centorino's house to get the drug, Centorino went to fetch it. He was followed by some of the agents. He first went to his own house, 172 Columbia street; thence to 167 Columbia street, one part of which was a grocery store belonging to Pace and Thomas Agnello, and another part of which, connected with the grocery store, was the home of Frank Agnello and Pace. In a short time, Centorino, Pace, and the Agnellos came out of the last-mentioned place, and all went to Alba's house. Looking through the windows, those on watch saw \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 29]\n\u00a0\n Frank Agnello produce a number of small packages for delivery to Napolitano and saw the letter hand over money to Alba. Upon the apparent consummation of the sale, the agents rushed in and arrested all the defendants. They found some of the packages on the table where the transaction took place and found others in the pockets of Frank Agnello. All contained cocaine. On searching Alba, they found the money given him by Napolitano.\n And, as a part of its case in chief, the government offered testimony tending to show that, while some of the revenue agents were taking the defendants to the police station, the others and the city policeman went to the home of Centorino and searched it, but did not find any narcotics; that they then went to 167 Columbia street and searched it, and in Frank Agnello's bedroom found a can of cocaine, which was produced and offered in evidence. The evidence was excluded on the ground that the search and seizure were made without a search warrant. In defense, Centorino and others gave testimony to the effect that the packages of cocaine which were brought to and seized in Alba's house at the time of the arrests had been furnished to Centorino by Dispenza to induce an apparent sale of cocaine to Napolitano; that is, to incite crime or acts having the appearance of crime for the purpose of entrapping and punishing defendants. Centorino testified that, after leaving Napolitano and Dispenza with Alba at the latter's home, he went to his own house and got the packages of cocaine which had been given him by Dispenza, and took them to 167 Columbia street, and there a gave them to Frank Agnello to be taken to Alba's house. Frank Agnello testified on direct examination that he received the packages from Centorino, but that he did not know their contents, and that he would not have carried them, if he had known that they contained cocaine or narcotics. On cross-examination, he said that he had never seen narcotics. Then, notwithstanding objection \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 30]\n\u00a0\n by defendants, the prosecuting attorney produced the can of cocaine which the government claimed was seized in Agnello's bedroom and asked him whether he had ever seen it. He said he had not, and specifically stated he had never seen it in his house. In rebuttal, over objections of defendants, the government was permitted to put in the evidence of the search and seizure of the can of cocaine in Frank Agnello's room, which theretofore had been offered and excluded.\n The case involves the questions whether search of the house of Frank Agnello and seizure of the cocaine there found, without a search warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment, and whether the admission of evidence of such search and seizure violated the Fifth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment is:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n The provision of the Fifth Amendment invoked is this:\n'No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'\n\n The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody is not to be doubted. See Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 158\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 392\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177. The legality of the arrests or of the searches and seizures made at the home of Alba is not questioned. Such searches and seizures naturally and usually appertain to and attend such arrests. But the right does not extend to other places. Frank Agnello's \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 31]\n\u00a0\n house was several blocks distant from Alba's house, where the arrest was made. When it was entered and searched, the conspiracy was ended and the defendants were under arrest and in custody elsewhere. That search cannot be sustained as an incident of the arrests. See Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 40 S. Ct. 182; People v. Conway, 225 Mich. 152, 195 N. W. 679; Gamble v. Keyes, 35 S. D. 645, 650, 153 N. W. 888.\n Under the Harrison Act (section 8 (Comp. St.  6287n), and section 1 as amended by section 1006 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6287g)) it is unlawful for any person, who has not registered and paid a special tax, to have cocaine in his possession, and all unstamped packages of such drug found in his possession are subject to forfeiture. We assume, as contended by the government, that defendants obtained from Frank Agnello's house the cocaine that was taken to Alba's house and there seized; that the can of cocaine which later was found in Agnello's house was unlawfully in his control and subject to seizure; and that it was a part of the cocaine which was the subject-matter of the conspiracy.\n The government cites Carroll v. United States, supra; but it does not support the search and seizure complained of. That case involved the legality of a search of an automobile and the seizure of intoxicating liquors being transported therein in violation of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et. seq.). The search and seizure were made by prohibition agents without a warrant. After reference to various acts of Congress relating to the seizure of contraband goods, the court said (page 153, 45 S. Ct. 285):\n'We have made a somewhat extended reference to these statutes to show that the guaranty of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures by the Fourth Amendment has been construed, practically since the beginning of the government, as recognizing a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house, or other structure in respect of which a proper official warrant readily may be obtained, and a \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 32]\n\u00a0\n search of a ship, motorboat, wagon, or automobile, for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant, because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.'\n\n It was held that:\n'The facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched.' Page 162, 45 S. Ct. 288.\n\n And on that ground the court held the search and seizure without warrant justified.\n While the question has never been directly decided by this court, it has always been assumed that one's house cannot lawfully be searched without a search warrant, except as an incident to a lawful arrest therein. Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 624, et seq., 630, 6 S. Ct. 524; Weeks v. United States, supra, 393; Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, 391; Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 308\n, 41 S. Ct. 261. The protection of the Fourth Amendment extends to all equally-to those justly suspected or accused, as well as to the innocent. The search of a private dwelling without a warrant is in itself unreasonable and abhorrent to our laws. Congress has never passed an act purporting to authorize the search of a house without a warrant. On the other hand, special limitations have been set about the obtaining of search warrants for that purpose. Thus, the National Prohibition Act, approved October 28, 1919, c. 85, tit. 2,  25, 41 Stat. 305, 315 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 m), provides that no search warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as such unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor or is in part used for business purposes, such as store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding house. And later, to the end that government employees without a warrant shall not invade the homes of the people and violate the priva- \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 33]\n\u00a0\n cies of life, Congress made it a criminal offense, punishable by heavy penalties, for any officer, agent or employee of the United States engaged in the enforcement of any law to search a private dwelling house without a warrant directing such search. Act Nov. 23, 1921, c. 134,  6, 42 Stat. 222, 223 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10184a). Safeguards similar to the Fourth Amendment are deemed necessary and have been provided in the constitution or laws of every state of the Union. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n We think there is no state statute authorizing the search of a house without a warrant; and in a number of state laws recently enacted for the enforcement of prohibition in respect of intoxicating liquors, there are provisions similar to those in section 25 of the National Prohibition Act. Save in certain cases as incident to arrest, there is no sanction in the decisions of the courts, federal or state, for the search of a private dwelling house without a warrant. Absence of any judicial approval is persuasive authority that it is unlawful. See Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howard's State Trials, 1030, 1066. Belief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house, furnishes no justification for a search of that place without a warrant. And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause. See Temperani v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 365; United States v. Rembert (D. C.) 284 F. 996, 1000; Connelly v. United States (D. C.) 275 F. 509; McClurg v. Brenton, 123 Iowa, 368, 372, 98 N. W. 881, 65 L. R. A. 519, 101 Am. St. Rep. 323; People v. Margolis, 220 Mich. 431, 190 N. W. 306; Childers v. Commonwealth, 198 Ky. 848, 250 S. W. 106; State v. Warfield, 184 Wis. 56, 198 N. W. 854. The search of Frank Agnello's house and seizure of the can of cocaine violated the Fourth Amendment.\n It is well settled that, when properly invoked, the Fifth Amendment protects every person from incrimination by \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 34]\n\u00a0\n the use of evidence obtained through search or seizure made in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Boyd v. United States, supra, 630 et seq.; Weeks v. United States, supra, 398; Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, 391, 392; Gouled v. United States, supra, 306; Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313, 316\n, 41 S. Ct. 266.\n The government contends that, even if the search and seizure were unlawful, the evidence was admissible because no application on behalf of defendant was made to the court for the return of the can of cocaine. The reason for such application, where required, is that the court will not pause in a criminal case to determine collateral issues as to how the evidence was obtained. See Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585, 594\n, 24 S. Ct. 372, affirming People v. Adams, 176 N. Y. 351, 68 N. E. 636, 63 L. R. A. 406, 98 Am. St. Rep. 675. But, in this case, the facts disclosing that the search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment were not in controversy. They were shown by the examination of the witness called to give the evidence. There was no search warrant, and from the first the position of the government has ben that none was necessary. In substance, Frank Agnello testified that he never had possession of the can of cocaine, and never saw it until it was produced in court. There is nothing to show that, in advance of its offer in evidence, he knew that the government claimed it had searched his house and found cocaine there, or that the prosecutor intended to introduce evidence of any search or seizure. It would be unreasonable to hold that he way bound to apply for the return of an article which he maintained he never had. Where, by uncontroverted facts, it appears that a search and seizure were made in violation of the Fourth Amendment, there is no reason why one whose rights have been so violated, and who is sought to be incriminated by evidence so obtained, may not invoke protection of the Fifth Amendment immediately and without any application for the return of the thing seized. 'A rule of practice must not be allowed for any technical reason to prevail over \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 35]\n\u00a0\n a constitutional right.' Gouled v. United States, supra, 313 (41 S. Ct. 266).\n And the contention that the evidence of the search and seizure was admissible in rebuttal is without merit. In his direct examination, Agnello was not asked and did not testify concerning the can of cocaine. In cross-examination, in answer to a question permitted over his objection, he said he had never seen it. He did nothing to waive his constitutional protection or to justify cross-examination in respect of the evidence claimed to have been obtained by the search. As said in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, 392 (40 S. Ct. 183):\n'The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so aquired shall not be used before the court but that it shall not be used at all.'\n\n The admission of evidence obtained by the search and seizure was error and prejudicial to the substantial rights of Frank Agnello. The judgment against him must be set aside and a new trial awarded.\n But the judgment against the other defendants may stand. The introduction of the evidence of the search and seizure did not transgress their constitutional rights. And it was not prejudicial error against them. The possession by Frank Agnello of the can of cocaine which was seized tended to show guilty knowledge and criminal intent on his part; but it was not submitted as attributable to the other defendants. During the summing up of the case to the jury by the prosecuting attorney, the court distinctly indicated that the evidence was admissible only against Frank Agnello. The other defendants did not request any instruction to the jury in reference to the matter, and they do not contend that any erroneous instruction was given. Isaacs v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 487, 491\n, 16 S. Ct. 51.\n The packages of cocaine seized at Alba's house were carried to that place by Frank Agnello. He did this at the instance of Centorino; and in his behalf it is claimed he acted innocently and without knowledge of the con- \n\n[269 U.S. 20, 36]\n\u00a0\n tents of the package. The evidence of the search and seizure made in his house tended to show that he knew what he was doing and was a willing participant in the conspiracy charged. But, so far as concerns the other defendants, it is immaterial whether he acted innocently and without knowledge of the contents of the package or knowingly to effect the object of the conspiracy.

Co. \n\n[268 U.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Wickersham, of Juneau, Alaska, for McHugh.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below has certified two questions of law concerning which it desires instruction. Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216). The first question follows. Our answer to it renders a reply to the second one unnecessary.\n'(1) Is the owner of a ship, a common carrier engaged in coastwise commerce trade in the territory of Alaska, liable to one of its employes, a stevedore, for damages which have resulted by reason of a defect or insufficiency due to the owner's negligence in an appliance furnished to the employe as provided under sections 1 and 2 of the Act of June 11, 1906, c. 3073, 34 Stat. 232, commonly known as the First Employers' Liability Act?'\n\n The designated statute is entitled An act relating to liability of common carriers in the District of Columbia and territories and common carriers engaged in commerce between the states and between the states and foreign nations, to their employees,' and provides:\n'Section 1. That every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce in the District of Columbia, or in any territory of the United States, or between the several states, or between any territory and another, or between any territory or territories and any state or states, or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any state or states or foreign nations, shall be liable to any of its employees, or, in the case of his death, to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and children, if any, if none, then for his parents, if none, then for his next of kin dependent upon him, for all damages which may result from the negligence of any of its officers, agents, or employees, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due to its negligence \n\n[268 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, ways, or works.\n\n'Sec. 2. That in all actions hereafter brought against any common carriers to recover damages for personal injuries to an employee, or where such injuries have resulted in his death, the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contributory negligence was slight and that of the employer was gross in comparison, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee. All questions of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury.'\n\n'Sec. 3. No contract of employment, insurance, etc., shall constitute a defense to an action brought to recover damages for injuries or death.\n\n'Sec. 4. That no action shall be maintained under this act, unless commenced within one year from the time the cause of action accrued.\n\n'Sec. 5. That nothing in this act shall be held to limit the duty of common carriers by railroads or impair the rights of their employees under the Safety-Appliance Act of March second, eighteen hundred and ninetythree, as amended April first, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, and March second, nineteen hundred and three.'\n\n The Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 \nU.S. 463\n, 28 S. Ct. 141, held that, 'conceding the power of Congress to regulate the relations of employer and employee engaged in interstate commerce, the [ above-quoted] act was unconstitutional in this: That in its provisions regulating interstate commerce Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in undertaking to make employers responsible, not only to employees when engaged in interstate commerce, but to any of its employees, whether engaged in interstate commerce or in commerce wholly within a state.' El Paso & Northeastern Ry. Co. v. Gutierrez, \n215 \nU.S. 87, 93\n, 30 S. Ct. 21. \n\n[268 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n The case last cited declared the act valid and controlling in so far as it relates to the District of Columbia and the territories, although invalid as to accidents within a state. It was there said (page 97, 30 S. Ct. 25):\n'When we consider the purpose of Congress to regulate the liability of employer to employee, and its evident intention to change certain rules of the common law which theretofore prevailed as to the responsibility for negligence in the conduct of the business of transportation, we think that it is apparent that had Congress not undertaken to deal with this relation in the states where it had been regulated by local law, it would have dealt with the subject and enacted the curative provisions of the law applicable to the District of Columbia and the territories over which its plenary power gave it the undoubted right to pass a controlling law, and to make uniform regulations governing the subject.'\n\n This court has never held the act applicable to marine torts. To give it such construction would give rise to a grave constitutional question as to its validity and cause much confusion and uncertainty concerning the reciprocal rights and obligations of ships and those who work upon them. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145; Panama R. R. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 386\n, 390 S., 44 S. Ct. 391. The language employed-'negligence in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, ways or works;' 'actions ... to recover damages for personal injuries;' 'all questions of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury'-and the 'evident intention to change certain rules of the common law which theretofore prevailed as to the responsibility for negligence in the conduct of the business of transportation,' oppose the suggestion that the purpose was to regulate purely maritime matters, from time immemorial subject to the law of the sea, which recognizes and enforces rights and remedies radically different from those of the common law. \n\n[268 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n In the absence of a clear and distinct enunciation of such purpose, we cannot conclude that Congress intended to invade the field of admiralty jurisdiction, and materially after long-recognized rights and established modes of procedure.\n The first question must be answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALPHA PORTLAND CEMENT CO. v. COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS(1925)\nNo. 103\nArgued: October 23, 1924Decided: May 4, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 203, 204]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis H. Porter and F. Carroll Taylor, both of New York City, and John G. Palfrey, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Alexander Lincoln and Jay R. Benton, both of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error claims that the commonwealth illegally exacted of it $800.45 as an excise tax for the year 1921, and $567.57 plus $22.97 interest for 1922. The court below upheld the tax and definitely ruled that it was not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment or the commerce clause of the federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). 244 Mass. 530, 139 N. E. 158; \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 207]\n\u00a0\n 248 Mass. 156, 142 N. E. 762. With negligible exceptions the assessments followed the Corporation Tax Law (Gen. Acts 1919, c. 355), now codified in Gen. Laws, c. 63. Chapters 361 and 493, Gen. Acts 1921, are subsidiary and demand no particular notice. Record No. 327 discloses how the assessments were calculated; also the essential facts hereinafter stated. The opinion in No. 103 discusses the fundamental questions of law; the later one is supplementary and explanatory.\n The statute (G. L. Mass. c. 63,  39) provides that 'every foreign corporation shall pay annually, with respect to the carrying on or doing of business by it within the commonwealth, an excise equal to the sum of ... five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it within the commonwealth' and 'two and one-half per cent. of that part of its net income ... which is derived from business carried on within the commonwealth:' Provided that the total tax shall be not less than an amount equal to one-twentieth of 1 per cent. of such proportion of the fair cash value of its capital stock as its assets employed within the state shall bear to the total assets. Annual returns, and additional information when demanded, must be filed with the commissioner. He is empowered to determine, under prescribed rules, the net portion of income from business within the state; but if dissatisfied any corporation may file 'a statement in such detail as the commissioner shall require, showing the amount of its annual net income derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.' Section 42. Credit for 5 per cent. of dividends paid to inhabitants of the state is authorized. Pertinent portions of the general statute (G. L. Mass. c. 63) are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[268 U.S. 203, 208]\n\u00a0\n We accept the following statements in the opinion below:\n'The petitioner is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey. Its business is the manufacture and sale of cement. Its principal office is at Easton, Pa. Its mills are located in several other states outside of Massachusetts, from which shipments are made to various parts of the United States and to foreign countries. It maintains an office in Boston in charge of a district sales manager, with a clerk, where its correspondence and other natural business activities in connection with the receipt of orders and shipments of goods for the New England states are conducted. The \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 209]\n\u00a0\n office is used as headquarters for travelling salesmen, who solicit orders in Massachusetts and the other New England states. Orders so taken are transmitted at the Boston office by mail to the principal office at Easton, Pa., where exclusively they are passed upon, and if accepted, the goods are shipped and invoices sent directly to the customer. Remittances usually are made to the petitioner at Easton, though in exceptional instances prepayments or collections are made by the salesmen and immediately transmitted to Easton. No samples or other merchandise are kept in this commonwealth. \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 210]\n\u00a0\n The only property of the petitioner in Massachusetts is its office furniture, valued at $573. It maintains no bank account here, its salaries and office rent being paid from its principal office. Incidental expenses are paid from an account not exceeding $1,000 kept by the district sales manager in his own name. No corporate books, records, or meetings are in Massachusetts. There is no controversy as to the facts, valuations or computation of the tax. The issues between the parties relate solely to the correct interpretation of our corporate tax law as to foreign corporations and to the constitutionality of that \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 211]\n\u00a0\n law in its application to the petitioner. ... It is rightly conceded by the Attorney General that the petitioner was engaged in this commonwealth exclusively in interstate commerce.'\n\n Having ascertained the necessary items, the comptroller made the calculations indicated below. The corporation's total net income returned for federal taxation, after allowances, amounted to $707,577.98; $7,602, 090.21 (although not quite accurate) was treated as the total value of intangible assets. \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 212]\n\u00a0\n Amount of Tax Measured by Net Income.\n Average value of tangible property in Massachusetts, $573. Divide this by average value all tangible property $16,992,355.22; multiply resulting fraction by $235,859.33 (one-third of $707,577.98, supra) equals $ 8.02 Wages, salaries, etc., assignable to Massachusetts, $11,493.38. Divide this by amount of all wages, salaries, etc., $1,650,614.73: multiply resulting fraction by $235,859.33 (one-third of $707,577.98, supra) equals 1,642.29 Gross receipts assignable to Massachusetts, $343,204.60. Divide this by gross receipts from all business, $10,717,546.43; multiply resulting fraction by $235,859.33 (one-third of$707,577.98, supra) equals 7,552.22 ___\n Net income $9,202.53 2 1\/2 per cent. of $9,202.53 $230.06 Less 5 per cent. of dividends paid Massachusetts inhabitants 42.15 ___ Total according to income $187.91 Amount of Tax Measured by Corporate Excess. \n Amount of Tax Measured by Corporate Excess.\n Income assigned to Massachusetts, as above shown $9,202.53. Divide this by $707,577.98 (entire apportionable net income); multiply resulting fraction by $7,602,090.21 (used for total intangible assets ). This yields $98,827.17, which was taken as the value of intangible assets assignable to Massachusetts. The tangible assets, $573, were added and $99,400 became the total accepted value of assets assignable to the state.\n Cash value of the company's capital stock was fixed at $16,352,162; all assets, $21,406,098. Divide $99,400 by \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 213]\n\u00a0\n $21,406,098; multiply resulting fraction by $16,352,162; the result is $75,932.08-the 'corporate excess.' Five dollars per thousand upon this is $379.66.\n Total assessment for 1922 ($187.91 plus $379.66), $567.57.\n In the course of its opinion the court below said:\n'This tax law, placing as it does both domestic and foreign corporations on common ground as to taxation except so far as essential differences require different treatment in details, follows the policy established in this commonwealth for many years of levying an excise instead of a property tax on corporate franchises and corporate transaction of business. Eaton, Crane & Pike Co. v. Commonwealth, 237 Mass. 523.\n\n'The general scheme of this tax law is that an excise is levied on both domestic and foreign business corporations doing business in this commonwealth. Real estate and machinery used in manufacture by such corporations alone are subject to a local property tax in the city or town where situated. All other personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is exempt from direct or local taxation. The amount of the excise tax is measured as to a foreign corporation ( section 39) by the sum of 'an amount equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it within the commonwealth,' and 'an amount equal to 2 1\/2 per cent. of that part of its net income, as defined in section thirty and in this section, which is derived from business carried on within this commonwealth,' with a further provision that a minimum tax of not less than one-twentieth of 1 per cent. of such proportion of the fair cash value of its shares of capital stock as its assets employed in business in this commonwealth bear to its total assets employed in business. ... \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 214]\n\u00a0\n 'The statute is an attempt to measure the excise on foreign corporations solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done within this commonwealth. This excise tax is in place of any other tax on personal property within the commonwealth from which, except as to machinery used in manufacture or in supplying and distributing water, foreign corporations (and also domestic corporations) are expressly exempted by G. L. c. 59,  5, cl. 16. ...\n\n'The present tax act imposes the excise with respect to the carrying on of business by foreign corporations within the commonwealth. It is an excise for the privilege of having a place of business under the protection of our laws and with the financial, commercial and other advantages flowing therefrom, measured solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done here by a foreign corporation. The excise is measured by two factors: (1) The value of the corporate excess employed within the commonwealth; and (2) the net income derived from business within the commonwealth.\n\n'1. The value of the corporate excess employed in the commonwealth as a factor of the tax is not measured by the capital stock of the corporation. If it were, it would be invalid. International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n. It is measured by the value of the property of the foreign corporation, including its franchise, employed in the commonwealth, after certain deductions are made. It seems to us that this factor of the tax stands under the protection of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. ...\n\n'It is manifest as matter of common business knowledge that commerce within this commonwealth yielding to the petitioner annual gross receipts of $424,982.70 must have involved credits, bills receivable and obligations to it of considerable amounts. No contention to the contrary \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 215]\n\u00a0\n has been urged by the petitioner. Such credits, bills receivable and obligations might be made subject to direct taxation within the commonwealth by appropriate legislation under numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Such credits, bills receivable and obligations constitute a part of 'the value of the assets' of the petitioner 'employed in ... [its] business within the commonwealth' used as the basis of ascertaining 'the corporate excess' of the petitioner 'employed within the commonwealth' upon which this factor of the excise is calculated. ...\n\n'2. The tax, as measured by the net income from business transacted in Massachusetts as a factor, is dependent upon net profits derived solely from interstate commerce. But there is no discrimination in the statute against interstate commerce. This net income is used as a measure applicable to all corporations alike. While not an income tax according to strict definition, in substance it affects net income alone, is measured by net income alone, is reasonable in amount and incidence, and is payable out of net income. ...\n\n'The tax considered as a whole with both its main factors is general in nature and reasonable in amount. The tax upon the petitioner in substance and effect, so far as concerns the factor of its corporate excess employed within the commonwealth, is levied upon its tangible personal property within the commonwealth, upon the credits due it from debtors within this commonwealth, and upon the exercise of its franchise within this commonwealth, and, so far as concerns the factor of its income, upon the net income derived from business in this commonwealth after all losses and expenses have been paid. It is not directed against interstate commerce or property outside the state but is confined to business done, property located, capital employed and net income earned within the commonwealth. It affects interstate \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 216]\n\u00a0\n commerce indirectly and is not an immediate burden upon it. It affords to the state only a fair and reasonable revenue for the maintenance of the government, the benefits from the protection of which the petitioner enjoys. Our conclusion is that the law thus construed, as applying to a foreign corporation using a part of its property exclusively for interstate commerce within the commonwealth, violates no guaranty established by the Constitution of the United States. The tax statute, therefore, is interpreted as applying to a corporation engaged in business within the commonwealth as is the petitioner.'\n\n Counsel for the commonwealth assert:\n'The present tax law imposes an excise on foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business in Massachusetts under the protection of its laws and with the financial, commercial and other advantages flowing therefrom, measured solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done within the state. Payment of the tax is not made a condition precedent to the doing of business. Collection of the tax is to be made by ordinary methods. There is no discrimination either against foreign corporations or against interstate commerce.' 'The taxes complained of were excises and not property taxes.' 'Being excises these taxes are not taxes on property or net income, but taxes measured by property and net income, used in or derived from business done in Massachusetts.'\n\n See Judson Freight Forwarding Co. v. Commonwealth, 242 Mass. 47, 136 N. E. 375, 27 A. L. R. 1131\n\n\n This view of the nature of the exaction was adopted by the court below, and we think it is the correct one. The right to lay taxes on tangible property or on income is not involved; and the inquiry comes to this: May a state impose upon a foreign corporation which transacts only interstate business within her borders an excise tax measured by a combination of two factors-the proportion of the total value of capital shares attributed to \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 217]\n\u00a0\n transactions therein, and the proportion of net income attributed to such transactions?\n Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 153\n, 154 S., 38 S. Ct. 295, necessitates a negative reply. Under St. 1909, c. 490, pt. 3,  56, the state demanded an excise of a foreign corporation which transacted therein only interstate business. The excise was laid upon the corporation and the basis of it the same as in the present cause. This court said:\n'We think the tax on this company was essentially a tax on doing an interstate business and therefore repugnant to the commerce clause.'\n\n Here also the excise was demanded on account of interstate business. A new method for measuring the tax had been prescribed, but that cannot save the exaction. Any such excise burdens interstate commerce and is therefore invalid without regard to measure or amount. Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 190\n, 38 S. Ct. 85; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135, 142\n, 38 S. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 259\n, 43 S. Ct. 83; Texas Transport & Terminal Co. v. New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S. Ct. 242, 34 A. L. R. 907.\n International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts considered an excise upon a corporation doing both local and interstate business, measured by its capital stock. St. 1909, c. 490; St. 1914, c. 724. Pertinent cases were cited and discussed and the tax declared 'unconstitutional and void as placing a prohibited burden on interstate commerce and laid on property of a foreign corporation located and used beyond the jurisdiction of the state.' Payment as a condition precedent to the doing of any business was not a controlling circumstance. The opinion recognizes the state's right to demand excises of foreign corporations in respect of intrastate business unless the exaction is really as tax on interstate business or property beyond the state. Under this principle certain of the complaining corporations in Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, were properly taxed. Plaintiff in \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 218]\n\u00a0\n error did no local business, and there was no proper foundation for the excise.\n It must now be regarded as settled that a state may not burden interstate commerce or tax property beyond her borders under the guise of regulating or taxing intrastate business. So to burden interstate commerce is prohibited by the commerce clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit taxation of property beyond the state's jurisdiction. The amount demanded is unimportant when there is no legitimate basis for the tax. So far as the language of Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 87\n, 34 S. Ct. 15, tends to support a different view it conflicts with conclusions reached in later opinions and is now definitely disapproved.\n Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 U.S. 275\n, 282, et seq., 39 S. Ct. 276, pointed out the limitations which must be observed when property used in interstate commerce is valued for purposes of taxation by a state. We there declined to follow the rule applied in Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 26\n, 11 S. Ct. 876, and held that determination of real value with fair accuracy is essential. Many methods adapted to that end have been accepted, but this does not tend to support an excise laid upon a foreign corporation on account of interstate transactions.\n The local business of a foreign corporation may support an excise measured in any reasonable way, if neither interstate commerce nor property beyond the state is taxed. Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, 41 S. Ct. 45, approved such an excise measured by income reasonably attributed to intrastate business; but nothing there said was intended to modify well-established principles. It must be read with the essential facts in mind. Local business was a sufficient basis for the excise, and there was no taxation of interstate commerce or property beyond the state. Of course, the opinion does not support the suggestion that the present statute is free from \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 219]\n\u00a0\n the fatal objections, to the former one because payment of the tax is no longer a condition precedent to carrying on any business. It cites approvingly St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 364\n, 35 S. Ct. 99, 59, L. Ed. 265, and there this court said:\n'So far as the commerce clause is concerned, it seems to us that the principles upon whose application the present decision must depend are those set forth in Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 695, where the court, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said: 'It is settled that where by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of interstate commerce, or on the receipts derived therefrom, or on the occupation or business of carrying it on, a tax is levied by a state on interstate commerce, such taxation amounts to a regulation of such commerce and cannot be sustained. But property in a state belonging to a corporation, whether foreign or domestic, engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, may be taxed, or a tax may be imposed on the corporation on account of its property within a state, and may take the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the state, if the ascertainment of the amount is made dependent in fact on the value of its property situated within the state (the exaction, therefore, not being susceptible of exceeding the sum which might be leviable directly thereon), and if payment be not made a condition precedent to the right to carry on the business, but its enforcement left to the ordinary means devised for the collection of taxes.\"\n\n The excise challenged by plaintiff in error is not materially different from the one declared unconstitutional in Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, and cannot be enforced against a foreign corporation which does nothing but interstate business within the state. The introduction of an extremely complicated method for calculating the amount of the exaction does not change its nature or mitigate the burden. \n\n[268 U.S. 203, 220]\n\u00a0\n The decrees of the court below must be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 39.

In a case where only two of the foregoing three rules are applicable, the said remainder of net income of the corporation shall be divided into two equal parts only, each of which shall be apportioned in accordance with one of the remaining two rules. If only one of the three rules is applicable, the part of the net income received from business carried on within the commonwealth shall be determined solely by that rule.\n\n'4. The value of the corporation's tangible property for the purposes of this section shall be the average value of such property during the taxable year.\n\n'5. The amount assignable to this commonwealth of expenditure of the corporation for wages, salaries, commissions or other compensation to its employees shall be such expenditure for the taxable year as represents the compensation of employees not chiefly situated at, connected with or sent out from premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the corporation outside the commonwealth.\n\n'6. The amount of the corporation's gross receipts from business assignable to this commonwealth shall be the amount of its gross receipts for the taxable year from (a) sales, except those negotiated or effected in behalf of the corporation by agents or agencies chiefly situated at, connected with or sent out from premises for the transaction of business owned or rented by the corporation outside the \n\n commonwealth and sales otherwise determined by the commissioner to be attributable to the business conducted on such premises, (b) rentals or royalties from property situated, or from the use of patents, within the commonwealth: Provided, that upon application by a corporation which owns or controls substantially all the capital stock of another corporation, or by the corporation so owned or controlled, the commissioner may impose the tax provided for by this chapter upon the income of the two corporations jointly in the same manner as though they were a single corporation, or may, in such other manner as he shall determine, equitably adjust the tax of the applying corporation. ...\n'9. A rule shall not be deemed to be inapplicable merely because all the tangible property or the expenditure of a corporation for wages, salaries, commissions or other compensation, or the gross receipts of the corporation, are found to be situated, incurred, or received without the commonwealth.'\n\n'Section 75. In addition to the methods provided by sections seventy- two and seventy-three [distraint or action in contract], taxes under this chapter, except section sixty-two [not involved], may be collected by an information brought in the Supreme Judicial Court by the attorney general at the relation of the state treasurer.

Alston, both of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit against the petitioning Express Company for the value of a parcel that was received by the Company for carriage but was not delivered. The Company admitted liability for fifty dollars but alleged that it could not be held for more, because the receipt that it gave fixed that sum as the value of the goods and a higher value would have required the payment of a higher rate. Under the ruling of the Court of verdict was found against the petitioner for a hundred dollars, interest and costs, subject to questions of law reserved, and judgment on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, without opinion, by an evenly divided Court.\n The goods were delivered by an agent and after conversation between him and the agent of the Express Company the latter put fifty dollars into the receipt as the value, neither party having any clear knowledge, and the receipt later was handed to and bound the sender of the goods. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n232 \nU.S. 508, 514\n, 34 S. Ct. 380. The rate for carriage of property valued at more than fifty dollars was higher than that charged. The schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission were offered, to show the rates, but were excluded, and the judgment was affirmed seemingly on the ground that the sending agent was not shown to have known that a lower valuation secured a lower rate, and that the car- \n\n[269 U.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n rier knew that the agent was ignorant of the true value of the goods. No argument is made for the respondent and it is plain that the judgment cannot be sustained. The carrier's knowledge of the agent's ignorance of the value was immaterial. It acted in good faith. The carrier's schedules should have been admitted and bound both parties. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 652\n, 653 S., 33 S. Ct. 391; Southern Express Co. v.

CLUNE(1925)\nNo. 331\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Burgess W. Marshall, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1872, A. K. Johnson, an honorably discharged soldier of the Civil War, made a homestead entry of 80 acres. He died in 1875 leaving a widow, who died in 1917, neither having disposed of the husband's additional homestead right. Johnson also left four children, all over the age of 21 years at the date of the death of the widow; and they, together with the widow of a deceased son, sold and as \n\n[269 U.S. 140, 141]\n\u00a0\n signed the right to one Mason who sold and assigned it to the extent of 20. 49 acres to Clune. By virtue of the latter assignment, Clune entered a tract of public lands in the United States Land Office in California; but the entry was rejected by the General Land Office on the ground that 'the assignment of the soldier's additional homestead right had not been made by the soldier or his widow or his heirs prior to the administrative ruling of the Department, of the Interior terior February 15, 1917 (46 L. D. 32), and rulings and decisions of the Land Office, which construed sections 2306 and 2307 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4594, 4602), as limiting a soldier's additional homestead right to the exercise thereof ( 1) by the soldier himself entering the land, or indirectly by conveying his right to entry to an assignee during his lifetime; (2) by the widow while her status as widow of the soldier continued; (3) in the absence of appropriation by the soldier or his widow, then by the minor orphan children during their minority acting through their guardian.' In October, 1923, Anderson entered the lands in controversy under an assignment of the additional soldier's homestead right of one Dunn, and patent issued to him therefor. Anderson's entry was made with full knowledge that Clune had made prior entry thereof, under which he was claiming the land. Alleging these facts, suit was brought by Clune against Anderson to have it adjudged that the latter held the lands in trust for the former. The trial court overruled a motion to dismiss the bill and rendered a decree in favor of Clune. An appeal followed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court has certified (Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216)) the following question upon which instruction is desired:\n'Under the Revised Statutes of the United States, sections 2306 and 2307, is a soldier's additional homestead right limited to the exercise thereof by the soldier himself entering the land, or indirectly by transfer of his right to an assignee during his lifetime, and to his widow while \n\n[269 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n her status as widow of the soldier continues, and in the absence of the appropriation by the soldier or his widow during their lives, then by his minor orphan children during their minority acting through a guardian?'\n\n By section 2304, R. S. (Comp. St.  4592), Johnson was given the right to enter and receive patent for 160 acres of public lands subject to homestead entry. Having entered only 80 acres, he became entitled to the benefits conferred by section 2306, R. S., which provides that every person entitled under the provisions of section 2304 to enter a homestead, who may have entered a quantity of land less than 160 acres, 'shall be permitted to enter so much land as, when added to the quantity previously entered, shall not exceed one hundred and sixty acres.' Section 2307, R. S ., provides:\n'In case of the death of any person who would be entitled to a homestead under the provisions of section twenty-three hundred and four, his widow, if unmarried, or in case of her death or marriage, then his minor orphan children, by a guardian duly appointed and officially accredited at the Department of the Interior, shall be entitled to all the benefits enumerated in this chapter, subject to all the provisions as to settlement and improvements therein contained. ...'\n\n It was held in Webster v. Luther, \n163 \nU.S. 331\n, 16 S. Ct. 963, that Congress intended by section 2306, R. S., to vest a property right in the donee as a sort of compensation for his failure under section 2304 to obtain the full quota of 160 acres; that residence on or cultivation of the lands to be taken was not required as in the case of the original homestead entry; and that it was immaterial to the government whether the original donee should exercise the right or should transfer it to another; and the property right thus vested was held to be assignable. The rulings of the Land Office prior to this decision had been that the right was essentially personal and nonassignable, to be exercised only by the original donee or his widow or his minor orphan children \n\n[269 U.S. 140, 143]\n\u00a0\n through a guardian. After the decisions, the rulings of the department were uniformly to the effect that the right not only was assignable, but inheritable; that, in case a soldier entitled to the right died without exercising it, leaving no widow or minor orphan children, the right to entry vested in his personal representatives (Williford Jenkins, 29 L. D. 510; Fidelo C. Sharp, 35 L. D. 164, and other cases); but, if the right passed to the minor children, it became absolute in them, in no way conditioned upon an appropriation by the guardian during their minority ( John H. Mason, 41 L. D. 361).\n This view was adhered to until 1917, when Secretary of the Interior by an administrative ruling held that the right must be used by the soldier in his lifetime, either by entering the land or assigning the right, or by the widow while her status as such continued, or by the minor orphan children during their minority, acting through their lawful guardian, and that, if not exercised as thus indicated, the right lapsed and ceased to exist. The officers of the Land Department were expressly instructed that no soldier's additional right assigned by the heirs or administrator of the estate of a deceased soldier or of his widow, or of his minor orphan children, or directly by such 'minor children,' after they had reached majority, should be recognized as a basis for the entry of public land. 46 L. D. 32. In a subsequent letter reviewing these instructions (46 L. D. 274, 275), the Secretary of the Interior said:\n'The benefit of section 2306, indeed, is not before its acceptance property at all, and hence is not capable of inheritance. It is a mere offer, which upon its acceptance by a designated beneficiary during his term of qualification as such becomes property, and convertible into specific land by entry under it.'\n\n This is plainly in the face of the decision of this Court in Webster v. Luther, supra. See, also, Mullen v. Wine (C. C.) 26 F. 206; Barnes v. Poirier, 64 F. 14, 18, 12 C. C. A. 9. The grant of \n\n[269 U.S. 140, 144]\n\u00a0\n the statute (section 2306), ipso jure, vests a property right in the donee which he may exercise or sell and transfer. A property right, the ownership of which may be conveyed to and vested in a purchaser, must be accorded the quality of inheritability, which usually attaches as an incident of ownership, in the absence of some provision of law to the contrary; and we therefore hold that the soldier's additional homestead right, if not exercised or transferred by the donee, passes to his estate as other property, subject only to the exercise of the rights given by section 2307 to the widow and minor orphan children.\n The question certified is answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARKANSAS v. ST. LOUIS-SAN FRANCISCO RY. CO.(1925)\nNo. 74\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Horace Sloan, of Jonesboro, Ark., and J. S. Utley, of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[269 U.S. 172, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas B. Pryor, of Ft. Smith, Ark., Gordon Frierson, of Jonesboro, Ark., Wm. J. Orr, of Springfield, Mo., Edward L. Westbrooke, of Jonesboro, Ark., and Edward T. Miller, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Two separate suits, consolidated in the trial court, were brought by plaintiff in error in the chancery court for the Western district of Craighead county, Ark., pursuant to statute (section 10204 et seq. of Crawford & Moses' Digest), to recover from the defendants overdue county taxes assessed against them for the years 1921 and 1922\n\n\n The assessments in question purport to have been made in compliance with a peremptory writ of mandamus issued by the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. The Maccabees, an incorporated fraternal order, relator in the mandamus proceeding, had previously recovered judgment against Craighead county on certain county warrants in the United States District Court; jurisdiction having been invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship. The mandamus proceeding, which was brought in aid of the judgment, resulted in an order directing the tax officials having jurisdiction in the premises 'to assess, at its full value in money, all property in Craighead county, and to continue said assessment at its full value in money until the judgment of the plaintiff ... shall have been paid in full; and it appearing that the property in said county has heretofore been assessed at not exceeding 50 per cent. of its assessed value, it is ordered that said mandamus require that the total assessment made hereunder shall be at least double the amount of the total assessment heretofore made.' The respondents, in what purported to be a compliance with the mandamus order, assessed all the property in Craighead county, for all taxes except the general county tax, at the old valuation of 50 per cent.; but for the general county tax, out of which the judgment of the Maccabees \n\n[269 U.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n was to be paid, they made a separate assessment on all property at a valuation of 100 per cent.\n In the chancery court the defendants contested the validity of the assessment, and judgment was entered for only one-half of the tax assessed against them for general county purposes. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that no tax could be lawfully assessed for those purposes upon a valuation in excess of the 50 per cent. valuation on which the assessment for other taxing purposes was based, and affirmed the judgment below. 162 Ark. 443, 258 S. W. 609, 259 S. W. 415.\n The plaintiff in error invokes the jurisdiction of this court under Judicial Code,  237 (Comp. St.  1214), alleging that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has drawn in question the validity of an authority exercised under the United States and has decided against its validity, in refusing to enforce the collection of overdue taxes upon an assessment ordered by the federal court, and assigns as error that in so doing the state court has refused to give effect to the judgment and mandamus of the District Court, in contravention of the judicial power granted to the federal courts by article 3 of the Constitution, and acts of Congress pursuant to it, and in contravention of clause 2 of article 6 (making the Constitution and laws of the United States the supreme law of the land).\n In holding invalid the assessment as made for general county purposes, the Supreme Court of Arkansas disclaimed any purpose to attack collaterally the judgment of the United States District Court, or to deny its full force and effect as rendered. It rested its decision on the narrow ground that the assessment upon the property of defendants in error was not made on a valuation uniform within Craighead county for all purposes of taxation, state, county, municipal, and school, as required by the state Constitution (article 16, section 5; Hays v. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., 159 Ark. 101, 250 S. W. 879), and that as made the \n\n[269 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n assessment did not comply with the judgment of mandamus, which specifically required the tax officials to assess at full value all property in Craighead county. Since the court deemed that the assessment complied neither with the requirements of the Constitution nor with the directions of the judgment of the District Court, it held that there was no denial of the authority of the judgment in holding the assessment invalid under the state Constitution.\n If the mandamus order had in terms directed the assessment to be made as it was in fact made by the taxing officials, or if the assessment had been held to be invalid on the ground that, although made as directed, it was not uniform with the valuation employed in other counties of the state, questions would have been presented which are not raised by this record. We might then have had to consider whether the determination of the state court did not, in effect, attack collaterally the judgment of the District Court and deny its authority, even though that judgment rested on a different view of the state Constitution than that adopted by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. See United States ex rel. v. Jimmerson, 222 F. 489, 138 C. C. A. 85, L. R. A. 1918B, 1102, and United States ex rel. v. Cargill (C. C. A.) 263 F. 856.\n These are questions which we are not called upon to decide here; for we find no necessary conflict between the mandamus order of the District Court and the Constitution of the state as interpreted and applied to the assessment by the state Supreme Court. The District Court undoubtedly had jurisdiction to compel the assessing officers of the county to levy a tax for the purpose of securing satisfaction of its judgment. Memphis v. Brown, \n97 U.S. 300\n; United States ex rel. Concord Sav. Bank v. Fort Scott, \n99 U.S. 152\n. For that purpose it had jurisdiction to determine what form of assessment would accord with the laws and \n\n[269 U.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the state of Arkansas and to prescribe the manner in which the assessments should be levied. Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall, 166; Prout v. Starr, \n188 \nU.S. 537\n, 23 S. Ct. 398.\n But in directing the assessment to be made within the county on the basis of a uniform valuation, the judgment did not specify the mode of assessment for different tax purposes; it did not direct that the assessment at an increased valuation should be made only for county taxation. Being silent with respect to these details, it must be taken to direct an assessment within the county at full valuation, in accordance with the laws of the state, leaving to be determined, by proceedings appropriately had in either the district court or the state court, the question whether the assessment actually made complied with those laws. No proceedings were had to secure a modification of the judgment of the District Court, so that it would direct the assessment to be made in the mode actually employed, or to compel an assessment on a uniform valuation for all tax purposes, on the theory that such uniformity was required by the state law, and in the view, which we adopt, that the judgment required an assessment to be made within the county according to that law.\n In that situation we do not find any basis for the contention that the authority of the judgment of the District Court was denied or its validity questioned by the determination of the state court that the assessment as made within the county was invalid. The mandamus not having prescribed the particular method of assessing the tax, the state court was left free to determine whether the assessment was made according to law, and in so doing it did not determine any matter which had been adjudicated by the District Court or refused to give full effect to its judgment.\n The writ of error is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T. & S.

Davis, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the United States to recover penalties for alleged violation of the Hours of Service Act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939,  2 (34 Stat. 1415 (Comp. St.  8678)). The case was tried by a Judge under a stipulation waiving a jury. Rev. St.  649, 700 (Comp. St .  1587, 1668). He found the defendant railroad company liable, subject to an exception to his refusal to rule that there was no evidence to warrant a recovery. The facts were not in dispute and the decision turned on the Judge's view of the law. 298 F. 549. His judgment was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 3 F. (2d) 138. The material part of the statute is:\n'That no operator, train dispatcher, or other employee who by the use of the telegraph or telephone dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements shall be required or permitted to be or remain on duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period in all towers, officers, places, and stations continuously operated night and day.'\n\n Two yardmasters were kept on duty for twelve hours each, by the railroad company in its Corwith Yard, Chicago, and the question is whether upon the statement of their duties they fell within the Act, bearing in mind that 'the purpose of the statute is to promote safety in operating trains by preventing the excessive mental and physical strain which usually results from remaining too \n\n[269 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n long at an exacting task. Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 197, 199\n, 200 S., 38 S. Ct. 442, 443 (62 L. Ed. 1066).\n The Corwith Yard lies to the South of the defendant's road, which runs East and West. Between the yard and the road, and parallel to the latter, runs the road of the Chicago & Alton Railroad, which must be crossed by cars coming from or going to the defendant's tracks to or from the yard. These crossings are controlled from a tower on the Chicago & Alton's line. When cars of either road seek to enter the yard the tower man generally telephones to the yardmaster to find out whether he is in condition to receive them, and when cars are to go out the yardmaster telephones to the tower man to know if they can pass; but the yardmaster has no authority over the tower man and his telephone either way is not conclusive of the tower man's action. Conversely the tower man has no authority over him.\n The yardmaster's duties extend to the breaking up and making up of trains, the prompt movement of cars, and general charge of the yard. The telephoning, although a part of them, was an incidental part only, and a small one. Twenty-four calls a day seems a too liberal estimate. The messages were not orders, although they generally would govern the decision of the tower man. His decision was not obedience to any authority of or represented by the yardmaster. The movements that the messages affected were not of the kind that require the greatest solicitude, even when they were train movements, which, of course, was not always the case. The office hardly could be described as 'continuously operated,' when the yardmaster was not in it much more than half the time, but was about the yard attending to other things. Taking all the facts into account we are of opinion that the employment of the yardmaster for more than nine hours was not within the evil at which the statute was aimed and that the ruling to the contrary was wrong.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAUSTIN NICHOLS & CO. v.

They present the same issues and were heard on the same proof. It will suffice to refer to the facts disclosed in number 199.\n December 21, 1917, in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, Austin Nichols & Co., a corporation, filed a libel and complaint against the respondent steamship.\n It alleged: Ownership of the damaged merchandise. Presence of the vessel within the court's jurisdiction. That 'on October 27, 1917, Rowlett Y. Pyman shipped and placed on board the steamship Isla de Panay, then lying at the port of Cadiz, Spain, 227 packages of olives in good order and condition, to be carried by the said steamship Isla de Panay as a common carrier from the port of Cadiz to the port of New York, and there to be delivered in like good order and condition as when shipped to your libelant, in accordance with the terms of bills of lading then and there issued for the said shipment and in consideration of an agreed freight. Thereafter the said steamship Isla de Panay sailed from the port of Cadiz and arrived at the port of New York in the month of November, 1917, and there discharged her cargo, not in like good order and condition as when shipped, but badly damaged.' Con- \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 266]\n\u00a0\n sequent damages amounting to about $11,000.\n It prayed: For process according to the course and practice in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to issue against the steamship, her engines, boilers, etc. That a decree be granted for the damage sustained, and the steamer condemned and sold to satisfy the same.\n The Compania Trasatlantica claimed the vessel as sole owner, obtained her release, and answered, denying liability. It admitted receipt of the goods and alleged their carriage and delivery as required by the bills of lading. It specifically admitted and alleged: 'That on or about the 6th day of November, 1917, there were shipped on board the steamship Isla de Panay, then at the port of Cadiz, Spain, and bound for the port of New York, 227 casks said to contain olives; the weight and contents of said casks and their quality, however, being stated to be unknown to the claimant, which expressly declined to be responsible therefor. ... That it was agreed that the merchandise should be transported for a stipulated freight to the port of New York and there be delivered to the order of the libelant, subject to the conditions and exceptions from liability contained in the bills of lading issued for said merchandise at Seville, Spain, from which port said merchandise was shipped in the first instance . ... That thereafter the steamship Isla de Panay sailed from the port of Cadiz, Spain, and arrived in due course at the port of New York in the month of November, 1917, and that it thereafter delivered at the port of New York all of the above mentioned merchandise which it received on board the ship at Cadiz in pursuance of and in compliance with the terms and conditions of the bills of lading hereinabove referred to.' That the bills of lading expressly exempted the vessel from responsibility for damage resulting from breakage of the articles and fragile containers. The ship was in all respects seaworthy, \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 267]\n\u00a0\n properly manned, equipped, and supplied for the voyage. If the merchandise suffered loss or damage, the ship was relieved from liability by the bills of lading, particularly that clause concerning breakage and fragile containers; also by the Harter Act, approved February 13, 1893. 27 Stat. 445, 446, c. 105 (Comp. St.  8029-8035).\n Upon the indicated issues evidence was taken and the cause went to hearing.\n The agent of the owner of the Isla de Panay stationed at Seville, Spain, there accepted the casks of olives (each of them weighed 1,500 pounds of more) and delivered to the consignors bills of lading. These recited:\n'M. Rowlett & Pyman has shipped on board the Spanish steamer Isla de Panay, its captain M_____, with destination to New York and consigned to Austin Nichols, the effects declared on back on the following conditions, ... gnoring weight and contents.'\n\n They said nothing concerning order or condition of the merchandise and contained exemption clauses as stated in the answer.\n The casks were carried down the river Guadalquivir 75 miles to Cadiz, on a small steamer belonging to the owner of the Isla de Panay, and were there delivered to her. They were loaded, stored, transported and landed at New York without negligence or default by the vessel; but the casks broke and the olives were damaged. That the casks were old, weak, and quite liable to break was observed by the owner's agent at Seville, and because of this he declined to accept them until the shippers gave the following agreement to secure against loss:\n'Sevilla, November 5, 1917\n\n\n\n'Compania Trasatlantica, Sevilla-My Dear Sirs: With reference to the shipment of 227 casks of olives that we are making by the steamer Isla de Panay to New York, we understand that that company considers the containers insufficient and that it does not \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 268]\n\u00a0\n accept responsibility for the damages that they suffer as natural consequences of the voyage, and as guarantee of that company we sign the present, as you have delivered us clean bills of lading.\n\n'Yours very truly, Rowlett & Pyman.'\n\n The captain of the Isla de Panay did not see the bills, nor did he know of the letter of guaranty until after the voyage had been completed. He observed the bad condition of the casks before accepting them at Cadiz, and their imperfection was noted on the accompanying shipping orders.\n It appears that Austin Nichols & Co. had directed their bankers at Seville to pay the agreed purchase price for the olives upon presentation of clean bills of lading. The bankers accepted the bills presently under consideration and paid the stipulated price to the consignors. There is nothing to show that the ship or her owner knew of the particular arrangement between buyer and seller.\n Libelants now insist that a trade usage prevailed at Seville under which bills without notation were regarded as receipts for merchandise in apparent good order and condition, and to establish this usage they rely upon an answer in the testimony of the vessel's captain. When asked by respondents' counsel, 'Why are these letters of guaranty given in Seville?' he replied:\n'If the bills of lading are issued with a note on them, the insurance companies or the bankers in Spain will not accept that bill of lading on account of the condition in which the goods are; but if they have no clause on it they will pass it to a banking house and the insurance company that they have been shipped by the shipper in apparent good order and condition, although they have issued a letter of guaranty relieving the company of any responsibility whatsoever for the condition of the packages.'\n\n Eduardo Benjumea, the owner's agent at Seville, who issued the bills, testified: \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 269]\n\u00a0\n 'In view of the above, and as was usually done in such cases, according to custom and at the request of the shippers, in order that their goods might not be prejudiced more than was necessary, and at the same time to relieve the company which I represent from responsibility, I ordered the acceptance of the letters of guaranty. ... The custom of demanding letters of guaranty by steamship companies from shippers, to protect themselves from possible claims for the arrival in bad condition of the shippers' goods at the port of destination, is old and well established and based on the following: (1) The decided opposition on the part of the shippers to notations being placed on the bills of lading which unnecessarily prejudices their goods and leaves everything to the good faith of the receivers. (2) Due to the general character that would necessarily have had to be given to the notations on the bills of lading, and it being practically impossible to examine carefully all the casks one by one both on account of economy and fixed dates on which the mail boats of the Compania Trasatlantica had to depart from Cadiz for the states. We could make, with such notations, greater damage than would be justifiable, which, considering the honorable practices of the Compania Trasatlantica, we naturally tried to avoid. (3) Although letters of guaranty were always requested for the above stated reasons, an exceptional use of these letters was made during the European war, as a consequence of the general bad quality of the packing, which, during that time, was presented for shipment. This bad quality of the packing was due to the lack of containers in good condition and an enormous demand for containers of this class which it was impossible to meet. What took place was the use of all available containers notwithstanding their sometimes inferior quality; that is, chestnut wood was accepted in place of oak in spite of the fact that old oak containers are stronger than new ones of chestnut. I \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 270]\n\u00a0\n have been 16 years in the shipping business as shipping agent, and have had a great experience in matters thereto pertaining, derived from the years so spent.'\n The District Court dismissed the libel. It said:\n'The great weight of evidence is to the effect that the chestnut casks containing the olives were old and insufficient at the time the merchandise left Seville for transshipment to claimant's vessel at Cadiz. ... The libelants paid drafts accompanying the bills of lading without knowledge that the containers were old and insufficient. If there is any liability here for damages it is upon the theory that by failing to note in the bills of lading any insufficiency in the containers, the steamship misled the libelants in their injury and is now estopped under the doctrine of Higgins v. Anglo-Algerian Steamship Co., 248 F. 386, 160 C. C. A. 396, to claim that the containers were insufficient. In that case, however, there was in the bill of lading an express representation that the merchandise itself was in apparent good order and condition, when it was known to be injured by rain water. Here the parties believed doubtless that the olives would go through, but the ship's agents were not willing to take the risk of any liability which might arise from old casks. No case has gone so far as to hold that a bill of lading containing no words representing the condition of the containers would give rise to an estoppel. The Harter Act expressly provides that the vessel shall not be liable for any 'insufficiency of package.\"\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree of dismissal. Having pointed out that the proceedings were in rem against the vessel and not in personam against the owner; that the libel alleged the merchandise was placed on board 'in good order and condition,' and was not discharged 'in like good order and condition'; that the bills were not signed by the captain; that the containers were weak when received, etc.-that court expressed inability \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 271]\n\u00a0\n to discover any ground upon which the libel could be sustained. It found:\n'In the instant cases the damage to the merchandise came within the exemptions of the bill of lading, which declared that the shipowners were not responsible for breakage. That many of the casks were broken is undisputed. The burden of proof rested upon the libelants to establish negligence on the part of the claimant, and this burden we have no hesitation in saying was not sustained. On the contrary, it has been established by the over-whelming weight of evidence that whatever damage the merchandise suffered in the cases now before the court was due, not to the negligence of the ship, but to the old and insufficient containers in which the goods were shipped.'\n\n And it held that the ship was not estopped to set up the bad condition of the casks by anything done at Seville or under the Harter Act, and that Higgins v. Anglo-Algerian S. S. Co., 248 F. 386, 160 C. C. A. 396, was not controlling.\n Counsel for petitioners maintain: That with corrupt purpose, and as part of a scheme to defraud petitioners, the ship issued bills of lading designed to conceal the bad condition of the casks, knowing that the shippers intended to obtain money upon them according to the local usage. That under the Seville usage bills of lading without notations impliedly acknowledged receipt of the merchandise in apparent good order and condition, and the ship could not repudiate this representation. That, considering this local trade usage, it was the positive duty of the ship to disclose the bad condition of the casks. Failure therein made the fraud upon petitioners possible, and 'where one of two innocent parties must suffer he must bear the loss whose act put it into the power of the third party to commit the wrong.' That section 4 of the Harter Act (Comp. St.  8032) imposed the positive duty to disclose the containers' bad condition. And, finally, that the doctrine approved in Higgins v. Anglo-Algerian S. S. Co. is applicable and controlling. \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 272]\n\u00a0\n Evidently the libels were drafted with the expectation of showing that the merchandise suffered damage from bad handling. Petitioners' witnesses testified that the casks reached New York in good condition but were negligently unloaded. The manager for Austin Nichols & Co. said:\n'The casks were satisfactory containers.'\n\n'I do not claim that the casks were bad.' 'Our claim is that these casks were handled in a bad way, by bad methods.' 'I do not make any claim about the casks, but we are making a claim about the manner in which they were handled.'\n\n The courts below, correctly, we think, have found that the overwhelming weight of evidence shows the casks were in bad condition when received at Cadiz, but were loaded, carried, and discharged without negligence or fault.\n Petitioners did not allege fraud or any peculiar trade usage at Seville, and there is no sufficient evidence to establish either of these things. The mere statement by the ship's captain referred to above is not enough to show a peculiar trade usage at Seville, there commonly known and acted upon, and it does not appear that the bank which accepted the bills of lading lacked full information concerning the circumstances attending their issue. The argument of counsel proceeds mostly upon assumption not supported by the record. Bowling v. Harrison, 6 How. 248, 259; Adams v. Otterback, 15 How. 539, 545, 546; Oelricks v. Ford, 23 How. 49, 61, 62. And see Carver on Carriage of Goods by Sea (6th Ed.)  181 et seq.\n The Harter Act provides:\n'Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the owner or owners, masters, or agent of any vessel transporting merchandise or property from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports to issue to shippers of any lawful merchandise a bill of lading, or shipping document, stating, among other things, the marks necessary for identification, number of packages, or quantity, stating whether \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 273]\n\u00a0\n it be carrier's or shipper's weight, and apparent order or condition of such merchandise or property delivered to and received by the owner, master, or agent of the vessel for transportation, and such document shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt of the merchandise therein described.\n\n'Sec. 5. For a violation of any of the provisions of this act the agent, owner, or master of the vessel guilty of such violation, and who refuses to issue on demand the bill of lading herein provided for, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars. ...'\n\n Comp. St.  8032, 8033.\n In the present case the bills of lading were issued as agreed by the parties; no demand was made for bills with different recitals. According to the long-established rule, bills like those before us do not affirmatively represent good order and condition (Atchison, Topeka & S. F. Ry. v. Harold, \n241 \nU.S. 371\n, 36 S. Ct. 665), and we find nothing in the Harter Act which requires that they be given a different effect, either through construction or by estoppel.\n Higgins v. Anglo-Algerian S. S. Co., supra, is essentially different from the present cause. There the bill of lading expressly recited that the merchandise had been received in good order and condition, and the ship was seeking to escape liability by setting up its own wrongful action.\n The decrees below must be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n I am unable to agree with the opinion just delivered. It seems to be conceded, but in any event I think it must be conceded, that if the bills of lading had contained a recital that the merchandise was received in good condition the ship would have been estopped from asserting that in fact it was in bad condition. Higgins v. Anglo-Algerian S. S. Co., 248 Fed. 386, 160 C. C. A. 396. Here, I think, the circumstances are such as to make the omission of a recital \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 274]\n\u00a0\n upon the subject the equivalent of a statement of good condition.\n The shipment was accepted and the bills of lading issued by the ship's agent,1 who testified that he was aware of the bad condition of the merchandise and that the letters of guaranty were taken with the understanding that no notation to that effect would be made on the bills. They were what are known as 'clean bills,' which meant, in this case at least, according to the evidence, bills which 'a banker will accept and attach to a draft and on which he will make payment against a letter of credit, and which indicates that the merchandise was in good condition when it was received from [by] the steamship company.' Without going into detail, I think it is fairly to be deduced from the evidence that the usages of the trade required a notation, and the evidence is clear that a notation of bad condition would have been made except for the letters of guaranty. The master of the Panay testified:\n'If a letter of guaranty is given me relieving me or the ship of all responsibility, as was done \n\n[267 U.S. 260, 275]\n\u00a0\n in this case, no notation will be put on the bill of lading, but if there is no letter of guaranty given, then a notation will be put on the bill of lading.'\n\n Consignees had instructed their bankers in Spain to pay the purchase price of the goods only upon presentation of clean bills of lading, and there is evidence to the effect that if bills are issued with a notation of bad condition they will not be accepted by insurance companies or bankers in Spain, but if such note be omitted they will pass, upon the assumption that the goods have been shipped in apparent good order and condition. Upon this assumption, the bills were passed and payment made. Under these circumstances, the omission of the notation in respect of the condition of the goods was nothing short of a suppression of the truth in order to further the fraudulent designs of the shippers. Upon every principle of fair dealing it should be regarded as the equivalent of a false notation of good condition which the ship is estopped to deny as against the claims of the consignees who relied upon it. To hold otherwise is to permit the wrongdoer to take advantage of his own misconduct, which a court of admiralty cannot allow with due regard for those equitable principles by which it is governed.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 4 of the Harter Act makes it the duty of the owner, master or agent of the vessel to issue a bill of lading. The bills of lading recite that the merchandise in question has been shipped on 'the Spanish steamer Isla de Panay' and purport to be issued by the 'agent of the steamer.' The agent at Seville, who issued the bills, in one place calls himself an agent of the company, and in another place speaks of 'this agency for the S. S. Isla de Panay.' The fact is that the question of agency was not seriously in issue in the trial court, and the statements in the evidence relating thereto were more or less casual, but enough appears to make it clear to my mind that the relation of agent to the ship was fairly established. A point is made of the fact that the bills of lading were delivered at Seville while the merchandise was delivered to the Panay at Cadiz. But delivery of the merchandise at Seville to the small steamer belonging to the same owner, for the sole purpose of transshipment, was in effect a delivery to the Panay. Bulkley v.

CITY OF PARKERSBURG(1925)\nNo. 305\nArgued: March 19, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 35, 36]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank W. Nesbitt, of Wheeling, W. Va., and J. W. Vandervort, of Parkersburg, W. Va., for appellant.\n Messrs. R. B. McDougle and F. P. Moats, both of Parkersburg, W. Va., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of West Virginia in 1894. The plaintiff is the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, alleged to be a Maryland corporation; the defendant is the city of Parkersburg, a West Virginia corporation. The relief sought was to enjoin the levying of taxes assessed upon certain railroad property. The federal jurisdiction was invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship. A temporary injunction issued upon the filing of the bill. In 1895 the case was heard upon demurrer to the bill and upon a motion to dissolve the injunction. In 1897 a decree was entered, which overruled the demurrer, but made no order respecting the injunction. Within 30 days thereafter an answer was filed by leave. Then the cause stood without further action for 23 years. In 1921 activities were resumed leisurely. In 1923, upon demurrers and motions, the District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia (to which the case had been transferred pursuant to section 290 of the Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1267]) entered a final decree for the plaintiff. The decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. City of Parkersburg v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 296 F. 74. The railroad appealed to this court. It also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the appeal.\n The decision in both lower courts was rendered on the merits. These we have no occasion to consider. There is no right of appeal to this court, because the jurisdiction of the trial court was invoked solely on the ground \n\n[268 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n of diversity of citizenship. Judicial Code,  128 (Comp. St.  1120). The writ of certiorari is granted. But, as the bill does not show that the trial court had jurisdiction of the controversy, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed with directions to remand the cause to the District Court.\n The claim asserted by the bill is this. In 1855 the Northwestern Virginia Railroad Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia, acquired from the town of Parkersburg, an exemption from, or commutation of, municipal taxes on certain property within its limits. In 1863 the railroad and the municipality became domestic corporations of West Virginia, upon the organization of that state. In 1865 the property and franchises of the railroad were purchased by the Baltimore & Ohio at a foreclosure sale. Pursuant to the statutes of West Virginia then in force, the Baltimore & Ohio declared 'that it would become a corporation as to said property, by the name of the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company.' The immunity from taxation asserted in the bill was claimed as an incident of the property acquired on foreclosure, and also as having been conferred by ordinances adopted, and contracts made with the Parkersburg Branch Railroad. The levy seems to have been made upon property of that company. It was a West Virginia corporation. \n1\n The bill sought to enforce its right. The capacity in which the Baltimore & Ohio sued to enforce the right to immunity was not stated clearly in the bill. Apparently it sued either in its capacity as \n\n[268 U.S. 35, 38]\n\u00a0\n owner (sole stockholder) of the West Virginia corporation or on the theory that, as to the property purchased on foreclosure, it became itself the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company. In neither view did the trial court have jurisdiction of the controversy.\n If the plaintiff sued as the corporate owner of the property, that is, as the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company, but under the name of the Baltimore & Ohio, the trial court was without jurisdiction as a federal court, because both the Branch Railroad and the defendant were West Virginia corporations, and hence the controversy was wholly between citizens of the same state. If the Baltimore & Ohio sued as the Maryland corporation, owner of all the stock in the Parkersburg Branch Railroad Company, the trial court was without jurisdiction of the controversy, because the latter corporation, an indispensable party plaintiff, was not joined. Compare Davenport v. Dows, 18 Wall. 626. And it could not have been joined. Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77\n, 41 S. Ct. 39. For then one of the plaintiffs would have been a citizen of West Virginia, there would no longer have been complete diversity of citizenship, and the jurisdiction of the trial court would have been ousted.\n So far as appears, the Branch Railroad was neither merged in, nor consolidated with, the Baltimore & Ohio. Nor was there a compulsory domestication of the latter in West Virginia. Martin's Administrator v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n151 \nU.S. 673\n, 14 S. Ct. 533. We have, therefore, no occasion to consider the questions involved in St. Louis & San Francisco v. James, \n161 \nU.S. 545\n, 16 S. Ct. 621; Louisville, New Albany & Chicago Ry. Co. v. Louisville Trust Co., \n174 \nU.S. 552\n, 19 S. Ct. 817; Southern Ry. Co. v. Allison, \n190 \nU.S. 326, 337\n, 23 S. Ct. 713; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Castle, \n224 \nU.S. 541\n, 32 S. Ct. 606.

Cas. 518.\n It would seem that the District Court must, upon the remand of the case to it, enter a decree of dismissal. But, \n\n[268 U.S. 35, 39]\n\u00a0\n as the question whether the trial court had jurisdiction does not appear to have been considered by either of the lower courts and was not discussed by the parties here, our direction to the Circuit Court of Appeals is to remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Code of Virginia 1860, tit. 18, c. 61,  28, 29; Constitution of West Virginia (1863) art. 11,  8; Baltimore & Ohio R.

CO. v. GROEGER(1925)\nNo. 113\nArgued: October 24, 1924Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 521, 522]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. T. Kinder and S. H. Tolles, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. E. C. Chapman, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, John C. Groeger, brought this action against the petitioner in the District Court for the Northern \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n District of Ohio, to recover damages for his death. He was a locomotive engineer, employed by the defendant, and at the time of his death, September 3, 1920, was operating a steam locomotive propelling an interstate train. He was killed by the explosion of the boiler. The action was brought under the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), and the federal Boiler Inspection Act of February 17, 1911,  2, 36 Stat. 913 (Comp. St.  8631), amended by Act March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1192 (Comp. St.  8639a).\n The court submitted for decision of the jury two issues: Whether the explosion was caused in whole or in part by an unsafe and insufficient condition permitted by defendant in and about the crown sheet of the boiler; and whether defendant's failure to have a fusible plug in the crown sheet violated section 2 of the Boiler Inspection Act. There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed. 288 F. 321.\n\n 1. \nDefendant asserts that section 2 of the Boiler Inspection Act prescribes no definite or ascertainable standard of duty. That section provides that it shall be unlawful 'for any common carrier ... to use any locomotive engine propelled by steam power ... unless the boiler ... and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same is put, that the same may be employed in the active service of such carrier in moving traffic without unnecessary peril to life or limb. ...' It imposes upon the carrier a higher degree of duty than theretofore existed. The requirement of the statute is substituted for the common-law rule which holds the employer to ordinary care to provide his employees a reasonably safe place in which, and reasonably safe appliances and machinery with which, to work. It is as definite and certain as is the common-law rule, and to hold that the duty imposed cannot be ascertained would be as unreasonable as it \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n would be to declare that the common-law rule which is ordinarily applied in personal injury actions brought by employees against employers is too indefinite to be enforced or complied with. The contention is without merit.\n\n 2. \nDefendant insists that there was no evidence to support a finding that the explosion resulted from any defective or dangerous condition of the crown sheet.\n The credibility of witnesses, the weight and probative value of evidence are to be determined by the jury and not by the judge. However, many decisions of this court1 establish that, in every case, it is the duty of the judge to direct a verdict in favor of one of the parties when the testimony and all the inferences which the jury could justifiably draw therefrom would be insufficient to support a different finding. \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n The parts of the fire box and boiler involved may be described briefly. One side of the metal forming the top and sides of the fire box is exposed to the fire, and the other side forms a part of the boiler and, when the engine is in use, is covered by water. In order to strengthen and to hold in proper position the sides and top of the fire box in relation to the opposite exterior walls of the boiler, staybolts are used, extending from the inside of the fire box to the outside of the boiler. There were 1,464 such bolts on the engine under consideration. The top of the fire box is called the crown sheet. It is kept covered with water while the engine is in operation, and if allowed to be without water thereon, it will become so overheated that damage or explosion will be liable to result. Fusible plugs are made of soft metal, which will melt at relatively low temperature. They may be, and sometimes are, inserted into and used as part of the crown sheet, and are so shaped and placed that the end of the plug inside the boiler extends slightly above the surface of the metal surrounding it. It is intended that, if the water on the crown sheet shall be too low, the fire will melt out the plug before greater damage or explosion results, and allow the steam to escape from the boiler into the fire box and so relieve the pressure and check or extinguish the fire.\n Rule 25, approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, is as follows:\n'No boiler shall be allowed to remain in service when there are two adjacent staybolts broken or plugged in any part of the fire box or combustion chamber, nor when three or more are broken or plugged in a circle four feet in diameter, nor when five or more are broken or plugged in the entire boiler.'\n\n Rule 14 of the Commission is as follows:\n'If boilers are equipped with fusible plugs, they shall be removed and cleaned of scale at least once every month. Their removal must be noted on the report of inspection.'\n\n This does not \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n purport to require fusible plugs to be used. There was none in the crown sheet in question. It was shown that the boiler had seven broken staybolts, and that they had been broken some time before the day the explosion occurred. Three were intermediate on one side within a radius of 16 inches; three, two of which were adjacent, were intermediate on the other side within a radius of 12 inches, and one was at the front end of the crown sheet. Use of the boiler in that condition violated rule 25. The evidence showed that overheating of the crown sheet has a tendency to injure and fracture staybolts; but it was not shown what caused these to break. All persons on the engine-engineer, fireman, and brakeman-were killed. The train stopped at Foster's Tower, about 3 miles from the place of the explosion, and there water was taken into the tank. A brakeman employed on another train, then at that station, testified that he went into the cab of Groeger's engine, and that, while there, he observed that water and steam were escaping from the boiler into the fire box; that he heard the sizzling of the water upon the fire; that, when he opened the fire box door, steam gushed out; that the fire was dead; that the steam gauge showed 160 pounds pressure, and that water was being put into the boiler by the two injectors. There was no evidence that, prior to the day of the explosion, there was any improper or unsafe condition or defect in the boiler, other than the broken staybolts. The testimony of the locomotive engineers, who operated the engine several days immediately preceding the explosion, was to the effect that the injectors, gauge cocks, and water glass-the means by which the supply of water in the boiler was controlled and observed-were in good condition. The testimony of a number of witnesses, whose experience qualified them to give opinion evidence on the basis of conditions existing after the explosion, supported the defendant's contention that the \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n broken staybolts did not cause or have any connection with the explosion, and, as to that matter, there was no substantial conflict in the evidence. The location of these broken staybolts in relation to the place of the tear or rupture was shown to be such that the explosion was not caused by them. And we find no evidence in the record to support a finding that they caused or contributed to cause the explosion.\n But we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that, under section 2 of the statute, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, wholly apart from the broken staybolts. Defendant's duty to have the boiler in a safe condition to operate so that it could be used without unnecessary peril to its employees was absolute and continuing. No notice to the defendant, actual or constructive, of the defects or unsafe condition of the boiler was necessary to plaintiff's case. Defendant is liable if its breach of duty contributed to cause the death. We are bound to assume that the condition of the boiler at Foster, a very short time before the explosion, was as indicated by the testimony of the brakeman above referred to. His credibility and the weight properly to be given to his testimony were for the jury. And if the boiler was in the condition he described, it would not be unreasonable to conclude that a breach of duty of defendant caused or contributed to cause the explosion. We think it did not conclusively appear that the failure of deceased properly to operate the engine was the sole cause of the explosion. It follows that the evidence made a case for the jury.\n\n 3. \nThe court, in harmony with the provisions of section 2, instructed the jury that the standard of defendant's duty was to put and keep the locomotive in proper condition and safe to operate, and that it would be a violation of defendant's duty if the engine, as to the crown sheet, was permitted to be in such a condition that it could not be employed in the active service of the carrier moving the \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 528]\n\u00a0\n traffic without unnecessary peril to life or limb, and further instructed as follows:\n'If you shall say and find that the standard of duty imposed by the law required a fusible safety plug to be installed, then the absence of the fusible safety plug would impose upon the defendant here an absolute liability, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover if the absence of it contributed in whole or in part to cause the explosion and the resulting death. ... An interstate carrier, as well as any railroad carrier, owes the duty, of course, of availing itself of the best mechanical contrivances and inventions in known practical use which are or would be effective in making safe a locomotive boiler as against explosions. It is not bound to introduce a new appliance the moment somebody suggests it or discovers it, but is entitled to a reasonable time and opportunity to test it out and make any changes. ... If you shall find ... that a fusible safety plug was required by that standard, and that it was a mechanical means and contrivance in known practical use and effective more than was any other that had been installed by the defendant on this engine, then its absence would be a violation of the Boiler Inspection Act . ...'\n\n That act was passed to promote the safety of employees and is to be read and applied with the federal Employers' Liability Act. Under the latter, defendant is liable for any negligence chargeable to it which caused or contributed to cause decedent's death (section 1), and he will not be held guilty of contributory negligence (section 3) or to have assumed the risks of his employment (section 4) if a violation of section 2 of the Boiler Inspection Act contributed to cause his death. See Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Donaldson, \n246 \nU.S. 121, 124\n, 38 S. Ct. 230, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 581; St. Louis Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 294\n, 28 S. Ct. 616; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617, 620\n, 37 S. Ct. 456.\n By the last-mentioned section, defendant was bound absolutely to furnish what before, under the common law, \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 529]\n\u00a0\n it was its duty to exercise ordinary care to provide. The carriers were left free to determine how their boilers should be kept in proper condition for use without unnecessary danger. The things required for that purpose were not prescribed or changed by the act; but use of boilers unless safe to operate as specified was made unlawful, and liability for consequences follows violation of the act. It is a well-established rule that the master is not bound to furnish the latest or best tools or appliances for the use of his servants. That rule is applicable here, and we hold that defendant was not liable for failure to furnish the best mechanical contrivances and investions or to discard appliances upon discovery of later improvements, provided the boiler was in proper condition and safe to operate, as required by the statute. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Bower, \n241 \nU.S. 470, 474\n, 36 S. Ct. 624; Patton v. Texas & Pacific R. R. Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658, 664\n, 21 S. Ct. 275; Washington, etc., Railway Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 570\n, 10 S. Ct. 1044.\n The jury was by the charge authorized to find that the act required defendant to have a fusible plug in the crown sheet of the boiler. There is nothing in the act or in any rule, regulation or order authorized by it, which specifies the use of fusible plugs. This, however, does not relieve the defendant of the duty to have and keep its boilers safe for use as required by the act. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Donaldson, supra, 128 (38 S. Ct. 230). The use of fusible plugs has been known for a long time. The record does not contain a complete showing of the extent of their use; but it appears that the Erie Railroad uses them, and that for some years defendant used them; that defendant has now about 2,700 locomotives, and does not have fusible plugs in any of them; and it was shown that they are not used by the New York Central, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, the Illinois Central, or the Nickel Plate. In 1899, the American Railway Master Mechanics' Association, whose members represent nearly all the railroads in \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 530]\n\u00a0\n the country, passed a resolution expressing the sense of the association to be 'that the use of fusible plugs in the crown sheets of locomotive fire boxes is not conducive to the prevention of the overheating of the crown sheet.' It appears that, among practical men experienced in such matters, there is a difference of opinion as to the usefulness of such plugs. If the question whether the standard of duty fixed by the act required defendant to have a fusible plug in the crown sheet of the boiler were one for the determination of a jury, we think there was evidence which would sustain a verdict in the affirmative or in the negative. But we think the question was not for the jury. Southern Pacific Co. v. Seley, \n152 \nU.S. 145, 150\n, 14 S. Ct. 530; Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H . & M. R. Co., \n122 \nU.S. 180, 194\n, 7 S. Ct. 1166; Randall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 478, 483\n, 3 S. Ct. 322; Kilpatrick v. Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co., 121 F. 11, 57 C. C. A. 255; Richards v. Rough, 53 Mich. 212, 216, 18 N. W. 785. And see Southern Pacific Co. v. Berkshire, \n254 \nU.S. 415, 417\n, 41 S. Ct. 162. The act required a condition which would permit use of the locomotive without unnecessary danger. It left to the carrier the choice of means to be employed to effect that result. While the burden was on the plaintiff to prove a violation of the act by defendant, she was not bound to show that any particular contrivance or invention was suitable or necessary to have and keep the boiler in proper condition. There is a multitude of mechanical questions involved in determining the proper construction, maintenance and use of the boilers, other parts of locomotives, their tenders and appurtenances, all of which are covered by the Boiler Inspection Act, as amended. Inventions are occurring frequently, and there are many devices to accomplish the same purpose. Comparative merits as to safety or utility are most difficult to determine. It is not for the courts to lay down rules which will operate to restrict the carriers in their choice of mechanical means by which their locomotives, boilers, engine tenders and appurtenances \n\n[266 U.S. 521, 531]\n\u00a0\n are to be kept in proper condition. Nor are such matters to be left to the varying and uncertain opinions and verdicts of juries. The interests of the carriers will best be served by having and keeping their locomotive boilers safe; and it may well be left to their officers and engineers to decide the engineering questions involved in determining whether to use fusible plugs or other means to that end. Tuttle v. Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co., supra, page 194 (7 S. Ct. 1166); Richards v. Rough, supra, page 216 ( 18 N. W. 785). The presence or absence of a fusible plug was a matter properly to be taken into consideration in connection with other facts bearing upon the kind and condition of the boiler in determining the essential and ultimate question; i. e. whether the boiler was in the condition required by the act.\n But we think the court erred in instructing the jury that defendant was bound to avail itself of 'the best mechanical contrivances and inventions in known practical use which are or would be effective in making safe a locomotive boiler as against explosions,' and also erred in authorizing the jury to decide that 'the standard of duty imposed by the law required a fusible safety plug to be installed,' and that 'the absence of the fusible safety plug would impose upon the defendant here an absolute liability.'\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pawling v.

BELT LINE R CORPORATION(1925)\nNo. 465\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 413, 415]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard Thayer Kingsbury, M. M. Fertig, and George P. Nicholson, all of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. A. T. Davison, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was commenced December 16, 1920, by appellee to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the New York Public Service Commission, First District (succeeded by the Transit Commission), made October 29, 1912. The order established joint routes on street railways in New York City and prescribed five cents as the maximum joint fare. Appellee's street railway formed a part of some of such routes. The complaint alleged that the order deprived appellee of any return on the value of its property used to perform the service covered by the joint fare complained of, and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and prayed injunction against the enforcement of the order in respect of certain lines with which its railroad connected. A temporary injunction was granted by a court of three judges. Section 266, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243); 273 F. 272. A master took the evidence and reported that the order was confiscatory. The district court confirmed his findings and entered decree as prayed. Appeal was taken under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n\n 1. \nAppellants contend that, when this suit was commenced, the rate- making process was not completed, and that the appellee had not exhausted its legal remedies in the state tribunals. The point is without merit. The order complained of had been in force for more than eight \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n years. The laws of the state required it to be obeyed, and prescribed penalties for failure to comply with it. See section 56, Public Service Commission Law; chapter 48, Consolidated Laws New York. May 11, 1920, the receiver of the New York Street Railways Company applied to the commission to be relieved from the requirements of the order, and, May 18, appellee joined in that application and prayed for the elimination of the joint fare between its lines and the lines of other companies, except those of the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Forty-Second Street, Manhattanville & St. Nicholas Avenue Railway Company. May 22, appellee filed with the commission a revised joint tariff, to take effect June 22, eliminating the joint fare of five cents. But on June 18, the commission suspended this tariff, and so compelled appellee to continue to comply with the order of October 29, 1912. July 9, the commission found the fare of five cents too low and prescribed in its stead a joint fare of seven cents, to take effect September 13. Appellee, on July 23, applied for a rehearing under section 22 of the Public Service Commission Law. It alleged that the joint fare of seven cents would be confiscatory; and that the evidence submitted had no reference to a joint or through rate of seven cents. August 28, the receiver also applied for a rehearing. August 31, the commission granted a rehearing to commence November 5, and postponed the taking effect of the joint fare of seven cents until such time as the commission might fix, at or after the termination of the rehearing. On November 5, the rehearing was commenced, and the testimony was closed November 10. There has been no determination of the matter by the commission, and so the order fixing joint fares at seven cents never took effect. Neither the original application nor the petition for rehearing relieved appellee of the burden of compliance with the order of October 29, 1912. No application to the commission for relief was required by the state law. None was necessary \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n as a condition precedent to the suit. See Prendergast v. N. Y. Tel. Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 48\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; United States v. Abilene & So. Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 282\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. On the point under consideration, it must be assumed that the joint fare of five cents was confiscatory as alleged. The continued enforcement of that rate would operate to take appellee's property without just compensation and to compel it to suffer daily confiscation. Notwithstanding the matter was pending on rehearing, the appellee had the right to sue in the federal court to enjoin the enforcement of the rate. It was not bound to await final action by the commission and, if the rate was in fact confiscatory, to serve in the meantime without just compensation. See Pacific Telephone Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196, 204\n, 44 S. Ct. 553; Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 43 S. Ct. 353; Love v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 185 F. 321, 326, 107 C. C. A. 403.\n\n 2. \nAppellants complaint that appellee has not sought injunction against the operation of the order as to the lines of the Third Avenue Company-which owns the stock of the appellee-and asserts that a diversion of traffic from other lines to that company has resulted from the injunction. The lines, as to which the order was enjoined, are relieved by the decree from the obligation of dividing the joint fare of five cents. If the rates enjoined are confiscatory, appellee is entitled to relief, notwithstanding its obedience to the order in respect of other lines and fares. It was not bound to attack the prescribed rates as to all the routes. It is not suggested that the commission is without power to prescribe equal and nonconfiscatory rates. The effect of the injunction on the business of the Third Avenue Company and its competitors is not involved in this suit; nor are they complaining.\n\n 3. \nAppellants insist that the appellee voluntarily assumed the obligation to carry transfer passengers pursuant \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n to the order of October 29, 1912, for two cents each; and having been incorporated and having acquired its property subsequent and subject to such order, it is not entitled to complain of the order as an infringement of any constitutional right.\n The commission had power to establish through rates and fix joint fares. The law required street railroad corporations to comply with every order made by the commission, and prescribed penalties to enforce such orders. See subdivision 3,  49; section 56, Public Service Commission Law, supra. The Central Park, North & East River Railroad Company, appellee's predecessor, accepted the order, and put in effect the prescribed joint fare of five cents. There is no suggestion that it was not bound to do so, or that the order was not then valid and binding on the company. A rate that is just and reasonable, when prescribed, subsequently may become too low, unreasonable, and confiscatory. See Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 693\n, 43 S. Ct. 675; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 400\n, 42 S. Ct. 351. That company did not agree to serve for the prescribed joint fare of five cents, and was not bound to do so if the rate was found to be, or if thereafter it should become, confiscatory. It did not surrender the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Central Park Company, many years before the order of October 29, 1912, was made, gave a mortgage on all its property, rights, and franchises. November 14, 1912, one Cornell purchased at foreclosure sale. December 24, 1912, under section 9 (now section 96 [Laws 1923, c. 787]) of the Stock Corporation Law, chapter 59, Consolidated Laws New York, Cornell and others became incorporated as the Belt Line Railway Corporation, the appellee. That corporation through such sale and by virtue of the provisions of section 9 succeeded to 'all the rights, privileges and franchises which at the time of such sale belonged to, or were vested in the corporation \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n last owning the property sold,' and became 'subject to all the provisions, duties and liabilities imposed by law on that [the predecessor] corporation.' The franchise of the mortgagor was not destroyed. People v. O'Brien, 111 N. Y. 1, 41, et seq., 18 N. E. 692, 2 L. R. A. 255, 7 Am. St. Rep. 684. The rights of the mortgagee and of the purchasers were inviolable. People ex rel. Third Avenue Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 203 N. Y. 299, 308, 96 N. E. 1011. There is nothing in appellee's certificate of incorporation or the laws under which it was organized that imposes upon it any obligation to continue to serve for a portion of the joint fare of five cents. The commission's order constitutes no part of the charter of appellee; and we find no agreement by appellee, expressed or implied, to comply with the order. The District Court rightly held that interstate Railway Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79\n, 28 S. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555, does not apply.\n\n 4. \nIt is asserted that the transfer order was not confiscatory, because it was a reasonable service requirement, and also because the additional expense which would be involved by a resumption of transfers would not exceed the additional revenue which would be derived from transfer passengers.\n The order was made under subdivision 3,  49, Public Commission Law, supra. Its purpose was to enable a passenger, by making a change from the car of one company to the car of another, to ride on the lines of both for a single fare of five cents. The service was not affected by the order. Change of cars remained necessary. The designation of transfer points and the requirement that transfer tickets be given and received by carriers were for the purpose of giving to the passenger the additional transportation without additional payment. The amount of the fare prescribed was not essential and had no relation to the use of connecting lines for a continuous journey. The state has power to require street railways and like utilities to provide reasonably adequate \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n facilities and services, even though compliance may be attended by some pecuniary disadvantage. Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. R., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 44 S. Ct. 247, and cases cited. But that rule is not applicable here; and the cases referred to do not support appellant's contention. The commission under the guise of regulation may not compel the use and operation of the company's property for public convenience without just compensation.\n The evidence sustains the finding of the master and the district court that the joint fare of five cents is confiscatory.\n At the time of the foreclosure appellee's predecessor, the Central Park Company, operated a street railway across town on Fifty-Ninth street and up and down town on the east side and on the west side of Manhattan Island from Fifty-Ninth street to the Battery. The order required the company to exchange transfers with the lines on First, Second, Third, Lexington, Madison, Sixth, and Seventh avenues, Broadway, and Eighth, Ninth and Tenth avenues. In October, 1919, and February, 1920, the receiver of the New York Railways Company returned the leased lines on Eighth, Ninth, and Madison avenues to their owners, who were not named in or bound by the order. This eliminated some of the through routes. June 3, 1919, with the approval of the commission, appellee abandoned the line on the east side, and March 24, 1921, abandoned the line on the west side. This left operated by appellee only the Fifty-Ninth street line from First avenue to Tenth avenue, and south on Tenth avenue to Fifty-Fourth street. It then exchanged transfers at intersections of Fifty-Ninth street and First, Second, Third, Lexington, Sixth, and Seventh avenues, Broadway, and Tenth avenue. The decree, following the prayer of the complaint, enjoins the enforcement of the order except as to transfers at First and Third avenues, Broadway and Tenth avenue. \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n There is involved only the rates applicable to a part of the company's business. In this respect, the case is similar to Northern Pacific Railway v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; Norfolk & Western Ry. v. West Virginia, \n236 \nU.S. 605\n, 35 S. Ct. 437; and Northern Pacific Railway v. Department of Public Works of Washington, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S. Ct. 412, decided April 13, 1925. The applicable law is plain. The state is without power to require the traffic covered by the fare enjoined to be carried at a loss or without substantial compensation over its proper cost. And such cost includes not only the expenditures, if any, incurred exclusively for that traffic, but also a just proportion of the expenses incurred for all traffic of which that in question forms a part. The cost of doing such business is not, and properly cannot be, limited to the amount by which total operating expenses would be diminished by the elimination of, or increased by adding, the transfer passengers in question. It would be arbitrary and unjust to charge to that class of business only the amount by which the operating expenses were, or would be, increased by adding that to the other traffic carried. Outlays are none the less attributable to transfer passengers because also applicable to other traffic. Operating expenses which are incurred on account of all passengers carried, and which are not capable of direct allocation to any class, should be attributed to the transfer passengers in question in like proportion as such expenses are fairly chargeable to other passengers receiving like service. While the carrier has no constitutional right to the same rate or percentage of return on all its business, the state may not select any class of traffic for arbitrary control and regulation. Broad as is its power to regulate, the state does not enjoy the freedom of an owner. Appellee's property is held in private ownership; and, subject to reasonable regulation in the public interest, the management and right to control the business policy of the company belong to its owners. Northern Pacific Railway v. \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n North Dakota, supra, 595, 596, 35 S. Ct. 429; Norfolk & Western Ry. v. West Virginia, supra, 609, 35 S. Ct. 437; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago G. W. Ry., \n209 \nU.S. 108, 118\n, 28 S. Ct. 493.\n It does not appear whether the commission, when making the order, acted without or upon sufficient evidence. Northern Pacific Railway v. Department of Public Works of Washington, supra. But the presumption is that the order was reasonable and valid, and the burden was on appellee to establish its invalidity. It is well known, and the court will take judicial notice of the fact, that the purchasing power of money has been much less since 1917 than it was in 1912, when the order was made; and that the cost of labor, materials and supplies necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of street railways has greatly increased. In the preamble to its order of July 20, 1920, prescribing a joint fare of seven cents instead of five cents, the commission stated:\n'The commission after a careful consideration of the testimony and briefs submitted by counsel, being of the opinion that the convenience of the traveling public necessitates the continuance of the said transfers, but that the maximum joint rate of five cents fixed in the said order of October 29, 1920, \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 1912]\n\u00a0\n is, by reason of the changed conditions under which the said railroad companies are operating, unjust, unreasonable, and insufficient to render a fair and reasonable return for the service furnished, it is ordered, ...' etc.\n\n Appellants argue that this does not amount to a finding that the joint fare of five cents is confiscatory. But, clearly, the language properly may be taken to mean that the rate is too low and violates the Constitution. That is the plain import of the words used. A commission or other legislative body, in its discretion, may determine to be reasonable and just a rate that is substantially higher than one merely sufficient to justify a judicial finding in a confiscation case that it is high enough to yield a just and reasonable return on the value of the property \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n used to perform the service covered by the rate. The mere fact that a rate is nonconfiscatory does not indicate that it must be deemed to be just and reasonable. It is well known that rates substantially higher than the line between validity and unconstitutionality properly may be deemed to be just and reasonable, and not excessive or extortionate. Trier v. C., St. P., M . & O. Ry. Co., 30 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 352, 355; Holmes & Hallowell Co. v. G. N. Ry. Co., 37 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 625, 635; Dimmitt-Caudle-Smith Live Stock Co. v. R. R. Co., 47 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 287, 298; Detroit & M. R. Co. v. Michigan Railroad Commission (D. C.) 203 F. 864, 870. But the language above quoted does not show, and there is nothing to suggest, that the commission had in mind or intended any such distinction.\n About the time the order of October 29, 1912, became effective, the carriers agreed upon a division of the joint fare. There was assigned to the appellee two cents and to the other carriers three cents out of each fare. This apportionment was accepted by the master and District Court. It is not challenged by any assignment of error; and it does not appear that appellee was entitled to more.\n The evidence shows that, upon the authorization of the commission, appellee issued capital stock to the amount of $734,000, bonds for $1,750, 000, and a note for $73,091.53. The total is $2,557,091.53. But because of abandonments, changes, and lack of supplementing evidence, this figure is not a good indication of the cost or of the value of the property in use at the time of the trial. At the trial, appellee called a valuation engineer who, in May, 1921, had been employed by the commission to make a valuation of all the street railroads in New York City. His estimate of the cost of reproduction of appellee's property in 1921 was $2,859,754. He deducted from this $77,000 on account of errors in the inventory and $128, 246, his estimate of the cost of putting the property in first class condition, leaving $2,654,508. There \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 424]\n\u00a0\n was other evidence of value. The master and District Court found the value to be $2,600,000. Appellants contend that this finding is not sustained by the evidence. In the view we take of this case, it is not necessary to determine the value of the property, or whether total revenue exceeds total operating expenses and taxes by a sum sufficient to pay a reasonable return on the value of all the property. However, we are satisfied by the evidence that a fair and reasonable return on the value would be in excess of $91,154.58, the annual interest at 5 per cent. on the indebtedness of $ 1,823,901.53-evidenced by the bonds and note.\n There follows a statement showing by fiscal years, ended June 30, and for three months ending September 30, 1922: (1) The number of passengers carried at five cents each; (2) the number of joint rate passengers carried at two cents each; (3) the average revenue per passenger, exclusive of free transfer passengers; (4) the average cost per passenger, including operating expenses and taxes, but excluding any amount for depreciation or interest; (5) the average cost per passenger, exclusive of depreciation, but including interest at 5 per cent. on the company's bonds and note.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) (4) (5) 1918 6,450,687 13,512,033 2.9 c. 2.75c. 3.20C. 1919 5,440,766 12,817,674 2.89c. 2.49c. 3.00c. 1920 7,186,735 10,171,479 3.2 c. 2.93c. 3.46c. 1921 8,119,325 7,948,148 3.5 c. 3.52c. 4.10c. 1922 8,100,009 5,720,102 3.68c. 2.92c. 3.58c. * 1,690,229 1,426,923 3.6 c. 3.03c. 3.77c. \n These figures show that the operating expenses and taxes, both before and after the injunction, substantially exceeded two cents, the amount received by appellee per transfer passenger. Exclusive of any allowance for a depreciation reserve or for interest, the average cost per \n\n[268 U.S. 413, 425]\n\u00a0\n passenger has been from about 24 per cent. to about 51 per cent. in excess of two cents; and, if interest on the debt at five per cent. be included, it appears that the excess has been from about 50 per cent. to 105 per cent. And the record shows that for some time prior to the injunction the total revenue from all sources, including revenue for transportation, advertising, rentals and interest on deposits, was less than a sum sufficient to cover operating expenses, taxes and interest on the debt, and also shows that both before and after the injunction such total revenue was not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property, after paying operating expenses and taxes.\n The master found that a resumption of the transfer traffic enjoined would result in an increase of revenue of $46,326.72 per year and of operating expenses of $105,900 per year. These findings were not confirmed. The district court found that the revenue would be increased by about $42, 000 per year and operating expenses about $46,000 per year.\n The evidence undoubtedly justifies the conclusion that a resumption of such transfer business would require additional operating expenses in an amount in excess of the resulting increase of revenue, and that appellee's fair share of the joint rate would be substantially less than the operating expenses and taxes justly chargeable to that business. It follows that the rate is confiscatory. We need not determine the value of the property attributable to the traffic in question or what would constitute a reasonable rate of return.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Three months ended September 30, 1922.\n\n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARCLAY & CO. v.

C., and Franklin Grady, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 15, 1924, Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of this court in the case of National Paper & Type Co. v. Frank K. Bowers, Collector (No. 320 of the present term) \n266 \nU.S. 373\n, 45 S. Ct. 133, 69 L. Ed. --. That case was heard at the same time with this. They were suits to recover taxes which it was claimed had been illegally collected, for the reason that the statutes under which they had been exacted deprived the taxpayers of their property without due process of law. The statute attacked in No. 320 was the income tax of 1921; that in this case was the income tax of 1918\n\n\n The plaintiffs in the two cases were corporations of this country engaged in the business of the purchase and manufacture of personal property within the United States and the sale thereof without the United \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n States. Their objection to the taxes both of 1921 and 1918 was that they were subjected to a tax on all of their net income, including profits made by them in the sale of their goods abroad, while foreign corporations engaged in the same business of buying and manufacturing goods in this country and selling them abroad were not taxed upon their whole net income but were exempted from a tax on all or a part of it.\n Another objection to the tax was that the tax in both instances was a tax on exports. That was disposed of by this court in opinion No. 320 by reference to the case of Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432.\n The court further pointed out that in respect to what was called discrimination in favor of foreign corporations Congress might adopt a policy calculated to serve the best interests of this country in dealing with citizens or subjects of another country and might properly say as to earnings from business begun in one country and ending in another that the net income of foreign subjects or citizens should be left to the taxation of their own government or to that having jurisdiction of the sales; that the question of taxing foreign corporations on such income might properly be affected by the consideration that domestic corporations had the power of the United States to protect their interests and redress their wrongs in whatever part of the world their business might take them, while the foreign corporations must look to the country of their origin for protection against injury or redress of losses occurring in countries other than the United States. Having disposed of No. 320 for these reasons in favor of the government by affirming the judgment below, a short opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice McKenna in No. 547 (\n267 \nU.S. 442\n, 45 S. Ct. 135), in which he said that the charge of invalidity in that case was on the same grounds as those set up in No. 320, and that upon authority of the decision in No. 320 the judgment should be affirmed. \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n A petition for rehearing seeks now to differentiate the present case from that considered and decided in No. 320.\n The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1076,  230 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 nn]) provided for a tax of 12 per cent. on the net income in excess of certain credits upon domestic corporations, but contained this provision in case of foreign corporations, under section 233(b):\n'In the case of a foreign corporation gross income includes only the gross income from sources within the United States, including the interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations of residents, corporate or otherwise, dividends from resident corporations, and including all amounts received (although paid under a contract for the sale of goods or otherwise) representing profits on the manufacture and disposition of goods within the United States.' 40 Stat. 1077 (section 6336 1\/8 p).\n\n The Revenue Act of 1921 taxed the net income (meaning the gross income, less certain deductions) of domestic corporations. 42 Stat. 252, 254,  230, 232 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6336 1\/8 nn, 6336 1\/8 oo). The same section, No. 232, provided that:\n'In the case of a foreign corporation ... the computation shall also be made in the manner provided in section 217.'\n\n The relevant parts of sections 217 and 233 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  6336 1\/8 hh, 6336 1\/8 p) were as follows:\n'Sec. 217. (a) That in the case of a non-resident alien individual or of a citizen entitled to the benefits of section 262. ...\n\n'(e) Items of gross income, expenses, losses and deductions, other than those specified in subdivisions (a) and (c), shall be allocated or apportioned to sources within or without the United States under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. ... Gains, profits and income from (1) transportation or other services rendered partly within and partly without the United States, or (2) from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within and sold without the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n without and sold within the United States, shall be treated as derived partly from sources within the partly from sources without the United States. Gains, profits and income derived from the purchase of personal property within and its sale without the United States or from the purchase of personal property without and its sale within the United States, shall be treated as derived entirely from the country in which sold. ...' 42 Stat. 243, 244, 245.\n\n'Sec. 233. ...\n\n'(b) In the case of a foreign corporation, gross income means only gross income from sources within the United States, determined ( except in the case of insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by sections 243 or 246) in the manner provided in section 217.' 42 Stat. 254.\n\n Counsel contend in their petition for rehearing that the Revenue Act of 1921 provided with respect to the manufacture within the United States by foreign corporations of goods which they sold in foreign countries that the income derived should be allocated to sources within the United States and imposed a tax on that part of such income allocated to manufacture, whereas the Revenue Act of 1918, under which this case arose exempted from tax all income of foreign corporations derived from the manufacture or purchase of goods within the United States which they sold or disposed of in foreign countries. But we do not think that that distinction makes any difference in the application of the principle upon which the judgment in No. 320 was based. Whatever the difference between the acts, whether the foreign corporations were wholly exempted or only partially exempted, they constituted a class all by themselves and could be properly so treated by Congress because of the considerations suggested in the opinion in No. 320. The attack made upon the law of 1921 for discrimination against American corporations in favor of foreign corporations was quite as \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n vigorous in the briefs of counsel for the plaintiffs in error in No. 320 as in No. 547 and rested on the same argument, and while the exemption of the net income of foreign corporations from manufacture in the United States did not exist in the act of 1921 as in the act of 1918, the question of discrimination in the two cases only differed in extent and did not call for any real distinction in deciding them. The question where an income is earned is always a matter of doubt when the business is begun in one country and ended in another. As pointed out by the plaintiff in error in his brief in No. 320, much of the business in such foreign trade in addition to the manufacture is done in the United States in storehouses and docks and in other ways after the manufacture, but whatever of that might be equitably allocated as done in the United States is exempted from taxation of foreign corporations by the act of 1921. Thus exactly the same question presents itself as in No. 320. It is only a difference in degree.\n The power of Congress in levying taxes is very wide and where a classification is made of taxpayers that is reasonable, and not merely arbitrary and capricious, the Fifth Amendment cannot apply. As this court said, speaking of the taxing power of Congress, in Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245, 256\n, 40 S. Ct. 550, 554 (64 L. Ed. 887, 11 A. L. R. 519):\n'It may be applied to every object within its range 'in such measure as Congress may determine,' enables that body 'to select one calling and omit another, to tax one class of property and to forbear to tax another,' and may be applied in different ways to different objects so long as there is 'geographical uniformity' in the duties, imposts and excises imposed. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 443; Austin v. Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, 699; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541, 548; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 92\n, 106 S.; Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 269 S.; McCray v. United \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 61; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 158; Billings v. United States, \n232 U.S. 261\n, 282; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 24-26.'\n\n The power of Congress to make a difference between the tax on foreign corporations and that of domestic corporations is not measured by the same rule as that for determining whether taxes imposed by one state upon the profits of a manufacturing corporation are an imposition of tax upon a subject-matter not within the jurisdiction of the taxing state. Cases on that subject like Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, 41 S. Ct. 45, have no application to the question here. Considerations of policy toward foreign countries may very well justify an exemption of the foreign corporations from taxes that might legitimately be imposed on them, but which Congress does not think it wise to exact. Such considerations justify a different classification of foreign corporations doing business in the United States either of manufacture or purchase and making profit out of that business in other countries from that which would apply to its own corporations. The injustice thought to be worked upon domestic corporations engaged in sales abroad by a different classification for purposes of taxation of foreign corporations similarly engaged is an argument, not for the constitutional invalidity of the law before a court, but for its repeal before Congress.\n The opinion of Mr. Justice McKenna applying the same principles in this case to those applied in No. 320 was entirely justified, and the petition for rehearing is overruled.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error is a domestic corporation engaged in business as a manufacturer. It is subjected to \n\n[267 U.S. 442, 452]\n\u00a0\n an income tax from which foreign corporations are exempted. It charges invalidity on the same grounds as those set up in National Paper & Type Co. v. Bowers (No. 320) \n266 \nU.S. 373\n, 45 S. Ct. 133, 69 L. Ed. --, and brought suit to recover the amount of the tax. Its complaint was dismissed on motion of the district attorney upon the authority of National Paper & Type Co. v. Edwards, Collector of Internal Revenue (D. C.) 292 F. 633, and judgment went on the merits.\n The cause was submitted with No. 320, just decided. It presents the same contentions, based upon the same grounds. And upon the authority of our decision in that case, the judgment below is\n Affirmed.* \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 267 U. S. --, 45 S. Ct. 348, 69 L.

Stockton, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Selig Edelman, of New York City, Ralph Merriam, of Chicago, Ill., and Lamar Hardy and Louis C.

Brown Company. The shipment was so delivered March 4, 1918. This action was brought to recover damages for loss in market value due to delay in transportation. At the trial, respondent contended that the express company was bound to make delivery of the eggs within a reasonable time, which he claimed to be not more than 30 hours. It was shown that the price of eggs in New York declined between the time respondent claimed delivery to consignee should have been made and the time when it was made. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of respondent. A judgment was entered thereon. Petitioner appealed. It was affirmed by the Appellate Division. 205 App. Div. 332, 199 N. Y. S. 509. Leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals of New York was denied. This court granted certiorari. \n263 \nU.S. 697\n, 44 S. Ct. 134.\n The case involves the construction of a provision of the Act of Congress of March 4, 1915, known as the First Cummins Amendment (38 Stat. 1196, 1197, c. 176), amending section 20 of the Act to Regulate Commerce of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 386, as amended by section 7 of the Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 593, 595 (Comp. St.  8604a). Chapter 176 requires any common carrier receiving property for transportation in interstate commerce to issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and makes it liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage or injury to such property, and contains certain provisos, the last two of which are:\n'Provided further, that it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days and for the filing of claims for a shorter period than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.'\n\n At the time of the delivery of the property for transportation, the express company issued and delivered a receipt or bill of lading therefor, which contained the following:\n'Received from Ky. Creameries the shipment hereinafter listed, subject to the classification and tariffs in effect on the date hereof, which shipment the company agrees to carry upon the terms and conditions of the uniform express receipt in effect on date of shipment.'\n\n Section 7 of the uniform receipt contains the following:\n'Except where the loss, damage or injury complained of is due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, as conditions precedent to recovery claims must be made in writing to the originating or delivering carrier within four months after delivery of the property or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits for loss. damage or delay shall be instituted only within two years and one day after delivery of the property, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.' Official Express Classification No. 25, filed May 18, 1917, I. C. C. A-2130.\n\n No claim was made or filed within four months after the delivery of the property to the consignee. We are required to decide whether the case is one where notice or filing of claim may be required as a condition precedent to recovery. If the first clause of the above-quoted provision \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n stood alone, the rule established would be clear. But the purpose of the second clause is to except some cases from the application of the general rule and to provide that as to them no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required. The language and structure of the second clause is so inapt and defective that it is difficult to give it a construction that is wholly satisfactory. \n1\n The Appellate Division held that the requirement of the receipt for the filing of claims within four months after delivery was prohibited by law, and was without force or effect. The court quoted from its opinion in Bell v. New York Central Railroad Co., 187 App. Div. 564, 566, 175 N. Y. S. 712, 713:\n'It will be noted that both the Cummins Amendment and the bill of lading provision make a double classification of claims, to wit: (1) Those for loss due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit, which we will call transit claims; and (2) those for loss otherwise sustained, which we will call nontransit claims. The Cummins Amendment permitted the carrier to require as a condition precedent to recovery the filing of a nontransit claim within four months, and in such cases to require suit to be instituted within two years. In the case of transit claims it forbade the carrier to require the filing of a claim as a condition precedent to recovery but authorized a requirement, that suit be instituted within two years.'\n\n Respondent supports this construction. But we think it is not satisfactory. The language does not require such a classification. The court suggests no reason \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n for such a division, and there seems to be no substantial considerations supporting it. Apparently, no effect is given the phrase, 'by carelessness or negligence.'\n The petitioner contends that the word 'delay' is to be read with 'while being loaded or unloaded.' This would make two classes of claims excepted from the general rule. One would include claims for loss due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded. The other would include those for damage in transit due to carelessness or negligence. But it is not apparent why claims for loss, damage or injury due to delay in transit should not be included in the same class as claims for damages due to delay while being loaded or unloaded. And no good reason is shown for the elimination of the element of carelessness or negligence from the definition of one class, while including it in the definition of the other.\n It must be assumed that Congress intended to make the classification on a reasonable basis having regard to considerations deemed sufficient to justify exceptions to the rule. The element of carelessness or negligence is important. There are such differences between liability without fault and that resulting from negligence that Congress upon good reasons might permit carriers to require notice and filing of claim within the specified times where the carrier is without fault, and forbid such a requirement in the cases referred to where the loss results from the carrier's negligence. Notice and filing of claim warns the carrier that there may be need to make investigations which otherwise might not appear to be necessary; and if notice of claim is given and filing of claim is made within a reasonable time it serves to enable the carrier to take timely action to discover and preserve the evidence on which depends a determination of the merits of the demand. As to claims for damages not due to negligence, in the absence of notice, there may be no reason \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n for anticipating demand or to investigate to determine the fact or extent of liability. But as to damages resulting from carelessness or negligence, it reasonably may be thought that the carrier has such knowledge of the facts or has such reason to expect claim for compensation to be made against it that the carrier should not be permitted to exact such notice and filing of claim as a condition precedent to recovery. No other basis of classification seems as well supported in reason as the element of carelessness or negligence. And that basis is substantially sustained by the language of the clause. The elimination of the final 'd' in 'damaged' and the omission of the comma after 'unloaded' would make the clause read as follows:\n'Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded or damage in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.'\n\n The context does not permit the use of the word 'damaged' or allow any meaning to be given to it. Its presence makes a grammatical defect and embarrasses interpretation. It seems obvious that the word 'damage' was intended. That word is in harmony with the context as well as with the probable intention of Congress. The final 'd' may be eliminated. The intention of the lawmaker constitutes the law. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 504. See Smythe v. Fiske, 23 Wall. 374, 380. Being satisfied of the legislative intention, the court will not be prevented from giving that intention effect by a too rigid adherence to the very word and letter of the statute. Oates v. National Bank, \n100 U.S. 239\n, 244. Having found that the word 'damage' was intended to be used, the court applies the rule that:\n'A thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter, \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n and a thing which is within the letter of a statute, is not within the statute, unless it is within the intention of the makers.' People v. Utica Insurance Company, 15 Johns. (N. Y.) 358, 381, 8 Am. Dec. 243; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197, 212\n, 23 S. Ct. 787\n\n\n\n The comma after the word 'unloaded' is not entitled to have any weight as evidence of the legislative intention as against the considerations supporting the extension of the qualifying effect of the words 'by carelessness or negligence' to all claims referred to in the second clause.\n'Punctuation is a minor, and not a controlling element in interpretation, and courts will disregard the punctuation of a statute, or re-punctuate it, if need be, to give effect to what otherwise appears to be its purpose and true meaning.' Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry Co. v. Voelker, 129 F. 522, 527, 65 C. C. A. 226, 70 L. R. A. 264.\n\n We hold that the second clause must be read as above indicated, that carelessness or negligence is an element in each case of loss, damage or injury included therein, and that, in such cases, carriers are not permitted to require notice of claim or filing of claim as a condition precedent to recovery. See Hailey v. Oregon Short Line R. Co. (D. C.) 253 F. 569.\n No notice of claim having been given and no claim having been filed as required by the uniform express receipt, it was incumbent upon the respondent to show loss, damage or injury due to delay by carelessness or negligence of the company. The carload of eggs was delivered to the company at Louisville, February 23, and was delivered by the company to the consignee at New York, March 4. It was shown that the car was taken out of Louisville, February 23, on a train of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that it should have gone to Pittsburgh without transfer. There was no other evidence in respect of the intended or actual movement of the car. There was evidence tending to show that the ordinary time of a passenger train on the Pennsylvania Railroad \n\n[268 U.S. 85, 92]\n\u00a0\n between Louisville and New York was 25 or 26 hours. But there was no evidence that such shipments usually moved or that this shipment could have moved on any train making that time, or to show the time usually made by trains upon which such shipments were or could be moved. There was no evidence to show what was the customary or usual time for the transportation and delivery of such shipments. The trial judge held that such reasonable time was not more than 30 hours. We think the evidence was not sufficient to sustain that finding or to show what was a reasonable time for such transportation and delivery. It follows that there was nothing to give rise to any inference or presumption that failure to deliver at destination within 30 hours was due to negligence or to support a finding that there was any loss or damage due to delay caused by carelessness or negligence of the company. The evidence of market value of such eggs in New York City was as follows: February 25th, 53 cents per dozen; February 26th, 52 to 53 cents; March 1st, 36 cents; March 2d, 35.5 to 36 cents; March 4th, 36.5 cents. The eggs in question were sold March 4th-some for 35 cents, some for 35.5, and the rest for 36.5 per dozen. There was no evidence of market value at any other time. The court directed a verdict in favor of respondent for $3,396.26, the difference between the amount for which the eggs were sold March 4th and their value calculated at 53 cents per dozen, the price prevailing February 25th, with interest. The date when the eggs should have been delivered to consignee and the market value at that time were essential to respondent's case. In the absence of either, the amount of the loss, if any, cannot be determined. The judgment given cannot be sustained.\n Reversed and remanded, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Hailey v. Oregon Short Line R. Co.

Pogue and Harry M. Hoffheimer, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff in error Beazell.\n Mr. Frank F. Dinsmore, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff in error Chatfield.\n Mr. John Wilson Brown, III, of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error were jointly indicted in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, Ohio, for the crime of embezzlement, a felony. On February 13, 1923, the date of the offense as charged, Ohio General Code,  13677, provided:\n'When two or more persons are jointly indicted for a felony, on application to the court for that purpose, each shall be tried separately.'\n\n In April of the same year, before the indictment, which was returned on October 25, this section was amended (110 Ohio Laws, p. 301) so as to provide:\n\n\n[269 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n 'When two or more persons are jointly indicted for a felony, except a capital offense, they shall be tried jointly, unless the court for good cause shown, on application therefor by the prosecuting attorney, or one or more of said defendants order that one or more of said defendants shall be tried separately.'\n By another section, the amended act was made applicable to trials for offenses committed before the amendment.\n The defendants severally made motions for separate trials on the ground that their defenses would be different, that each would be prejudiced by the introduction of evidence admissible against his codefendant, but inadmissible as to him, and that they were entitled to separate trials as a matter of right, specifically charging that as applied to their own indictment and trial, 'the amendment to the statutes of Ohio making the granting of said application for a separate trial discretionary with the trial court, is an ex post facto law within the restrictions imposed by article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States,' which provides that 'no state shall ... pass any ... ex post facto law.'\n Both motions were denied, the joint trial and conviction of the defendants followed, and in proceedings duly had in which the constitutional question was raised, their conviction was sustained by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The case comes before this court on motions to dismiss the writs of error or to affirm the judgment below.\n It is settled, by decisions of this court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done, which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post \n\n[269 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n facto. The constitutional prohibition and the judicial interpretation of it rest upon the notion that laws, whatever their form, which purport to make innocent acts criminal after the event, or to aggravate an offense, are harsh and oppressive, and that the criminal quality attributable to an act, either by the legal definition of the offense or by the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission, should not be altered by legislative enactment, after the fact, to the disadvantage of the accused.\n But the state of Ohio here drawn in question affects only the manner in which the trial of those jointly accused shall be conducted. It does not deprive the plaintiffs in error of any defense previously available, nor affect the criminal quality of the act charged. Nor does it change the legal definition of the offense or the punishment to be meted out. The quantum and kind of proof required to establish guilt, and all questions which may be considered by the court and jury in determining guilt or innocence, remain the same.\n Expressions are to be found in earlier judicial opinions to the effect that the constitutional limitation may be transgressed by alterations in the rules of evidence or procedure. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390; Cummings v. State of Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 326; Kring v. Missouri, \n107 \nU.S. 221, 228\n, 232 S., 2 S. Ct. 443. And there may be procedural changes which operate to deny to the accused a defense available under the laws in force at the time of the commission of his offense, or which otherwise affect him in such a harsh and arbitrary manner as to fall within the constitutional prohibition. Kring v. Missouri, \n107 \nU.S. 221\n, 2 S. Ct. 443; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343\n, 18 S. Ct. 620. But it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited. A statute which, after indictment, enlarges \n\n[269 U.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n the class of persons who may be witnesses at the trial, by removing the disqualification of persons convicted of felony, is not an ex post facto law. Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 575\n, 4 S. Ct. 202, 28 8l. Ed. 262; nor is a S. 575, 4 S. Ct. 202; nor is a after the indictment so as to render admissible against the accused evidence previously held inadmissible, Thompson v. Missouri, \n171 \nU.S. 380\n, 18 S. Ct. 922; or which changes the place of trial, Gut v. Minnesota, 9 Wall. 35; or which abolishes a court for hearing criminal appeals, creating a new one in its stead. See Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S. Ct. 570.\n Just what alterations of procedure will be held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition cannot be embraced within a formula or stated in a general proposition. The distinction is one of degree. But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, \n237 \nU.S. 180, 183\n, 35 S. Ct. 507, and not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance, see Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565, 590\n, 16 S. Ct. 904; Thompson v. Missouri, supra, 386, 18 S. Ct. 922; Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 \nU.S. 589, 597\n, 21 S. Ct. 730\n\n\n The legislation here concerned restored a mode of trial deemed appropriate at common law, with discretionary power in the court to direct separate trials. We do not regard it as harsh or oppressive as applied to the plaintiffs in error, or as affecting any right or immunity more substantial than did the statute which changed the qualification of jurors, upheld in Gibson v. Mississippi, supra; or the statute which granted to the state an appeal from an intermediate appellate court, upheld in Mallet v. North Carolina, supra. Obviously the statute here is less burdensome to the accused than those involved in Hopt v. Utah, supra, and Thompson v. Missouri, supra.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEHN, MEYER & CO. v. MILLER(1925)\nNo. 343\nArgued: November 24, 1924Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. D. Guthrie, of New York, City, for appellant.\n Mr. Merrill E. Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Since December, 1905, the appellant, Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited, has been a corporation organized under the laws of the Straits Settlements, a crown colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It has never been a resident of nor has it done business within the territory of any nation at war with the United States since April 6, 1917, or an ally of such nation. Prior to February, 1918, under the supervision of Menzi, a stockholder and citizen of Switzerland, it carried on business in the Philippine Islands. During that month, and while subjects of Germany held most of its stock, the Alien Property Custodian, claiming authority under the Trading with the Enemy Act, seized and converted into cash the corporation's assets found in those islands. The proceeds are held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States.\n Alleging that its property had been improperly seized and the proceeds were being unjustly withheld, the company brought suit to recover them in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, July 28, 1922. Upon motion the trial court dismissed the petition and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree.\n Following much consideration, Congress passed the original Trading with the Enemy Act, approved October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 411, c. 106 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 a-3115 1\/2 ff, 3115 1\/2 g- 3115 1\/2 j]). It is long (19 sections), rather complicated, and evinces the purpose to clothe the President with definitely restricted powers in respect of seizing property of those designated as enemies. It has been amended several times but has always contained the original provisions ( section 9 [section 3115 1\/2 e]) allowing recovery \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n of seized property which did not in fact belong to an enemy. 'By section 9, as twice amended, any one, 'not an enemy or ally of enemy,' claiming any interest, right or title in any money or other property so sequestered and held may give notice of his claim and institute a suit in equity. ... [ The act] distinctly reserves to any claimant who is neither an enemy nor an ally of an enemy a right to assert and establish his claim by a suit in equity unembarrassed by the precedent executive determination. Not only so, but pending the suit, which the claimant may bring as promptly after the seizure as he chooses, the property is to be retained by the Custodian to abide the result and, if the claimant prevails, is to be forthwith returned to him. Thus there is provision for the return of property mistakenly sequestered; and we have no hesitation in pronouncing it adequate, for it enables the claimant, as of right, to obtain a full hearing on his claim in a court having power to enforce it if found meritorious.' Stoeher v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 246 S., 41 S. Ct. 293, 295, 296 (65 L. Ed. 604); Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, \n262 \nU.S. 51\n, 43 S. Ct. 486.\n Section 2 (section 3115 1\/2 aa), which has remained unchanged, declares that 'person' shall include corporation or body politic and the word 'enemy' shall be deemed to mean:\n'(a) Any individual, partnership, or other body of individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (including that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation with which the United States is at war, or resident outside the United States and doing business within such territory, and any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory.\n\n'(b) The government of any nation with which the United States is at war, or any political or municipal subdivision \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n thereof, or any officer, official, agent, or agency thereof.\n\n'(c) Such other individuals, or body or class of individuals, as may be natives, citizens, or subjects of any nation with which the United States is at war, other than citizens of the United States, wherever resident or wherever doing business, as the President, if he shall find the safety of the United States or the successful prosecution of the war shall so require, may, by proclamation, include within the term 'enemy.\"\n\n Also, the words 'ally of enemy' shall be deemed to mean:\n'(a) Any individual, partnership, or other body of individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (including that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation which is an ally of a nation with which the United States is a war, or resident outside the United States and doing business within such territory, and any corporation incorporated within such territory of such ally nation, or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory.\n\n'(b) The government of any nation which is an ally of a nation with which the United States is at war, or any political or municipal subdivision of such ally nation, or any officer, official, agent, or agency thereof.\n\n'(c) Such other individuals, or body or class of individuals, as may be natives, citizens, or subjects of any nation which is an ally of a nation with which the United States is at war, other than citizens of the United States, wherever resident or wherever doing business, as the President, if he shall find the safety of the United States or the successful prosecution of the war shall so require, may, by proclamation, include within the term 'ally of enemy.\"\n\n After prohibiting trade with, for or on account of any enemy or ally of enemy, and making sundry provisions \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n for licenses, appointment of an Alien Property Custodian, reports to him, etc., etc., the original act provided:\n'Sec. 7(c). If the President shall so require, any money or other property owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owing or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian.' \n1\n Section 3115 1\/2 d.\n\n'Sec. 9. That any person, not an enemy, or ally of enemy claiming any interest, right, or title in any money or other property which may have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian hereunder, and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States ... may file with the said Custodian a notice of his claim under oath and in such form and containing such particulars as the said Custodian shall require; and the President, if application is made therefor by the claimant, may, with the assent of the owner of said property and of all persons claiming any right, title, or interest therein, order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n or of the interest therein to which the President shall determine said claimant is entitled. ... If the President shall not so order within sixty days after the filing of such application, or if the claimant shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made no application to the President, said claimant may, at any time before the expiration of six months [enlarged to eighteen months by Act Dec. 21, 1921, c. 13, 42 Stat. 351 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e)] after the end of the war, institute a suit in equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia [Act July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35] or in the District Court of the United States for the district in which such claimant resides, or, if a corporation, where it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed. ...' Section 31151\/2 e.\n\n Section 9 was materially amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977. The original section, quoted above, was reenacted as subsection (a). It provides for recovery when the seized property belonged to one not an 'enemy or ally of enemy,' where the taking was in fact without warrant of law. Six subsections-(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g)- were added. Subsection (b) permits recovery by some within the definition of 'enemy' whose properly had been lawfully seized. Each of its eight numbered paragraphs include such persons. Subsection (c) and those parts of subsection (b) here specially important follow. All of subsection (b) is printed below. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[266 U.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 9, subsec. (b) In respect of all money or other property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, if the President shall determine that the owner thereof at the time such money or other property was required to be so conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or at the time when it was voluntarily delivered to him or was seized by him was-...\n'Par. (6) A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals outside the United States, \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n or a corporation incorporated within any country other than the United States, and was entirely owned at such time by subjects or citizens of nations, states, or free cities other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary and is so owned at the time of the return of its money or other property hereunder; ... Then the President, without any application being made therefor, may order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of such money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States, or of the interest therein to which the President shall determine such person \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 469]\n\u00a0\n entitled, either to the said owner or to the person by whom said property was conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian. ...\n\n'Subsec. (c) Any person whose property the President is authorized to return under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof may file notice of claim for the return of such property, as provided in subsection ( a) hereof, and thereafter may make application to the President for allowance of such claim and\/or may institute suit in equity to recover such property, as provided in said subsection, and with like effect. The President \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 470]\n\u00a0\n or the court, as the case may be, may make the same determinations with respect to citizenship and other relevant facts that the President is authorized to make under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof.'\n\n Section 9 was further amended by the Act of March 4, 1923, c. 285, 42 Stat. 1511, 1512, 1513, by adding to subsection (b) three new paragraphs-9, 10, and 11. Each of these empowers certain persons to recover property or funds held by the Alien Property Custodian and is broad enough to include some always within the general definition of 'enemy.' Paragraph 11 follows:\n'Subsec. (b), par. (11) A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, having its principal place of business within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, or a corporation, organized or incorporated within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, and that the control of, or more than 50 percentum \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 471]\n\u00a0\n of the interests or voting power in, any such partnership, association, other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, was at such time, and is at the time of the return of any money or other property, vested in citizens or subjects of nations, States, or free cities other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary: Provided, however, that this subsection shall not affect any rights which any citizen or subject may have under paragraph (1) of this subsection.'\n\n Appellant maintains that it was never an enemy or ally of enemy within the statutory definitions; that only property of persons so described was properly subject to seizure; and, as it was neither enemy nor ally of enemy, the provisions of section 9, subsection (a) (always part of the act) in plain terms permit it to recover unlawfully seized property or the proceeds.\n On the other side the insistence is that subsection (c) of section 7 permitted seizure of appellant's property because held 'on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of' stockholders, the majority of whom were enemy subjects of Germany. Further, that although appellant's property may have been taken originally without authority, return of it is now impliedly prohibited by subsection (b) of section 9, as amended (acts of 1920 and 1923), since this subsection applies in terms to 'all money or other property conveyed transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States,' whether taken lawfully or no. Paragraphs 6 and 11 are specially relied upon, and it is said that they specify the only classes of corporations now permitted to recover and do not include appellant.\n We think subsection (a) of section 9 gives now, as the same words gave from the first, the right of recovery to any person never 'an enemy or ally of enemy,' within the statutory definitions. Stoehr v. Wallace, supra. The \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 472]\n\u00a0\n contrary view, urged by appellees, would greatly qualify, perhaps delete, this subsection, and would place the United States in the unenviable position of positively refusing, after hostilities had ended, to give up property which had been taken contrary to their own laws. It would require very clear words to convince us that Congress intended any such thing.\n Subsection (b) adds to those allowed to recover from the first a considerable number always within the definition of 'enemy' and affords to them the measure of relief which Congress deemed proper long after peace had been actually restored. And this accords with the spirit of the provision in section 12 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 ff):\n'After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money or other property received and held by the Alien Property Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury, shall be settled as Congress shall direct.'\n\n Before its passage the original Trading with the Enemy Act was considered in the light of difficulties certain to follow disregard of corporate identity and efforts to fix the status of corporations as enemy or not according to the nationality of stockholders. These had been plainly indicated by the diverse opinions in Daimler Company, Limited, v. Continental Tyre & Rubber Company, etc., 2 A. C. (1916) 307, decided June 30, 1916\n\n\n Section 7, subsection (c), was never intended, we think, to empower the President to seize corporate property merely because of enemy stockholders' interests therein. Corporations are brought within the carefully framed definitions (section 2) of 'enemy' and 'ally of enemy' by the words: Any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war [or any nation which is an ally of such nation] or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory. And \n\n[266 U.S. 457, 473]\n\u00a0\n we find no adequate support for the suggestion that Congress authorized the taking of property of other corporations because one or more stockholders were enemies. Logically carried out this view would have permitted the seizure of all property of companies incorporated by any associated power-e. g., Great Britain-solely because some German held one share of the many thousands. The result indicates that the premise is bad. What the President might do was plainly set down in well-considered words.\n The challenged decree must be reversed and the cause will be remanded to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whether the objection would be good if it turned entirely on the words of section 7c, on which the plaintiff relies, we need not consider; for they obviously are qualified and explained by section 5, which very plainly enables the President to exercise his power under section 7c 'through such officer or officers as he shall direct.' By the orders already noticed the President directed that this power be exercised through the Alien Property Custodian. It therefore is as if the words relied on had been 'which the President, acting through the Alien Property Custodian, shall determine after investigation' is enemy-owned, etc. In short, a personal determination by the President is not required; he may act through the Custodian, and a determination by the latter is in effect the act of the President.'

RATNER(1925)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 5, 1923Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 353, 354]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Selden Bacon, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 353, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis S. Posner, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Hub Carpet Company was adjudicated bankrupt by the federal court for Southern New York in involuntary proceedings commenced September 26, 1921. Benedict, who was appointed receiver and later trustee, collected the book accounts of the company. Ratner filed in that court a petition in equity praying that the amounts so collected be paid over to him. He claimed them under a writing given May 23, 1921-four months and three days before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. By it the company purported to assign to him, as collateral for certain loans, all accounts present and future. Those collected by the receiver were, so far as \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 358]\n\u00a0\n appears, all accounts which had arisen after the date of the assignment, and were enumerated in the monthly list of accounts outstanding which was delivered to Ratner September 23. Benedict resisted the petition on the ground that the original assignment was void under the law of New York as a fraudulent conveyance; that, for this reason, the delivery of the September list of accounts was inoperative to perfect a lien in Ratner; and that it was a preference under the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585- 9656). He also filed a cross-petition in which he asked that Ratner be ordered to pay to the estate the proceeds of certain collections which had been made by the company after September 17 and turned over to Ratner pursuant to his request made on that day. The company was then insolvent and Ratner had reason to believe it to be so. These accounts also had apparently been acquired by the company after the date of the original assignment.\n The District Judge decided both petitions in Ratner's favor. He ruled that the assignment executed in May was not fraudulent in law; that it created an equity in the future acquired accounts; that, because of this equity, Ratner was entitled to retain, as against the bankrupt's estate, the proceeds of the accounts which had been collected by the company in September and turned over to him; that by delivery of the list of the accounts outstanding on September, 23, this equity in them had ripened into a perfect title to the remaining accounts; and that the title so perfected was good as against the supervening bankruptcy. Accordingly, the District Court ordered that, to the extent of the balance remaining unpaid on his loans, there be paid Ratner all collections made from accounts enumerated in any of the lists delivered to Ratner; and that the cross- petition of Benedict be denied. There was no finding of fraud in fact. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order. 282 F. 12. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n259 \nU.S. 579\n, 42 S. Ct. 591. \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 359]\n\u00a0\n The rights of the parties depend primarily upon the law of New York. Hiscock v. Varick Bank of N. Y., \n206 \nU.S. 28\n, 27 S. Ct. 681. It may be assumed that, unless the arrangement of May 23 was void because fraudulent in law, the original assignment of the future acquired accounts became operative under the state law, both as to those paid over to Ratner before the bankruptcy proceedings and as to those collected by the receiver;1 and that the assignment will be deemed to have taken effect as of May 23. Sexton v. Kessler, \n225 \nU.S. 90, 99\n, 32 S. Ct. 657. That being so, it is clear that, if the original assignment was a valid one under the law of New York, the Bankruptcy Act did not invalidate the subsequent dealings of the parties. Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 \nU.S. 516\n, 25 S. Ct. 306; Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 \nU.S. 91\n, 25 S. Ct. 567. The sole question for decision is, therefore, whether on the following undisputed facts the assignment of May 23 was in law fraudulent.\n The Hub Carpet Company was, on May 23, a mercantile concern doing business in New York City and proposing to continue to do so. The assignment was made there to secure an existing loan of $15,000, and further advances not exceeding $15,000 which were in fact made July 1, 1921. It included all accounts receivable then outstanding and all which should thereafter accrue in the ordinary course of business. A list of the existing accounts was delivered at the time. Similar lists were to be delivered to Ratner on or about the 23d day of each succeeding month containing the accounts outstanding at such future dates. Those enumerated in each of the lists delivered prior to September aggregated between $100, 000, and $120,000. The receivables were to be collected by the company. Ratner was given the right, at any time, to \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 360]\n\u00a0\n demand a full disclosure of the business and financial conditions; to require that all amounts collected be applied in payment of his loans; and to enforce the assignment although no loan had matured. But until he did so, the company was not required to apply any of the collections to the repayment of Ratner's loan. It was not required to replace accounts collected by other collateral of equal value. It was not required to account in any way to Ratner. It was at liberty to use the proceeds of all accounts collected as it might see fit. The existence of the assignment was to be kept secret. The business was to be conducted as theretofore. Indebtedness was to be incurred, as usual, for the purchase of merchandise and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. The amount of such indebtedness unpaid at the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings was large. Prior to September 17, the company collected from accounts so assigned about $150,000, all of which it applied to purposes other than the payment of Ratner's loan. The outstanding accounts enumerated in the list delivered September 23 aggregated $90,000.\n Under the law of New York a transfer of property as security which reserves to the transferor the right to dispose of the same, or to apply the proceeds thereof, for his own uses, is, as to creditors, fraudulent in law and void. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[268 U.S. 353, 361]\n\u00a0\n This is true whether the right of disposition for the transferor's use be reserved in the instrument3 or by agreement in pais, oral or written;4 whether the right of disposition reserved be unlimited in time5 or be expressly terminable by the happening of an event;6 whether the transfer cover all the property of the debtor7 or only a part;8 whether the right of disposition extends to all the property transferred9 or only to a part thereof;10 and whether the instrument of transfer be recorded or not. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n If this rule applies to the assignment of book accounts, the arrangement of May 23 was clearly void; and the equity in the future acquired accounts, which it would otherwise have created,12 did not arise. Whether the rule applies to accounts does not appear to have been passed upon by the Court of Appeals of New York. But it would seem clear that whether the collateral consist of chattels \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 362]\n\u00a0\n or of accounts, reservation of dominion inconsistent with the effective disposition of title must render the transaction void. Ratner asserts that the rule stated above rests upon ostensible ownership, and argues that the doctrine of ostensible ownership ship is not applicable to book accounts. That doctrine raises a presumption of fraud where chattels are mortgaged ( or sold) and possession of the property is not delivered to the mortgagee ( or vendee).13 The presumption may be avoided by recording the mortgage (or sale). It may be assumed, as Ratner contends, that the doctrine does not apply to the assignment of accounts. In their transfer there is nothing which corresponds to the delivery of possession of chattels. The statutes which embody the doctrine and provide for recording as a substitute for delivery do not include accounts. A title to an account good against creditors may be transferred without notice to the debtor14 or record of any kind. \n15\n But it is \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 363]\n\u00a0\n not true that the rule stated above and invoked by the receiver is either based upon or delimited by the doctrine of ostensible ownership. It rests not upon seeming ownership because of possession retained, but upon a lack of ownership because of dominion reserved. It does not raise a presumption of fraud. It imputes fraud conclusively because of the reservation of dominion inconsistent with the effective disposition of title and creation of a lien.\n The nature of the rule is made clear by its limitations. Where the mortgagor of chattels agrees to apply the proceeds of their sale to the payment of the mortgage debt or to the purchase of other chattels which shall become subject to the lien, the mortgage is good as against creditors, if recorded. \n16\n The mortgage is sustained in such cases 'upon the ground that such sale and application of proceeds is the normal and proper purpose of a chattel mortgage, and within the precise boundaries of its lawful operation and effect. It does no more than to substitute the mortgagor as the agent of the mortgagee to do exactly what the latter had the right to do, and what it was his privilege and his duty to accomplish. It devotes, as it should, the mortgaged property to the payment of the mortgage debt.' The permission to use the proceeds to furnish substitute collateral 'provides only for a shifting of the lien from one piece of property to another taken in exchange.' Brackett v. Harvey, 91 N. Y. 214, 221, 223. \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 364]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand, if the agreement is that the mortgagor may sell and use the proceeds for his own benefit, the mortgage is of no effect although recorded. Seeming ownership exists in both classes of cases because the mortgagor is permitted to remain in possession of the stock in trade and to sell it freely. But it is only where the unrestricted dominion over the proceeds is reserved to the mortgagor that the mortgage is void. This dominion is the differentiating and deciding element. The distinction was recognized in Sexton v. Kessler, \n225 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 32 S. Ct. 657, where a transfer of securities was sustained. \n17\n It was pointed out that a reservation of full control by the mortgagor might well prevent the effective creation of a lien in the mortgagee and that the New York cases holding such a mortgage void rest upon that doctrine.\n The results which flow from reserving dominion inconsistent with the effective disposition of title must be the same whatever the nature of the property transferred. The doctrine which imputes fraud where full dominion is reserved must apply to assignments of accounts although the doctrine of ostensible ownership does not. There must also be the same distinction as to degrees of dominion. Thus, although an agreement that the assignor of accounts shall collect them and pay the proceeds to the assignee will not invalidate the assignment which it accompanies,18 the assignment must be deemed fraudulent in law if it is agreed that the assignor may use the proceeds as he sees fit.\n In the case at bar the arrangement for the unfettered use by the company of the proceeds of the accounts precluded \n\n[268 U.S. 353, 365]\n\u00a0\n the effective creation of a lien19 and rendered the original assignment fraudulent in law. Consequently the payments to Ratner and the delivery of the September list of accounts were inoperative to perfect a lien in him, and were unlawful preferences. \n20\n On this ground, and also because the payment was fraudulent under the law of the State, the trustee was entitled to recover the amount. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Stackhouse v. Holden, 66 App. Div. 423, 73 N. Y. S. 203, is relied upon by Ratner to establish the proposition that reservation of dominion does not invalidate an assignment of accounts. The decision was by an intermediate appellate court, and, although decided in 1901, appears never to have been cited since in any court of that state. \n22\n There was a strong dissenting opinion. Moreover, the case is perhaps distinguishable on its facts, page 426. Greey v. Dockendorff, \n231 \nU.S. 513\n, 34 S. Ct. 166, upon which Ratner also relies, has no bearing on the case at bar. It involved assignment of accounts, but there was no retention of dominion by the bankrupt. The sole question was whether successive assignments of accounts by way of security, made in pursuance of a contract, were bad because the contract embraced all the accounts. The lien acquired before knowledge by either party of insolvency was held good against the trustee.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Williams v. Ingersoll, 89 N.

By her will made in 1912, which was duly probated, she devised the entire allotment to Juanita and Oleta Blundell, her great granddaughters, bequeathing to her husband only a nominal sum. Defendant in error asserts title through mesne conveyances vesting in him the interest of David H. Poff. His suit is based on the provisions of section 8341, Rev. Laws Okl. 1910 (section 11224, Comp. Stat. Okl. 1921), which reads:\n'Every estate and interest in real or personal property to which heirs, husband, widow, or next of kin might succeed, may be disposed of by will: Provided, that no marriage contract in writing has been entered into between the parties; no man while married shall bequeath \n\n[267 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n more than two-thirds of his property away from his wife, nor shall any woman while married bequeath more than two-thirds of her property away from her husband: Provided, further, that no person who is prevented by law from alienating, conveying or encumbering real property while living shall be allowed to bequeath same by will.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error contend that this statute as applied to Patsy Poff's will is in direct conflict with section 23 of the Act of Congress of April 26, 1906, disposing of the affairs of the Five Civilized Tribes ( 34 Stat. 137, 145, c. 1876), and therefore invalid. Section 23 is as follows:\n'Every person of lawful age and sound mind may by last will and testament devise and bequeath all of his estate, real and personal, and all interest therein: Provided, that no will of a full-blood Indian devising real estate shall be valid, if such last will and testament disinherits the parent, wife, spouse, or children of such full-blood Indian, unless acknowledged before and approved by a judge of the United States Court for the Indian Territory, or a United States commissioner.'\n\n There was an amendment in 1908 in a detail not important here. It was held below that the state statute applied, that there was no conflict with the federal statute, that defendant in error was entitled to recover, and the decree went accordingly. 96 Okl. 26, 220 P. 40.\n A brief reference to the state of the law at the time of the passage of section 23 will help to clear the way for a correct determination of the question. By sections 12 and 16 of the Supplemental Agreement with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, ratified by the Act of July 1, 1902, supra, lands of the kind here involved were declared to be inalienable during specified periods of time. It is settled that this restriction against alienation extended to a disposition by will, Taylor v. Parker, \n235 \nU.S. 42\n, 35 S. Ct. 22, and, but for section 23, it is plain that the devise in question, at least as to the homestead, would have been without effect. \n\n[267 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n But, it must be borne in mind, the restriction was in respect of the specified lands and did not affect the testamentary power of the Indians to dispose of their alienable property, which power, on the contrary, has been fully recognized, first, by an extension of the appropriate laws of Arkansas over the Indian Territory, and then, upon the admission of the state of Oklahoma, by the substitution therefor of Oklahoma law. Taylor v. Parker, supra; Jefferson v. Fink, \n247 \nU.S. 288, 294\n, 38 S. Ct. 516. The general policy of Congress, prior to the adoption of section 23, plainly had been to consider the local law of descents and wills applicable to the persons and estates of Indians except in so far as it was otherwise provided. Thus, by section 2 of the Act of April 28, 1904, c. 1824, 33 Stat. 573, the laws of Arkansas, theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory, were expressly 'continued and extended in their operation, so as to embrace all persons and estates in said territory, whether Indian, freedmen, or otherwise,' and jurisdiction was conferred upon the courts of the Territory in the settlement of the estates of decedents, etc., whether Indian, freedmen, or otherwise.\n Section 23 must be read in the light of this policy; and, so reading it, we agree with the ruling of the state supreme court that Congress intended thereby to enable 'the Indian to dispose of his estate on the same footing as any other citizen, with the limitation contained in the proviso thereto.' The effect of section 23 was to remove a restriction theretofore existing upon the testamentary power of the Indians, leaving the regulatory local law free to operate as in the case of other persons and property. There is nothing in Blanset v. Cardin, \n256 \nU.S. 319\n, 41 S. Ct. 519, cited to the contrary, which militates against this view. That case involved the will of a Quapaw woman devising her restricted lands away from her husband. It was held that section 8341 of the Oklahoma laws did not apply because it was in conflict with an act of Congress. But the act there \n\n[267 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n considered was very different from the one now under review. There the authority to dispose of restricted property by will was limited by the provisions of the Act of February 14, 1913, c. 55, 37 Stat. 678 (Comp. St .  4228), that the will must be 'in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior,' and that no will 'shall be valid or have any force or effect unless and until it shall have been approved' by that officer. By this language the intent of Congress to exclude the local law and to establish the regulations of the Secretary as alone controlling was made evident; and it was so held. But here the federal statute contains no provision of like character; it is without qualification except in the single particular set forth in the proviso; and, clearly, it does not stand in the way of the operation of the local law.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOHLER v. CALLAWAY(1925)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n The bill sought to enjoin the levy of executions on delinquent tax assessments of the tax receiver of Richmond county, Ga., against the estate of J. B. White, for the seven years from 1911 to 1917. The assessments were as follows:\n Tax\n Assessment, 1911 $1,000,866.87 $13,552.20 \" 1912 1,399,161.67 18,888.68 \" 1913 1,558,300.83 22,751.19 \" 1914 1,548,735.38 21,527.42 \" 1915 1,439,160.83 21,011.75 \" 1916 1,509,936.00 22,347.05 \" 1917 1,623,567.52 25,490.01\n\n The aggregate amount of the executions was $145,568.30, with interest thereon to the date when issued July 28, 1918, of $70,764.01, or a total of principal and interest of $216,332.01.\n The bill of the complainant, who was White's executor, asked an injunction on two grounds. One was that in the sum assessed were national bank stocks, which under section 5219, R. S. (Comp. St.  9784), should have been assessed for taxation in New York City where the banks were and not in Georgia, \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n and also stock in a Georgia railway exempt from taxation by the state law.\n The second ground was that the assessment of the stocks and other securities was at their full market value, whereas in Georgia and in Richmond county property of this class in the hands of others was generally and intentionally assessed by the taxing officers at less than 25 percent of such value, and that such discrimination was unlawful under the statutes and constitution of Georgia and would work a denial of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n J. B. White, a native of Ireland, came to Georgia in 1866, and resided there continuously until 1909. He never was naturalized. In 1909 he went abroad and died at Genoa, Italy, in March, 1917, leaving a will, in which he described himself as of Richmond county, in that state, and named the complainant, E. H. Callaway, as his executor. The executor probated the will and filed an inventory of the estate in the court of the ordinary During the seven years-1911 to 1917-White had returned for taxation his real estate in Richmond county amounting to $600,000 and $300 of household and kitchen furniture, but no other personal property. After the probate of the will, the tax receiver of the county demanded of the executor returns of taxation for seven years on the securities shown in the inventory. The certificates of stock and the bonds were physically in possession of Henry Clews & Co. in New York. The executor insisted (though he subsequently abandoned the claim) that they are not subject to taxation in Georgia, for the reason that White was a nonresident. The tax receiver withdrew his demand. Thereafter the board of county commissioners directed institution of proceedings in mandamus to compel the tax receiver to assess this property as delinquent. The suit for mandamus, \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n though it did not go to a rule absolute, brought out from a member of the firm of Clews & Co. evidence of the exact amount and value of the property which White had left with them. The tax receiver then made the assessments at full market value. The executor demanded arbitration as provided by section 1059 of the Georgia Code of 1910 and the General Arbitration Act. Acts of Georgia of 1910, pp. 22, 24, as codified in Park's Annotated Code 1914,  1116(d). The latter section directed the county tax receiver to assess property at the valuation fixed by the taxpayer in the return, if satisfactory, and, if not, within 30 days to make an assessment on the best information he could procure and notify the taxpayer. The latter might by a demand within 20 days have the question of true value referred to arbitrators, one selected by him, one by the tax receiver, and a third by the other two, and in default of their agreement, by the board of county commissioners. In this case the executor selected his arbitrator, the tax receiver his, and the county commissioners selected the third. On the day of the meeting of the arbitrators, the state applied to the superior court of the county for an injunction to prevent their further proceeding; but the application was denied. The issue was then heard by the arbitrators, the state and county appearing and taking part therein by counsel. The arbitrators made an award fixing the valuation at 25 per cent. of the market value of the securities and the same was 'fastened in tax digest of the county for the year 1917.' The tax collector calculated the taxes due and submitted the amount to the executor as $27,980.88. This sum the executor tendered as full payment of the taxes due. On advice of counsel representing the state the collector declined it. The state and county then filed a second petition in the superior court to enjoin the tax receiver and the tax collector from making the assessments and collections according to the arbitra- \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n tion. The superior court held the petition insufficient on demurrer and dismissed the application. Meantime the first application to enjoin the proceedings in arbitration reached the Supreme Court and the superior court was sustained in refusing the injunction. Georgia v. Callaway, 150 Ga. 235, 103 S. E. 792. When the second application for injunction reached the Supreme Court, two of the judges out of six (only four being present) held that an act of 1918 (Acts of Georgia of 1918, No. 270, p. 232) repealed the section of the act of 1910 on which the arbitration had preceded and rendered it void, and that therefore the original assessments made by the tax receiver were valid, the executions could issue, and no injunction was necessary. Of the other two judges, one held that the act of 1918 did not prevent the arbitration proceedings in which the state participated. The other held that the state had not put itself in a position to object to the assessment of the arbitrators, because its only complaint was that the award was fraudulent and it had not made out its case, and that the effect of the act of 1918 it was not necessary for the court to decide. So an injunction was a second time refused. Georgia v. Callaway, 152 Ga. 871, 111 S. E. 563.\n The second decision was made March 4, 1922. On March 9th following, tax executions on the assessments made by the tax receiver July 28, 1919, including those on the stock of the national banks of New York City, were issued. The executor thereupon again tendered payment of taxes and interest under the award of the arbitrators to the tax collector which was again declined.\n On March 22, 1922, the bill in the present case was filed, and after a hearing before three judges a temporary injunction was issued by the District Court. The state and the county and the tax officials were made defendants, and filed answers. Among other objections by them to the equitable relief sought was that though the \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n complainant in his bill admitted that there was due from him $27,980.88 to the tax receiver, it had not been paid, and the bill should be dismissed. Thereafter on the 25th of September, 1922, the executor tendered the sum of $27,980.88, and it was accepted, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties in the pending litigation. The executor then upon leave of court amended his bill and made the averment of the payment.\n The District Court after a full hearing sustained its jurisdiction, held that the award of the arbitrators was invalid and that the state and county were not estopped by the state court orders to attack it, enjoined execution of the assessments on the national bank and Georgia railway stocks as nontaxable, found unlawful discrimination in the assessments on the other securities, enjoined collection thereof to the extent of 75 per cent. and decreed against the complainant, interest on the 25 per cent. of the assessments already paid by him, from the date of his first tender until their actual payment. The cross-appeal of the executor raised in his assignments of error the validity of the award of the arbitration and the question of interest.\n Messrs. Benjamin E. Pierce, of Augusta, Ga., George M. Napier, of Atlanta, Ga., and Wm. K. Miller, of Augusta, Ga., for Bohler and others.\n Messrs. E. H. Callaway and William Howard, both of Augusta, Ga., for Calloway.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n First. A primary and preliminary question is that of the validity of the arbitration and award. The proceeding was initiated and award made under the act of 1910 \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n but it was not begun until July 28, 1919, a year after the act of 1918 claimed by appellants to have repealed the arbitration provision was enacted.\n The executor contends that the refusal of the state Supreme Court to enjoin the arbitration board from proceeding was res adjudicata as to its validity. There were no defensive pleadings. It was a decision upon an interlocutory injunction and was presumably made in the exercise of judicial discretion upon a balance of convenience as to halting the proceeding of arbitration before its conclusion. Chicago Great Western Ry. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 45 S. Ct. 55, 69 L. Ed. --. The court pointed out that the ruling it affirmed was only a pendente lite injunction. 150 Ga. 235, 103 S. E. 792. Neither the court nor counsel referred to or considered the act of 1918. Its effect upon the arbitration proceeding does not seem to have been called to the attention of either. To give finality to such a temporary ruling would be contrary to the principles governing estoppel by judgment. Santowsky v. McKey, 249 F. 51, 161 C. C. A. 111; Knox v. Alwood (D. C.) 228 F. 753; Webb v. Buckalew, 82 N. Y. 555. When the case came again to the Supreme Court on the second application for injunction by the tax authorities, it was dismissed for varying reasons of the four judges. Certainly in view of the holding by two of them that the act of 1918 repealed the provision for arbitration, it could not be said to be a judgment binding the parties to the validity of the award. We agree with the District Judge that no estoppel grew out of the injunction suits.\n Second. Did the act of 1918 render the award a nullity? Two of the state Supreme Court judges held that it did. Four federal judges have agreed with them. The sections of the act of 1918 here applicable were the first, third fifth, seventh, and eighth. By the first section when the owner of property had omitted to return the same for taxation at the time and for the \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n years the return should have been made, he, or, if he was dead, his personal representative, was required to return the property for taxation for each year it was delinquent. By the third section when such property was of the class which should have been returned to the tax receiver of the county, the latter was to notify in writing the delinquent, or, if dead, his personal representative, requiring a return within 20 days. By the fifth section if the delinquent or his personal representative refused to return the property after notice the tax receiver was to assess the property from the best information he could obtain as to its value for the years in default and to notify such delinquent of the valuation which should be final unless the person or persons so notified raised the question that it was excessive, in which event the further procedure should be by petition in equity in the superior court of the county where such property was assessed. By the seventh section if the delinquent or his personal representative disputed the taxability of such property, he might also raise that question by petition in equity. By the eighth section all laws and parts of laws in conflict with the act were repealed.\n As already stated, by the laws in force before 1918, the remedy for the delinquent taxpayer was in case of excessive assessment to demand arbitration in 20 days. Obviously the act of 1918 gave to the taxpayer an opportunity to file a petition in equity to enjoin excessive assessment as a substitute for his previous remedy by arbitration. The repealing section though not specific, was quite broad enough to end a resort to arbitration under the old law.\n Third. Had the federal court jurisdiction to entertain the bill and enjoin the enforcement of the executions issued upon the assessments? Appellants cite Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Salm et al., \n258 \nU.S. 122\n, 42 S. Ct. 207, as indicating \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n the contrary. That was a bill in equity by a bridge company to enjoin a tax assessment by county assessors on a railroad bridge because of discrimination. The assessment made by the county assessors was subject to revision by a board of review required to give a hearing and to correct the assessment as should appear just. The payment of taxes was not to be enforced by distraint or levy, but by legal proceedings in a civil suit for the collection of a debt in which the owner might appear and defend on any legal ground, including discrimination. The complainant there brought his bill without taking any of the steps offered by the statute as an administrative remedy and ignored the defense he might make in the suit to collect the tax. The question here is different. The remedy to be taken by the taxpayer against excessive assessment is by petition in equity. That is a judicial proceeding. Such a proceeding is not administrative as the appeal to the Supreme Court was in the case of Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210\n, 29 S. Ct. 67. Nithing in the Georgia decisions shows that the petition here provided was other than a regular application to a court of equity for relief by injunction. Nothing indicates that the court was to make administrative assessment. It was only to enjoin excessive assessment. No reason existed why a federal court sitting in the same jurisdiction might not grant equitable relief to the taxpayer against the executions on the assessments, provided there be stated in the bill ground for federal equity jurisdiction. This was a suit of a civil nature under section 247 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1224 ), and arose under the Constitution of the United States. It was properly in equity because there was no adequate remedy at law, the assessments being final except as subject to equitable intervention. The Georgia law gives no right of action to recover taxes voluntarily paid even under protest on the ground that they were illegally assessed and collected. \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n Section 4317 of the Civil Code of Georgia of 1910 is as follows:\n'Payment of taxes or other claims, made through ignorance of the law, or where the facts are all known, and there is no misplaced confidence and no artifice, deception, or fraudulent practice used by the other party are deemed voluntary, and can not be recovered back, unless made under an urgent and immediate necessity therefor, or to release person or property from detention, or to prevent an immediate seizure of person or property. Filing a protest at the time of payment does not change the rule.'\n\n In Georgia the statutory methods for levy, assessment and collection of taxes are not merely cumulative they are exhaustive. Richmond County v. Steed, 150 Ga. 229, 103 S. E. 253; State v. Western & Atlantic R. R. Co., 136 Ga. 619, 71 S. E. 1055. It would seem to follow that the only remedy intended to be furnished in Georgia in such a case as this was by injunction in equity against excessive assessments. If the remedy by law is doubtful, equitable relief may be had. Wilson v. Ill. So. Ry., \n263 \nU.S. 574, 577\n, 44 S. Ct. 203; Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Weld County, \n247 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 286 S., 38 S. Ct. 510; Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 15 S. Ct. 555. The case seems to be quite like that of Cummings v. National Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n, in which under a statute of Ohio authorizing a suit for injunction to prevent the collection of illegal taxes, it was held that a bill would lie in the federal court to enjoin the collection of a tax as illegal because it discriminated against the shares of a national bank.\n Another objection to the bill is that the assessments made in July, 1919, have become final by the delay because this bill was not filed until March 11, 1922. It is argued that as the petition in equity takes the place of the arbitration proceeding and the arbitration proceeding had to be begun within 20 days after the notification to the taxpayer of the assessment, in some way or other the 20-day limitation is projected into the new act. \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n No statutory time limitation which would bar the resort to a petition or a bill in equity as filed in this case has been pointed out to us by counsel and we cannot infer one.\n We come now to the issue of discrimination. By the Constitution of Georgia (article 7, section 2) it is provided that:\n'All taxation shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws.'\n\n By the laws of Georgia all real and personal property, including stocks and securities in corporations in other states owned by citizens of Georgia, is to be returned and taxed at its fair market value; i. e., what it would bring at cash sale when sold in such manner as it is usually sold. Park's Annotated Code of Georgia 1914,  1002, 1002a, 1003, and 1004\n\n\n It is well settled that if the administration of the tax laws of a state is shown to result in an intentional and systematic discrimination against a complainant by a bill in a federal court, the court may grant relief by injunction under the state law without deciding the federal constitutional question upon which jurisdiction of the bill is based. Louis. & Nash. R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, 37 S. Ct. 683, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 97; Greene v. Louisville R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 514 S.-519, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Taylor v. L. & N. R. R. Co., 88 F. 350, 31 C. C. A. 537; Georgia Railroad v. Wright, 125 Ga. 589, 602, 603, 54 S. E. 52.\n Complainant's evidence to show that the valuation of real and personal property by the county officials was far below the market value in Richmond county and throughout the state of Georgia is convincing. It consists of reports and admissions by the comptroller general and the state tax commissioner, the chief taxing officers of the state, and of the testimony of past and present taxing officials of a great number of counties, \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 490]\n\u00a0\n some having large cities, and others without such cities in different parts of the state. In his report of 1920, the state tax commissioner said he thought it wise not to require more than 35 per cent. of the true value of real estate as a minimum basis for equalizing purposes, and be finally approved a comparative statement of counties showing the highest per cent. of true value of lands returned to be 60 and the lowest 25. The evidence further showed that the assessment of intangible personalty was at a much less percentage of true value than that of real estate. The fact seemed to be that stocks and bonds were not generally returned at all, and when they were returned they were assessed at a mere nominal figure. The condition in respect to the low valuations was attributed by several of the taxing officials, who were witnesses for the complainant, in part to the arbitration method. They said that if they attempted to impose anything like the real value, an arbitration was demanded, and the invariable result was a reduction of the assessment, so that there had come to be a generally understood acquiescence by county officials in low percentages. It was quite apparent that the undervaluation of both realty and personalty by county taxing officials in Richmond county and elsewhere in Georgia had become systematic and intentional. It would seem from the evidence and the reports that not more than 10 per cent. of stocks and bonds was taxed at all. The comptroller general's report for 1912 said that the system of assessment of such property was but little better than voluntary contributions of taxpayers to state's revenue. The recognition of these conditions seems to have led equalizers and assessors in fairness to scale down the assessment of stocks and bonds when returned. Hence we find that the board of tax assessors of Richmond county, a body whose duty it was to receive the regular annual returns from the tax receiver and equalize them as between individuals (Park's \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n Annotated Code 1914,  1116k), in determining the value of the White estate for taxing purposes for 1918-a current assessment the next year after those here in suit-fixed the value of the same stocks and bonds and intangibles at $250,000, or about 18 per cent. of their market value. Two of the assessors by affidavit testified from their experience that such percentage was at a higher rate than that at which such property when returned was usually assessed. The tax receiver who returned the property in this case at its full market value for the seven years testified before the board of arbitration that neither he nor the board of appraisers had ever taxed real estate at more than two-thirds of its value, mortgages or stocks at more than 50 per cent., and county property at more than 33 1\/3 per cent.\n Objection is made to the testimony of tax officials in this case, especially to that of the tax receiver, who fixed the 100 per cent. assessment in the present case, and to that of the members of the board of tax assessors and equalizers who assessed the value of the White estate for the year 1918. It is based upon the language of this court in C., B. & Q. Ry. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 27 S. Ct. 326. We do nto think that the citation has application here. That was a case where members of a state railway assessing board were called by the taxpayers and subjected to an elaborate cross-examination with reference to the operation of their minds in valuing and taxing the particular railroads whose assessment was there in question. It was held to be improper thus to impeach official awards. The witnesses in this case were not subjected to cross-examination as to the reasons for their official action in this case. They were called because they were men of long experience in assessing property in the county and state to testify to the existence of a systematic and intentional undervaluation of the property of others-of property generally. \n\n[267 U.S. 479, 492]\n\u00a0\n The court in reaching a conclusion as to the percentage to which the valuation here should be reduced in order fairly to avoid discrimination fixed 25 per cent., the same as that in the award of the board of arbitration. It is insisted that the action of the board, because its power to make an award was abolished by the law of 1918, was not admissible evidence. It is quite true that the award might be of doubtful competency if offered as independent evidence, but the fact that the award was made an issue in the pleadings and evidence and was a part of the record, suggests a difference. But even if it ought not to have been considered, the other evidence sustaining the conclusion of the court was ample. The evidence which the defendants offered was of a stereotyped character from the state and county officials of many counties, in which it was said that they all struggled to obey the law; but nothing which was said by them was any real contradiction of the affidavits already referred to, or of the reports of the state officials already commented on.\n There only remains to consider the question of interest made by the executor on his cross-appeal. The District Court exacted interest on the amount found to be due and which the executor admitted to be due, from the time of the first tender by him at the time of the award of the arbitrators until the final tender some three years later when the amendment to the bill was filed. We think this was right. The tenders of the complainant were with a condition attached, namely that the money to be received was to be received in full payment of the claim. The complainant had no right to impose such limitation. If he owed the money, as he admitted he did, he should have paid it without restriction, and his withholding it for three years requires that he pay interest on it during the time of detention.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.

U S(1925)\nNo. 286\nArgued: January 30, 1925Decided: March 9, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joe Kirby, of Sioux Falls, S. D., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 432, 435]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to the District Court for the District of South Dakota brought by Rae Brooks to reverse a judgment against him of conviction under two indictments for violation of the Act of Congress of October, 1919, and known as the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act. The writ of error issued under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) because the case involves the constrction or application of the Constitution, in that the chief assignment of error is the invalidity of the act. The act became effective October 29, 1919 (41 Stat. 324 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10418b-10418f]), and is as follows:\n'Chapter 89.-An act to punish the transportation of stolen motor vehicles in interstate or foreign commerce. \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n 'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that this act may be cited as the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act.\n\n'Sec. 2. That when used in this act:\n\n'(a) The term 'motor vehicle' shall include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motorcycle, or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails;\n\n'(b) The term 'interstate or foreign commerce' as used in this act shall include transportation from one state, territory, or the District of Columbia, to another state, territory, or the District of Columbia, or to a foreign country, or from a foreign country to any state, territory, or the District of Columbia.\n\n'Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.\n\n'Sec. 4. That whoever shall receive, conceal, store, barter, sell, or dispose of any motor vehicle, moving as, or which is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.\n\n'Sec. 5. That any person violating this act may be punished in any district in or through which such motor vehicle has been transported or removed by such offender.'\n\n The objection to the act cannot be sustained. Congress can certainly regulate interstate commerce to the extent of forbidding and punishing the use of such commerce as an agency to promote immorality, dishonesty or the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other states from the state of origin. In doing this it is merely exercising the police power, for the benefit of the public, \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n within the field of interstate commerce. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 215\n, 5 S. Ct. 826. In Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S. Ct. 92, it was held that Congress could pass a law excluding diseased stock from interstate commerce in order to prevent its use in such a way as thereby to injure the stock of other states. In the Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321\n, 23 S. Ct. 321, it was held that Congress might pass a law punishing the transmission of lottery tickets from one state to another, in order to prevent the carriage of those tickets to be sold in other states and thus demoralize, through a spread of the gambling habit, individuals who were likely to purchase. In the Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45\n, 31 S. Ct. 364, it was held that it was within the regulatory power of Congress to punish the transportation in interstate commerce of adulterated articles which if sold in other states from the one from which they were transported would deceive or injure persons who purchased such articles. In Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308\n, 33 S. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905, and Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470\n, 37 S. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168, the so-called White Slave Traffic Act, which was construed to punish any person engaged in enticing a woman from one state to another for immoral ends, whether for commercial purposes or otherwise, was valid because it was intended to prevent the use of interstate commerce to facilitate prostitution or concubinage and other forms of immorality. In Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Railway Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311\n, 37 S. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845, it was held that Congress had power to forbid the introduction of intoxicating liquors into any state in which their use was prohibited in order to prevent the use of interstate commerce to promote that which was illegal in the state. In Weber v. Freed, \n239 \nU.S. 325\n, 36 S. Ct. 131, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 317, it was held that Congress had power to prohibit the importation of pictorial representations of prize fights designed for public exhibition because of the demoralizing effect of such exhibitions in the state of destination. \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n In Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724, it was held that a federal law forbidding the transportation of articles manufactured by child labor in one state to another was invalid because it was really not a regulation of interstate commerce but a congressional attempt to regulate labor in the state of origin by an embargo on its external trade. Articles made by child labor and transported into other states were harmless and could be properly transported without injuring any person who either bought or used them. In referring to the cases already cited, upon which the argument for the validity of the Child Labor Act (Comp. St.  8819a-8819f) was based, this court pointed out that in each of them the use of interstate commerce had contributed to the accomplishment of harmful results to people of other states, and that the congressional power over interstate transportation in such cases could only be effectively exercised by prohibiting it. The clear distinction between authorities first cited and the Child Labor Case leaves no doubt where the right lies in this case. It is known of all men that the radical change in transportation of persons and goods effected by the introduction of the automobile, the speed with which it moves, and the ease with which evil-minded persons can avoid capture have greatly encouraged and increased crimes. One of the crimes which have been encouraged is the theft of the automobiles themselves and their immediate transportation to places remote from homes of the owners. Elaborately organized conspiracies for the theft of automobiles and the spiriting them away into some other state and their sale or other disposition far away from the owner and his neighborhood have roused Congress to devise some method for defeating the success of these widely spread schemes of larceny. The quick passage of the machines into another state heips to conceal the trail of the thieves, gets the stolen property into another police jurisdiction \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n and facilitates the finding of a safer place in which to dispose of the booty at a good price. This is a gross misuse of interstate commerce. Congress may properly punish such interstate transportation by any one with knowledge of the theft because of its harmful result and its defeat of the property rights of those whose machines against their will are taken into other jurisdictions.\n The fourth section merely makes more effective the regulation contained in the third section. The third section punishes the transportation of a stolen automobile with knowledge of the theft. The fourth section punishes the receipt, the concealment, the storing, the bartering, the sale or the disposition of such stolen vehicle moving as interstate commerce or as a part thereof with knowledge of its having been stolen. Of course this section can and does apply only to the storing or concealment of a stolen automobile with knowledge of its theft as a final step in the use of interstate transportation to promote the scheme of its unlawful disposition and the withholding of it from its owner. For these reasons we think that sections 3 and 4 are within the power of Congress.\n The constitutional question brought this case directly to this court. Being here, the other questions arising on the record must be decided. Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239\n, 40 S. Ct. 205; Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216\n, 35 S. Ct. 285.\n It is objected that the counts of the indictments failed to inform the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation. There were two indictments with two counts each. One charged violation of section 3 in the first count and of section 4 in the second count as to one automobile. The second indictment made the same charges as to a second automobile. The charge in one under section 3 was that defendant 'knowingly, unlawfully and feloniously did transport and cause to be transported in \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce' from Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls, S. D., a touring automobile describing it as of $1,000 value, the property of and belonging to one W. C. Wendt of Omaha, Neb., which said automobile theretofore on September 7th, A. D. 1921, had been stolen from Wendt, and that the defendant did not have the consent of the owner to transport it from Sioux City to Sioux Falls 'all of which he, the said Rae Brooks, then and there well knew.' The argument is that this does not sufficiently charge that the defendant knew that the automobile was stolen when he transported it. We think it does; that it is a reasonable construction to hold that the last words refer to the whole previous narration.\n The third objection is that there is no evidence of the defendant's guilt, and that the jury should have been so advised. We have read the evidence and read the charge of the court. The charge of the court submitted the issues properly to the jury except possibly in one respect to which we shall refer.\n It appeared that Brooks, the defendant, owned a garage in Sioux Falls, S. D., and that he went to Sioux City, Iowa, and obtained these two automobiles which had been stolen and transferred them to Sioux Falls. We cannot say that the circumstances were not such that a jury might properly infer that the defendant knew that they were stolen and had acquired them and transported them to South Dakota for the purpose of profiting by the transaction in stolen goods. It is said that there was no evidence after the cars were stored in Sioux Falls that the defendant made any effort to secrete, conceal or store them with guilty knowledge. It is not necessary for us to examine into this question or another mooted by the defendant's counsel. He contends that under the charge of the court the jury might have been led to convict the defendant on the second count in each indictment, \n\n[267 U.S. 432, 441]\n\u00a0\n on the theory that he became aware of the stolen character of the cars only after he reached Sioux Falls, and stored them after he became aware of their stolen character in Sioux Falls. This, he says, was an erroneous application of the fourth section because if his connection with the transporation was innocent, his subsequent criminal concealment of the stolen property would be disconnected with interstate commerce and be only a crime against the state. We do not think it necessary to pass on this question for the reason that the verdict of the jury was general, that the defendant was found guilty on both the counts of each of the two indictments and that the defendant was sentenced to 18 months on each indictment and each count, the sentences to run concurrently. As the convictions can be sustained on the first count in each indictment under the verdict, there is no ground for reversing the case because of error in charging as to the second count. Claassen v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 12 S. Ct. 169; Evans v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 608, 609\n, 14 S. Ct. 939; Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S. Ct. 17; Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239, 252\n, 40 S. Ct. 205.\n There are some objections made to the form of some questions put by the district attorney. We do not think they are shown to have been sufficiently prejudicial to justify a new trial.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWNE v. UNION PAC R CO(1925)\nNo. 194\nArgued: January 19, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ray Campbell, of Wichita, Kan., for petitioner.\n Mr. Nelson H. Loomis, of Omaha, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was begun in the district court, Shawnee county, Kansas, to recover damages resulting from false recitals of dates contained in substituted order bills of lading for four cars of wheat. These bills were issued by respondent's agent at Denver and stated, contrary to the facts, that they were given in lieu of others issued at points of origin on specified dates prior to November 9, 1920\n\n\n Petitioner agreed to buy a quantity of wheat from the Ed. Past Grain Company, of Denver, at a stipulated price, shipments to be made before November 9th, and then contracted to resell at a favorable price contingent upon like shipments. He alleged that, relying on the false recitals in the substituted bills, he paid drafts drawn on himself by the Past Company for the purchase price, but was unable to use the wheat, when received, to fulfill his contract for resale because original shipments were too late, and that he was compelled to dispose of it on a declining market at considerable loss. Also:\n'That according to the usage and custom of the grain business, well known to defendant, ... time of shipment of grain in car lots is determined by the date appearing on the bills of lading on which the carrier received such car of grain for transportation and grain on contract is delivered by tendering \n\n[267 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n a properly indorsed order bill of lading attached to the seller's draft on the buyer for the estimated price of such car of grain, such order bill of lading being delivered to the buyer upon payment of such draft.'\n\n Answering, respondent denied every allegation of the petition not specifically admitted. It acknowledged purchase of the wheat by petitioner from the Past Company, but alleged that, having failed to cancel the contract because of delay, as permitted, he was bound to accept the wheat on arrival; also, that it had no notice of the contract for resale, and was not liable for any special damages consequent upon failure to comply therewith. It further stated that the substituted bills were prepared by the Past Company and the signature of its Denver agent obtained by fraud; that the agent had no authority to sign bills containing false or erroneous statements; that petitioner could have disposed of the wheat without loss if he had acted promptly and prudently upon receipt of the same; and (paragraph 5):\n'Defendant denies specifically that plaintiff used every effort to ascertain the dates said shipments were made, and this defendant alleges that the freight bills which plaintiff alleges were paid by him, show fully the points where different parts of said shipments originated in less than carload lots, and show the transit point where the same were consolidated into the four carload shipments involved in this action; that, had plaintiff awaited the arrival of said shipments at McKinney, Tex., before paying the drafts attached to the bills of lading he could, by inquiring of the delivering carrier, have ascertained all of the facts relative to the dates and points of origin of said shipments, and defendant alleges this information was equally available to him at any time thereafter. Defendant further alleges that by reason of the lateness of the delivery of said shipments, plaintiff was, or should have been warned, of the probability of the fraud of the Ed Past Grain Company, and should have \n\n[267 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n detected the same prior to the payment of the drafts and acceptance of the wheat, as did the Gladney Milling Company when the wheat was thereafter tendered to them for application on the contract between them and the plaintiff.'\n\n A general demurrer to the answer and special demurrers to certain paragraphs were interposed and overruled by the court. Judgment went against petitioner. He stood on the demurrer and perfected an appeal to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the challenged judgment. In the latter court his principal contention seems to have been that the federal Bill of Lading Act, approved August 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 538 [Comp. St.  8604aaa- 8604w]), c. 415, makes order bills of lading strictly negotiable, and therefore respondent became liable to him for the damages consequent upon misstatements of dates in the substituted bills. This contention was duly considered and rejected. The court then said:\n'It follows that in so far as plaintiff's demurrer involved the question chiefly urged here, the ruling of the trial court was correct. The other matters pleaded in defendant's answer, to which the plaintiff objected and demurred, need but brief attention. The fact, if correct, that plaintiff was bound to accept the shipments from the Ed Past Grain Company, may not be a complete defense to plaintiff's cause of action, but it does raise an issue which may become important on the measure of damages if any are recoverable in the action; and whether there was a custom of grain dealers to rely on the datings of bills of lading, of which the carrier had notice or was bound to take notice, was also a question of fact, and therefore not demurrable. The scope of the powers of defendant's agent at Denver could not be determined by demurrer; and neither could the matters pleaded in the fifth paragraph of the answer summarized above.'\n\n'It is well settled that, where the Supreme Court of a state decides a federal question in rendering a judgment, \n\n[267 U.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n and also decides against the plaintiff in error upon an independent ground not involving a federal question and broad enough to maintain the judgment, the writ of error will be dismissed without considering the federal question.' Hammond v. Johnston, \n142 \nU.S. 73, 78\n, 12 S. Ct. 141; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Canal Company, \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Ct. 318.\n\n It seems clear that the Supreme Court of Kansas rested its judgment, affirming the action of the trial court, upon a nonfederal ground broad enough to sustain it. The answer not only relied upon nonnegotiable features of the bills-the federal question-but advanced other defenses good as against the general demurrer. It denied the existence of any trade usage to accept as accurate recitals as to dates in bills of lading, also that the Denver agent had power to issue the substituted bills. It asserted that petitioner was obligated to accept the grain irrespective of the dates of original shipments, and that if due diligence had been exercised no loss would have occurred. These denials and assertions raised questions under the state laws. They were substantial and broad enough to sustain the ruling of the trial court.\n The judgment below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUCK v. KUYKENDALL(1925)\nNo. 345\nArgued: November 25, 1924Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 307, 308]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Merrill Moores, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John H. Dunbar, of Olympia, Wash., for appellee.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 307, 312]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), from a final decree of the federal court for Western Washington, dismissing a bill brought to enjoin the enforcement of section 4 of chapter 111 of the Laws of Washington of 1921. That section prohibits common carriers for hire from using the highways by auto vehicles between fixed termini or over regular routes, without having first obtained from the director of public works a certificate declaring that \n\n[267 U.S. 307, 313]\n\u00a0\n public convenience and necessity require such operation. The highest court of the state has construed the section as applying to common carriers engaged exclusively in interstate commerce. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schoenfeldt, 123 Wash. 579, 213 P. 26; Schmidt v. Department of Public Works, 123 Wash. 705, 213 P. 31. The main question for decision is whether the statute so construed and applied is consistent with the federal Constitution and the legislation of Congress.\n Buck, a citizen of Washington, wished to operate an auto stage line over the Pacific Highway between Seattle, Wash., and Portland, Or., as a common carrier for hire exclusively for through interstate passengers and express. He obtained from Oregon the license prescribed by its laws. Having complied with the laws of Washington relating to motor vehicles, their owners and drivers (Carlsen v. Cooney, 123 Wash. 441, 212 P. 575), and alleging willingness to comply with all applicable regulations concerning common carriers, Buck applied there for the prescribed certificate of public convenience and necessity. It was refused. The ground of refusal was that, under the laws of the state, the certificate may not be granted for any territory which is already being adequately served by the holder of a certificate, and that, in addition to frequent steam railroad service, adequate transportation facilities between Seattle and Portland were already being provided by means of four connecting auto stage lines, all of which held such certificates from the state of Washington. \n1\n In re Buck, P. U. R. 1923E, 737. To enjoin interference by its officials with the operation of the projected \n\n[267 U.S. 307, 314]\n\u00a0\n line, Buck brought this suit against Kuykendall, the director of public works. The case was first heard, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, before three judges, on an application for a preliminary injunction. They denied the application. 295 F. 197. A further application for the injunction made after amending the bill was likewise denied. 295 F. 203. Then the case was heard by the District Judge upon a motion to dismiss the amended bill. The final decree dismissing the bill was entered without further opinion. See, also, Interstate Motor Transit Co. v. Kuykendall, 284 F. 882.\n That part of the Pacific Highway which lies within the state of Washington was built by it with federal aid pursuant to Act July 11, 1916, c. 241, 39 Stat. 355, as amended by Act Feb. 28, 1919, c. 69, 40 Stat. 1189, 1200 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  7477bb), and Federal Highway Act Nov. 9, 1921, c. 119, 42 Stat. 212 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  7477 1\/4 et seq). Plaintiff claimed that the action taken by the Washington officials, and threatened, violates rights conferred by these federal acts and guaranteed both by the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause. In support of the decree dismissing the bill this argument is made. The right to travel interstate by auto vehicle upon the public highways may be a privilege or immunity of citizens of the United States. Compare Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. A citizen may have, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the right to travel and transport his property upon them by auto vehicle. But he has no right to make the highways his place of business by using them as a common carrier for hire. Such use is a privilege which may be granted or withheld by the state in its discretion, without violating either the due process clause or the equal protection clause. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 144\n, 44 S. Ct. 257. The highways belong to the state. It may make provision appropriate for securing the safety and convenience of the public in the use of them. Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. It may impose fees with a \n\n[267 U.S. 307, 315]\n\u00a0\n view both to raising funds to defray the cost of supervision and maintenance and to obtaining compensation for the use of the road facilities provided. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S. Ct. 140. See, also, Pierce Oil Corporation v. Hopkins, \n264 \nU.S. 137\n, 44 S. Ct. 251. With the increase in number and size of the vehicles used upon a highway, both the danger and the wear and tear grow. To exclude unnecessary vehicles-particularly the large ones commonly used by carriers for hire-promotes both safety and economy. State regulation of that character is valid even as applied to interstate commerce, in the absence of legislation by Congress which deals specifically with the subject. Vandalia R. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 \nU.S. 255\n, 37 S. Ct. 93; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., \n211 \nU.S. 612\n, 29 S. Ct. 214. Neither the recent federal highway acts, nor the earlier post road acts (Rev. Stat.  3964 [ Comp. St.  7456]; Act March 1, 1884, c. 9, 23 Stats. 3 [Comp. St.  7457 ]), do that. The state statute is not objectionable because it is designed primarily to promote good service by excluding unnecessary competing carriers. That purpose also is within the state's police power.\n The argument is not sound. It may be assumed that section 4 of the state statute is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment; and also, that appropriate state regulations adopted primarily to promote safety upon the highways and conservation in their use are not obnoxious to the commerce clause, where the indirect burden imposed upon interstate commerce is not unreasonable. Compare Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, No. 283, \n266 \nU.S. 570\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 69 L. Ed. --, decided January 12, 1925. The provision here in question is of a different character. Its primary purpose is not regulation with a view to safety or to conservation of the highways, but the prohibition of competition. It determines, not the manner of use, but the persons by whom the highways may be used. It prohibits such use to some persons, while \n\n[267 U.S. 307, 316]\n\u00a0\n permitting it to others for the same purpose and in the same manner. Moreover, it determines whether the prohibition shall be applied by resort, through state officials, to a test which is peculiarly within the province of the federal action-the existence of adequate facilities for conducting interstate commerce. The vice of the legislation is dramatically exposed by the fact that the state of Oregon had issued its certificate which may be deemed equivalent to a legislative declaration that, despite existing facilities, public convenience and necessity required the establishment by Buck of the auto stage line between Seattle and Portland. Thus, the provision of the Washington statute is a regulation, not of the use of its own highways, but of interstate commerce. Its effect upon such commerce is not merely to burden, but to obstruct, it. Such state action is forbidden by the commerce clause. It also defeats the purpose of Congress, expressed in the legislation giving federal aid for the construction of interstate highways.\n By motion to dismiss filed in this court, the state makes the further contention that Buck is estopped from seeking relief against the provisions of section 4. The argument is this: Buck's claim is not that the department's action is unconstitutional because arbitrary or unreasonable. It is that section 4 is unconstitutional because use of the highways for interstate commerce is denied unless the prescribed certificate shall have been secured. Buck applied for a certificate. Thus he invoked the exercise of the power which he now assails. One who invokes the provisions of law may not thereafter question its constitutionality. The argument is unsound. It is true that one cannot in the same proceeding both assail a statute and rely upon it. Hurley v. Commissioner of Fisheries, \n257 \nU.S. 223, 225\n, 42 S. Ct. 83; Compare Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 37 S. Ct. 609. Nor can one who avails himself of the benefits conferred by a statute deny its validity. Pierce Oil Co. v. Phoenix Refining Co., \n259 \nU.S. 125\n, 42 S. Ct. 440; \n\n[267 U.S. 307, 317]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis Co. v. Prendergast Co., \n260 \nU.S. 469, 472\n, 43 S. Ct. 178. But in the case at bar Buck does not rely upon any provision of the statute assailed; and he has received no benefit under it. He was willing, if permitted to use the highways, to comply with all laws relating to common carriers. But the permission sought was denied. The case presents no element of estoppel. Compare Arizona v. Copper Queen Mining Co., \n233 U.S. 87\n, 94 et seq., 34 S. Ct. 546.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. See, \n267 \nU.S. 325\n, 45 S. Ct. 327, 69 L.

It was a proceeding under the Anti-Trust Act to dissolve an illegal combination of the defendants to monopolize the business of transporting and selling coal from the coal fields of Ohio in interstate commerce. Act July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended by Act Feb. 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, c. 544. A full hearing resulted, March, 1914, in finding that the illegal combination existed and a comprehensive decree radically dissolving the combination. United States v. Lake Shore & M S. Ry. Co. (D. C.) 203 F. 295. The railroad companies were directed to part with all their interests in the coal companies, and the business of mining and selling coal was ordered to be separated from that of railway transportation by the sale of the stocks of the defendant coal companies held by the railway companies and the dissolving of other relations which had made the combination possible and effective. Jurisdiction of the cause was retained by the court for the purpose of making such other and further orders and decrees as might be necessary to the due execution of the decree and the complete dissolution of the combination and monopoly therein condemned.\n The Buckeye Coal & Railway Company was not a party to the original suit. All of its stock was owned by the Hocking Valley Railway Company. Its property consisted of 11,000 acres of coal land in the coal fields of Ohio, with an estimated deposit of 18,000,000 tons. In 1899, the Buckeye Company had pledged its coal lands in a mortgage of the Hocking Valley Railway Company to the Central Trust Company to secure $20,000,000 of the Railway Company's bonds. In the same mortgage, the Buck- \n\n[269 U.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n eye Company agreed to pay 2 cents royalty on each ton of coal mined by it to the Central Trust Company, the mortgage trustee, to be applied to the redemption of the bonds. The Buckeye Company was not an obligor on the bonds. The Hocking Valley Railway Company, in addition to the pledge of its railway property, the Buckeye coal lands and the royalty, included in the mortgage also all the capital stock of the Buckeye Company. Upon an intervening petition of the original complainant, the United States, and after a hearing to which the Hocking Valley Railway Company and the Central Trust Company, the mortgage trustee, were parties, an order was made by the court by which the capital stock of the Buckeye Company was directed to be sold, freed from the lien of the mortgage, and subject to the approval of the court. This order was made May 19, 1916. The Hocking Valley Railway Company then made a contract with one John S. Jones, to sell him all the Buckeye Coal Company stock for $50,000 under a contract by which it was agreed that the stock sold should be released from the pledge of the mortgage. There was an express stipulation that the contract was not to impair the covenants of the Buckeye Company in the Hocking Valley Railway mortgage in respect of the lands of the Coal Company or of the 2 cents royalty, except that the Hocking Company agreed that its railroad property pledged under the mortgage should be first exhausted before any recourse should be had to the coal lands of the Buckeye Company. The constract of purchase was made subject to the presentation of its terms to the court and its approval. On October 5, 1916, the Hocking Valley Company reported the sale to the court, reciting the contract. On November 10, 1916, the District Court, after reciting the report of the contract of purchase and the dismissal of the appeal, and the tender of the purchaser for examination, found the purchaser satisfactory and approved the purchase. Jones took pos- \n\n[269 U.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n session of the stock and organized a new company, the Sunday Creek Coal Company, which by exchange of stock succeeded to the ownership of the coal lands of the Buckeye Company and that of other companies. It is conceded by counsel for the coal companies that the value of the property of the railway that the value of the property of the railway pay the bonds is far greater than the amount due on them so that the lien on the coal lands is negligible.\n In April, 1919, the coal companies brought a suit in a state court against the Central Trust Company and the Hocking Valley Railway Company in Ohio to quiet their title to the coal lands. The common pleas court of Ohio, after a full hearing, denied the prayer and sustained the validity of the mortgage lien upon the coal lands and the royalty. The decree of the common pleas court was affirmed in the intermediate appellate court and in the Supreme Court of Ohio. The final disposition of the cause was on June 7, 1921. This is pleaded herein by the Central Trust Company, trustee, as res judicata.\n The coal companies on December 6, 1921, applied for leave to the court below to file the intervening petition here the subject of consideration. Leave was granted and the Hocking Valley Railway Company and the Central Trust Company, parties, were required to answer. The prayer is that they be enjoined from enforcing the mortgage lien upon the coal lands of the Buckeye Company or the 2 cents a ton royalty. The ground urged is that the maintenance of these two liens constitutes such a relation between the coal companies and the railway company as to be a violation of the main decree and the anti-trust law, in that it furnishes a motive for the railway company illegally to favor the coal companies in their interstate transportation of coal to the selling markets. Thereafter the United States by leave also filed a petition against the same defendants, in which in the public \n\n[269 U.S. 42, 47]\n\u00a0\n interest it asked that the association between the railway company and the coal companies be dissolved by canceling the liens with or without compensation.\n The petition of the United States and the petition of the coal companies came on for hearing together. The District Court denied the petition of the coal companies, on the ground, first, that the order of November 10, 1916, approving the sale of the stock of the Buckeye Company, was a final order, and the District Court had no power to alter it; and, second, that the decree against the two companies in the state court was res judicata. As to the petition of the United States, the court conceded that under the reservation of the main decree such an application could be made to it for further relief to achieve the purpose of the main decree. It said that the fact that the court had approved the sale of the stock of the Buckeye Company indicated that the court had found that the release of the liens was not essential to carrying out the purpose of the decree and did not involve such an association between the railway company and the coal company as to interfere with the effectiveness of that decree. But while dismissing the petition, it left opportunity open in its order to the United States to apply for further relief in the matter, if such an association came to be used as a means of defeating the main decree. The United States has not appealed from this order of dismissal of its petition. The only appeal is that of the two coal companies.\n There is an embarrassment of reasons why the appeal of the two coal companies should fail. Their intervening petition seeks to vary or set aside the order of the District Court, which necessarily approved, not only the sale of the Buckeye stock, but also the stipulation in the contract of sale that the pledge of the coal lands and the 2-cent royalty should be unimpaired. That order was made November 10, 1916. It was a final order in respect of the sale ap- \n\n[269 U.S. 42, 48]\n\u00a0\n proved. The clause of reservation in the main decree, as the court below said, was exhausted so far as that sale was concerned. All the facts, including the contract of purchase, were then before the court. No new ones have since been developed. The term has long passed within which that order could be altered by the court which made it.\n Second, the validity of the covenants of the mortgage entered into by the Buckeye Company was affirmed by the decree in the litigation between the Hocking Valley Railway Company, the Central Trust Company, the mortgage trustee, and the two coal companies, appellants. This was res judicata, so far at least as the personal and private rights of the coal companies were concerned.\n Third, even if we assume that the United States might apply under the reservation clause to the District Court to direct the cancellation of the mortgage lien on the coal lands, and the covenant as to the royalty on a showing that they were being used to continue the illegal combination condemned in the main decree, it could only be done in the interest of the public represented by the United States. The petition of the United States on this head was denied by the court below and the United States has taken no appeal. The status of the two coal companies in the court below and here is merely that of informers. Their attitude, if it is nicely analyzed, seems to be that unless the mortgage lien on their coal lands to secure the railway bonds, and the 2 per cent. royalty are canceled, they may be induced to enter a conspiracy with the railway company by which the railway company will grant them unlawful and discriminating favors in railway transportation to enable them to increase the coal mined and the royalty to be applied to redeem the bonds. They wish to have this temptation to crime on their part removed, and incidentally have themselves relieved from obligations which were recognized by the court as valid and binding \n\n[269 U.S. 42, 49]\n\u00a0\n in the judicial sale of the entire capital stock of the Buckeye Company and which as against them have been adjudged valid by the courts of Ohio. The United States which must alone speak for the public interest does not appear with them on this appeal. They have therefore no locus standi. United States v. Northern Securities Co. (C. C.) 128 F. 808.\n Underneath all these reasons for dismissing the appeal is the fundamental objection that these coal companies presented no case upon their petition justifying their intervention. They were not parties to the original suit. Their interest was not of persons who had suffered by the original combination made the subject of the main decree who might have had relief under the 16th section of the amendment to the Anti-Trust Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323 (38 Stat. 737). They were really put forward as intervening parties in the interest of Jones the purchaser at the judicial sale of all their stock through which he continues to manage them. His, and therefore their, only claim to be heard at all must be based on the decree confirming the purchase, part of the consideration for which as approved by the court they now seek to impeach.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURK-WAGGONER OIL ASS'N v.

Wheat, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Burk-Waggoner Oil Association is an unincorporated joint-stock association like those described in Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144\n, 44 S. Ct. 462. It was organized in Texas and \n\n[269 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n carried on its business there. Under the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 a et seq .)), it was assessed as a corporation the sum of $561,279.20 for income and excess profits taxes for the year 1919. It paid the tax under protest in quarterly installments, and after appropriate proceedings brought this suit in the federal District Court for Northern Texas against the collector of internal revenue to recover one of the installments. The association asserted that it was a partnership, contended that under the act no partnership was taxable as such, and claimed that if the act be construed as authorizing the taxation of a partnership as a corporation, or the taxation of the group for the distributive share of the individual members, it violated the federal Constitution. The District Court entered judgment for the defendant. 296 F. 492. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), on direct writ of error allowed and filed April 21, 1924. Compare Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254.\n The Revenue Act of 1918,  210, 211, 218a, 224, 335(c) being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 e, 6336 1\/8 ee, 6336 1\/8 i(a), 6336 1\/8 l, 6336 7\/16 n(c), provides in terms that individuals carrying on business in partnership shall be liable for income tax only in their individual capacity, and that the members of partnerships are taxable upon their distributive shares of the partnership income, whether distributed or not. It subjects corporations to income and excess profits taxes different from those imposed upon individuals. See sections 210-213 (sections 6336 1\/8 e- 6336 1\/8 ff) and sections 230, 300 (sections 6336 1\/8 nn, 6336 7\/16 a). It provides in section 1 (section 6371 1\/4 a): 'That when used in this act -... The term 'corporation' includes associations, joint-stock companies and insurance companies.' By the common law of Texas a partnership is not an entity, Glasscock v. Price, 92 Tex. 271, 47 S. W. 965; McManus v. Cash & Luckel, 101 Tex. 261, 108 S. W. 800; an association like the plaintiff is a partnership; its shareholders are individually liable for its debts as members of a partnership, Thompson v. Schmitt, 115 Tex. 53, 274 S. W. 554; Victor Refining Co. v. City National Bank of Commerce, 115 Tex. 71, 274 S. W. 561; and \n\n[269 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n the association cannot hold real property except through a trustee, Edwards v. Old Settlers' Association (Tex. Civ. App.) 166 S. W. 423, 426. A Texas statute provides that such associations may sue and be sued in their own name. Act April 18, 1907, c. 128, Vernon's Sayler' Texas Civil Statutes, 1914, title 102, c. 2, arts. 6149-6154. Since the writ of error was allowed, this court has held in Hecht v. Malley that associations like the plaintiff are, by virtue of section 1, subject to the special excise tax imposed by the Revenue Law of 1918 on every 'domestic corporation.'\n The Burk-Waggoner Association contends that what is called its property and income were in law the property and income of its members; that ownership, receipt, and segregation are essential elements of income, which Congress cannot affect; that consequently income can be taxed by Congress without apportionment only to the owner thereof; that the income of an enterprise when considered in its relation to all others than the owners is not income within the purview of the Sixteenth Amendment; and that thus what is called the income of the association can be taxed only to the partners upon their undistributed shares of the partnership profits, for otherwise such a distribution would neither enrich, nor segregate anything to the separate use of, a partner. The association further contends that, while Congress may classify all recipients of income upon any reasonable basis for the purpose of imposing income taxes at different rates, or for other purposes connected with the levying and collection of such taxes, it cannot tax the income of the association, for that would make out of a business group, whose property under the law of the state is owned by the members individually, an entity capable of owning property and receiving income; that to attempt this would constitute, not classification, but an unlawful invasion of the state's exclusive power to regulate the ownership of property with- \n\n[269 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n in its borders: that, on the other hand, if the tax be considered as one imposed upon the members and collected from the group, it would likewise be void, both because it is a direct tax, not imposed upon income, and not apportioned among the states, and because it is so arbitrary and variable in its rates and application as to conflict with the due process clause. The association contends, finally, that there is a conflict between the specific provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 for the taxation of partnership income to the members only and the definition of the term 'corporation,' in section 1, and that the grave constitutional doubts which necessarily arise, if the act be construed as attempting to impose the corporation income tax upon associations which by the laws of the state are partnerships, present a compelling reason for construing the act as not subjecting the association's income to the taxes imposed upon corporations. Compare United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 29 S. Ct. 527.\n There is no room for applying the rule of construction urged in aid of constitutionality. It is clear that Congress intended to subject such joint-stock associations to the income and excess profits taxes as well as to the capital stock tax. The definition given to the term 'corporation' in section 1 applies to the entire act. The language of the section presents no ambiguity. Nor is there any inconsistency between that section and sections 218(a) and 335(c), which refer specifically to the taxation of partnerships. The term partnership as used in these sections obviously refers only to ordinary partnerships. Unincorporated joint-stock associations, although technically partnerships under the law of many states, are not in common parlance referred to as such. They have usually a fixed capital stock divided into shares represented by certificates transferable only upon the books of the company, manage their affairs by a board of directors and exec- \n\n[269 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n utive officers and conduct their business in the general form and mode of procedure of a corporation. Because of this resemblance in form and effectiveness, these business organizations are subjected by the act to these taxes as corporations.\n The claim that the act, if so construed, violates the Constitution is also unsound. It is true that Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact. But the thing to which the tax was here applied is confessedly income earned in the name of the association. It is true that Congress cannot convert into a corporation an organization which by the law of its state is deemed to be a partnership. But nothing in the Constitution precludes Congress from taxing as a corporation an association which, although unincorporated, transacts its business as if it were incorporated. The power of Congress so to tax associations is not affected by the fact that, under the law of a particular state, the association cannot hold title to property, or that its shareholders are individually liable for the association's debts, or that it is not recognized as a legal entity. Neither the conception of unincorporated associations prevailing under the local law, nor the relation under that law of the association to its shareholders, nor their relation to each other and to outsiders, is of legal significance as bearing upon the power of Congress to determine how and at what rate the income of the joint enterprise shall be taxed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAIRO, T & S R.

McLaughlin, of Washington, D.

Plaintiff's claim is in character the same as that sued on in St. Louis, Kennett & Southeastern R. Co. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 346\n, 45 S. Ct. 245, 69 L. Ed. --, decided this day. It is presented in the same manner; and the government makes the same defense. The provision for settlement and release of claims here relied upon is substantially the same as in that case. But, in other respects, the contract is entirely different. It is in the form, known as the per diem contract, which contains no operative provision other than that providing for settlement and release of claims. The rest of the document consists of recitals and the testimonium clause. The consideration for the settlement and release is therein stated to be 'obtaining the advantages of the two days' free time or reclaim allowance and such other co-operation as is accorded to it by the Director General of Railroads.'\n The petition alleges that the Director General gave no more than he would have been obliged by law to give had no agreement been made. This is not true. But it is, in any event, without legal significance. The plaintiff's agreement embodying the release was under seal. Hence, it is binding even if without a consideration. The petition alleges, also, that the agreement 'was accepted by the \n\n[267 U.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n officers of the plaintiff for the purpose of saving for themselves such rights, privileges, and conveniences as were indicated by the Director General, and was signed for this purpose only and not otherwise, and for the supposed concessions set out in the contract itself.' The allegation does not charge facts constituting legal duress. United States v. Child & Co., 12 Wall. 232, 244. Nor is it claimed that the agreement is void because of duress.\n As in the St. Louis Co. Case, the Director General clearly had authority to enter into the agreement in question.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAMI v.

Caffey, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to prevent the collection of a tax imposed by a municipal ordinance of Carolina, Porto Rico, on the ground that the ordinance is void. The Supreme Court of the Island upheld the tax, 30 P. R. 413, but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Central Victoria v. Cami, 295 F. 809, following its decision on the same day in Successors of C. & J. Fantanzzi v. Municipal Assembly of Arroyo (C. C. A.) 295 F. 803. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n265 \nU.S. 577\n, 44 S. Ct. 635. Had the Circuit Court of Appeals deferred to the local interpretation of Porto Rican statutes, we should not have granted a writ. We repeatedly have stated the reason for such deference, and we believe that the appellate jurisdiction was granted with other ends in view than that of setting the local courts right in their interpretation of their own laws. But since the case has been decided the other way we cannot avoid dealing with the merits and we should not be warranted in reversing the decision under review unless we thought either that it was wrong or at least that there was such plausible ground for the judgment reversed by it, that the local decision ought not to be distrubed. \n\n[268 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Porto Rico expressed an intelligible doubt whether a bill for an injunction would lie in this class of cases, but no error was assigned on that ground, and in view of our opinion on the merits there is no sufficient reason for opening that question. When we come to the merits we are compelled to agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals as we understand the reasoning of that Court.\n On February 17, 1921, the ordinance complained of was passed, and imposed a tax of ten cents on every hundredweight of sugar manufactured in the municipality. The statutes affecting the power to levy this tax are set out more fully in the principal opinion below. We give only those that immediately determine the result. The Porto Rican Act No. 9 of May 12, 1920,  49, provides that the municipal revenues shall consist of: (d) License taxes provided by Act No. 26, of March 28, 1914, 'which is hereby declared to be in force.' '(f) Any other impost, excise or tax that may be levied by two thirds of the members of the municipal assembly, provided that the object or matter of taxation is not also the object or matter of any federal or insular tax.' The Act of 1914 included in its Group C the business of sugar and molasses mills among those that municipalities were empowered to tax, and proceeded:\n'The rates of taxation for Group C are made as follows: For each $1, 000 or fraction thereof in excess of the first $500 of volume of business transacted, up to $1,000,000 inclusive $0.25 a year,' and over that, $0.125.\n\n As the Act of 1914 is taken up into that of 1920, it is difficult for us to believe that in one paragraph the latter Act gave power to tax up to a specified maximum and in another a general power limited only by the other principles of taxation. Therefore when in section 49(f) the later act allows 'any other impost, excise or tax' we think it must be taken to mean any tax on other objects of taxation not any other tax on those for which a limit already definitely is prescribed. \n\n[268 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner argues that the Circuit Court of Appeals was mistaken in assuming that the maximum allowed by the Act of 1914 had been reached by a previous tax. The assumption is made however only for the purpose of admitting that an additional tax of the kind warranted by the Act of 1914 might be imposed within the limit of the maximum, and as it is not argued that this tax can be sustained as that which is authorized by the Act of 1914 it does not matter whether the limit under that Act had been reached or not. This is a different tax levied under an interpretation of the clause in the Act of 1920 authorizing other taxes, which in our opinion cannot be sustained. We think it unnecessary to add more to what has been said below.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCANNON MFG. CO. v.

C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. Harry Covington, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cannon Manufacturing Company, a North Carolina corporation, brought, in a court of that state, this action against Cudahy Packing Company, a Maine corporation, for breach of a contract to purchase cotton sheeting for use in packing meat. The defendant appeared specially for the purpose of filing a petition for removal to the federal court for western North Carolina; and the order of removal issued. In that court the defendant, appearing specially, moved that the summons be set aside and the action dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The ground of the motion was that the defendant was not doing business within the state and had not been served with process. The only service made was, as the sheriff's return recites, the delivery of a copy of the 'summons and complaint to Cudahy Packing Company of Alabama, agent of defendant, Frank H. Ross, to whom papers were delivered, being process agent of Cudahy Company of Alabama.' The District Court, concluding upon the evidence that the defendant was not present in North Carolina, entered a final judgment dismissing the action. 292 F. 169. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), the question of jurisdiction having been duly certified.\n The main question for decision is whether, at the time of the service of process, defendant was doing business within the state in such a manner and to such an extent \n\n[267 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n as to warrant the inference that it was present there. Bank of America v. Whitney Central National Bank, \n261 \nU.S. 171\n, 43 S. Ct. 311. In order to show that it was, the plaintiff undertook to establish identity pro hac vice between the defendant and the Alabama corporation. The Alabama corporation, which has an office in North Carolina, is the instrumentality employed to market Cudahy products within the state; but it does not do so as defendant's agent. It buys from the defendant and sells to dealers. In fulfillment of such contracts to sell, goods packed by the defendant in Iowa are shipped direct to dealers, and from them the Alabama corporation collects the purchase price. Through ownership of the entire capital stock and otherwise, the defendant dominates the Alabama corporation, immediately and completely, and exertsits control both commercially and financially in substantially the same way, and mainly through the same individuals, as it does over those selling branches or departments of its business not separately incorporated which are established to market the Cudahy products in other states. The existence of the Alabama company as a distinct corporate entity is, however, in all respects observed. Its books are kept separate. All transactions between the two corporations are represented by appropriate entries in their respective books in the same way as if the two were wholly independent corporations. This corporate separation from the general Cudahy business was doubtless adopted solely to secure to the defendant some advantage under the local laws.\n The objection to the maintenance of the suit is not procedural-as where it is sought to defeat a suit against a foreign corporation on the ground that process has been served upon one not authorized to act as its agent. Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Meyer, \n197 \nU.S. 407\n, 25 S. Ct. 483; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Alexander, \n227 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 33 S. Ct. 245, Ann.

The obstacle insisted upon is that the court lacked jurisdiction because the defendant, a foreign corporation, was not within the state. No question of the constitutional powers of the state, or of the federal government, is directly presented. The claim that jurisdiction exists is not rested upon the provisions of any state statute or upon any local practice dealing with the subject. The resistance to the assumption of jurisdiction is not urged on the ground that to subject the defendant to suit in North Carolina would be an illegal interference with interstate commerce. Compare International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 579\n, 587-589, 34 S. Ct. 944. The question is simply whether the corporate separation carefully maintained must be ignored in determining the existence of jurisdiction.\n The defendant wanted to have business transactions with persons resident in North Carolina, but for reasons satisfactory to itself did not choose to enter the state in its corporate capacity. It might have conducted such business through an independent agency without subjecting itself to the jurisdiction. Bank of America v. Whitney Central National Bank, \n261 \nU.S. 171\n, 43 S. Ct. 311. It preferred to employ a subsidiary corporation. Congress has not provided that a corporation of one state shall be amenable to suit in the federal court for another state in which the plaintiff resides, whenever it employees a subsidiary corporation as the instrumentality for doing business therein. Compare Lumiere v. Mae Edna Wilder, Inc., \n261 \nU.S. 174, 177\n, 178 S., 43 S. Ct. 312. That such use of a subsidiary does not necessarily subject the parent corporation to the jurisdiction was settled by Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, \n190 U.S. 406\n, 409-411, 23 S. Ct. 728, Peterson v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n205 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S. Ct. 513, and People's Tobacco Co., Ltd., v. American Tobacco Co., \n246 \nU.S. 79, 87\n, 38 S. Ct. 233, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 537. In the case at bar, the identity of interest may have been more complete and the exercise of control over the subsidiary \n\n[267 U.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n more intimate than in the three cases cited, but that fact has, in the absence of an applicable statute, no legal significance. The corporate separation, though perhaps merely formal, was real. It was not pure fiction. There is here no attempt to hold the defendant liable for an act or omission of its subsidiary or to enforce as against the latter a liability of the defendant. Hence, cases concerning substantive rights, like Hart Steel Company v. Railroad Supply Co., \n244 \nU.S. 294\n, 37 S. Ct. 506, Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic Association, \n247 \nU.S. 490\n, 38 S. Ct. 553, Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lewellyn, \n248 \nU.S. 71\n, 39 S. Ct. 35, and United States v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n254 \nU.S. 255\n, 41 S. Ct. 104, have no application.\n The plaintiff contends, on a further ground, that the defendant was present in North Carolina. The argument is that there is no such thing as a corporation sole under the laws of Alabama; that three stockholders are necessary in order to sustain the existence of a corporate entity; that where the number of members falls below three the entity falls into a state of suspense; that the defendant, in fact, owned all the stock in the Alabama corporation; that the directors of the latter could not have been bona fide directors because not stockholders; that its franchise was suspended (First National Bank of Gadsden v. Winchester, 119 Ala. 168, 24 So. 351, 72 Am. St. Rep. 904); and that therefore what was done in North Carolina must have been done by the defendant. No Alabama case has been cited, or found, which determines the effect, in that state, of such alleged suspense. Nor has any case been cited, or found, which determines what would be its effect under the law of North Carolina. It is not contended that the Alabama corporation was dissolved ipso facto by this concentration of its stock, or that its property became, in law, that of the defendant. It may be that upon the concentration of its stock in the hands of the defendant, the franchise of the Alabama corporation became subject to \n\n[267 U.S. 333, 338]\n\u00a0\n forfeiture in a judicial proceeding by the state, or that thereby its status was reduced from a corporation de jure to one de facto. But whatever might be other legal consequences of the concentration, we cannot say that, for purposes of jurisdiction, the business of the Alabama corporation in North Carolina became the business of the defendant.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARROLL v. U.S.(1925)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas E. Atkinson and Clare J. Hall, both of Grand Rapids, Mich., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 132, 143]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The constitutional and statutory provisions involved in this case include the Fourth Amendment and the National Prohibition Act.\n The Fourth Amendment is in part as follows:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n Section 25, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 315, passed to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, makes it unlawful to have or possess any liquor intended for use in violating the act, or which has been so used, and provides that no property rights shall exist in such inquor. A search warrant may issue and such liquor, with the containers thereof, may be seized under the warrant and be ultimately destroyed. The section further provides:\n'No search warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as such unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, or unless it is in part used for some business purpose such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boaring house. The term 'private dwelling' shall be construed to include the room or rooms used and occupied not transiently but solely as \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 144]\n\u00a0\n a residence in an apartment house, hotel, or boarding house.'\n\n Section 26, title 2, under which the seizure herein was made, provides in part as follows:\n'When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. Whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle and team or automobile, boat, air or water craft, or any other conveyance, and shall arrest any person in charge thereof.'\n\n The section then provides that the court upon conviction of the person so arrested shall order the liquor destroyed, and except for good cause shown shall order a sale by public auction of the other property seized, and that the proceeds shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.\n By section 6 of an act supplemental to the National Prohibition Act ( 42 Stat. 222, 223, c. 134 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10184a]) it is provided that if any officer or agent or employee of the United States engaged in the enforcement of the Prohibition Act or this Amendment, 'shall search any private dwelling,' as defined in that act, 'without a warrant directing such search,' or 'shall without a search warrant maliciously and without reasonable cause search any other building or property,' he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to fine or imprisonment or both.\n In the passage of the supplemental act through the Senate, amendment No. 32, known as the Stanley Amendment, was adopted, the relevant part of which was as follows:\n'Sec. 6. That any officer, agent or employee of the United States engaged in the enforcement of this act or \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 145]\n\u00a0\n the National Prohibition Act, or any other law of the United States, who shall search or attempt to search the property or premises of any person without previously securing a search warrant, as provided by law, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not to exceed $1,000, or imprisoned not to exceed one year, or both so fined and imprisoned in the discretion of the court.'\n\n This amendment was objected to in the House, and the judiciary committee, to whom it was referred, reported to the House of Representatives the following as a substitute:\n'Sec. 6. That no officer, agent or employee of the United States, while engaged in the enforcement of this act, the National Prohibition Act, or any law in reference to the manufacture or taxation of, or traffic in, intoxicating liquor, shall search any private dwelling without a warrant directing such search, and no such warrant shall issue unless there is reason to believe such dwelling is used as a place in which liquor is manufactured for sale or sold. The term 'private dwelling' shall be construed to include the room or rooms occupied not transiently, but solely as a residence in an apartment house, hotel, or boarding house. Any violation of any provision of this paragraph shall be punished by a fine of not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment not to exceed one year, or both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.'\n\n In its report the committee spoke in part as follows:\n'It appeared to the committee that the effect of the Senate amendment No. 32, if agreed to by the House, would greatly cripple the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act and would otherwise seriously interfere with the government in the enforcement of many other laws, as its scope is not limited to the prohibition law, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 146]\n\u00a0\n but applies equally to all laws where prompt action is necessary. There are on the statute books of the United States a number of laws authorizing search without a search warrant. Under the common law and agreeable to the Constitution search may in many cases be legally made without a warrant. The Constitution does not forbid search, as some parties contend, but it does forbid unreasonable search. This provision in regard to search is as a rule contained in the various state Constitutions, but notwithstanding that fact search without a warrant is permitted in many cases, and especially is that true in the enforcement of liquor legislation.\n\n'The Senate amendment prohibits all search or attempt to search any property or premises without a search warrant. The effect of that would necessarily be to prohibit all search, as no search can take place if it is not on some property or premises.\n\n'Not only does this amendment prohibit search of any lands but it prohibits the search of all property. It will prevent the search of the common bootlegger and his stock in trade, though caught and arrested in the act of violating the law. But what is perhaps more serious, it will make it impossible to stop the rum-running automobiles engaged in like illegal traffic. It would take from the officers the power that they absolutely must have to be of any service, for if they cannot search for liquor without a warrant they might as well be discharged. It is impossible to get a warrant to stop an automobile. Before a warrant could be secured the automobile would be beyond the reach of the officer with its load of illegal liquor disposed of.'\n\n The conference report resulted, so far as the difference between the two houses was concerned, in providing for the punishment of any officer, agent, or employee of the government who searches a 'private dwelling' without a warrant, and for the punishment of any such officer, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 147]\n\u00a0\n etc., who searches any 'other building or property' where, and only where, he makes the search without a warrant 'maliciously and without probable cause.' In other words, it left the way open for searching an automobile or vehicle of transportation without a warrant, if the search was not malicious or without probable cause.\n The intent of Congress to make a distinction between the necessity for a search warrant in the searching of private dwellings and in that of automobiles and other road vehicles in the enforcement of the Prohibition Act is thus clearly established by the legislative history of the Stanley Amendment. Is such a distinction consistent with the Fourth Amendment? We think that it is, The Fourth Amendment does not denounce all searches or seizures, but only such as are unreasonable.\n The leading case on the subject of search and seizure is Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S. Ct. 524. An Act of Congress of June 22, 1874 (18 Stat. 187), authorized a court of the United States in revenue cases, on motion of the government attorney, to require the defendant to produce in court his private books, invoices, and papers on pain in case of refusal of having the allegations of the attorney in his motion taken as confessed. This was held to be unconstitutional and void as applied to suits for penalties or to establish a forfeiture of goods, on the ground that under the Fourth Amendment the compulsory production of invoices to furnish evidence for forfeiture of goods constituted an unreasonable search even where made upon a search warrant, and was also a violation of the Fifth Amendment, in that it compelled the defendant in a criminal case to produce evidence against himself or be in the attitude of confessing his guilt.\n In Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, it was held that a court in a criminal prosecution could not retain letters of the accused seized in his house, in his absence and without his authority, by a United States marshal \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 148]\n\u00a0\n holding no warrant for his arrest and none for the search of his premises, to be used as evidence against him, the accused having made timely application to the court for an order for the return of the letters.\n In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, a writ of error was brought to reverse a judgment of contempt of the District Court, fining the company and imprisoning one Silverthorne, its president, until he should purge himself of contempt in not producing books and documents of the company before the grand jury to prove violation of the statutes of the United States by the company and Silverthorne. Silverthorne had been arrested, and while under arrest the marshal had gone to the office of the company without a warrant and made a clean sweep of all books, papers, and documents found there and had taken copies and photographs of the papers. The District Court ordered the return of the originals, but impounded the photographs and copies. This was held to be an unreasonable search of the property and possessions of the corporation and a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the judgment for contempt was reversed.\n In Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261, the obtaining through stealth by a representative of the government from the office of one suspected of defrauding the government of a paper which had no pecuniary value in itself, but was only to be used as evidence against its owner, was held to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. It was further held that when the paper was offered in evidence and duly objected to it must be ruled inadmissible because obtained through an unreasonable search and seizure and also in violation of the Fifth Amendment because working compulsory incrimination.\n In Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313\n, 41 S. Ct. 266, it was held that where concealed liquor was found by government officers without a search warrant in the home of the defendant, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 149]\n\u00a0\n in his absence, and after a demand made upon his wife, it was inadmissible as evidence against the defendant, because acquired by an unreasonable seizure.\n In none of the cases cited is there any ruling as to the validity under the Fourth Amendment of a seizure without a warrant of contraband goods in the course of transportation and subject to forfeiture or destruction.\n On reason and authority the true rule is that if the search and seizure without a warrant are made upon probable cause, that is, upon a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstaces known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction, the search and seizure are valid. The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens.\n In Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S. Ct. 524, as already said, the decision did not turn on whether a reasonable search might be made without a warrant; but for the purpose of showing the principle on which the Fourth Amendment proceeds, and to avoid any misapprehension of what was decided, the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, used language which is of particular significance and applicability here. It was there said (page 623 [6 S. Ct. 528]):\n'The search for and seizure of stolen or forfeited goods, or goods liable to duties and concealed to avoid the payment thereof, are totally different things from a search for and seizure of a man's private books and papers for the purpose of obtaining information therein contained, or of using them as evidence against him. The two things differ toto coelo. In the one case, the government is entitled to the possession of the property; in the other it is not. The seizure of stolen goods is authorized by the \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 150]\n\u00a0\n common law; and the seizure of goods forfeited for a breach of the revenue laws, or concealed to avoid the duties payable on them, has been authorized by English statutes for at least two centuries past; and the like seizures have been authorized by our own revenue acts from the commencement of the government. The first statute passed by Congress to regulate the collection of duites, the Act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat. 29, 43, contains provisions to this effect. As this act was passed by the same Congress which proposed for adoption the original amendments to the Constitution, it is clear that the members of that body did not regard searches and seizures of this kind as 'unreasonable,' and they are not embraced within the prohibition of the amendment. So, also, the supervision authorized to be exercised by officers of the revenue over the manufacture or custody of excisable articles, and the entries thereof in books required by law to be kept for their inspection, are necessarily excepted out of the category of unreasonable searches and seizures. So, also, the laws which provide for the search and seizure of articles and things which it is unlawful for a person to have in his possession for the purpose of issue or disposition, such as counterfeit coin, lottery tickets, implements of gambling, etc., are not within this category. Common- welath v. Dana, 2 Metc. (Mass.) 329. Many other things of this character might be enumerated.'\n\n It is noteworthy that the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1789 to which the court there refers provides:\n'That every collector, naval officer and surveyor, or other person specially appointed by either of them for that purpose, shall have full power and authority, to enter any ship or vessel, in which they shall have reason to suspect any goods, wares or merchandise subject to duty shall be concealed; and therein to search for, seize, and secure any such goods, wares or merchandise; and if they shall have cause to suspect a concealment thereof, in any \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 151]\n\u00a0\n particular dwelling house, store, building, or other place, they or either of them shall, upon application on oath or affirmation to any justice of the peace, be entitled to a warrant to enter such house, store, or other place (in the daytime only) and there to search for such goods, and if any shall be found, to seize and secure the same for trial; and all such goods, wares and merchandise, on which the duties shall not have been paid or secured, shall be forfeited.' 1 Stat. 43.\n\n Like provisions were contained in the Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35,  48-51, 1 Stat. 145, 170; in section 27 of the Act of February 18, 1793, c. 8, 1 Stat. 305, 315; and in sections 68-71 of the Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat. 627, 677, 678.\n Thus contemporaneously with the adoption of the Fourth Amendment we find in the First Congress, and in the following Second and Fourth Congresses, a difference made as to the necessity for a search warrant between goods subject to forfeiture, when concealed in a dwelling house or similar place, and like goods in course of transportation and concealed in a movable vessel where they readily could be put out of reach of a search warrant. Compare Hester v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 57\n, 44 S. Ct. 445.\n Again, by the second section of the Act of March 3, 1815, 3 Stat. 231, 232, it was made lawful for customs officers, not only to board and search vessels within their own and adjoining districts, but also to stop, search, and examine any vehicle, beast, or person on which or whom they should suspect there was merchandise which was subject to duty or had been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law, whether by the person in charge of the vehicle or beast or otherwise, and if they should find any goods, wares or merchandise thereon, which they had probable cause to believe had been so unlawfully brought into the country, to seize and secure the same, and the vehicle or beast as well, for trial \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 152]\n\u00a0\n and forfeiture. This act was renewed April 27, 1816 (3 Stat. 315), for a year and expired. The Act of February 28, 1865, revived section 2 of the Act of 1815, above described, 13 Stat. 441, c. 67. The substance of this section was re-enacted in the third section of the Act of July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178, and was thereafter embodied in the Revised Statutes as section 3061 (Comp. St.  5763). Neither section 3061 nor any of its earlier counterparts has ever been attacked as unconstitutional. Indeed, that section was referred to and treated as operative by this court in Cotzhausen v. Nazro, \n107 \nU.S. 215, 219\n, 2 S. Ct. 503. See, also, United States v. One Black Horse (D C.) 129 F. 167.\n Again by section 2140 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4141) any Indian agent, subagent or commander of a military post in the Indian country, having reason to suspect or being informed that any white person or Indian is about to introduce, or has introduced, any spirituous liquor or wine into the Indian country, in violation of law, may cause the boats, stores, packages, wagons, sleds and places of deposit of such person to be searched and if any liquor is found therein, then it, together with the vehicles, shall be seized and and proceeded against by libel in the proper court and forfeited. Section 2140 was the outgrowth of the Act of May 6, 1822, c. 58, 3 Stat. 682, authorizing Indian agents to cause the goods of traders in the Indian country to be searched upon suspicion or information that ardent spirits were being introduced into the Indian country to be seized and forfeited if found, and of the Act of June 30, 1834,  20, c. 161, 4 Stat. 729, 732, enabling an Indian agent having reason to suspect any person of having introduced or being about to introduce liquors into the Indian country to cause the boat, stores or places of deposit of such person to be searched and the liquor found forfeited. This court recognized the statute of 1822 as justifying such a search and seizure in American Fur Co. v. United States, 2 Pet. 358. By the Indian \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 153]\n\u00a0\n Appropriation Act of March 2, 1917, c. 146, 39 Stat. 969, 970, automobiles used in introducing or attempting to introduce intoxicants into the Indian territory may be seized, libeled, and forfeited as provided in the Revised Statutes,  2140\n\n\n And again in Alaska, by section 174 of the Act of March 3, 1899, c. 429, 30 Stat. 1253, 1280, it is provided that collectors and deputy collectors or any person authorized by them in writing shall be given power to arrest persons and seize vessels and merchandise in Alaska liable to fine, penalties, or forfeiture under the act and to keep and deliver the same, and the Attorney General, in construing the act, advised the government:\n'If your agents reasonably suspect that a violation of law has occurred, in my opinion they have power to search any vessel within the three-mile limit according to the practice of customs officers when acting under section 3059 of the Revised Statutes [Comp. St.  5761], and to seize such vessels.' 26 Op. Attys. Gen. 243.\n\n We have made a somewhat extended reference to these statutes to show that the guaranty of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures by the Fourth Amendment has been construed, practically since the beginning of the government, as recognizing a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house, or other structure in respect of which a proper official warrant readily may be obtained and a search of a ship, motor boat, wagon, or automobile for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant, because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\n Having thus established that contraband goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant, we come now to consider under what circumstances such search may be made. It would be intolerable and unreasonable \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 154]\n\u00a0\n if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor, and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Travelers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self-protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official, authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise. Section 26, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, like the second section of the act of 1789, for the searching of vessels, like the provisions of the act of 1815, and section 3601, Revised Statutes, for searching vehicles for smuggled goods, and like the act of 1822, and that of 1834 and section 2140, R. S., and the act of 1917 for the search of vehicles and automobiles for liquor smuggled into the Indian country, was enacted primarily to accomplish the seizure and destruction of contraband goods; secondly, the automobile was to be forfeited; and, thirdly, the driver was to be arrested. Under section 29, title 2, of the act the latter might be punished by not more than $500 fine for the first offense, not more than $1,000 fine and 90 days' imprisonment for the second offense, and by a fine of $500 or more and by not more than 2 years' imprisonment for the third offense. Thus he is to be arrested for a misdemeanor for his first and second offenses, and for a felony if he offends the third time.\n The main purpose of the act obviously was to deal with the liquor and its transportation, and to destroy it. The mere manufacture of liquor can do little to defeat the policy of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Prohibition Act, unless the for \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 155]\n\u00a0\n bidden product can be distributed for illegal sale and use. Section 26 was intended to reach and destroy the forbidden liquor in transportation and the provisions for forfeiture of the vehicle and the arrest of the transporter were incidental. The rule for determining what may be required before a seizure may be made by a competent seizing official is not to be determined by the character of the penalty to which the transporter may be subjected. Under section 28, title 2, of the Prohibition Act, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, his assistants, agents and inspectors are to have the power and protection in the enforcement of the act conferred by the existing laws relating to the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors. Officers who seize under section 26 of the Prohibition Act are therefore protected by section 970 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1611), providing that:\n'When, in any prosecution commenced on account of the seizure of any vessel, goods, wares, or merchandise, made by any collector or other officer, under any act of Congress authorizing such seizure, judgment is rendered for the claimant, but it appears to the court that there was reasonable cause of seizure, the court shall cause a proper certificate thereof to be entered, and the claimant shall not, in such case, be entitled to costs, nor shall the person who made the seizure, nor the prosecutor, be liable to suit or judgment on account of such suit or prosecution: Provided, that the vessel, goods, wares, or merchandise be, after judgment, forthwith returned to such claimant or his agent.'\n\n It follows from this that, if an officer seizes an autombile or the liquor in it without a warrant, and the facts as subsequently developed do not justify a judgment of condemnation and forfeiture, the officer may escape costs or a suit for damages by a showing that he had reasonable or probable cause for the seizure. Stacey v. Emery, \n97 U.S. 642\n. The measure of legality of such a seizure is, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 156]\n\u00a0\n therefore, that the seizing officer shall have reasonable or probable cause for believing that the antomobile which he stops and seizes has contraband liquor therein which is being illegally transported.\n We here find the line of distrinction between legal and illegal seizures of liquor in transport in vehicles. It is certainly a reasonable distinction. It gives the owner of an automobile or other vehicle seized under section 26, in absence of probable cause, a right to have restored to him the automobile, it protects him under the Weeks and Amos Cases from use of the liquor as evidence against him, and it subjects the officer making the seizures to damages. On the other hand, in a case showing probalbe cause, the government and its officials are given the opportunity which they should have, to make the investigation necessary to trace reasonably suspected contraband goods and to seize them.\n Such a rule fulfills the guaranty of the Fourth Amendment. In cases where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used and when properly supported by affidavit and issued after judicial approval protects the seizing officer against a suit for damages. In cases where seizure is impossible except without warrant, the seizing officer acts unlawfully and at his peril unless he can show the court probable cause. United States v. Kaplan (D. C.) 286 F. 963, 972.\n But we are pressed with the argument that if the search of the automobile discloses the presence of liquor and leads under the staute to the arrest of the person in charge of the automobile, the right of seizure should be limited by the common-law rule as to the circumstances justifying an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor. The usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one believed by the officer upon reasonable cause to have been guilty of a felony, and that he may only arrest without a warrant one guilty of a misdemeanor if committed \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 157]\n\u00a0\n in his presence. Kurtz v. Moffitt, \n115 \nU.S. 487\n, 6 S. Ct. 148; John Bad Elk v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 529\n, 20 S. Ct. 729. The rule is sometimes expressed as follows:\n'In cases of misdemeanor, a peace officer like a private person has at common law no power of arresting without a warrant except when a breach of the peace has been committed in his presence or there is reasonable ground for supposing that a breach of peace is about to be committed or renewed in his presence.' Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 9, part. III, 612.\n\n The reason for arrest for misdemeanors without warrant at common law was promptly to suppress breaches of the peace (1 Stephen, History of Criminal Law, 193), while the reason for arrest without warrant on a reliable report of a felony was because the public safety and the due apprehension of criminals charged with heinous offenses required that such arrests should be made at once without warrant (Rohan v. Sawin, 5 Cush. [ Mass.] 281). The argument for defendants is that, as the misdemeanor to justify arrest without warrant must be committed in the presence of the police officer, the offense is not committed in his presence unless he can by his senses detect that the liquor is being transported, no matter how reliable his previous information by which he can identify the automobile as loaded with it. Elrod v. Moss (C. C. A.) 278 F. 123; Hughes v. State, 145 Tenn. 544, 238 S. W. 588, 20 A. L. R. 639.\n So it is that under the rule contended for by defendants the liquor if carried by one who has been already twice convicted of the same offense may be seized on information other than the senses, while if he has been only once convicted it may not be seized unless the presence of the liquor is detected by the senses as the automobile concealing it rushes by. This is certainly a very unsatisfactory line of difference when the main object of the section is to forfeit and suppress the liquor, the arrest of the individual being only incidental as shown by the lightness \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 158]\n\u00a0\n of the penalty. See Commonwealth v. Street, 3 Pa. Dist. and Co. Ct. Rep. 783. In England at the common law the difference in punishment between felonies and misdemeanors was very great. Under our present federal statutes, it is much less important and Congress may exercise a relatively wide discretion in classing particular offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. As the main purpose of section 26 was seizure and forfeiture, it is not so much the owner as the property that offends. Agnew v. Haymes, 141 F. 631, 641, 72 C. C. A. 325. The language of the section provides for seizure when the officer of the law 'discovers' any one in the act of transporting the liquor by automobile or other vehicle. Certainly it is a very narrow and technical construction of this word which would limit it to what the officer sees, hears or smells as the automobile rolls by and excludes therefrom when he identifies the car the convincing information that he may previously have received as to the use being made of it.\n We do not think such a nice distinction is applicable in the present case. When a man is legally arrested for an offense, whatever is found upon his person or in his control which it is unlawful for him to have and which may be used to prove the offense may be seized and held as evidence in the prosecution. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 392\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177; Dillon v. O'Brien and Davis, 16 Cox, C. C. 245; Getchell v. Page, 103 Me. 387, 69 A. 624, 18 L. R. A. (N. S.) 253, 125 Am. St. Rep. 307; Kneeland v. Connally, 70 Ga. 424; 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure,  211; 1 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (10th Ed.)  97. The argument of defendants is based on the theory that the seizure in this case can only be thus justified. If their theory were sound, their conclusion would be. The validity of the seizure then would turn wholly on the validity of the arrest without a seizure. But the theory is unsound. The right to search and the validity of the seizure are not dependent on the right to arrest. They are dependent on the reasonable cause the seizing officer \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 159]\n\u00a0\n has for belief that the contents of the automobile offend against the law. The seizure in such a proceeding comes before the arrest as section 26 indicates. It is true that section 26, title 2, provides for immediate proceedings against the person arrested and that upon conviction the liquor is to be destroyed and the automobile or other vehicle is to be sold, with the saving of the interest of a lienor who does not know of its unlawful use; but it is evident that if the person arrested is ignorant of the contents of the vehicle, or if he escapes, proceedings can be had against the liquor for destruction or other disposition under section 25 of the same title. The character of the offense for which, after the contraband liquor is found and seized, the driver can be prosecuted does not affect the validity of the seizure.\n This conclusion is in keeping with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and the principles of search and seizure of contraband forfeitable property; and it is a wise one because it leaves the rule one which is easily applied and understood and is uniform. Houck v. State, 106 Ohio St. 195, 140 N. E. 112, accords with this conclusion. Ash v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 277, and Milam v. United States (C. C. A.) 296 F. 629, decisions by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit take the same view. The Ash Case is very similar in its facts to the case at bar, and both were by the same court which decided Snyder v. United States ( C. C. A.) 285 F. 1, cited for the defendants. See, also, Park v. United States (1st C. C. A.) 294 F. 776, 783, and Lambert v. United States (9th C. C. A.) 282 F. 413.\n Finally, was there probable cause? In The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, the question was whether the seizure of a French vessel at a particular place was upon probable cause that she was there for the purpose of smuggling. In this discussion Mr. Justice Story, who delivered the judgment of the court, said (page 374):\n'It has been very justly observed at the bar that the court is bound to take notice of public facts and geographical \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 160]\n\u00a0\n positions, and that this remote part of the country has been infested, at different periods, by smugglers, is matter of general notoriety, and may be gathered from the public documents of the government.'\n\n We know in this way that Grand Rapids is about 152 miles from Detroit, and that Detroit and its neighborhood along the Detroit river, which is the international boundary, is one of the most active centers for introducing illegally into this country spirituous liquors for distribution into the interior. It is obvious from the evidence that the prohibition agents were engaged in a regular patrol along the important highways from Detroit to Grand Rapids to stop and seize liquor carried in automobiles. They knew or had convincing evidence to make them believe that the Carroll boys, as they called them, were so-called 'bootleggers' in Grand Rapids; i. e., that they were engaged in plying the unlawful trade of selling such liquor in that city. The officers had soon after noted their going from Grand Rapids half way to Detroit, and attempted to follow them to that city to see where they went, but they escaped observation. Two months later these officers suddenly met the same men on their way westward presumably from Detroit. The partners in the original combination to sell liquor in Grand Rapids were together in the same automobile they had been in the night when they tried to furnish the whisky to the officers, which was thus identified as part of the firm equipment. They were coming from the direction of the great source of supply for their stock to Grand Rapids, where they plied their trade. That the officers, when they saw the defendants, believed that they were carrying liquor, we can have no doubt, and we think it is equally clear that they had reasonable cause for thinking so. Emphasis is put by defendants' counsel on the statement made by one of the officers that they were not looking for defendants at the particular time when they appeared. We do not perceive that it has any weight. As soon as they did appear, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 161]\n\u00a0\n the officers were entitled to use their reasoning faculties upon all the facts of which they had previous knowledge in respect to the defendants.\n The necessity for probable cause in justifying seizures on land or sea, in making arrests without warrant for past felonies, and in malicious prosecution and false imprisonment cases has led to frequent definition of the phrase. In Stacey v. Emery, \n97 U.S. 642\n, 645 (24 L. Ed. 1035), a suit for damages for seizure by a collector, this court defined probable cause as follows:\n'If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been committed, it is sufficient.'\n\n See Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch, 339; The George, 1 Mason, 24, Fed. Cas. No. 5328; The Thompson, 3 Wall. 155.\n It was laid down by Chief Justice Shaw, in Commonwealth v. Carey, 12 Cush. 246, 251, that:\n'If a constable or other peace officer arrest a person without a warrant, he is not bound to show in his justification a felony actually committed, to render the arrest lawful; but if he suspects one on his own knowledge of facts, or on facts communicated to him by others, and thereupon he has reasonable ground to believe that the accused has been guilty of felony, the arrest is not unlawful.' Commonwealth v. Phelps, 209 Mass. 396, 95 N. E. 868, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 566; Rohan v. Sawin, 5 Cush. 281, 285.\n\n In McCarthy v. De Armit, 99 Pa. 63, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania sums up the definition of probable cause in this way (page 69):\n'The substance of all the definitions is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.'\n\n In the case of the Director General v. Kastenbaum, \n263 \nU.S. 25\n, 44 S. Ct. 52, which was a suit for false imprisonment, it was said by this court (page 28 [44 S. Ct. 53]):\n'But, as we have seen, good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause. That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the Director General's agent, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 162]\n\u00a0\n which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable.'\n\n See, also, Munn v. De Nemours, 3 Wash. C. C. 37, Fed. Cas. No. 9926.\n In the light of these authorities, and what is shown by this record, it is clear the officers here had justification for the search and seizure. This is to say that the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched.\n Counsel finally argue that the defendants should be permitted to escape the effect of the conviction because the court refused on motion to deliver them the liquor when, as they say, the evidence adduced on the motion was much less than that shown on the trial, and did not show probable cause. The record does not make it clear what evidence was produced in support of or against the motion. But, apart from this, we think the point is without substance here. If the evidence given on the trial was sufficient, as we think it was, to sustain the introduction of the liquor as evidence, it is immaterial that there was an inadequacy of evidence when application was made for its return. A conviction on adequate and admissible evidence should not be set aside on such a ground. The whole matter was gone into at the trial, so no right of the defendants was infringed.\n Counsel for the government contend that Kiro, the defendant who did not own the automobile, could not complain of the violation of the Fourth Amendment in the use of the liquor as evidence against him, whatever the view taken as to Carroll's rights. Our conclusion as to the whole case makes it unnecessary for us to discuss this aspect of it.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 163]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, before his retirement, concurred in this opinion.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n\n 1. \nThe damnable character of the 'bootlegger's' business should not close our eyes to the mischief which will surely follow any attempt to destroy it by unwarranted methods. 'To press forward to a great principle by breaking through every other great principle that stands in the way of its establishment; ... in short, to procure an eminent good by means that are unlawful, is as little consonant to private morality as to public justice.' Sir William Scott, The Le Louis, 2 Dodson, 210, 257.\n While quietly driving an ordinary automobile along a much frequented public road, plaintiffs in error were arrested by federal officers without a warrant and upon mere suspicion-ill-founded, as I think. The officers then searched the machine and discovered carefully secreted whisky, which was seized and thereafter used as evidence against plaintiffs in error when on trial for transporting intoxicating liquor contrary to the Volstead Act. 41 Stat. 305, c. 85. They maintain that both arrest and seizure were unlawful and that use of the liquor as evidence violated their constitutional rights.\n This is not a proceeding to forfeit seized goods; nor is it an action against the seizing officer for a tort. Cases like the following are not controlling: Crowell v. McFadon. 8 Cranch, 94, 98; United States v. 1960 Bags of Coffee, 8 Cranch, 398, 403, 405; Otis v. Watkins, 9 Cranch, 339; Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310, 318; Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342; Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205. They turned upon express provisions of applicable acts of Congress; they did not involve the point now presented and afford little, if any, assistance toward its proper solution. The Volstead Act does not, in terms, authorize arrest or seizure upon mere suspicion. \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 164]\n\u00a0\n Whether the officers are shielded from prosecution or action by Rev. Stat.  970, is not important. That section does not undertake to deprive the citizen of any constitutional right or to permit the use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It does, however, indicate the clear understanding of Congress that probable cause is not always enough to justify a seizure.\n Nor are we now concerned with the question whether by apt words Congress might have authorized the arrest without a warrant. It has not attempted to do this. On the contrary, the whole history of the legislation indicates a fixed purpose not so to do. First and second violations are declared to be misdemeanors-nothing more-and Congress, of course, understood the rule concerning arrests for such offenses. Whether different penalties should have been prescribed or other provisions added is not for us to inquire; nor do difficulties attending enforcement give us power to supplement the legislation.\n\n 2. \nAs the Volstead Act contains no definite grant of authority to arrest upon suspicion and without warrant for a first offense, we come to inquire whether such authority can be inferred from its provisions.\n Unless the statute which creates a misdemeanor contains some clear provision to the contrary, suspicion that it is being violated will not justify an arrest. Criminal statutes must be strictly construed and applied, in harmony with rules of the common law. United States v. Harris, \n177 \nU.S. 305, 310\n, 20 S. Ct. 609. And the well-settled doctrine is that an arrest for a misdemeanor may not be made without a warrant unless the offense is committed in the officer's presence.\n Kurtz v. Moffitt, \n115 \nU.S. 487, 498\n, 6 S. Ct. 148, 152 (29 L. Ed. 458):\n'By the common law of England, neither a civil officer nor a private citizen had the right without a warrant to make an arrest for a crime not committed in his presence, except in the case \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 165]\n\u00a0\n of felony, and then only for the purpose of bringing the offender before a civil magistrate.'\n\n John Bad Elk v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 20 S. Ct. 729, 731 ( 44 L. Ed. 874):\n'An officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.'\n\n Commonwealth v. Wright, 158 Mass. 149, 158, 33 N. E. 82, 85 (19 L. R. A. 206, 35 Am. St. Rep. 475):\n'It is suggested that the statutory misdemeanor of having in one's possession short lobsters with intent to sell them is a continuing offence, which is being committed while such possession continues, and that therefore an officer who sees any person in possession of such lobsters with intent to sell them can arrest such person without a warrant, as for a misdemeanor committed in his presence. We are of opinion, however, that for statutory misdemeanors of this kind, not amounting to a breach of the peace, there is no authority in an officer to arrest without a warrant, unless it is given by statute . ... The Legislature has often empowered officers to arrest without a warrant for similar offenses, which perhaps tends to show that, in its opinion, no such right exists at common law.'\n\n Pinkerton v. Verberg, 78 Mich. 573, 584, 44 N. W. 579, 582 (7 L. R. A. 507, 18 Am. St. Rep. 473):\n'Any law which would place the keeping and safe-conduct of another in the hands of even a conservator of the peace, unless for some breach of the peace committed in his presence, or upon suspicion of felony, would be most oppressive and unjust, and destroy all the rights which our Constitution guarantees. These are rights which existed long before our Constitution, and we have taken just pride in their maintenance, making them a part of the fundamental law of the land.' 'If persons can be restrained of their liberty, and assaulted and imprisoned, under such circumstances, without complaint or warrant, then there is no limit to the power of a police officer.'\n\n\n 3. \nThe Volstead Act contains no provision which annuls the accepted common-law rule or discloses definite intent \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 166]\n\u00a0\n to authorize arrests without warrant for misdemeanors not committed in the officer's presence.\n To support the contrary view section 26 is relied upon.\n'When ... any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. Whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle and team or automobile, boat, air or water craft, or any other conveyance, and shall arrest any person in charge thereof.'\n\n Let it be observed that this section has no special application to automobiles; it includes any vehicle-buggy, wagon, boat, or air craft. Certainly, in a criminal statute, always to be strictly construed, the words 'shall discover ... in the act of transporting in violation of the law' cannot mean shall have reasonable cause to suspect or believe that such transportation is being carried on. To discover and to suspect are wholly different things. Since the beginning apt words have been used when Congress intended that arrests for misdemeanors or seizures might be made upon suspicion. It has studiously refrained from making a felony of the offense here charged; and it did not undertake by any apt words to enlarge the power to arrest. It was not ignorant of the established rule on the subject, and well understood how this could be abrogated, as plainly appears from statutes like the following:\n'An act to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage,' approved March 2, 1789, 1 Stat. 627, 677, 678, c. 22; 'An act to provide more effectually for the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise imported \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 167]\n\u00a0\n into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels,' approved August 4, 1790, 1 Stat. 145, 170, c. 35; 'An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and tonnage,' approved March 3, 1815, 3 Stat. 231, 232, c. 94.\n\n These and similar acts definitely empowered officers to seize upon suspicion and therein radically differ from the Volstead Act, which authorized no such thing.\n'An act supplemental to the National Prohibition Act,' approved November 23, 1921, 42 Stat. 222, 223, c. 134, provides:\n\n'That any officer, agent, or employee of the United States engaged in the enforcement of this act, or the National Prohibition Act, or any other law of the United States, who shall search any private dwelling as defined in the National Prohibition Act, and occupied as such dwelling, without a warrant directing such search, or who while so engaged shall without a search warrant maliciously and without reasonable cause search any other building or property, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined for a first offense not more than $1,000, and for a subsequent offense not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.'\n\n And it is argued that the words and history of this section indicate the intent of Congress to distinguish between the necessity for warrants in order to search private dwelling and the right to search automobiles without one. Evidently Congress regarded the searching of private dwellings as matter of much graver consequence than some other searches and distinguished between them by declaring the former criminal. But the connection between this distinction and the legality of plaintiffs in error's arrest is not apparent. Nor can I find reason for inquiring concerning the validity of the distinction under the Fourth Amendment. Of course, the distinction is \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 168]\n\u00a0\n valid, and so are some seizures. But what of it? The act made nothing legal which theretofore was unlawful, and to conclude that by declaring the unauthorized search of a private dwelling criminal Congress intended to remove ancient restrictions from other searches and from arrests as well, would seem impossible.\n While the Fourth Amendment denounces only unreasonable seizures unreasonableness often depends upon the means adopted. Here the seizure followed an unlawful arrest, and therefore became itself unlawful-as plainly unlawful as the seizure within the home so vigorously denounced in Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 391\n, 392 S., 393, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177.\n In Snyder v. United States, 285 F. 1, 2, the Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, rejected evidence obtained by an unwarranted arrest, and clearly announced some very wholesome doctrine:\n'That an officer may not make an arrest for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence, without a warrant, has been so frequently decided as not to require citation of authority. It is equally fundamental that a citizen may not be arrested on suspicion of having committed a misdemeanor and have his person searched by force, without a warrant of arrest. If, therefore, the arresting officer in this case had no other justification for the arrest than the mere suspicion that a bottle, only the neck of which he could see protruding from the pocket of defendant's coat, contained intoxicating liquor, then it would seem to follow without much question that the arrest and search, without first having secured a warrant, were illegal. And that his only justification was his suspicion is admitted by the evidence of the arresting officer himself. If the bottle had been empty or if it had contained any one of a dozen innoxious liquids, the act of the officer would, admittedly, have been an unlawful invasion of the personal liberty of the defendant. That it happened in this instance to contain whisky, we think, \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 169]\n\u00a0\n neither justifies the assault nor condemns the principle which makes such an act unlawful.'\n\n The validity of the seizure under consideration depends on the legality of the arrest. This did not follow the seizure, but the reverse is true. Plaintiffs in error were first brought within the officers' power, and, while therein, the seizure took place. If an officer, upon mere suspicion of a misdemeanor, may stop one on the public highway, take articles away from him and thereafter use them as evidence to convict him of crime, what becomes of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments?\n In Weeks v. United States, supra, through Mr. Justice Day, this court said:\n'The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the people, their persons, houses, papers and effects against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. This protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not, and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our federal system with the enforcement of the laws. The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions, the latter often obtained after subjecting accused persons to unwarranted practices destructive of rights secured by the federal Constitution, should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts which are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights. ... The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 170]\n\u00a0\n resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.'\n\n Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 40 S. Ct. 182:\n'The proposition could not be presented more nakedly. It is that although of course its seizure was an outrage which the government now regrets, it may study the papers before it returns them, copy them, and then may use the knowledge that it has gained to call upon the owners in a more regular form to produce them; that the protection of the Constitution covers the physical possession but not any advantages that the government can gain over the object of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act. Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, to be sure, had established that laying the papers directly before the grand jury was unwarranted, but it is taken to mean only that two steps are required instead of one. In our opinion such is not the law. It reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words. \n232 U.S. 393\n. The essence of a provision forbidling the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court but that it shall not be used at all. Of course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the government's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed.'\n\n Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S. Ct. 261, and Amos v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 313\n, 41 S. Ct. 266, distinctly point out that property procured by unlawful action of federal officers cannot be introduced as evidence.\n The arrest of plaintiffs in error was unauthorized, illegal, and violated the guaranty of due process given by the Fifth Amendment. The liquor offered in evidence was obtained by the search which followed this arrest and was therefore obtained in violation of their constitutional \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 171]\n\u00a0\n rights. Articles found upon or in the control of one lawfully arrested may be used as evidence for certain purposes, but not at all when secured by the unlawful action of a federal officer.\n\n 4. \nThe facts known by the officers who arrested plaintiffs in error were wholly insufficient to create a reasonable belief that they were transporting liquor contrary to law. These facts were detailed by Fred Cronenwett, chief prohibition officer. His entire testimony as given at the trial follows:\n'I am in charge of the federal prohibition department in this district. I am acquainted with these two respondents, and first saw them on September 29, 1921, in Mr. Scully's apartment on Oakes street, Grand Rapids. There were three of them that came to Mr. Scully's apartment, one by the name of Kruska, George Krio, and John Carroll. I was introduced to them under the name of Stafford, and told them I was working for the Michigan Chair Company, and wanted to buy three cases of whisky, and the price was agreed upon. After they thought I was all right, they said they would be back in half or three-quarters of an hour; that they had to go out to the east end of Grand Rapids to get this liquor. They went away and came back in a short time, and Mr. Kruska came upstairs and said they couldn't get it that night; that a fellow by the name of Irving, where they were going to get it, wasn't in, but they were going to deliver it the next day, about ten. They didn't deliver it the next day. I am not positive about the price. It seems to me it was around $130 a case. It might be $135. Both respondents took part in this conversation. When they came to Mr. Scully's apartment they had this same car. While it was dark and I wasn't able to get a good look at this car, later, on the 6th day of October, when I was out on the road with Mr. Scully, I was waiting on the highway while he went to Reed's Lake to get a light \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 172]\n\u00a0\n lunch, and they drove by, and I had their license number and the appearance of their car, and knowing the two boys, seeing them on the 29th day of September, I was satisfied when I seen the car on December 15th it was the same car I had seen on the 6th day of October. On the 6th day of October it was probably twenty minutes before Scully got back to where I was. I told him the Carroll boys had just gone toward Detroit and we were trying to catch up with them and see where they were going. We did catch up with them somewhere along by Ada, just before we got to Ada, and followed them to East Lansing. We gave up the chase at East Lansing.\n\n'On the 15th of December, when Peterson and Scully and I overhauled this car on the road, it was in the country, on Pike 16, the road leading between Grand Rapids and Detroit. When we passed the car we were going toward Ionia, or Detroit, and the Kiro and Carroll boys were coming towards Grand Rapids when Mr. Scully and I recognized them and said, 'There goes the Carroll brothers,' and we went on still further in the same direction we were going and turned around and went back to them-drove up to the side of them. Mr. Scully was driving the car; I was sitting in the front seat, and I stepped out on the running board and held out my hand and said, 'Carroll, stop that car,' and they did stop it. John Kiro was driving the car. After we got them stopped, we asked them to get out of the car, which they did. Carroll referred to me, and called me by the name of 'Fred,' just as soon as I got up to him. Raised up the back part of the roadster; didn't find any liquor there; then raised up the cushion; then I struck at the lazyback of the seat and it was hard. I then started to open it up, and I did tear the cushion some, and Carroll said, 'Don't tear the cushion; we have only got six cases in there;' and I took out two bottles and found out it was liquor; satisfied it was liquor. Mr. Peterson and a fellow by the \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 173]\n\u00a0\n name of Gerald Donker came in with the two Carroll boys and the liquor and the car to Grand Rapids. They brought the two defendants and the car and the liquor to Grand Rapids. I and the other men besides Peterson stayed out on the road, looking for other cars that we had information were coming in. There was conversation between me and Carroll before Peterson started for town with the defendants. Mr. Carroll said, 'Take the liquor, and give us one more chance, and I will make it right with you.' At the same time he reached in one of his trousers pockets and pulled out money; the amount of it I don't know. I wouldn't say it was a whole lot. I saw a $10 bill and there was some other bills; I don't know how much there was; it wasn't a large amount.\n\n'As I understand, Mr. Hanley helped carry the liquor from the car. On the next day afterwards, we put this liquor in boxes, steel boxes, and left it in the marshal's vault, and it is still there now. Mr. Hanley and Chief Deputy Johnson, some of the agents and myself were there. Mr. Peterson was there the next day that the labels were signed by the different officers; those two bottles, Exhibits A and B.\n\n'Q. Now, those two bottles, Exhibits A and B, were those the two bottles you took out of the car out there, or were those two bottles taken out of the liquor after it got up here? A. We didn't label them out on the road; simply found it was liquor and sent it in; and this liquor was in Mr. Hanley's custody that evening and during the middle of the next day when we checked it over to see the amount of liquor that was there. Mr. Johnson and I sealed the bottles, and Mr. Johnson's name is on the label that goes over the bottle with mine, and this liquor was taken out of the case to-day. It was taken out for the purpose of analyzation. The others were not broken until to- day. \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 174]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. And are you able to tell us, from the label and from the bottles, whether it is part of the same liquor taken out of that car? A. It has the appearance of it; yes, sir. Those are the bottles that were in there that Mr. Hanley said was gotten out of the Carroll car.'\n\n Cross-examination:\n'I think I was the first one to get back to the Carroll car after it was stopped. I had a gun in my pocket; I didn't present it. I was the first one to the car and raised up the back of the car, but the others were there shortly afterward. We assembled right around the car immediately.\n\n'Q. And whatever examination and what investigation you made you went right ahead and did it in your own way? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And took possession of it, arrested them, and brought them in? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And at that time, of course, you had no search warrant? A. No, sir. We had no knowledge that this car was coming through at that particular time.'\n\n Redirect examination:\n'The lazyback was awfully hard when I struck it with my fist. It was harder than upholstery ordinarily is in those backs; a great deal harder. It was practically solid. Sixty-nine quarts of whisky in one lazyback.'\n\n The negotiation concerning three cases of whisky on September 29th was the only circumstance which could have subjected plaintiffs in error to any reasonable suspicion. No whisky was delivered, and it is not certain that they ever intended to deliver any. The arrest came 2 1\/2 months after the negotiation. Every act in the meantime is consistent with complete innocence. Has it come about that merely because a man once agreed to deliver whisky, but did not, he may be arrested whenever thereafter he ventures to drive an automobile on the road to Detroit!\n\n 5. \nWhen Congress has intended that seizures or arrests might be made upon suspicion it has been careful to say \n\n[267 U.S. 132, 175]\n\u00a0\n so. The history and terms of the Volstead Act are not consistent with the suggestion that it was the purpose of Congress to grant the power here claimed for enforcement officers. The facts known when the arrest occurred were wholly insufficient to engender reasonable belief that plaintiffs in error were committing a misdemeanor, and the legality of the arrest cannot be supported by facts ascertained through the search which followed.\n To me it seems clear enough that the judgment should be reversed.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCEMENT MFRS' PROTECTIVE ASS'N v. U S(1925)\nNo. 551\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis and Archibald Cox, both of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final decree of the District Court for the Southern District of New York granting a perpetual injunction in a proceeding brought by the United States under section 4, chapter 647, of the Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8823), commonly known as the Sherman Act. Defendants are the Cement Manufacturers' Protective Association, an unincorporated association, four individuals, the officers of the association and 19 corporations, members of the association, engaged in manufacturing and shipping Portland cement in interstate commerce, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and Virginia. The petition, which was filed on the 30th day of June, 1921, alleges restraint of interstate commerce in violation of section 1 of the act ( Comp. St.  8820). The complaint prays that the Cement Manufacturers' Protective Association be adjudged a violation of section 1 and enjoined accordingly. After final hearing, the District Court entered its decree enjoining the continuance of the Cement Manufacturers' Protective Association and enjoined it and the several defendants from engaging in the activities of which the government complains and of which a summary account will presently be given.\n The association was organized in January, 1916. Its purposes, as described by the constitution, were:\n The 'collection \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 591]\n\u00a0\n and dissemination of such accurate information as may serve to protect each manufacturer against misrepresentation, deception and imposition, and enable him to conduct his business exactly as he pleases in every respect, and particularly free from misdirection by false or insufficient information concerning the following matters, to wit:\n'(a) Information concerning credits;\n\n'(b) Information concerning contracts which have been made for the delivery of cement sufficiently complete to enable the manufacturer to protect himself against spurious contracts and like transactions induced by misrepresentations;\n\n'(c) Information concerning freight rates on cement;\n\n'(d) Statistical information as to production; stocks of cement and clinker on hand, and shipments.'\n\n The constitution also provides that--\n'Membership in the association shall be recognized as implying that the member is absolutely free to conduct his business exactly as he pleases in every respect and particular.'\n\n Cement is a thoroughly standardized product. It is manufactured from limestone and shale which are crushed to extreme fineness. then subjected to high temperatures which process produces a fused mass, which when cooled is known as clinker. The clinker is then ground into the finished product, which is then ready for transportation and use. Clinker is not subject to deterioration, but the ground clinker or cement deteriorates rapidly on exposure to moisture and cannot be kept in storage except for a limited period of time. The defendant corporations are manufacturers of this product, which is shipped in interstate commerce principally within the areas of the several states in which the several defendants are located, and they are competitors in the business of shipping the product in interstate commerce. From 60 per cent. to 65 per cent. of the total product of the several corporate defendants is sold \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 592]\n\u00a0\n to the general trade for immediate use. Of this 60 per cent. to 65 per cent. approximately two-thirds is sold to dealers who are allowed a differential from the sales price to the retail trade.\n The activities of defendant, on which the government bases its case for an injunction, may summarily be stated as follows: The government charges that the defendants, through the activities of the association, control prices and production of cement within the territorial area served by the several defendants in the following manner:\n\n\n (1)\n By the use of 'specific job contracts' for future delivery of cement, accompanied by a system of reports and trade espionage having as its objective the restriction of deliveries of cement under those contracts.\n\n\n (2)\n By compiling and distributing, among the members, freight rate books which give the rate of freight from arbitrary basing points to numerous points of delivery within the territorial area served by the several defendants;\n\n\n (3)\n By exchange of information concerning credits;\n\n\n (4)\n By activities of the association at its meetings.\n The government asserts that uniformity of prices and limitation of production are necessary results of these activities of the defendants. It does not, however, charge any agreement or understanding between the defendants placing limitations on either prices or production. The evidence does not establish that prices were excessive or unreasonable, and the District Court found 'as compared with the rise of prices of other basic commodities, it is possible to say that the quotations of cement advanced less than others.' The court also found that competition had not been destroyed by the association and that upon many occasions the defendants were active in endeavoring to take business from companies associated with them. The court, however, held that the activities of the defendant in connection with specific job contracts tended to \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 593]\n\u00a0\n limit the amount of cement distributed to the trade under those contracts; that the exchange of information complained of generally tended to limit production; that the dissemination of this information, especially that contained in the freight rate book, tended to produce uniformity in price; and that there was accordingly a restraint of commerce within the principles laid down in American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 393\n, 42 S. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093; United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S. Ct. 607\n\n\n It is conceded, and the court below found, that before the organization of the present association there was substantial uniformity of trade practices in the cement trade, so far as is pertinent to the present discussion, in the following respects:\n\n\n (1)\n The sale of cement by specific job contracts for future delivery;\n\n\n (2)\n The selling of cement, f. o. b. delivery;\n\n\n (3)\n Using freight basing points in the quotation of prices;\n\n\n (4)\n Including in all quotations for sale of cement, a freight rate from a basing point to the place of delivery;\n\n\n (5)\n Charging purchasers of cement for bags in which the product is shipped and allowing credit for bags returned to the manufacturers in good condition.\n Since there is no exchange of information among the defendants with respect to contracts for the sale of cement for immediate delivery, which constitutes more than 60 per cent. of the business, the government's contention before this court centered upon the use of the specific job contract by defendants and their activities in connection with such contracts, since without the use of the specific job contract the other activities complained of could have no substantial bearing on restraint of competition with respect either to prices or production. It will therefore be necessary to \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 594]\n\u00a0\n consider more at length the activities of the defendants in connection with specific job contracts and incidentally their other activities as related to sales of cement under specific job contracts and the information exchanged with respect to such contracts.\n Specific Job Contracts.\n The specific job contract and the practices of the trade with respect to making deliveries in performance of those contracts were customary in the trade long before any of the collective activities complained of in this case. We do not understand the government to contend that the use of specific job contracts by defendants or that their use generally by the trade is the result of any agreement or understanding or in itself constitutes any violation of the Sherman Law. It is contended that the violation arises rather from the co-operation among the several defendants in acquiring and distributing information with reference to specific job contracts and the effect of the dissemination of that information on the trade, to which reference will now be made.\n The specific job contract is a form of contract in common use by manufacturers of cement whereby cement is sold for future delivery for use in a specific piece of construction which is described in the contract. As was stated in the opinion of the court below, they are contracts 'whereby a manufacturer is to deliver, in the future, cement to be used in a specific piece of work, such as a particular building or road, and the obligation is that the manufacturer shall furnish and the contractor shall take only such cement as is required for or used for the specific purpose.' These contracts have, by universal practice, been treated by cement manufacturers as, in effect, free options customarily made and acted upon on the understanding that the purchaser is to pay nothing until after \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 595]\n\u00a0\n the delivery of the cement to him; that he is not obligated in any event to take the cement contracted for unless he chooses to; that he is not held to the price named in the contract in the event of a decline in the market price; whereas the manufacturer may be held to the contract price if the market advances and may be held for the delivery of the full amount of cement required for the completion of the particular piece of construction described in the contract. The practical effect and operation of the specific job contract therefore is to enable contractors who are bidding upon construction work to secure a call or option for the cement required for the completion of that particular job at a price which may not be increased, but may be reduced if the market declines. It enables contractors to bid for future construction work with the assurance that the requisite cement will be available at a definitely ascertained maximum price.\n In view of the option features of the contract referred to, the contractor is involved in no business risk if he enter into several specific job contracts with several manufacturers for the delivery of cement for a single specific job. The manufacturer, however, is under no moral or legal obligation to supply cement except such as is required for the specific job. If, therefore, the contractor takes advantage of his position and of the peculiar form of the specific job contract, as modified by the custom of the trade, to secure deliveries from each of several manufacturers of the full amount of cement required for the particular job, he in effect secures the future delivery of cement not required for the particular job, which he is not entitled to receive, which the manufacturer is under no legal or moral obligation to deliver, and which presumably he would not deliver if he had information that it was not to be used in accordance with his contract. The activities of the defendants complained of are directed toward securing this information and communicating it \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 596]\n\u00a0\n to members, and thus placing them in a position to prevent contractors from securing future deliveries of cement which they are not entitled to receive under their specific job contracts, and which experience shows they endeavor to procure especially in a rising market.\n Members are required to make to the secretary of the association prompt reports of all specific job contracts, describing in detail the contract and giving the name and address of the purchaser; the amount of cement required, the price and delivery point; also the date of expiration of the contract. They are also required to make detailed reports of all changes in the contract, including increases in the amount of cement to be delivered and cancellations. The association also employs 'checkers,' whose business it is, by actual inspection and inquiry, to ascertain, so far as possible, the amount of cement required for specific jobs referred to in specific job contracts, and whether cement shipped under specific job contracts is actually used or required for use under such contracts. Without entering into any detailed discussion of this phase of the activity of defendants, we accept fully the government's contention that the defendants regularly take all practicable steps to ascertain whether cement contracted for under the specific job type of contract was actually being used for the job described in the contract, and that the fullest information with respect to such contracts and the use of cement shipped under said contracts is reported to the members of the association through the mediation of the secretary.\n The government does not contend that the activities of the association with respect to specific job contracts diminished the number of such contracts, or that they diminished in any way the obligations of members of the association upon such contracts. There is, however, abundant evidence to show that there were actual concellations of deliveries on the ground that contractors were \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 597]\n\u00a0\n not entitled, under the terms of their contracts, to receive such deliveries. In 1920, of 1,392 contracts investigated and found to be 'padded' to the extent of more than 3,500,000 barrels of cement, 978 were partially canceled to the extent of 2,014,653 barrels.\n The Association Freight Rate Book.\n The custom in the cement trade of selling cement at a delivered price, which includes the mill price, the price of bags, and freight charges, was an established trade practice before the organization of the defendant association. As required by the by-laws of the defendant association, it has distributed to its members freight rate books, listing freight rates from established basing points to practically every city and town in the northeast section of the United States. The freight rates contained in the freight rate book are compiled from the official tariffs and translated from the rate per ton of the official tariffs into the rate per barrel of 380 pounds, the unit for the sale of cement. Similar lists of freight rates embracing substantially the same subject-matter were prepared and used by individual manufacturers before the organization of the defendant association. The association freight rate book took the place of previous separate publications by individual manufacturers, with a consequent saving of money and increase of accuracy and a more thorough and continuous checking of rates. The basing points from which freight rates were calculated were not selected by the association, but were the same as those appearing in prior books published by individuals before the publication of the association freight rate book. The basing points are points of actual shipment from which the larger proportion of the cement in a given locality in which cement is manufactured is actually shipped. The rates published are the actual rates omitting fractions of cents between the basing points and actual points of delivery. \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 598]\n\u00a0\n Manufacturers customarily, and for the purpose of the convenient conduct of their business, maintain a uniform base or factory price, so far as the customers of the individual manufacturer are concerned. That is to say, the business is conducted on a 'one-price' basis. In order, however, to datermine the delivered price, there must be added to the factory price of a given manufacturer, the cost of transportation to the point of delivery. Prompt quotations of a delivered price therefore involves the ability to carry out promptly the mechanical process of adding, to the mill price, the cost of transportation to the point of delivery. Lists of freight rates, in convenient and readily available form, are therefore necessary adjuncts to the quotation of delivery prices for cement.\n The use of basing points for the purpose of computing freight rates appears not to have been the result of any collective activity on the part of defendants or cement manufacturers generally, nor were they arbitrarily selected. Their use is rather the natural result of the development of the business within certain defined geographical areas. When a manufacturer establishes his factory at a given point of production and sells his product in a territory which is contiguous freightwise to his factory, other mills established in the vicinity and serving the same territory, in order to compete in that territory, must eigher secure a like freight rate, or they must sell at a mill price which will permit them to deliver cement at a price which will enable them to compete with the mill or mills located at the basing point, which is the principal point of production in the territory which is contiguous in point of freight rate to the basing point. If such competing mills secure the same freight rate through the adoption of a blanket freight rate by the Interstate Commerce Commission, as was done in the Lehigh Valley, the rate from the basing point would in every case be identical with the freight rate for the competing mills. If there were no \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 599]\n\u00a0\n blanket freight rate, the competing mills must still use the rate from a given basing point in order to compete with the mills located in the vicinity of that chief point of production. In either case the freight rate from the basing point is an essential element in making a delivered price, since selling by any particular manufacturer at the lowest of the delivered prices computed from several basing points is a necessary procedure in competing in the sale of cement. The freight rate book, therefore, not only enables the manufacturer to calculate a delivered price on the basis of his own mill price, which he determines, to points in the territory nearest in point of freight rate to his own mill, but it enables him also to determine at once the freight differential which he must offset in his mill price in order to compete with other manufacturers serving any other given territory.\n Exchange of Information Concerning Credits.\n Members of the association render monthly reports of all accounts of customers two months or more over due, giving the name and address of the delinquent debtor; the amount of the overdue account in ledger balance; accounts in hands of attorneys for collection and any explanation, as for example when the account was treated by the debtors as offset of a balance due for bags, or was otherwise disputed. There are also reports showing the general total of delinquent accounts in comparison with those for the last 12 months and reports of payments of accounts placed in the hands of attorneys. There was a form, seldom used, for answering inquiries as to whether a particular name had appeared in the monthly report, and, if so, where. There were never any comments concerning names appearing on the list of delinquent debtors. The government neither charged nor proved that there was any agreement with respect to the use of this information \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 600]\n\u00a0\n or with respect to the persons to whom or conditions under which credit should be extended. The evidence falls far short of establishing any understanding on the basis of which credit was to be extended to customers, or that any co-operation resulted from the distribution of this information, or that there were any consequences from it other than such as would naturally ensue from the exercise of the individual judgment of manufacturers in determining, on the basis of available information, whether to extend credit or to require cash or security from any given customer.\n Statistical Information.\n The statistical activities of the association, other than those relating to specific job contracts which have already been referred to, dealt with information as to existing supplies of cement and the so-called bag report which gave information concerning returned bags which are the usual containers in which cement is shipped and delivered.\n Each member of the association, in addition to the reports on specific job contracts already referred to, sends to the association a monthly statement of its production of clinker and ground cement, shipments, and stock on hand for the past month and for the corresponding periods of the previous year. These were compiled and distributed to members without any change or comment. In addition semimonthly statements of shipments were also received and likewise distributed. Each member of the association was thus given full information as to the available supply of cement and by whom it was held.\n By universal practice, the price of bags in which cement is shipped is included and becomes a part of the mill base price. This is usually at the rate of 10 cents per bag. The bag reports were made quarterly and contained two items; the total number of bags returned to each member \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 601]\n\u00a0\n during the preceding quarter, and the percentage thereof found unfit for use. The reports show that the loss varied from about 3\/4 of 1 per cent. by one manufacturer to about 4 1\/2 per cent. by another and the diversity continued throughout the period covered by the reports.\n In 1918 a questionnaire was sent out inquiring as to the practice of each company to determine whether better results were obtained by cleaning before or after counting, showing that some counted before cleaning and some after cleaning, and some both before and after. No information was reported concerning the charge and allowance or deposit for bags returned, or concerning the number received from any particular customer, or the portion found unfit for use.\n Meetings.\n The constitution and by-laws of the association provided for monthly meetings. A full and accurate stenographic report of all discussions at meetings was kept and made available to the government, and, as is stated in the government's brief:\n'The association's counsel was present at every meeting to steer the discussions away from illegal subjects and to have them confine the matters strictly within the purview of the by-laws and the constitution of the association.'\n\n During the only period of rising markets since the relinquishment of war control, the spring and summer of 1920, no meetings were held during July and August. The later minutes contained complaints at smallness of attendance and the number of companies represented at meetings varied from 11 to 17, with an average attendance of about two-thirds of the total membership of 19 corporations. There was no discussion at these meetings of current prices; no comment on conditions or as to prospect of market, production, or prices. Excerpts from the minutes are set out by the government's brief at great length indicating \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 602]\n\u00a0\n that from time to time individual representatives of the companies expressed themselves on subjects of minor importance; such as return of bags, and bag reports; discounts; the use of trade acceptances where customers desired more than the customary 30 days' discount. But with reference to these suggestions and discussions, either no action was taken, or action was taken adverse to the suggestions made. There is no evidence that any agreement was reached affecting any of the matters discussed; nor does the government point specifically to any uniformity of trade practice or custom followed, which is urged as even inferentially the result of activities at meetings. Legal Consequence of Defendants' Activities.\n From these various activities of the defendants, the government deduces a purpose to control the price of cement which it is charged was to be accomplished by the control of the supply of cement on the market and by intimate association of the defendants in the exchange of information and a ready means of quoting a delivered price at any point. Cement was to be kept from the market by the use of the specific job contract accompanied by the systematic gathering and reporting of information with reference to the specific jobs and the amount of cement required for their completion. The two essential elements in the conspiracy to restrain commerce charged therefore are: (a) The gathering and reporting of information which would enable individual members of the association to avoid making deliveries of cement on specific job contracts which by the terms of the contracts they are not bound to deliver; and (b) the gathering of information as to production, price of cement sold on specific job contracts, and transportation costs not differing essentially from similar information disseminated by the Maple Flooring Association which is the subject of \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 603]\n\u00a0\n the opinion in United States v. Maple Flooring Association, \n268 \nU.S. 563\n, 45 S. Ct. 578, 69 L. Ed. --, decided to-day.\n That a combination existed for the purpose of gathering and distributing these two classes of information is not denied. That a consequence of the gathering and dissemination of information with respect to the specific job contracts was to afford, to manufacturers of cement, opportunity and grounds for refusing deliveries of cement which the contractors were not entitled to call for, an opportunity of which manufacturers were prompt to avail themselves, is also not open to dispute. We do not see, however, in the activity of the defendants with respect to specific job contracts any basis for the contention that they constitute an unlawful restraint of commerce. The government does not rely on any agreement or understanding among members of the association that members would either make use of the specific job contract, or that they would refuse to deliver 'excess' cement under specific job contracts. Members were left free to use this type of contract and to make such deliveries or not as they chose and the evidence already referred to shows that in 1920 padded specific job contracts were cut down something less than two-thirds of the total amount of the padding as a result of the of gathering and reporting this information. It may be assumed, however, if manufacturers take the precaution to draw their sales contracts in such form that they are not to be required to deliver cement not needed for the specific jobs described in these contracts, that they would, to a considerable extent, decline to make deliveries, upon receiving information showing that the deliveries claimed were not called for by the contracts.\n Unless the provisions in the contract are waived by the manufacturer, demand for and receipt of such deliveries by the contractor would be a fraud on the manufacturer, and in our view the gathering and dissemination of information which will enable \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 604]\n\u00a0\n sellers to prevent the perpetration of fraud upon them, which information they are free to act upon or not as they choose, cannot be held to be an unlawful restraint upon commerce, even though in the ordinary course of business most sellers would act on the information and refuse to make deliveries for which they were not legally bound.\n In Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 395\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, 279 (49 L. Ed. 518), this court approved a decree which provided that defendants should not be restrained 'from establishing and maintaining rules for the giving of credit to dealers where such rules in good faith are calculated solely to protect the defendants against dishonest or irresponsible dealers.' Distribution of information as to credit and responsibility of buyers undoubtedly prevents fraud and cuts down to some degree commercial transactions which would otherwise be induced by fraud. But for reasons stated more at length in our opinion in United States v. Maple Flooring Association, supra, we cannot regard the procuring and dissemination of information which tends to prevent the procuring of fraudulent contracts or to prevent the fraudulent securing of deliveries of merchandise on the pretense that the seller is bound to deliver it by his contract, as an unlawful restraint of trade even though such information be gathered and disseminated by those who are engaged in the trade or business principally concerned.\n Nor for the reasons stated, can we regard the gathering and reporting of information, through the co-operation of the defendants in this case, with reference to production, price of cement in actual closed specific job contracts and of transportation costs from chief points of production in the cement trade, as an unlawful restraint of commerce; even though it be assumed that the result of the gathering and reporting of such information tends to bring about uniformity in price.\n Agreements or understanding among competitors for the maintenance of uniform prices are, of course, unlawful \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 605]\n\u00a0\n and may be enjoined, but the government does not rely on any agreement or understanding for price maintenance. It relies rather upon the necessary leveling effect upon prices of knowledge disseminated among sellers as to some of the important factors which enter into price. It is conceded that there is a substantial uniformity of price of cement. Variations of price by one manufacturer are usually promptly followed by like variation throughout the trade. As already indicated, the larger proportion of the product of the defendants is distributed through dealers and prices to dealers are not reported to or through the association. It is contended by the government that the report of prices on specific job contracts in effect informs the members of the association of prices to dealers, since the differential allowed to dealers is well known in the trade. However this may be, the fact is that any change in quotation of price to dealers, promptly becomes well known in the trade through reports of salesmen, agents, and dealers of various manufacturers. It appears to be undisputed that there were frequent changes in price and uniformity has resulted not from maintaining the price at fixed levels, but from the prompt meeting of changes in prices by competing sellers.\n It is urged by the defendants that such uniformity of price as existed in the trade was due to competition. They offered much evidence tending to show complete independence of judgment and of action of defendants by large expenditures in competitive sales efforts and by variations in the volume of their production and shipment, earnings and profits. A great volume of testimony was also given by distinguished economists in support of the thesis that in the case of a standardized product sold wholesale to fully informed professional buyers as were the dealers in cement, uniformity of price will inevitably result from active, free and unrestrained competition, and the government in its brief concedes that--\n'Undoubtedly \n\n[268 U.S. 588, 606]\n\u00a0\n the price of cement would approach uniformity in a normal market in the absence of all combinations between the manufacturers.'\n\n We realize also that uniformity of price may be the result of agreement or understanding, and that an artificial price level not related to the supply and demand of a given commodity may be evidence from which such agreement or understanding or some concerted action of sellers operating to restrain commerce may be inferred. But here the government does not rely upon agreement or understanding, and this record wholly fails to establish, either directly or by inference, any concerted action other than that involved in the gathering and dissemination of pertinent information with respect to the sale and distribution of cement to which we have referred, and it fails to show any effect on price and production except such as would naturally flow from the dissemination of that information in the trade and its natural influence on individual action.\n For reasons stated in United States v. Maple Flooring Association, supra, such activities are not in themselves unlawful restraints upon commerce and are not prohibited by the Sherman Act.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed.\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, Mr. Justice SANFORD, and Mr. Justic McREYNOLDS, dissent. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL UNION TELEPHONE CO. v. CITY OF EDWARDSVILLE(1925)\nNo. 37\nArgued: October 13, 1925Decided: November 23, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. D. Bangs and Nathan G. Moore, both of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Edwardsville in July, 1882, by ordinance granted to the Central Union Telephone Company a right in its streets to erect and maintain the necessary poles and wires for the operation of a telephone system. The Central Telephone Company transferred its rights to the Central Union Telephone Company. Later the city council adopted a resolution requesting the Central Union Telephone Company to furnish to the city, free of charge, one telephone and such additional telephones as the city council might call for at a reduction of 25 per cent. from the regular rates, and the right to attach, without charge, fire and police alarm wires to the top cross-arm of each pole. The company filed its acceptance of this resolution as provided in the resolution. It maintains 1,000 poles in the city of Edwardsville. The city in 1914 passed an ordinance which in effect imposes a tax of 50 cents a pole upon every person, firm, or corporation owning, controlling, or occupying any such poles in the streets of Edwardsville. The city brought \n\n[269 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n suit for the amount due under the tax law at 50 cents a pole. A jury was waived, and after a hearing the court entered judgment for $3,000 against the company. The circuit court held that neither the ordinance by which the Central Telephone Company was permitted to occupy the streets, nor the subsequent resolution accepted by the Central Union Telephone Company, constituted a contract, and that the tax law was not, therefore, a violation of the Constitution of the United States, in impairing a contract, or in depriving the company of property without due process of law. Upon this record an appeal was taken to the Appellate Court of the state for the Fourth Circuit. That court transferred the case to the Supreme Court of Illinois, on the ground that the Appellate Court had no jurisdiction of it. The City of Edwardsville v. Central Union Telephone Co ., 302 Ill. 362, 134 N. E. 716. The Supreme Court held that, as the appeal had been taken to the Appellate Court and errors assigned which that court had jurisdiction to hear, the case was improperly transferred to the Supreme Court, and remanded it to the Appellate Court, which gave judgment, affirming the circuit court. 227 Ill. App. 424. The plaintiff then obtained a certiorari from the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Appellant Court, and in that hearing the Supreme Court declined to hear the constitutional questions, on the ground that they had been waived by the failure to carry the case from the circuit court directly to the Supreme Court to review those questions. 309 Ill. 482, 141 N. E. 206.\n Paragraph 89, section 88 (3 Starr & Curtiss' Annotated Illinois Statutes, p. 3114), reads as follows:\n'Par. 89. Appeal from Trial Court to Appellate Court-From Trial Court to Supreme Court. Sec. 88. Appeals from and writs of error to circuit courts, the superior court of Cook county, the criminal court of Cook county, county courts and city courts in all criminal cases, below the grade of felony, shall be taken directly to the Appellate \n\n[269 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n Court, and in all criminal cases above the grade of misdemeanors, and cases in which a franchise or freehold or the validity of a statute or construction of the Constitution is involved, and in all cases relating to revenue, or in which the state is interested as a party or otherwise, shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court.'\n\n The construction of this statute has been uniformly held to be that, where a question involves the Constitution, it must be taken on error or appeal to the Supreme Court, and that, if it be taken to the Appellate Court on other grounds, the party taking the appeal or suing out the writ of error shall be held to have waived the constitutional questions. Indiana Millers Ins. Co. v. People, 170 Ill. 474, 49 N. E. 364; Robson v. Doyle, 191 Ill. 566, 61 N. E. 435; Case v. Sullivan, 222 Ill. 56, 78 N. E. 37; Poe v. Ulrey, 233 Ill. 56, 84 N. E. 46; Haas Co. v. Amusement Co., 236 Ill. 452, 86 N. E. 248, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 620, 127 Am. St. Rep. 297; Scott v. Artman, 237 Ill. 394, 86 N. E. 295; Comm'rs v. Shockey, 238 Ill. 237, 87 N. E. 335. The city, therefore, moves to dismiss the writ of error.\n It is objected on behalf of the plaintiff in error that the words 'validity of a statute or construction of the Constitution' refer to the Constitution of Illinois and not to the federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of Illinois has held otherwise in this case. City of Edwardsville v. Central Union Tel. Co., 309 Ill. 482, 483, 484, 141 N. E. 206.\n But counsel for plaintiff in error insist that it is for this court to determine finally whether a litigant in a state court has waived his federal right, citing Davis v. O'Hara, \n266 \nU.S. 314\n, 45 S. Ct. 104; Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22\n, 44 S. Ct. 13; American Railway Exp. Co. v. Levee, \n263 \nU.S. 19\n, 44 S. Ct. 11; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375; Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 67\n, 39 S. Ct. 24. But there is nothing in these cases which justifies this court in ignoring or setting aside a required form of practice under the appellate statutes of the state by which federal constitutional rights, as well as state constitutional rights, may be asserted in the Supreme Court of the state or be held to be waived, if the practice gives to the litigant a \n\n[269 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n reasonable opportunity to have the issue as to the claimed right heard and determined by that court. We said in John v. Paullin, \n231 \nU.S. 583, 585\n, 34 S. Ct. 178:\n'Without any doubt it rests with each state to prescribe the jurisdiction of its appellate courts, the mode and time of invoking that jurisdiction, and the rules of practice to be applied in its exercise; and the state law and practice in this regard are no less applicable when federal rights are in controversy than when the case turns entirely upon questions of local or general law,'\n\n -and many cases are there cited.\n It seems to us that the practice under the statute of Illinois above quoted is entirely fair. If the litigant has a constitutional question, federal or state, he may take the case directly to the Supreme Court and have that question decided, together with all the other questions in the case, and then, if the federal constitutional question is decided against him, he may bring it here by writ of error or application for certiorari. If he elects to take his case to the Appellate Court, he may have the nonconstitutional questions considered and decided, but he gives up the right to raise constitutional objections in any court. There is some complaint that counsel could not infer that the constitutional questions referred to in the statute were federal questions, because the Supreme Court of Illinois had not so decided before this case. We have not been able to determine, from the Illinois decisions cited above, whether any of the constitutional questions held to be waived therein were federal until the present case. It is not, however, a forced or strained interpretation to hold that 'cases ... in which the validity of a statute or construction of the Constitution is involved' include validity under, or construction of, both Constitutions. When so declared by the state court, it should bind us, unless so unfair or unreasonable in its application to those asserting a federal right as to obstruct it. This is no such case. \n\n[269 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n The case of Prudential Insurance Co. v. Cheek, \n259 \nU.S. 530\n, 42 S. Ct. 516, 27 A. L. R. 27, is relied upon to sustain the writ in this case. In that case there was a trial by jury, resulting in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant reserved its constitutional points, and appealed from the resulting judgment to the state Supreme Court, which refused to take jurisdiction, on the ground that all constitutional questions had been decided by it on a former appeal, and, because the verdict, being only for $1,500, was less than the jurisdictional amount required by the statute, transferred the cause to the St. Louis Court of Appeals for final disposition. The St. Louis Court of Appeals, in conformity to the former opinion of the Supreme Court on the constitutional questions, affirmed the judgment, and refused the application for certification of the case to the Supreme Court. A writ of error from this court to the St. Louis Court of Appeals followed, and a motion to dismiss the writ was made, on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeals was not that of the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had. The motion was denied, and the case considered on its merits. There is nothing in that case which conflicts with granting the motion to dismiss in this. The plaintiff in error had exhausted every means to test the question in the Supreme Court of Missouri, and had lost, and on the second hearing a writ of error properly lay to the highest court to which the case could be taken, which was the intermediate court. Here the law of the state under the statute, as many times construed, required the appeal on constitutional grounds to be taken directly from the circuit court to the Supreme Court of Illinois. It elected, instead, to go to the Appellate Court, with the consequences well understood, and thereby it waived the question which it now wishes to present here.\n The motion to dismiss the writ of error is granted. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL UNION TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK v. ANDERSON COUNTY(1925)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. S. B. Dabney and H. M. Garwood, both of Houston, Tex., for appellant.\n Mr. Nelson Phillips, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The complaint in this case was filed as ancillary to and dependent on a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage on railroad properties. On the motion of defendants, the District Court held that it had no jurisdiction and dismissed the cause. This is an appeal from that decree. The question of jurisdiction alone is certified. Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215). \n\n[268 U.S. 93, 94]\n\u00a0\n In 1911, the International & Great Northern Railway Company was organized, and acquired under mortgage foreclosure sale all the property of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company. At the time of the purchase, the railway company made a mortgage of all its properties to appellant. The latter brought suit in equity against the railway company to foreclose the mortgage, and, August 10, 1914, the court appointed receivers who took possession of and operated the property. May 17, 1915, the court entered a decree of foreclosure, providing that if the company failed to pay the mortgage debt, $12,908,461.06, with interest, the property should be sold. Pursuant to the decree, all the property, consisting of 1106 miles of railroad, all money, claims and assets in the hands of the receiver, was sold for $5,000,000, subject to the lien of a first mortgage and other existing obligations, as well as such obligations as the court thereafter should fix. By decree of August 10, 1922, the court confirmed the sale and directed the execution of a deed to the International-Great Northern Railroad Company.\n June 5, 1922, before the sale, appellant filed this complaint. The defendants were the railway company, Anderson county, Tex., the county judge, the clerk of the county court, the city of Palestine in that county, its mayor, and certain of its citizens as representatives of all similarly situated. The complaint alleges as follows: The defendants, except the railway company, were asserting that in 1872 and 1875 contracts were made with the predecessors of the railway company which, taken with an act of the Legislature of Texas of 1889, amended in 1899, operated to require the original contracting companies and all successors in title forever to maintain the general offices, shops, and roundhouses at Palestine. In 1912, the defendants had sued the railway company in the state district court and obtained a decree requiring it forever to keep its general offices, shops and roundhouses at Palestine. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[268 U.S. 93, 95]\n\u00a0\n Although at the time of bringing suit, defendants had knowledge of the existence of the mortgage, they failed to make plaintiff a party to the suit. They insist that the decree is res adjudicata and binding against plaintiff and any purchaser under the foreclosure sale, and they threaten, if it is not observed by the purchaser, to enforce the decree with penalties. It is impossible to maintain the general offices, shops and roundhouses at Palestine without great loss and injury to and burden on the railroad property. The claims of defendants, if maintained, will cause a net loss in operating the railroad of not less than $500,000 per year, and thereby diminish the value of the property by not less than $3,000,000, and constitute a cloud and burden on the title and value of the property. The alleged contracts of 1872 and 1875 were never made; and if made, never became binding on the successors of the corporations with whom they were made, and are not binding upon plaintiff or any purchaser under the foreclosure decree. Defendants, without equity or right, are clouding the title and burdening the property to the great injury of plaintiff, its trust, and any purchaser of the property. The suit is brought in aid of the principal cause and the decree of foreclosure and for the benefit of the plaintiff and any purchaser under the decree, and for the purpose of determining whether the claims of Anderson county, Palestine, and its citizens are valid in law or equity. By appropriate provisions in the decree of May 17, 1915, foreclosing the mortgage and authorizing the sale, and in the decree of August 10, 1922, confirming the sale and directing conveyance to the purchaser, the court retained jurisdiction to determine any \n\n[268 U.S. 93, 96]\n\u00a0\n questions affecting the title to the property or that are germane to the purpose or substance of this suit. Plaintiff prays that the court forever enjoin defendants from asserting, or in any court attempting to enforce, their claims that such offices, shops and roundhouses shall be kept at Palestine, and that it decree the railroad property to be free from the burden and cloud of such claims.\n If the complaint discloses a controversy that is ancillary to and dependent on the foreclosure suit, the district court had jurisdiction. The rule permitting third persons to come into suits in federal courts to enforce their claims in respect of property there impounded is stated in Hoffman v. McClelland, \n264 \nU.S. 552, 558\n, 44 S. Ct. 407, 409:\n'It is settled that where in the progress of a suit in a federal court property has been drawn into the court's custody and control, third persons claiming interests in or liens upon the property may be permitted to come into that court for the purpose of setting up, protecting and enforcing their claims-although the court could not consider or adjudicate their claims if it had not impounded the property. Power to deal with such claims in incident to the jurisdiction acquired in the suit wherein the impounding occurs, and may be invoked by a petition to intervene pro interesse suo or by a dependent bill. But in either case the proceeding is purely ancillary.'\n\n Ancillary suits are not limited to those initiated by persons who desire to come in and have their rights determined. Such a suit may be maintained by the plaintiff in the principal suit against strangers to the record to determine a controversy having relation to the property in the custody of the court and which, in justice to the parties before the court, ought to be determined in the principal suit. See Compton v. Jesup, 68 F. 263, 284, 15 C. C. A. 397; Street, Fed. Eq. Pr.  1248\n\n\n The provision of the decree of May 17, 1915, retaining jurisdiction, extended to all questions not determined and reserved the right to resell the property in case the purchaser \n\n[268 U.S. 93, 97]\n\u00a0\n should fail to make any payment on account of purchase price within a specified time after the order requiring it. The decree of August 10, 1922, confirming the sale, retained jurisdiction over the property with reference to all claims against the railway company and to enforce payment of any judgment therefor out of the property sold. It reserved all questions relating 'to suits now pending in this court in this cause, or affecting the property above dealt with ... for further hearing and determination. ...' In view of the reservations in these decrees, the sale and delivery of the railroad properties to the purchaser did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the property or terminate plaintiff's right to carry on this suit. Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 54\n, 28 S. Ct. 182; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 111\n, 24 S. Ct. 399; Smith v. Missouri Pacific R. Co. (C. C. A.) 266 F. 653.\n Taking the allegations of the complaint to be true, the maintenance of the general offices, shops, and roundhouse at Palestine burdens and restricts operation, requires great and unnecessary expenditures, and correspondingly diminishes the value of the railroad. If, as asserted in the complaint, the claims and insistence of the defendants are groundless, plaintiff had a right to have the property sold free from such burdens and restrictions. The controversy has direct relation to the operation, use and value of the railroad property, and must be held to be ancillary to and dependent on the foreclosure suit. The District Court had jurisdiction and should have heard and determined the merits.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act above referred to is now articles 6423-6425, Revised Statutes of Texas.

Taft, of New York City, and A. Warner Parker, of Washington, D. C., amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, Chang Chan and three others, claiming to be native-born citizens of the United States permanently domiciled therein, sought release from detention by the Immigration Commissioner of four young Chinese women, alleged to be their lawful wives wedded in China prior to July 1, 1924. On that day the young women were on the high seas as passengers upon the President Lincoln. Arriving at San Francisco July 11, without immigration vises as provided for by section 9, Immigration Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, they sought and were \n\n[268 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n finally denied permanent admission. In support of this action the Secretary of Labor said:\n'Neither the citizenship of the alleged husband, nor the relationship of the applicant to him, has been investigated for the reason that even if it were conceded that both elements exist she would still be inadmissible, as section 13 of the Act of 1924 mandatorily excludes the wives of United States citizens of the Chinese race if such wives are of a race or persons ineligible to citizenship, and the Department has no alternative than to recommend exclusion.'\n\n The court below inquires, Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216):\n'Should the petitioners be refused admission to the United States either, (a) because of the want of a vise; or (b) because of want of right of admission if found to be Chinese wives of American citizens?'\n\n This cause involves no claim of right granted or guaranteed by treaty and is therefore radically different from Cheung Sum Shee et al. v. John D. Nagle, etc., \n268 \nU.S. 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 539, this day becided.\n The excluded wives are alien Chinese ineligible to citizenship here. Rev. Stat.  2169 (Comp. St.  4358); Act May 6, 1882, c. 126,  14, 22 Stat. 58, 61 (Comp. St.  4359). Notwithstanding their marriage to citizens of the United States, they did not become citizens and remained incapable of naturalization.\n Prior to September 22, 1922, Rev. Stat.  1994 (Comp. St.  3948) applied. It provided:\n'Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the United States, and who might herself be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a citizen.'\n\n Since that date chapter 411, 42 Stat. 1021, 1022,  2 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4358b), has been in force. It provides:\n'That any woman who marries a citizen of the United States after the passage of this act, or any woman whose husband is naturalized after the passage of this act, shall not become a citizen of the United States \n\n[268 U.S. 346, 352]\n\u00a0\n by reason of such marriage or naturalization; but, if eligible to citizenship, she may be naturalized upon full and complete compliance with all requirements of the naturalization laws. ...'\n\n Section 13(c), Immigration Act of 1924, declares:\n'No alien ineligible to citizenship shall be admitted to the United States unless such alien (1) is admissible as a nonquota immigrant under the provisions of subdivision (b), (d), or (e) of section 4, or ( 2) is the wife, or the unmarried child under eighteen years of age, of an immigrant admissible under such subdivision (d), and is accompanying or following to join him, or (3) is not an immigrant as defined in section 3.'\n\n Subdivisions (b), (d), and (e) of section 4 apply to immigrants previously lawfully admitted, immigrants who seek to enter as religious ministers or professors, and to students. They are not controlling here. An 'immigrant' is defined in section 3 as 'any alien departing from any place outside the United States destined for the United States,' with certain exceptions, none of which describes the present applicants.\n Taken in their ordinary sense the words of the statute plainly exclude petitioners' wives.\n We cannot accept the theory that as consular officers are required to issue vises to Chinese wives of American citizens therefore they must be admitted. A sufficient answer to this is found in  2(g)--\n'Nothing in this act shall be construed to entitle an immigrant, to whom an immigration visa has been issued, to enter the United States, if, upon arrival in the United States, he is found to be inadmissible to the United States under the immigration laws.'\n\n Nor can we approve the suggestion that the provisions contained in subdivision (a)1 of section 4 were omitted from \n\n[268 U.S. 346, 353]\n\u00a0\n the exceptions in section 13(c) because of some obvious oversight and should now be treated as if incorporated therein. Although descriptive of certain 'nonquota immigrants,' that subdivision is subject to the positive inhibition against all aliens ineligible to citizenship who do not fall within definitely specified and narrowly restricted classes.\n In response to the demand for an interpretation of the act which will avoid hardships and further a supposed rational and consistent policy, it suffices to refer to what we have said in Yee Won v. White, \n256 \nU.S. 399, 401\n, 402 S., 41 S. Ct. 504; Chung Fook v. White, \n264 \nU.S. 443, 445\n, 446 S., 44 S. Ct. 361; Commissioner, etc., v. Gottlieb, \n265 \nU.S. 310, 314\n, 44 S. Ct. 528\n\n\n The applicants should be refused admission if found to be Chinese wives of American citizens. It is unnecessary now to consider the requirement of the act in respect of vises. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'An immigrant who is the unmarried child under 18 years of age, or the wife, of a citizen of the United States who resides therein at the time of the filing of a petition under section 9.' \n\n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAS.

Long, of Wichita, Kan., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an original proceeding in mandamus in the Supreme Court of Kansas to compel the Wolff Packing Company to put into effect an order of a state agency, called the Court of Industrial Relations, determining a dispute respecting wages, hours labor and working conditions in a slaughtering and packing plant owned and operated by the company. The order was made in a compulsory proceeding under a Kansas statute, called the Industrial Relations Act, Laws Special Session 1920, c. 29, and consisted of 19 distinct paragraphs-some fixing wages, some fixing hours of labor and pay for overtime, and others prescribing working conditions. After a hearing, \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court eliminated the paragraphs relating to working conditions, because made without the required notice, and awarded a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding obedience to the other paragraphs. Court of Industrial Relations v. Charles Wolff Packing Co., 109 Kan. 629, 201 P. 418; Id., 111 Kan. 501, 207 P. 806.

Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. After receiving the mandate, the state court vacated its original judgment, eliminated the paragraphs relating to working conditions and those fixing wages, also eliminated from the paragraphs fixing hours of labor the clauses relating to pay for overtime, and awarded a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding obedience to what remained of the last paragraphs. Court of Industrial Relations v. Charles Wolff Packing Co., 114 Kan. 304, 219 P. 259. On a rehearing, the court modified that judgment by awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel obedience to the paragraphs fixing hours of labor, including the clauses relating to pay for overtime. 114 Kan. 487, 227 P. 249. The paragraphs to which obedience was thus finally commanded are as follows:\n'(3) A basic working day of 8 hours shall be observed in this industry; but a 9-hour day may be observed not to exceed 2 days in any 1 week without penalty: Provided, however, that if the working hours of the week shall exceed 48 in number, all over 48 shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half; furthermore, in case a day in excess of the 8-hour day shall be observed more than 2 days in any 1 week, all over 8 hours, except for said 2 days in said week, shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half, even though the working hours of the week may be 48 hours or fewer.'\n\n'(14) Workers paid by the week or day, if employed within the plant and not within the office or sales department, shall be subject to hours of work and overtime \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 561]\n\u00a0\n as other employees under the terms of finding No. 3 hereof.'\n\n'(19) In departments operating 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, each employee therein shall be entitled to 1 day off each week. In other departments work performed on Sunday and legal holidays shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half.'\n\n The order, according to its terms, was to remain in force until changed by the Court of Industrial Relations or by agreement of the parties with the approval of that agency.\n The company has brought the case here again-this time on two writs of error. One covers the judgment first entered after receipt of the mandate of this court, and the other covers the judgment entered on the rehearing. The first of these writs can serve no purpose and must be dismissed. The rehearing was seasonably requested and the judgment entered thereon became the final judgment, the other being superseded by it.\n Throughout the mandamus proceedings the company insisted that the Industrial Relations Act, on which the order was based, was in conflict with the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that no state shall deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law. This insistence was wholly rejected when the original judgment, heretofore reversed, was rendered, and was largely rejected when the judgment on the rehearing was given.\n When the case was first before this court the discussion at the bar and in the briefs chiefly related to the validity of the parts of the act permitting the fixing of wages, and the opinion then delivered particularly dealt with that question, the ultimate conclusion, as expressed therein, being:\n'We think the Industrial Court Act, in so far as it permits the fixing of wages in plaintiff in error's packing \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 562]\n\u00a0\n house, is in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives it of its property and liberty of contract without due process of law.'\n\n That conclusion, without more, required a reversal of the judgment of the state court. The parts of the act permitting the fixing of hours of labor were not specially dealt with, and were not affected by the decision, save as the reasons on which it proceeded might be applicable to them. The reversal was with a direction that the case be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this court's decision, and therefore the mandate operated particularly to require that the parts of the act permitting the fixing of wages be regarded as invalid.\n In the proceedings which followed the receipt of the mandate, the state court held that the other parts of the act were separable from those permitting the fixing of wages, and also pronounced them constitutional. As the question of separability was a state question, the decision of that court thereon is conclusive here. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S. Ct. 323; Hallanan v. Eureka Pipe Line Co., \n261 \nU.S. 393, 397\n, 43 S. Ct. 414. The decision on the constitutional question is all that we can review.\n Both parties rely on our decision when the case was first here. One insists that by reversing the original judgment of the state court, and not merely a part of it, we adjudged the invalidity of the entire act, and the other that by particularly declaring the provisions permitting the fixing of wages invalid and saying nothing about the provisions permitting the fixing of hours of labor we impliedly held the latter valid. Both contentions are wrong.\n'A judgment of reversal is not necessarily an adjudication by the appellate court of any other than the questions in terms discussed and decided.' Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hill, \n193 \nU.S. 551, 553\n, 24 S. Ct. 538, 539 (48 L. Ed. 788).\n\n The company next contends that the decision, even though not in terms determining the question of the validity \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 563]\n\u00a0\n of the provisions permitting the fixing of hours of labor, recognized and gave effect to principles which are applicable to that question and if applied will solve it. A survey of the act and of the decision will show that this contention is well taken.\n The declared and adjudged purpose of the act is to insure continuity of operation and production in certain businesses which it calls 'essential industries.' To that end it provides for the compulsory settlement by a state agency of all labor controversies in such businesses which endanger the intended continuity. It proceeds on the assumption that the public has a paramount interest in the subject which justifies the compulsion. The businesses named include, among others, that of manufacturing or preparing food products for sale and human consumption. The controversies to be settled include, among others, those arising between employer and employees over either wages or hours of labor. The state agency charged with the duty of making the settlement is the Court of Industrial Relations. Although called a court, it is an administrative board. It is to summon the disputants before it, to give them a hearing, to settle the matter in controversy-as by fixing wages or hours of labor, where they are what is in dispute-to embody its findings and determination in an order, and, if need be, to institute mandamus proceedings in the Supreme Court of the state to compel compliance with its order. The order is to continue in effect for such reasonable time as the agency may fix, or until changed by agreement of the parties with its approval. The employer may discontinue the business (a) where it can be conducted conformably to the order only at a loss; or (b) where for good cause shown the agency approves; and individual employees may quit the service in the exercise of a personal privilege, but may not induce others to quit or combine with them to do so. With these qualifications, both employer \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 564]\n\u00a0\n and employees are required to continue the business on the terms fixed in the order; violations and evasions being penalized. The authority given to the agency to fix wages or hours of labor is not general, nor is it to be exerted independently of the system of compulsory settlement. On the contrary, it is but a feature of that system, and correspondingly limited in purpose and field of application. No distinction is made between wages and hours of labor; both are put on the same plane. In the fixing of wages regard is to be had for what is fair between employer and employees, and in the fixing of hours of labor regard is to be had for what are healthful periods; but neither is to be fixed save in the compulsory adjustment of an endangering controversy to the end that the business shall go on.\n The following excerpt from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state in State ex rel. v. Howat, 109 Kan. 376, 417, 198 P. 686, 705 (25 A. L. R. 1210) explains the pervading theory of the act:\n'Heretofore the industrial relationship has been tacitly regarded as existing between two members-industrial manager, and industrial worker. They have joined whole-heartedly in excluding others. The Legislature proceeded on the theory there is a third member of those industrial relationships which have to do with production, preparation and distribution of the necessaries of life-the public. The Legislature also proceeded on the theory the public is not a silent partner. Whenever the dissensions of the other two become flagrant, the third member may see to it the business does not stop.'\n\n On three occasions when the act was before us we referred to it as undertaking to establish a system of 'compulsory arbitration.' Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181, 184\n, 42 S. Ct. 277; Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 542\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 323. The Supreme Court of the state in a recent opinion criticizes this use of the term 'arbitration.' \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 565]\n\u00a0\n State v. Howat, 116 Kan. 412, 415, 227 P. 752. We recognize that in its usual acceptation the term indicates a proceeding based entirely on the consent of the parties. And we recognize also that this act dispenses with their consent. Under it they have no voice in selecting the determining agency, or in defining what that agency is to investigate and determine. And yet the determination is to bind them, even to the point of preventing them from agreeing on any change in the terms fixed therein, unless the agency approves. To speak of a proceeding with such attributes merely as an arbitration might be subject to criticism, but we think its nature is fairly reflected when it is spoken of as a compulsory arbitration. Of course, our present concern is with the essence of the system rather than its name. In this connection it is well to observe that in the opinion last mentioned the state court recognizes that the system, while intended to be just between employer and employees, proceeds on the theory that the public interest is paramount, as was explained in State ex rel. v. Howat, supra.\n The survey just made of the act, as construed and applied in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the state, shows very plainly that its purpose is not to regulate wages or hours of labor either generally or in particular classes of business, but to authorize the state agency to fix them where, and in so far as, they are the subjects of a controversy the settlement of which is directed in the interest of the public. In short, the authority to fix them is intended to be merely a part of the system of compulsory arbitration and to be exerted in attaining its object, which is continuity of operation and production.\n When the case was first here the question chiefly agitated, and therefore discussed and decided, was whether the authority to fix wages as an incident of the compulsory arbitration could be applied to a business like that of the Wolff Company consistently with the protection \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 566]\n\u00a0\n which the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment affords to the liberty of contract and rights of property. The question was answered in the negative and the act was held invalid in so far as it gives that authority. The subject was much considered and the principles which were recognized and applied were distinctly stated.\n At the outset the court pointed out that the act assumes as a 'necessary postulate' that the state, in the interest of the public, 'may compel those engaged in the manufacture of food, and clothing, and the production of fuel, whether owners or workers, to continue in their business and employment on terms fixed by an agency of the state if they cannot agree.' Then, after referring to the limited privilege of withdrawing from the business or employment which the act accords to owners and employees who may be dissatisfied with the determination, the court said:\n'These qualifications do not change the essence of the act. It curtails the right of the employer on the one hand, and of the employee on the other, to contract about his affairs. This is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the guaranty of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Meyer v. Nebraska, ante, 390. While there is no such thing as absolute freedom of contract and it is subject to a variety of restraints, they must not be arbitrary or unreasonable. Freedom is the general rule, and restraint the exception. The legislative authority to abridge can be justified only by exceptional circumstances. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 U.S. 525\n.'\n\n Various matters which were relied on as justifying the attempted restraint or abridgment were considered and pronounced inadequate. Among them was the assumption in the act that a business like that in question- preparing food for sale and human consumption-is so far \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 567]\n\u00a0\n affected with a public interest that the state may compel its continuance, and, if the owner and employees cannot agree, may fix the terms through a public agency to the end that there shall be continuity of operation and production. This assumption was held to be without any sound basis and its indulgence by the state Legislature was declared not controlling. The court recognized that, in a sense, all business is of some concern to the public, and subject to some measure of regulation, but made it plain that the extent to which regulation reasonably may go varies greatly with different classes of business and is not a matter of legislative discretion solely, but is a judicial question to be determined with due regard to the rights of the owner and employees. Care was taken to point out that operating a railroad, keeping an inn, conducting an elevator, and following a common calling are not all in the same class, and particularly to point out the distinctions between a quasi public business conducted under a public grant imposing a correlative duty to operate, a business originally private which comes to be affected with a public interest through a change in pais, and a business which not only was private in the beginning but has remained such. The conclusion was that power to compel the continuance of a business because affected with a public interest is altogether exceptional. On this subject the court said:\n'An ordinary producer, manufacturer or shopkeeper may sell or not sell as he likes (United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 U.S. 290\n, 320; Terminal Taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 U.S. 252\n, 256), and while this feature does not necessarily exclude businesses from the class clothed with a public interest (German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n), it usually distinguishes private from quasi-public occupations. ...\n\n'It involves a more drastic exercise of control to impose limitations of continuity growing out of the public \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 568]\n\u00a0\n character of the business upon the employee than the employer; and without saying that such limitations upon both may not be sometimes justified, it must be where the obligation to the public of continuous service is direct, clear and mandatory and arises as a contractual condition express or implied of entering the business either as owner or worker. It can only arise when investment by the owner and entering the employment by the worker create a conventional relation to the public somewhat equivalent to the appointment of officers and the enlistment of soldiers and sailors in military service. ...\n\n'The penalties of the act are directed against effort of either side to interfere with the settlement by arbitration. Without this joint compulsion, the whole theory and purpose of the act would fail. The state cannot be heard to say, therefore, that upon complaint of the employer, the effect upon the employee should not be a factor in our judgment. ...\n\n'The power of a Legislature to compel continuity in a business can only arise where the obligation of continued service by the owner and its employee is direct and is assumed when the business is entered upon. A common carrier which accepts a railroad franchise is not free to withdraw the use of that which it has granted to the public. It is true that if operation is impossible without continuous loss (Brooks- Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 U.S. 396\n; Bullock v. Railroad Commission, \n254 U.S. 513\n), it may give up its franchise and enterprise, but short of this, it must continue. Not so the owner [in another field] when by mere changed conditions his business becomes clothed with a public interest. He may stop at will whether the business be losing or profitable.'\n\n Applying these principles, the court was of opinion that the business in question is one which the state is without power to compel the owner and employees to continue. \n\n[267 U.S. 552, 569]\n\u00a0\n On further reflection we regard the principles so stated and applied as entirely sound. They are as applicable now as they were then. The business is the same and the parties are the same. So we reach the same conclusion now that we reached then.\n The system of compulsory arbitration which the act establishes is intended to compel, and if sustained will compel, the owner and employees to continue the business on terms which are not of their making. It will constrain them, not merely to respect the terms if they continue the business, but will constrain them to continue the business on those terms. True, the terms have some qualifications, but as shown in the prior decision the qualifications are rather illusory and do not subtract much from the duty imposed. Such a system infringes the liberty of contract and rights of property guaranteed by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n'The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect.' Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 627 (67 L. Ed. 1042, 29 A. L. R. 1446).\n\n The authority which the act gives respecting the fixing of hours of labor is merely a feature of the system of compulsory arbitration and has no separate purpose. It was exerted by the state agency as a part of that system and the state court sustained its exertion as such. As a part of the system it shares the invalidity of the whole. Whether it would be valid had it been conferred independently of the system and made either general or applicable to all businesses of a particular class we need not consider, for that was not done.\n It follows that the state court should have declined to give effect to any part of the order of the state agency. \n No. 207.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n No. 299. Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHEUNG SUM SHEE v. NAGLE(1925)\nNo. 769\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 336, 337]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A.

C., amici curiae.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry W. Taft, of New York City, A. Warner Parker, of Washington, D. C., John J. Sullivan, of New York City, and\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners are alien wives and minor children of resident Chinese merchants lawfully domiciled within the United States. They departed from China on the steamship President Lincoln, and upon arrival at San Francisco, July 11, 1924, sought permanent admission to the United States. The Secretary of Labor denied their applications and gave the following reasons therefor:\n'Neither the mercantile status of the husband and father, nor the applicant's relationship to him, has been \n\n[268 U.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n investigated for the reason that even if it were conceded that both these elements exist the applicants would be inadmissible as a matter of law. This is made necessary because of the inhibition against their coming to the United States as found in paragraph (c) of section 13 and that portion of section 5 which reads as follows: 'An alien who is not particularly specified in this act as a nonquota immigrant or a nonimmigrant shall not be admitted as a nonquota immigrant or a nonimmigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.\"\n\n The court below has inquired, Judicial Code,  239 (Comp. St.  1216):\n'Are the alien Chinese wives and minor children of Chinese merchants who were lawfully domiciled within the United States prior to July 1, 1924, such wives and minor children now applying for admission, mandatorily excluded from the United States under the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924?'\n\n Prior to July 1, 1924, petitioners, if otherwise unobjectionable, might have been admitted notwithstanding their race and nationality. United States v. Mrs. Gue Lim, \n176 \nU.S. 459, 466\n, 468 S., 20 S. Ct. 415; Yee Won v. White, \n256 \nU.S. 399, 400\n, 401 S., 41 S. Ct. 504. But it is said they are absolutely excluded by the 'act to limit the immigration of aliens into the United States, and for other purposes,' approved May 26, 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, applicable provisions of which follow:\n'Sec. 13. ... (c) No alien ineligible to citizenship shall be admitted to the United States unless such alien (1) is admissible as a nonquota immigrant under the provisions of subdivision (b), (d), or ( e) of section 4, or (2) is the wife, or the unmarried child under 18 years of age, of an immigrant admissible under such subdivision (d), and is accompanying or following to join him, or (3) is not an immigrant as defined in section 3.'\n\n'Sec. 3. When used in this act the term 'immigrant' means any alien departing from any place outside the \n\n[268 U.S. 336, 345]\n\u00a0\n United States destined for the United States, except ... (6) an alien entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of the provisions of a present existing treaty of commerce and navigation.'\n\n'Sec. 5. When used in this act the term 'quota immigrant' means any immigrant who is not a nonquota immigrant. An alien who is not particularly specified in this act as a nonquota immigrant or a nonimmigrant shall not be admitted as a nonquota immigrant or a nonimmigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.'\n\n The present existing treaty of commerce and navigation with China, dated November 17, 1880, 22 Stat. 826, 827, provides:\n'Article II. Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as teachers, students, merchants or from curiosity, together with their body and household servants, and Chinese laborers who are now in the United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.'\n\n An alien entitled to enter the United States 'solely to carry on trade' under an existing treaty of commerce and navigation is not an immigrant within the meaning of the Act,  3(6), and therefore is not absolutely excluded by section 13.\n The wives and minor children of resident Chinese merchants were guaranteed the right of entry by the treaty of 1880 and certainly possessed it prior to July 1st when the present Immigration Act became effective. United States v. Mrs. Gue Lim, supra. That act must be construed with the view to preserve treaty rights unless clearly \n\n[268 U.S. 336, 346]\n\u00a0\n annulled, and we cannot conclude that, considering its history, the general terms therein disclose a congressional intent absolutely to exclude the petitioners from entry.\n In a certain sense it is true that petitioners did not come 'solely to carry on trade.' But Mrs. Gue Lim did not come as a 'merchant.' She was nevertheless allowed to enter, upon the theory that a treaty provision admitting merchants by necessary implication extended to their wives and minor children. This rule was not unknown to Congress when considering the act now before us.\n Nor do we think the language of section 5 is sufficient to defeat the rights which petitioners had under the treaty. In a very definite sense they are specified by the act itself as 'nonimmigrants.' They are aliens entitled to enter in pursuance of a treaty as interpreted and applied by this court 25 years ago.\n The question propounded by the court below must be answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO GREAT WESTERN R. CO. v. SCHENDEL(1925)\nNo. 422\nArgued: January 6, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. A. G. Briggs, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.[ Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Schendel \n267 U.S. 287\n (1925) ]\n\n\n[267 U.S. 287, 289]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Tom Davis, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota affirmed a judgment in favor of respondent for damages resulting from the death of his intestate, Ring, fatally injured while in petitioner's service and while both were engaging in interstate commerce. The original action was based upon the federal Employers' Liability Act, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, 66, c. 149 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), and the Safety Appliance Act of 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, as amended in 1910, by 36 Stat. 298, 299, c. 160, (Comp. St.  8605-8623).\n While the freight train upon which Ring served as brakeman was upon the main line at Budd, Iowa, a drawbar pulled out of a car. Thereupon the crew chained this car to the one immediately ahead. The engine pulled the whole train onto the adjacent siding, which lies on a gentle grade, and stopped. The intention was to detach the damaged car and leave it there. The plan was to cut off the engine, bring it around back of the train, remove the rear portion, couple this to the forward portion, and move on. Acting under the conductor's direction, Ring asked the head brakeman to tell the engineer to proceed, and then, without the knowledge of either of the others, he and the conductor went between the crippled car and the next one in order to disengage the connecting chain. While they were working there the engineer cut off the engine, the car ran slowly down the grade, and Ring, caught by the chain, suffered fatal injuries.\n A rule of the company provided that employees should advise the engineer when they were going between or under cars and must know that he understood their purpose before they put themselves in any dangerous position. Ring gave no such warning, although familiar with the rule and with the grade upon which the train stood. \n\n[267 U.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner insists: (1) The facts do not bring the case within the Safety Appliance Act since the car had come to rest on the side track and had ceased to be 'used,' within the meaning of the statute. (2) The defective drawbar did not proximately contribute to the injury. (3) The violation of the rule by Ring constituted negligence subsequent to and independent of the question of a defective safety appliance and was a proximate cause of the injury.\n It is provided by the original Safety Appliance Act:\n'Sec. 2. That on and after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' Comp. St.  8606\n\n\n\n The amendment of 1910 directs:\n'Sec. 4. That any common carrier subject to this act using, hauling, or permitting to be used or hauled on its line, any car subject to the requirements of this act not equipped as provided in this act, shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars for each and every such violation: ... Provided, that where any car shall have been properly equipped, as provided in this act and the other acts mentioned herein, and such equipment shall have become defective or insecure while such car was being used by such carrier upon its line of railroad, such car may be hauled from the place where such equipment was first discovered to be defective or insecure to the nearest available point where such car can be repaired, without liability for the penalties imposed by section four of this act or section six of the act of March second, eighteen hundred and ninety- three as amended by the act of April first, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, if such movement is necessary to make such repairs and \n\n[267 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n such repairs cannot be made except at such repair point; and such movement or hauling of such car shall be at the sole risk of the carrier, and nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve such carrier from liability in any remedial action for the death or injury of any railroad employee caused to such employee by reason of or in connection with the movement or hauling of such car with equipment which is defective or insecure or which is not maintained in accordance with the requirements of this act and the other acts herein referred to. ...' Comp. St.  8621.\n\n The Employers' Liability Act provides (section 4) that, in an action under it for injury or death of an employee, 'such employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment [or to have been guilty of contributory negligence] in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' Comp. St.  8660.\n Former opinions have adequately explained the purpose of these enactments. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 293\n, 28 S.

Ct. 456-must be understood as in entire harmony with the doctrine announced in St. Louis & San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Conarty, and not as intended to modify or overrule anything which we there said.\n Under the circumstances disclosed, we think it clear that the use, movement or hauling of the defective car, within the meaning of the statute, had not ended at the time of the accident. To cut this car out of the train so \n\n[267 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n that the latter might proceed to destination was the thing in view, an essential part of the undertaking in connection with which the injuries arose.\n The things shown to have been done by the deceased certainly amount to no more than contributory negligence or assumption of the risk, and both of these are removed from consideration by the Liability Act.

C., and The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant brought this action, October 29, 1917, to recover the amounts by which freight charges on certain materials transported over its railroad were reduced by the application of government land grant rates. All the freight was transported on government bills of lading, and moved in whole or in part by the use of appellant's land-aided lines of railroad. road. The shipments, including coal, sand, cement, piling, and lumber, were made in the years 1909 to 1916, inclusive. Some of appellant's lines of railroad were constructed by the aid of land granted by an Act of Congress of May 12, 1864,  3, c. 84, 13 Stat. 73. See Lake Superior & Mississippi R. R. Co. v. United States, \n93 U.S. 442\n; Act of August 5, 1882, c. 390, 22 Stat. 261. The appellant deemed the United States to be entitled to have its property transported over such \n\n[267 U.S. 403, 404]\n\u00a0\n lines at 50 per cent. of the tariff rates. Two of appellant's lines of railroad in Minnesota were constructed by the aid of land granted by an Act of Congress of July 4, 1866,  3, c. 168, 14 Stat. 88. Appellant made no charges for the shipments that moved over these lines. Appellant alleged that when it received and transported such freight it believed it belonged to the United States, and had no intimation that the shipments were private property until the latter part of 1916. The Court of Claims held that all the shipments belonged to the United States, and that it was entitled to transportation of its property at 50 per cent. of the tariff rates on the aided lines first above referred to, and to free transportation on those last mentioned, and found that it was not shown whether appellant was informed as to the title to the property.\n The court further found that in every instance appellant made out and presented freight bills to the government for the net charges after making proper land grant deductions, and that the payment of the full amount so claimed was made and accepted without protest. Appellant is not entitled to recover. Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States (decided this day) \n267 \nU.S. 395\n, 45 S. Ct. 233, 69 L.

OF NEW JERSEY(1925)\nNo. 351\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 377, 378]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George W. Wickersham and Paxton Blair, both of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. R. V. Lindabury, of Newark, N. J., for appellee Central R. Co. of New Jersey.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 377, 379]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Julius Henry Cohen, of New York City, for appellee Port of New York Authority.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the city of Newark to enjoin the construction of a bridge across Newark Bay. Jersey City and the state of New Jersey by leave of court intervened as parties complainant.\n Under the authority of chapter 64, Laws of New Jersey 1860, the defendant company constructed and has since maintained and used a double- track wooden railroad bridge, with bascule draws, across Newark Bay. It is below Newark, between Elizabeth and Bayonne, and crosses the channel at an angle of about 66 degrees. Newark Bay is a navigable estuary, and its waters at this place are wholly within the state of New Jersey. The company proposes and has commenced to construct upon substantially the same location a substitute bridge of masonry and steel with four tracks and vertical draws. It claims that the Acts of Congress of August 8, 1919, c. 42, 41 Stat. 277, and February 15, 1921, c. 47, 41 Stat. 1099, and the Bridge Act of March 23, 1906, c. 1130, 34 Stat. 84 (Comp. St.  9961-9968 ), with the approval of its plans by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of War, confer authority to construct the bridge in question without the consent of the state. But the company also insists that, if the authority of the state is necessary, it was granted by the act of 1860\n\n\n Appellants maintain that the source of power to construct a bridge over navigable waters wholly within one state is in the state itself; that the concurrent consent of both state and federal governments is necessary before such a bridge lawfully may be erected; that the authority granted by the act of 1860 does not extend to the new bridge; and that under laws of New Jersey (chapter 123, Laws of 1914, and chapter 242, Laws of 1915) the approval of the \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 380]\n\u00a0\n substitute bridge by the state board of commerce and navigation is necessary.\n The complaint alleges that the city of Newark owns real estate above the bridge of the westerly shore of the bay, and has expended large sums for improvements thereon, consisting of warehouses, slips, docks, and other facilities of commerce, known collectively as 'Port Newark terminal'; that neither the present nor the proposed bridge is necessary to the operation of the railroad; that, because of the threatened construction of the proposed bridge, complainant has been unable to secure tenants for the terminal property; and that, if any bridge shall be constructed between Elizabeth and Bayonne, the free and unobstructed access of vessels to the Newark terminal will be prevented and the value of the terminal destroyed. The complaint shows that the defendant the Port of New York Authority is a body corporate and politic, established by a compact between New Jersey and New York for the creation of the port of New York district, and for the comprehensive development of that port. Congress gave its consent to the agreement. Chapter 151, Laws of New Jersey 1921; chapter 154, Laws of New York 1921; chapter 77, 42 Stat. 174. The district extends as far north as Irvington on the Hudson, N. Y., as far east as Long Beach, Long Island, as far south as Atlantic Highlands, and as far west as Summit, N. J., and so includes Newark Bay and the site of the bridge. See opinion of District Court in this case. 287 F. 196, 201. Pursuant to the compact, a comprehensive plan for the development of the port of New York was approved by both states and consented to by Congress. Chapter 9, Laws of New Jersey 1922; chapter 43, Laws of New York 1922; chapter 43, Stat. 822. Appellants insist that Congress, by creating and adopting as its instrumentality the Port Authority, qualified the license granted by the United States to the company by imposing as an additional requirement the approval of that body. \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 381]\n\u00a0\n The petition of intervention of Jersey City adopts the allegations of the complaint and shows that within its territorial limits it has much shore land on Newark Bay and the Hackensack river, which is a continuation of the bay, and that it owns lands on these waterfronts, on which it has expended large sums for the construction of wharves and other improvements. The petition states that the construction of the proposed bridge will cause that city irreparable injury. The petition of intervention of the state of New Jersey calls attention to the provisions of the acts of 1914 and 1915, and alleges that the company has not obtained the approval of its plans for the proposed bridge by the board of commerce and navigation.\n The complainant and intervenors pray judgment that the defendant company is without right or power to build the proposed bridge; that it would be an unlawful purpresture and public nuisance; and that its construction without the permission of the New Jersey board of commerce and navigation and the Port Authority is unlawful, and for an injunction.\n The defendant Port Authority answered. The defendant company moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action. The motion was granted by the District Court (287 F. 196), and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (297 F. 77). Complainant and interveners appealed to this court. Judicial Code,  241 ( Comp. St.  1218).\n By the legislation empowring the company to construct, maintain and use the railroad, the state of New Jersey consented to the construction of the bridge in question.\n At the time the bridge was built, there was no applicable legislation by Congress. And it was within the power of the state to authorize its construction. Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Company, 2 Pet. 245, 252; \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 382]\n\u00a0\n Escanaba Company v. Chicago, \n107 \nU.S. 678, 683\n, 2 S. Ct. 185 27 L. Ed. 442. Chapter 64, Laws of New Jersey 1860, provides:\n'That it shall and may be lawful for the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey to extend their railroad from some point in their track in the city of Elizabeth, to some point or points on New York Bay, in the county of Hudson, at or south of Jersey City; and for that purpose, in its construction and completion, maintenance, use and enjoyment, all and every provision of the act entitled, 'An act to incorporate the Somerville & Easton Railroad Company' [approved February 26, 1847], and of the several supplements thereto, shall extend and be applicable to the railroad now authorized to be constructed, in every respect as if the same had been originally authorized under the said act to which this is a supplement. [Section 1.] ... That the said railroad company shall construct a suitable bridge over any navigable water that they may cross, with a pivot draw with two openings, each of seventy-five feet in width, at right angles to the main channel, located at a point convenient for navigation. ...' [Section 2.]\n\n Section 6 of the act of incorporation of 1847 (P. L. p. 130) confers upon the president and directors of the company 'all the rights and powers necessary and expedient to survey, lay out, and construct' the railroad 'not exceeding one hundred feet in width, with as many sets of tracks and rails as they may deem necessary, ... and to erect embankments, bridges, ferries, and all other works necessary to lay rails and to do all other things which shall be suitable or necessary for the completion or repair of the said road or roads.' These laws conferred on the company, not only the powers expressly defined, but also those which fairly are incidental thereto. Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., \n163 \nU.S. 564, 581\n, 16 S. Ct. 1173. Necessary bridges are essential parts of the railroad; they are stretches of railroad over water. As to bridges over navigable waters, the act of 1860 specified draws and the number \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 383]\n\u00a0\n and width of openings. But it did not prescribe the number of tracks or other elements which were to constitute th railroad. The company was empowered to have as many tracks, within the width specified, as it deemed necessary. That the company in the first instance might have built a four- track bridge of permanent materials such as is now proposed, instead of a smaller wooden structure, cannot be doubted. The powers granted were not exhausted by the construction of the tracks and bridge first provided. Its charter was of unlimited duration. Bridges, as well as other elements of the property, must be replaced when they wear out or become inadequate. The company was empowered to maintain and improve its railroad, as it might from time to time find necessary or expedient. It was not bound to have its performance limited to the capacity of the bridge first constructed, but it was free to add to its transportation facilities by laying down additional tracks over waters crossed by its bridges as well as upon land. Plainly, authority to provide, as needed, better and stronger bridges having additional tracks is to be regarded as within the purposes of and incidental to the powers expressly given. See Railway Companies v. Keokuk Bridge Co., \n131 \nU.S. 371, 385\n, 389 S., 9 S. Ct. 770; Brainard v. Clapp, 10 Cush. (Mass.) 6, 10, 57 Am. Dec. 74; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Polhemus, 178 F. 904, 906, 102 C. C. A. 105, 29 L. R. A. (N.S.) 465. This case is not like Morris and Essex Railroad Co. v. Central Railroad Co., 31 N. J. Law, 205, or McCran v. Erie Railroad Company (Court of Errors and Appeals, New Jersey, March 6, 1924) 95 N. J. Eq. 653, 124 A. 50. In the former, the company, having laid out its railroad in accordance with the charter, was held to be without power to add a branch or spur. In the latter, it was held that a change of a part of the line shortening a curve could not be made without complying with section 16 of the Railroad Act of New Jersey, requiring the consent of the riparian commission (now the board of commerce and navigation) and the payment of compensation to that body for land under water \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 384]\n\u00a0\n taken by the company. Here no extension, branch, spur, or change of route is involved.\n The replacement was authorized by the United States. The Act of August 8, 1919, authorized the company to construct a bridge suitable to the interests of navigation, between Elizabeth and Bayonne, in accordance with the Bridge Act of March 23, 1906. The latter requires the plans and specifications to be approved by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of War (section 1), and provides that, whenever Congress shall authorize a bridge over navigable waters of the United States, the authority shall cease unless construction be commenced within one year and completed within three years (section 6). The company failed to commence construction within one year. But the Act of February 15, 1921, made the time for commencing and completing the bridge two and five years respectively from the date of its passage. The Chief of Engineers and Secretary of War, December 29, 1922, approved the plans. The supremacy of the power of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states and of the regulations made by the exertion of that power is so well known as not to require citation of authority. Undoubtedly that power extends to the navigable waters of Newark Bay and to the plans for the replacement of the bridge in question. As both state and federal governments have authorized or consented to the construction of the bridge, we need not decide whether the acts of Congress and approval of the plans by the Chief of Engineers and Secretary of War would be sufficient, without the consent of the state, or whether, in respect of the navigable waters of Newark Bay wholly within the state of New Jersey, the legislation of Congress supersedes the laws of the state.\n The laws of New Jersey do not require approval of the plans for the proposed bridge by the state board of commerce and navigation. \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 385]\n\u00a0\n Section 4, c. 123, Laws of 1914, provides:\n'All plans for the development of any water front upon any navigable water or stream of this state, or bounding thereon ... in the nature of individual improvement or development, or as a part of a general plan which involves the construction, change, alteration or modification of a dock, wharf, pier, bulkhead, bridge, pipe line, cable, or any other similar or dissimilar water front development, to be undertaken subsequent to the passage of this act, shall first be submitted to the said commission [the board of commerce and navigation, sections 5, 13, c. 242, Laws of 1915], and no such development ... shall be commenced or executed without the aporoval of this commission first had and received. ...'\n\n And it declares that any such development or improvement commenced or executed without such approval shall be deemed to be a purpresture and a public nuisance. The company in February, 1917, June, 1918, and February, 1922, applied to that board for the approval of its plans for the proposed bridge. All its applications were denied. Nevertheless, the company is free to insist that such approval was not required. See Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 69 L. Ed. --. The plans for the new bridge to replace the old one are not shown by any allegations of fact to constitute a 'plan for the development of any water front.' The construction or replacement of a railroad bridge across a bay or river is nto necessarily a 'water front development.' The company was empowered under the act of 1860 not only to construct and maintain its railroad and the existing double-track bridge across the bay, but also to replace that bridge by another having additional tracks, whenever the company found it expedient so to do. We find nothing in the act to indicate an intention to require the plans for such replacement to be submitted to the state board. It is plain that the construction to be undertaken by the company for the maintenance and betterment of its railroad \n\n[267 U.S. 377, 386]\n\u00a0\n bridge over the bay is not a 'water front development to be undertaken subsequent to the passage' of chapter 123, Laws of 1914.\n Approval by the Port Authority of the company's plans for the proposed bridge was not required. There is no provision in any of the laws relating to the Port Authority or to the comprehensive plan for the development of the port, which requires such approval. And the Port Authority does not claim that the company was required to obtain its permission. In its answer, it prays the court 'to determine its legal duties in the premises,' and expresses willingness to pass on the application for a permit, if the court shall determine one is required. The complaint alleges that the bridge is not included in the comprehensive plan, and that the existing and proposed bridges 'are in conflict therewith, obstructive thereof, and inimical thereto.' But the fact that the bridge is not included does not make it unlawful, or leave the company without authority to construct it. It does not appear that the Port Authority has attempted or has power to deprive the company of its right to maintain, improve, and use that part of its railroad. The assertion that the bridge is in conflict with the comprehensive plan is not supported by any facts alleged in the complaint or in the answer to the Port Authority. The pleader's naked assertion is not enough to support the contention that the consent of the Port Authority was required.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOCKRILL v.

Section 9 provides:\n'Every transfer of real property, or of an interest therein, though colorable in form, shall be void as to the state and the interest thereby conveyed or sought to be conveyed shall escheat to the state if the property interest involved is of such a character that an alien mentioned in section two hereof [one not eligible to citizenship under the laws of the United States] is inhibited from acquiring, possessing, enjoying or transferring it, and if the conveyance is made with intent to prevent, evade or avoid escheat as provided for herein. A prima facie presumption that the conveyance is made with such intent shall arise upon proof of ... the taking of the property in the name of a person other than the persons mentioned in section two hereof if the consideration is paid or agreed or understood to be paid by an alien mentioned in section two hereof . ...'\n\n Section 10 provides that, if two or more persons conspire to effect a transfer of real property or of any interest therein in violation of the provisions of the statute, they shall be punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.\n Plaintiff in error Cockrill is an American, and Ikada is a Japanese subject not eligible to citizenship. They entered into an agreement to purchase certain agricultural lands and to take title in the name of Cockrill. Ikada furnished the money which was paid on account of the purchase price, and, upon the making of the contract, took possession of the property. Cockrill had no interest in the land; and the prosecution maintained that he made the contract with the seller and intended to take the deed and hold the land in trust for Ikada. But \n\n[268 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs in error represented that the land was being acquired for and was to be owned by the children of Ikada, who are natives of the United States and entitled to take and hold such lands. See Estate of Tetsubumi Yano, 188 Cal. 645, 649, 206 P. 995. The court included in its charge to the jury the above quoted provisions of section 9. Plaintiffs in error assert that the rule of evidence so declared violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and also the treaty between the United States and Japan.\n It is not, and could not reasonably be, suggested that the statute is repugnant to the due process clause. It does not operate to preclude any defense. The inference that payment of the purchase price by one from whom the privilege of acquisition is withheld, and the taking of the land in the name of one of another class, are for the purpose of getting the control of the land for the ineligible alien is not fanciful, arbitrary, or unreasonable. There is a rational connection between the facts and the intent authorized to be inferred from them. The statute involves no attempt to relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It merely creates a presumption which may be overcome by evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. See Yee Hem v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 178\n, 45 S. Ct. 470, 69 L. Ed. -, decided April 27, 1925; Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463; People v. Rodriquez, 182 Cal. 197, 187 P. 423.\n The statute is not repugnant to the equal protection clause. The rule of evidence applies equally and without discrimination to all persons-to citizens and eligible aliens as well as to the ineligible. In the application of the law at the trial, no distinction was made between the citizen and the Japanese. Plaintiffs in error maintain that invalidity results from the fact that, where payment of the purchase price is made by an ineligible alien, the law creates a presumption of a purpose to prevent, \n\n[268 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n evade, or avoid escheat, while no such presumption arises where such payment is made by a citizen or eligible alien. But there are reasonable grounds for the distinction. Conveyances to ineligible Japanese are void as to the state and the lands conveyed escheat. Payment by such aliens for agricultural lands taken in the names of persons not of that class reasonably may be given a significance as evidence of intent to avoid escheat not attributable to like acts of persons who have the privilege of owning such lands. The equal protection clause does not require absolute uniformity, or prohibit every distinction in the laws of the state between ineligible aliens and other persons within its jurisdiction. The state has a wide discretion and may classify persons on bases that are reasonable and germane having regard to the purpose of the legislation. Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375. This is well illustrated by the Alien Land Laws. Terrace v. Thompson, supra, 218 (44 S. Ct. 15); Porterfield v. Webb, supra, 233 (44 S. Ct. 21); Webb v. O'Brien, supra, 324 (44 S. Ct. 112); Frick v. Webb, supra, 333 (44 S. Ct. 115). The fact that in California all privileges in respect of the acquisition, use, and control of the land for agricultural purposes are withheld from ineligible Japanese constitutes a reasonable and valid basis for the rule of evidence.\n It is the third paragraph of article 1 of the Treaty that plaintiffs in error contend is violated. The treaty provision is:\n'The citizens or subjects of each of the high contracting parties shall receive, in the territories of the other, the most constant protection and security for their persons and property, and shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges as are or may be granted to native citizens or subjects, on their submitting themselves to the conditions imposed upon the native citizens or subjects.' Subdivision 3.\n\n It is plain that the treaty does not furnish any protection to Japanese subjects in this country against the application of a rule of evidence created \n\n[268 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n by state enactment that is not given them by the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the law does not contravene these constitutional provisions, it must be held not to violate the treaty.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLLEGE POINT BOAT CORPORATION v. U S(1925)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Julian C. Hammack and Bynum E. Hinton, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[267 U.S. 12, 13]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On October 25, 1918, the College Point Boat Corporation agreed to manufacture for the Navy Department 2,000 collision mats. The United States agreed to pay therefor $641,200, and to supply the required canvas. On \n\n[267 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n November 11, 1918, the Armistice was signed. Soon after, the Navy Department informed the corporation that the mats would probably not be needed, suggested that it stop operations, and asked it to submit a proposition for cancellation of the contract. This notification and request were received before the process of manufacture had been begun; but the corporation had expended large sums in necessary preparations. Negotiations for settlement followed. They extended over nearly eight months and proved inconclusive. Without prejudice to the rights of either party, the United States made a partial settlement by taking over at cost raw materials which the corporation had purchased or contracted for.\n In November, 1919, this suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the further amounts claimed. The court found that, in addition to the amounts covered by the partial settlement, expenditures had been made, services rendered, and charges incurred aggregating $5,112.42 in cost or value. For that amount it entered judgment. The claimant contended that the United States was under the ordinary liability of one who, having contracted for goods to be manufactured, without cause, gives notice that he will not accept delivery, and that it was liable, also, for the prospective profits. United States v. Speed, 8 Wall. 77; United States v. Purcell Envelope Co., \n249 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 39 S. Ct. 300. The court found that the corporation was ready, willing, and able to perform the contract, and that, if it 'be entitled to prospective profits on the contract work, the amount of such profits it would be entitled to recover, after allowing for its release from the care and responsibility which would have attended full performance of the contract, would be $123,980.' As a conclusion of law, the court ruled that no part of these prospective profits was recoverable, because the United States had canceled the contract. 58 Ct. Cl. 380. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219). \n\n[267 U.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n There is no finding of fact that the contract was canceled. Nor do the facts found warrant the conclusion that there was in law a cancellation before the suit was begun. The contract did not contain any clause authorizing cancellation other than for default by the plaintiff. There was no such default. The United States actually did have an unconditional right of cancellation. For the contract was made pursuant to the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182. By virtue of the statutory provision, as was later held in Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428, the right to cancel became, by implication, one of the terms of the contract. But, so far as appears, neither party knew that the United States had such a right. The Navy Department failed to give the notice requisite to terminate the contract. Its sole objective in suggesting that preparations for the performance of the contract be stopped was to avoid useless production. The corporation necessarily acquiesced. The parties negotiated, seeking to find a basis on which they could agree to cancel and liquidate the obligation of the government. In the negotiations, and in the agreements which embodied the partial settlement, the Navy used language inconsistent with an intention to exercise a right of cancellation. As its efforts to procure consent to cancel proved futile, stopping the work was an anticipatory breach.\n The question remains whether the measure of damages recoverable for this breach is the same as it would have been if the government had not possessed the right of cancellation. A party to a contract who is sued for its breach may ordinarily defend on the ground that there existed, at the time, a legal excuse for nonperformance by him, although he was then ignorant of the fact. \n1\n He \n\n[267 U.S. 12, 16]\n\u00a0\n may, likewise, justify an asserted termination, rescission, or repudiation, of a contract by proving that there was, at the time, an adequate cause, although it did not become known to him until later. \n2\n An unconditional right to cancel can be availed of for the purpose of terminating a contract, even after suit brought, unless some intervening change in the position of the other party renders that course inequitable. Compare Clough v. London & Northwestern Ry. Co., L. R. 7 Exch. 26, 33 et seq. Ignorance of its right doubtless prevented the Navy Department from taking, shortly after the Armistice, the course which would have resulted legally in canceling the contract at that time. But the right to cancel was not lost by mere delay in exercising it; among other reasons, because the statute conferred upon the government also the power to suspend the contract. The right remained effective as a limitation upon the corporation's right to have the government accept and pay for the mats. This continuing right of cancellation which was asserted later, in court, operated to curtail the damages recoverable. It limited the value of the plaintiff's right to require performance, and hence the amount and character of the loss for which compensation must be made. Prospective profits were not recoverable.\n The corporation contends that the United States had broken its agreement even prior to its notification to stop preparations for the performance of the contract; and that a party in default cannot exercise a right to cancel. There is no such rule of general application. The default referred to was not substantial. By the terms of the \n\n[267 U.S. 12, 17]\n\u00a0\n contract the United States was to furnish the canvas within 30 days; that is, on November 25. It did not do so. Two weeks before that date the Armistice had been signed. On December 3 the corporation requested that the canvas be supplied. On December 6 it received from the Navy notice that the mats would probably not be needed. Neither these facts, nor any other found, render inequitable a delayed exercise of the right to cancel.\n It is also urged that the Navy did not tender to the corporation 75 per cent. of the amount which it offered in settlement. The right to cancel conferred by the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, is not made dependent upon such tender. The corporation made no demand for that amount. Moreover, for aught that appears, it has actually received a larger percentage. With the amount awarded by the lower court, it will receive full compensation.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] H. D. Williams Cooperage Co. v. Scofield, 115 F. 119, 121, 53 C. C.

GOMERY(1925)\nNo. 44\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 177, 178]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Stephen J. Cox, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. George Bayard Jones, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In an earlier suit petitioners sought to enjoin an infringement of the Callahan patent, No. 948,719, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held the patent valid. Concrete Appliances Co. v. Meinken, 262 F. 958. Later the present suit was brought in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin an infringement of the same patent by the respondents. The District Court expressed the opinion that the claims of the patent did not involve invention, but, in deference to the determination in the Sixth Circuit, dismissed the petitioners' bill on the ground of noninfringement. 284 F. 518. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the patent was invalid for want of invention. 291 F. 486. In view of the conflict of decision, the writ of certiorari was granted by this court (\n264 \nU.S. 578\n, 44 S. Ct. 404) to review the determination in the Third Circuit. Thomson Co. v. Ford Motor Co., \n265 \nU.S. 445\n, 44 S. Ct. 533. Both suits involved claims numbered 1, 2, 5, and 13 of the Callahan patent for 'material transferring apparatus' designed for use in transferring concrete or other plastic materials from a suitable source of supply to working points desired on a building or other structure, in the course of construction.\n In principle, the device concerned calls into operation gravity, in conveying mobile substances from an elevated central point to varying working points in building operations. The claims made by the patentee, which relate \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 179]\n\u00a0\n to a combination embraced in the apparatus described, when paraphrased and separated into their constituent elements, comprise: (1) A tower; (2) a boom oscillatory or swinging horizontally, adjustably connected with the tower and adapted to be arranged at various points in its height; (3) a conduit carried by the boom, extending laterally from the tower, connected to it and adjustable vertically at varying heights in the tower; (4) a means for raising plastic material to the height desired in the tower; and ( 5) a means for receiving the plastic material from the raising means and conducting it to the conduit, both the raising means and the receiving means being adjustable vertically at varying heights in the tower.\n The apparatus described in the letters patent is capable of use in conveying 'wet' or 'mush' concrete from the point where it is prepared for use and distributing it to points where it is incorporated into a building in process of construction. When the mixed concrete is in readiness to be placed in the forms or molds in which it is allowed to 'set' or harden into an integral part of the structure, it is elevated by the 'raising means,' usually a bucket, skip, or other suitable conveyor, to the 'receiving means,' a hopper, in which the concrete is deposited. From thence it flows by gravity into the conduit, and through it to the form or mold, which may be in any part of the structure at a suitable level below the base of the hopper. As the building progresses, the conveyor, the hopper, and the attached conduit may be progressively raised within the tower, so that gravity may carry the flowing concrete to any desired point at lower levels in the structure.\n The several elements in the petitioners' claims which we have enumerated embrace familiar devices long in common use, separately or in smaller groups, both in this and in kindred mechanical arts. It is not argued that there is any novelty in such units or groups, and the only serious question presented is whether in combination \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n in the apparatus described, they constitute an invention. That the combination embodied in the described apparatus produces a useful result in the mechanical arts, and in modified form is widely used in building operations, is established. Our inquiry, therefore, must be addressed to the question whether the combination is novel, and whether it passes the line, sometimes tenuous and difficult of ascertainment, which separates mechanical skill from invention. The pursuit of this inquiry involves a consideration of the state of the art prior to Callahan's application, of which elaborate proof was made in the trial court.\n Because of an evident difference in the state of the proof in the two cases, the adjudications of this patent by the two Circuit Courts of Appeals are, we think, only apparently conflicting. It is clear from an examination of the two records, the earlier of which is an exhibit in this suit, as well as from the opinion of the court in the Sixth Circuit, that that court did not have before it the detailed history of the practical development of the art, which was elaborately proved in the present case and which convinced both the District Judge and the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Third Circuit that the plaintiff's appliance did not embody an invention. The question thus presented is one of fact, but notwithstanding the agreement of the two courts below, on this aspect of the case, the difference in result reached by the two Circuit Courts of Appeals leads us to review the salient features of the state of the art at about January, 1908, when, according to petitioners, Callahan conceived the combination covered by the claims in his patent. See Thompson Co. v. Ford Motor Co., supra, 447 (44 S. Ct. 533).\n It is a fact of which we may take judicial notice (King v. Gallun, \n109 \nU.S. 99\n, 3 S. Ct. 85) that the principle of conveying and distributing a mobile substance by gravity has found exemplification for centuries, in apparatus for lifting \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 181]\n\u00a0\n water by power, in buckets or other convenient form of conveyor to a central reservoir from which its flow is induced by gravity, through suitable conduits to fixed points or through movable pipes or hose to varying selected points. Long prior to the Callahan application the principle had been applied to other substances capable of flow under the action of gravity, such as grain, coal, crushed stone, sand, and iron ore. The proof is abundant that by 1905 it was common practice in the erection and use of grain elevators to provide for raising the grain by endless belt or other conveyor to the top of the elevator; then to discharge it into a receptacle, called a garner or hopper, from which it flowed by gravity through pipes or spouts having a swivel connection with the hopper and swinging laterally, so that the lower end of the spout was movable in the arc of a circle. These spouts were capable of extension, variable at will by attaching additional sections appropriately swiveled, to the end of the section of the spout connecting with the hopper. The conduit or spout was supported, according to need and convenience, by an inclined cable attached at a suitable point above to the elevator tower, or by pivoted boom or gaff attached to the tower of the elevator and capable of being raised or lowered at its outer end. Apparatus of this type was commonly and successfully used for the unloading and storage of grain, and for loading it from storage on to ships or cars in varying positions and distances from the elevator tower; sectional or telescopic spouts, attached to the tower and to each other, being used to secure the delivery of the grain in the desired direction, and at desired distances, the spout being raised or lowered and given direction by the use of boom and tackle. On occasion there was duplication of the apparatus on board ship by the use of a supplemental hopper and supplemental conduit or chute supported and controlled by boom and tackle located on the ship. \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 182]\n\u00a0\n Similar apparatus was in use for the moving of coal by gravity through chutes so constructed as to be moved either vertically or horizontally and supported by cable or boom.\n Before 1904-5 it was common practice for architects' specifications to require that concrete used in building operations be mixed 'dry'; that is, of a consistency which would not admit of its ready flow by gravity. This practice was resisted by engineers and contractors, because it was cheaper and easier to use 'wet' concrete, which could be conveniently distributed through chutes and conduits. For reasons which need not now be inquired into in detail, the increasing use in earlier years of 'wet' concrete in all types of structural work had become the established practice by 1905. Cotemporaneously with this increasing use, and, as the proofs show, an active agency in inducing it, was the practical adaptation of the apparatus, used in moving and distributing grain and other substances of similar mobility, to all the requirements for the convenient handling and distribution of concrete by gravity in building operations. Without attempting to refer to all of the numerous instances of that adaptation it will be sufficient to indicate some of the more significant examples which mark its progress.\n As early as 1902-3 in the construction of the Ingalls Building in Cincinnati, an apparatus was used for elevating concrete to a hopper, from which it was discharged through movable metal chutes supported by horses, to varying required points on the floor area of a building in process of erection. This apparatus was described in the Engineering News of July 30, 1903\n\n\n In 1906 a like apparatus was used in the construction of a reinforced concrete building in Norfolk, Va. Concrete was elevated in a tower to a hopper, which was capable of being elevated from story to story as the work progressed. The chute attached to the mouth of the \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 183]\n\u00a0\n hopper by swivel was capable of lateral movement, and supported by block and tackle attached to the top of the tower.\n There is proof of the use at San Francisco harbor in 1906, in concrete construction, of substantially similar apparatus placed on a scow. It involved the use of a chute moved into different positions by a supporting boom.\n In June, 1907, a similar apparatus was used in the construction of a steel-framed concrete building in St. Louis, although sketches, prepared at the time, called for a swinging boom for the support of a conduit, the boom was in practice dispensed with, as the steel skeleton of the building afforded a means of supporting the conduit.\n In the summer of 1908 an appliance of the same sort was used in the construction of a concrete building at St. Joseph, Mo.; the hopper being capable of elevation within the tower as required, and the movable chute being supported by cables radiating from the top of the tower.\n In 1906 the Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company built at Gary, Ind., a concrete cofferdam, using a mixer placed on a car running on a trestle, with a wooden hopper beneath the mouth of the mixer, and a movable steel chute extending from the hopper into the cofferdam; the chute being secured by ropes or wires extending to the bracing.\n In 1907, in connection with this same construction, the apparatus was modified by the addition of a mast, to which was attached a swinging boom from which the movable steel chute was suspended. This was in successful operation several months, and was constructed by a man who had never seen concrete handled in this manner, but who was familiar with grain elevator practice.\n In July, 1908, five months prior to the filing of the Callahan application, an apparatus comprising the elements enumerated in the claims in suit was used success- \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 184]\n\u00a0\n fully in constructing a concrete building in St. Louis. The hopper was vertically adjustable, but the boom was mounted at the top of the tower, so that there was no necessity for change of its location vertically as the building progressed. The use of a swinging boom, attached to a building in process of erection or to a construction tower, which boom was in practice raised from time to time as convenience of operation required, was then a well-known device.\n In this state of the art, Callahan and several others, in the period 1909, applied for patents on combinations for the conveying of wet concrete through spouts or chutes; their applications resulting in interferences.\n Without more extensive examination of the record, this state of the proof leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that the combination described in the Callahan application does not constitute an invention.\n The observations of common experience in the mechanical arts would lead one to expect that, once the feasibility of using 'wet' concrete in building operations was established, the mechanical skill of those familiar with engineering and building problems would seek to make use of known methods and appliances for the convenient handling of this new building material.\n To say nothing of the universally known methods and appliances for raising and distributing water, there were ready at hand widely used and generally understood appliances for the elevation and distribution of mobile substances, such as grain and coal, which involved, both in principle and in practical detail, all the elements described in the Callahan claims. Failure to make use of these obviously applicable methods and appliances in combination, suitable to the particular work in hand, in dealing with a new, plastic material capable of similar treatment, would, we think, have evidenced a want of ordinary mechnical skill and of familiarity with con- \n\n[269 U.S. 177, 185]\n\u00a0\n struction problems and methods. The adaptation independently made by engineers and builders of these familiar appliances to the movement and distribution of concrete cement in building operations and the independent patent applications, within a comparatively short space of time, for devices for that purpose are in themselves persuasive evidence that this use, in combination of well known mechanical elements was the product only of ordinary mechanical or engineering skill and not of inventive genius. Atlantic Works v. Brady, \n107 \nU.S. 192\n, 2 S. Ct. 225. It is but 'the suggestion of that common experience, which arose spontaneously and by a necessity of human reasoning, in the minds of those who had become acquainted with the circumstances with which they had to deal.' Hollister v. Benedict Manufacturing Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 72\n, 5 S. Ct. 717, 724 (28 L. Ed. 901). This progressive adaptation, much of which preceded and some of which was cotemporaneous with the Callahan adaptation, of well- known devices to new but similar uses, 'is but the display of the expected skill of the calling, and involves only the exercise of the ordinary faculties of reasoning upon the materials supplied by a special knowledge, and the facility of manipulation which results from its habitual and intelligent practice.' Hollister v. Benedict Manufacturing Co., supra, at page 73 (5 S. Ct. 724). No novel elements were used by Callahan in his device. We are unable to find that their use in combination in it was more than the application to them of mechanical skill in the course of a natural development and expansion of the art. The decree of the court below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOOKE v. U.S.(1925)\nNo. 311\nArgued: March 20, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n Clay Cooke and J. L. Walker were each sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment for contempt by the United \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The case was taken on error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed the sentence of Cooke and reversed that of Walker. By certiorari, Cooke's sentence was brought here.\n Walker was defendant in a series of suits growing out of the bankruptcy of the Walker Grain Company. One of the cases, numbered 984, after a long jury trial resulted in a verdict against Walker of $56,000. The next day, while the court was open and engaged in the trial of another cause, and during a 10 minutes' recess for rest and refreshments, Walker, by direction of Cooke, delivered to the District Judge in his chambers, adjoining the courtroom, and within a few feet of it, a letter marked 'Personal,' as follows:\n'Fort Worth, Texas, February 15, 1923\n\n\n\n'Hon. James C. Wilson, Judge U. S. District Court, Fort Worth, Texas- Dear Sir: In re No. 985, W. W. Wilkinson, Trustee, v. J. L. Walker; in re No. 986, W. W. Wilkinson, Trustee, v. Mass. Bonding Company et al.; in re 266, Equity, W. W. Wilkinson, Trustee v. J. L. Walker; in re 69, Equity, Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. J. L. Walker; in re No. 1001, in Bankruptcy, Walker Grain Company.\n\n'Referring to the above matters pending in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, at Fort Worth, I beg personally, as a lawyer interested in the cause of justice and fairness in the trial of all litigated matters, and as a friend of the judge of this court, to suggest that the only order that I will consent to your honor's entering in any of the above-mentioned matters now pending in your honor's court is an order certifying your honor's disqualification on the ground of prejudice and bias to try said matters. \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n 'You having, however, proceeded to enter judgment in the petition for review of the action of the referee on the summary orders against the Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank and J. L. Walker and Mrs. M. M. Walker, you, of course, would have to pass upon the motion for a new trial in those matters, and also having tried 984, W. W. Wilkinson, Trustee, v. J. L. Walker, you will, of course, have to pass upon the motion for a new trial in said cause.\n\n'I do not like to take the steps necessary to enforce the foregoing disqualification, which to my mind, as a lawyer and an honest man, is apparent.\n\n'Therefore, in the interest of friendship and in the interest of fairness, I suggest that the only honorable thing for your honor to do in the above-styled matters is to note your honor's disqualification, or, your honor's qualification having been questioned, to exchange places and permit some judge in whom the defendant and counsel feel more confidence to try these particular matters.\n\n'Prior to the trial of cause No. 984, which, as just concluded, I had believed that your honor was big enough and broad enough to overcome the personal prejudice against the defendant Walker, which I knew to exist, but I find that in this fond hope I was mistaken, also my client desired the privilege of laying the whole facts before your honor in an endeavor to overcome the effect of the slanders that have been filed in your honor's court against him personally, and which have been whispered in your honor's ears against him, and in proof of which not one scintilla of evidence exists in any record ever made in your honor's court.\n\n'My hopes in this respect having been rudely shattered, I am now appealing purely to your honor's dignity as a judge and sense of fairness as a man to do as in this letter requested, and please indicate to me at the earliest moment your honor's pleasure with respect to the mat- \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n ters herein presented, so that further steps may be avoided.\n\n'With very great respect, I beg to remain, Clay Cooke.'\n\n'Yours most truly,\n\n Eleven days after this, on the 26th of February, the court directed an order to be entered with a recital of facts concluding as follows:\n'Therefore, since the matters of fact set forth herein are within the personal knowledge of the judge of this court, and since it is the view of this court that said letter as a whole is an attack upon the honor and integrity of the court, wherein it charges that the judge of this court is not big enough and broad enough to truly pass upon matters pending therein, and wherein it charges in effect that the judge of this court has allowed himself to be improperly approached and influenced and whispered to by interested parties against a litigant in the court, and since it is the view of this court that such an act by a litigant and his attorney constitutes misbehavior, and a contempt under the law, and that the threats and impertinence and insult in said letter were deliberately and designedly offered, with intent to intimidate and improperly influence the court in matters then pending and soon to be passed upon, and to destroy the independence and impartiality of the court in these very matters, it is ordered that an attachment immediately issue for the said J. L. Walker and Clay Cooke, and that the marshal of this court produce them instanter before this court to show cause, if any they have, why they should not be punished for contempt.'\n\n The marshal arrested the defendants and brought them to court. The following statement shows in substance what then occurred:\n'Judge Wilson: At this time I will call the contempt matter against Clay Cooke and J. L. Walker, attachment having been issued for these respondents. \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n I have requested Judge J. M. McCormick, of Dallas, to be present and act as a friend of the court in this proceeding, and have also requested the district attorney, it being in its nature a criminal matter, to act.'\n\n Mr. Clay Cooke said that he had not known of the attachment until that morning, that he would like time to prepare for trial and get witnesses for their defense, that there might be extenuating circumstances which would appeal to the court's sense of fairness and justice in fixing whatever penalty might be imposed and that he had attempted to secure counsel, but through illness or absence of those he sought he had failed up to that time.\n Judge Wilson intimated that he would not postpone the matter, and said:\n'There is just this question involved, and, as stated by counsel representing the court, these facts are within the personal knowledge of this court. Did you deliver this letter to the judge of this court?\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: Is your honor asking me?\n\n'Judge Wilson: I am stating the question-and does that under the law constitute contempt? If you have any defense, you have not suggested any. This court would be glad to give you ample time to file any pleadings pertinent and secure any evidence that might support or tend to support it, but unless you desire now to state that you have some defense you care to file and present, and indicate what that defense is to this charge, then I shall direct that this proceeding go forward, and you are fully protected, since the higher courts are open to you to correct any error, even to the Supreme Court, that the judge of this court might commit here. Now if you have any defense that is pertinent to this order, state what it is.'\n\n Mr. Cooke began to dictate a statement to be filed by him, to the effect that he and Walker believed that they had a good defense, and that the matters of fact stated \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n in the letter as to the bias and prejudice of the judge were true.\n'The Court: That does not constitute any defense.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cook: I'll state, then, something otherwise--\n\n'Judge Wilson: Repeating the insult does not constitute any defense.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: I am not trying to repeat the insult, if your honor please. ... I am now stating my good faith.\n\n'Judge Wilson: I mean this, that the court is not permitting it stated-you may, if you regard that as proper, you may state it in your bill of exceptions in concluding the record.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: That affiant had heretofore been on friendly relations with said Judge James C. Wilson--\n\n'Judge Wilson: That is a matter that is wholly immaterial here; it don't make any difference how friendly.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: I am stating my good faith in writing the letter. And affiant believed in writing said letter that he would relieve the said judge of the embarrassment of filing the necessary statutory affidavits of disqualification, and if said letter--\n\n'Judge Wilson: Now the court is not caring anything about your suggesting the disqualification of the court; that is your right before these important trials, but you did not avail yourself of that privilege. You understood as a lawyer how to proceed in order to suggest the disqualification of the judge.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: I am going to state why I did not proceed--\n\n'Judge Wilson: That does not constitute any defense to this contempt charge.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: Can I put that in about writing the letter? Can I put that in later?\n\n'Judge Wilson: You may. \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Clay Cooke: That affiant wrote said letter without any intention on his part of incurring contempt proceedings, and without any thought of contempt, and believed that said letter would not be so construed; that affiant has the highest regard for this court as a judge; that affiant believed in good faith the court had heard things concerning--'\n\n Then Mr. McCormick, for the court, interposed an objection that there ought not to be an accentuation of the contempt in the letter by a repetition of innuendoes and reflections on the court or by including them in the record.\n Mr. Clay Cooke said he had dictated and sent the letter after advising with reputable counsel, who had read it and believed it proper.\n'The letter itself was not carefully read by myself.'\n\n'Judge Wilson: I would like to know who said reputable counsel are.'\n\n Mr. Clay Cooke said it was his partner, Mr. Dedmon. He said the letter was dictated, and was not read by his client, J. L. Walker; that he had not made the contents public, and intended it only for the judge's eye, to relieve him from embarrassment; that the purpose was most friendly. After repeating a desire for counsel and the investigation as to the law of contempt in its application to this case, Mr. Cooke referred to the statement he had been attempting to dictate, and asked that he might make it fuller, because of certain interruptions, and to put in anything relevant to his defense.\n'You may add-I have not heard any defense suggested here yet, but you may add any, however, if you think of any later. Read the order, Mr. District Attorney.'\n\n The district attorney then read the order for the arrest of the defendants set forth in the record in said cause; the defendants were directed to stand up and the court addressed them as follows: \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n 'Judge Wilson: The findings of fact, all of which are within the personal knowledge of this court, will be made in the order entered:\n'Now, gentlemen, it is a matter almost of common knowledge that the court may be lawfully criticized, the same as any other branch of the government, and that it is not unlawful or a contempt of the court for any person, including newspapers, to pass criticisms upon the judiciary, including the federal courts and the judges, regardless of their truth or falsity, when those criticisms are concerning past matters not at the time pending in the courts. This law is based upon sound principle. Every branch of the government needs constructive criticism; when it is such, it is wholesome and helpful; no judge, I think, welcomes it more nor fears it less than the judge of this court. But it is altogether a different proposition, and is unlawful and clearly constitutes a contempt of court, for any litigant or attorney to pass such in the presence of the court, not in a respectful, but in a contemptuous and slanderous manner, concerning matters then pending and later to be disposed of by the court.\n\n'It is obvious upon a reading of this letter that you deliberately designed to improperly influence the court in these pending matters wherein no disqualification is suggested, and you were very careful to suggest that the court was not disqualified in certain matters, and it is the view of the court that it was your thought and aim to destroy the independence and the very impartiality of the court as to those matters.\n\n'And I have some more things I should like to remind you gentlemen of, your conduct and course as litigant and as an attorney of this court, in many respects, has been reprehensible. You have filled your pleadings with scandalous charges against trusted officials of this court. You have charged that the referee in bankruptcy, the attorneys for the petitioning creditors, and the trustee in bankruptcy entered into a corrupt conspiracy to do \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n many unlawful things, all to deprive you, J. L. Walker, of your rights in this court. And not only that, but while the jury were deliberating in cause No. 984, and though in charge of the marshal of this court, you, both of you being a party to it, employed a private detective to follow and shadow them, with a view of reporting to you any corrupt conduct on their part; and you, J. L. Walker, after the jury had rendered its verdict of $56,000 against you, you employed this same detective, whose sworn statement I hold in my hand, to follow the foreman of the jury, Mr. E. G. Thomas, an honorable and respected citizen of Tarrant county, stating that you expected him to meet some one and be paid off-in other words, to receive bribe money for his verdict in said cause. And not only that, but you gave this same private detective to understand that another one of the jurors, an honorable citizen of Parker county, had been improperly approached and influenced as a juror in this case--\n\n'Mr. J. L. Walker: Your honor, pardon me, but I would like to state that J. L. Walker did but what he is in position to prove and I have it in my pocket--\n\n'Mr. Marshal, cause this man to desist.\n\n'Mr. J. L. Walker: I beg your pardon; I thought I had the right to speak now.\n\n'Judge Wilson: No; you haven't got a right. Your time to reply is passed.\n\n'In view of all this, it is not surprising that you men would deliver this letter to the court with the utterly false statement in it that this court had permitted himself to be improperly influenced and whispered to by interested parties against a litigant in this court. It is a simple and easy matter to analyze the character of any man who is expecting every other man to act dishonestly and corruptly.\n\n'Your whole course, as I say, has been contemptible, not only in this matter, and it is not surprising that you delivered this letter to the court, and is surprising that \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n you did not state more in the letter, and of course you are in contempt; if you are not, you have your remedy; and you, J. L. Walker, I sentence to the Tarrant county jail for 30 days and the payment of a $500 fine--\n\n'Mr. McCormick: I doubt whether your honor has the authority to assess both fine and imprisonment. The statute says you may punish by 'fine or imprisonment.' I believe I would suggest that you visit such fine as you see fit, or such imprisonment, but not both.\n\n'Judge Wilson: I assess a punishment of 30 days against each of these respondents.'\n\n Mr. Cooke asked that a bond be fixed pending appeal.\n'Mr. McCormick: An appeal does not lie in such a case. The evidence, gentlemen, if at all, must be reviewed by writ of error, if reviewed at all.\n\n'Mr. Clay Cooke: The statement of the court is he will consider a writ of error or appeal. In this case we will have 60 days--\n\n'Judge Wilson: Take these respondents to jail, Mr. Marshal.\n\n'Mr. McCormick: If they are going to take the full 60 days on the matter--\n\n'Judge Wilson: No; there is not going to be any 60 days; the higher court is going to pass upon this matter at once. ...\n\n'Mr. Dedmon: Did your honor fix the amount of the bond?\n\n'Judge Wilson: One thousand dollars. I am not allowing them bond, not releasing the defendants. It is a writ of error bond.\n\n'Mr. Dedmon: You mean you are not going to let them appeal from the order adjudging them to spend 30 days in jail?\n\n'Judge Wilson: If they perfect this appeal, I might release them from jail-show that they are going to appeal it, and do it in a hurry.' \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 528]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin C. Brandenburg, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 517, 530]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Merrill E. Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for the United States.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 517, 532]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first objection to the sentence of the court, made on behalf of the petitioner, is that the letter written to the judge is not a contempt of the court. Section 21 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  988) contains the following:\n'Whenever a party to any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall make and file an affidavit that the judge before whom the action or proceeding is to be tried or heard has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any opposite party to the suit, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be designated in the manner prescribed in the section last \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 533]\n\u00a0\n preceding, or chosen in the manner prescribed in section twenty-three, to hear such matter. Every such affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the behalf that such bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term of the court, or good cause shall be shown for the failure to file it within such time. No party shall be entitled in any case to file more than one such affidavit; and no such affidavit shall be filed unless accompanied by a certificate of counsel of record that such affidavit and application are made in good faith.'\n\n It is said that all that the petitioner intended to do by this letter was to advise the court of the desire of his client to have another judge try the four cases yet to be heard, and of his own desire to avoid the necessity of filing an affidavit of bias under the above section in those cases by inducing the regular judge voluntarily to withdraw. Had the letter contained no more than this, we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it would not have been improper.\n But we also agree with that court that the letter as written did more than this. The letter was written the morning after the verdict, in the heat of the petitioner's evident indignation at the judge's conduct of the case and the verdict. At least two weeks would elapse before it was necessary to file an affidavit of bias in the other cases. \n1\n The letter was written and delivered pending further necessary proceedings in the very case which aroused the writer's anger. While it was doubtless intended to notify the judge that he would not be allowed to sit in the other cases, its tenor shows that it was also written to gratify the writer's desire to characterize in severe language, personally \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 534]\n\u00a0\n derogatory to the judge, his conduct of the pending case. Though the writer addressed the judge throughout as 'your honor,' this did not conceal, but emphasized, the personal reflection intended. The expression of disappointed hope that the judge was begenough and broad enough to overcome his personal prejudice against petitioner's client, and that the client would have the privilege of rebutting the whispered slanders to which the judge had lent his ear, and the declaration that his confidence in the judge had been rudely shattered, were personally condemnatory and were calculated to stir the judge's resentment and anger. Considering the circumstances and the fact that the case was still before the judge, but without intending to foreclose the right of the petitioner to be heard with witnesses and argument on this issue when given an opportunity, we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the letter was contemptuous.\n But, while we reach this conclusion, we are far from approving the course of the judge in the procedure or absence of it adopted by him in sentencing the petitioner. He treated the case as if the objectionable words had been uttered against him in open court\n To preserve order in the courtroom for the proper conduct of business, the court must act instantly to suppress disturbance or violence or physical obstruction or disrespect to the court, when occurring in open court. There is no need of evidence or assistance of counsel before punishment, because the court has seen the offense. Such summary vindication of the court's dignity and authority is necessary. It has always been so in the courts of the common law, and the punishment imposed is due process of law. Such a case had great consideration in the decision of this court in Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289\n, 9 S. Ct. 77. It was there held that a court of the United States, upon the commission of a contempt in open court, \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 535]\n\u00a0\n might upon its own knowledge of the facts, without further proof, without issue or trial, and without hearing an explanation of the motives of the offender, immediately proceed to determine whether the facts justified punishment and to inflict such punishment as was fitting under the law.\n The important distinction between the Terry Case and the one at bar is that this contempt was not in open court. This is fully brought out in Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S. Ct. 699. The contempt there was an effort to deter a witness in attendance upon a court of the United States in obedience to a subpoena, while he was in a waiting room for witnesses near the courtroom, from testifying and the offering him money in the hallway of the courthouse as an inducement. This was held to be 'misbehavior in the presence of the court,' under section 725, R. S. ( now section 268 of the Judicial Code [Comp. St.  1245]). The court, speaking by Mr. Justice Harlan, said (page 277 [9 S. Ct. 702]):\n'We are of opinion that, within the meaning of the statute, the court, at least when in session, is present in every part of the place set apart for its own use, and for the use of its officers, jurors and witnesses, and misbehavior anywhere in such place is misbehavior in the presence of the court. It is true that the mode of proceeding for contempt is not the same in every case of such misbehavior. Where the contempt is committed directly under the eye or within the view of the court, it may proceed 'upon its own knowledge of the facts, and punish the offender, without further ther proof, and without issue or trial in any form' (Ex parte Terry, \n128 U.S. 289\n, 309); whereas, in cases of misbehavior of which the judge cannot have such personal knowledge, and is informed thereof only by the confession of the party, or by the testimony under oath of others, the proper practice is, by rule or other process, to require the offender to appear and show cause why he should not be punished. 4 Bl. Com. 286.' \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 536]\n\u00a0\n This difference between the scope of the words of the statute 'in the presence of the court,' on the one hand, and the meaning of the narrower phrase, 'under the eye or within the view of the court,' or 'in open court,' or 'in the face of the court,' or 'in facie curiae,' on the other, is thus clearly indicated, and is further elaborated in the opinion.\n\n We think the distinction finds its reason, not any more in the ability of the judge to see and hear what happens in the open court than in the danger that, unless such an open threat to the orderly procedure of the court and such a flagrant defiance of the person and presence of the judge before the public in the 'very hallowed place of justice,' as Blackstone has it, is not instantly suppressed and punished, demoralization of the court's authority will follow. Punishment without issue or trial was so contrary to the usual and ordinarily indispensable hearing before judgment constituting due process that the assumption that the court saw everything that went on in open court was required to justify the exception; but the need for immediate penal vindication of the dignity of the court created it.\n When the contempt is not in open court, however, there is no such right or reason in dispensing with the necessity of charges and the opportunity of the accused to present his defense by witnesses and argument. The exact form of the procedure in the prosecution of such contempts is not important. The court, in Randall v. Brigham, 7 Wall. 523, 540 (19 L. Ed. 285), in speaking of what was necessary in proceedings against an attorney at law for malpractice, said:\n'All that is requisite to their validity is that, when not taken for matters occurring in open court, in the presence of the judges, notice should be given to the attorney of the charges made and opportunity afforded him for explanation and defence. The manner in which the proceeding shall be conducted, so that it be without oppression or unfairness, is a matter of judicial regulation.' \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 537]\n\u00a0\n The court in Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S. Ct. 699, applied this rule to proceedings for contempt.\n\n Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed. See Hollingsworth v. Duane, 12 Fed. Cas. 359, 360; In re Stewart, 118 La. 827, 43 So. 455; Ex parte Clark, 208 Mo. 121, 106 S. W. 990, 15 L. R. A. (N. S.) 389.\n The proceeding in this case was not conducted in accordance with the foregoing principles. We have set out at great length in the statement which precedes this opinion the substance of what took place before, at, and after the sentence. The first step by the court was an order of attachment and the arrest of the petitioner. It is not shown that the writ of attachment contained a copy of the order of the court, and we are not advised that the petitioner had an exact idea of the purport of the charges until the order was read. In such a case, and after so long a delay, it would seem to have been proper practice, as laid down by Blackstone (4 Commentaries, 286), to issue a rule to show cause. The rule should have contained enough to inform the defendant of the nature of the contempt charged. See Hollingsworth v. Duane, 12 Fed. Cas. 367, 369. Without any ground shown for supposing that a rule would not have brought in the alleged contemnors, it was harsh under the circumstances to order the arrest.\n After the court elicited from the petitioner the admission that he had written the letter, the court refused him time to secure and consult counsel, prepare his defense, and call witnesses, and this, although the court itself \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 538]\n\u00a0\n had taken time to call in counsel as a friend of the court. The presence of the United States district attorney also was secured by the court on the ground that it was a criminal case.\n The court proceeded on the theory that the admission that the petitioner had written the letter foreclosed evidence or argument. In cases like this, where the intention with which acts of contempt have been committed must necessarily and properly have an important bearing on the degree of guilt and the penalty which should be imposed, the court cannot exclude evidence in mitigation. It is a proper part of the defense. There was a suggestion in one of the remarks of the petitioner to the court that, while he had dictated the letter, he had not read it carefully, and that he had trusted to the advice of his partner in sending it; but he was not given a chance to call witnesses or to make a full statement on this point. He was interrupted by the court, or the counsel of the court, in every attempted explanation. On the other hand, when the court came to pronounce sentence, it commented on the conduct of both the petitioner and his client in making scandalous charges in the pleadings against officials of the court, and charges of a corrupt conspiracy against the trustee and referee in bankruptcy, and of employing a detective to shadow jurymen while in charge of the marshal, and afterwards to detect bribery of them, in proof of which the court referred to a sworn statement of the detective in its hands, which had not been submitted to the petitioner or his client. When Walker questioned this, the court directed the marshal to prevent further interruption. It was quite clear that the court considered the facts thus announced as in aggravation of the contempt. Yet no opportunity had been given to the contemnors even to hear these new charges of the court, much less to meet or explain them before the sentence. We think the procedure pursued was unfair and oppressive to the petitioner. \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 539]\n\u00a0\n Another feature of this case seems to call for remark. The power of contempt which a judge must have and exercise in protecting the due and orderly administration of justice, and in maintaining the authority and dignity of the court, is most important and indispensable. But its exercise is a delicate one, and care is needed to avoid arbitrary or oppressive conclusions. This rule of caution is more mandatory where the contempt charged has in it the element of personal criticism or attack upon the judge. The judge must banish the slightest personal impulse to reprisal, but he should not bend backward, and injure the authority of the court by too great leniency. The substitution of another judge would avoid either tendency, but it is not always possible. Of course, where acts of contempt are palpably aggravated by a personal attack upon the judge, in order to drive the judge out of the case for ulterior reasons, the scheme should not be permitted to succeed. But attempts of this kind are rare. All of such cases, however, present difficult questions for the judge. All we can say upon the whole matter is that, where conditions do not make it impracticable, or where the delay may not injure public or private right, a judge, called upon to act in a case of contempt by personal attack upon him, may, without flinching from his duty, properly ask that one of his fellow judges take his place. Cornish v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 283, 285; Toledo Co. v. United States, 237 F. 986, 988, 150 C. C. A. 636.\n The case before us is one in which the issue between the judge and the parties had come to involve marked personal feeling that did not make for an impartial and calm judicial consideration and conclusion, as the statement of the proceedings abundantly shows. We think, therefore, that when this case again reaches the District Court, to which it must be remanded, the judge who imposed the sentence herein should invite the senior Circuit Judge of the circuit to assign another judge to sit in the second hearing of the charge against the petitioner. \n\n[267 U.S. 517, 540]\n\u00a0\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The next term of the court at Fort Worth would have been the second Monday in March (Judicial Code,  108 [Comp.

UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA(1925)\nNo. 671\nArgued: January 7, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., and James B. McDonough, of Ft. Smith, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. A. Glasgow, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for damages for the effect of an alleged conspiracy of the defendants unlawfully to restrain and prevent plaintiffs' interstate trade in coal in violation of the first and second sections of the federal Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8820, 8821). The charge is that the defendants in 1914, for the purpose of consummating the conspiracy, destroyed valuable mining properties of the plaintiffs. Treble damages and an attorney's fee are asked under the seventh section of the act. The suit was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. The plaintiffs are the Bache-Denman Coal Company and eight other corporations, in each of which the first named owns a controlling amount of stock. One of them is the Coronado Company, which gives the case its name. The corporations were correlated in organization and in the physical location of their mines. They had been operated for some years as a unit in the Prairie Creek Valley in Sebastian county, Ark. Immediately after the destruction of the property, the District Court in a proper proceeding appointed receivers for the mines, and they or their successors are also parties to this suit. The original complaint \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n was filed in September, 1914. It was demurred to, and the demurrer sustained. On error in the Court of Appeals the ruling was reversed. Dowd v. United Mine Workers of America, 235 F. 1, 148 C. C. A. 495. The case then came on for trial on the third amended complaint and the answers of the defendants. The trial resulted in a verdict of $200,000 for the plaintiffs, which was trebled by the court, and a counsel fee of $25,000 and interest to and date of the judgment were added. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment as to interest, but in other respects affirmed it. United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado, 258 F. 829, 169 C. C. A. 549. On error to this court under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218), the judgment of both courts was reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. The opinion is reported in \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762. The new trial in October, 1923, resulted in a directed verdict and judgment for the defendants, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case is here on error for a second time.\n In our previous opinion we held that the International Union, known as the United Mine Workers of America, the union known as United Mine Workers, District No. 21, and the subordinate local unions which were made defendants, were, though unincorporated associations, subject to suit under the Anti-Trust Act, but that there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury to show participation by the International Union in the conspiracy and the wrongs done. We found evidence tending to show that District No. 21 and other defendants were engaged in the conspiracy and the destruction of the property, but not enough to shown an intentional restraint of interstate trade and a violation of the Anti-Trust Act. The plaintiffs contend that they have now supplied the links lacking at the first trial against each of the principal defendants.\n The Bache-Denman mines lie near the west line of Arkansas, next to Oklahoma. In all the Arkansas mines, \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n except a small one, union miners were engaged. The towns of the neighborhood-Hartford, Huntington, Midland, Frogtown, and others-were peopled by them. District No. 21 was a regional organization of the United Mine Workers which included Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. Mr. Bache as manager of the plaintiff's mines had been operating them for a number of years with union labor and under a District No. 21 contract and scale of wages, which did not expire until July 1, 1914. In March of that year he determined to run his mines thereafter on a nonunion or open basis, and notified Pete Stewart, the president of the District No. 21, that he intended to do so. He shut down his mines and prepared to open them on an open shop basis on April 6th. He anticipated trouble. He employed three guards from the Burns Detective Agency and a number of others to aid him. He bought a number of Winchester rifles and ammunition, and surrounded his principal mining plant at Prairie Creek, No. 4, with cables strung on posts. He had notices prepared and sent to his employees who occupied the company's houses that they should vacate unless they remained in his employ. He sent out for nonunion men and had gathered some 30 or more for the day fixed for the opening. The people in all that part of the country were urged by the members of the local unions to come to a meeting at the schoolhouse, a short distance from the Prairie Creek mine, for a public protest. The meeting appointed a committee to visit the superintendent and insist that the mine remain a union mine. The guards, directed not to use their guns save to defend their own lives, were at the mercy of the union miners, who assaulted them, took their guns away, and injured a number of them. The employees deserted the mine which filled with water upon the stopping of the pumps. One of the crowd went up to the top of the coal tipple and planted a flag on which was the legend, 'This is a union man's country.' \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bache obtained from the federal District Court an injunction against the union miners and others taking part in this lawless violence, including among them the president of No. 21, Pete Stewart, and Holt, its secretary-treasurer. Bache then prepared to resume mining. The work progressed under the protection of United States deputy marshals. Meanwhile nonunion miners and other employees were brought in from out of the state. The United States marshals were after some weeks withdrawn from the property and only private guards were retained. Meanwhile the water had been pumped out and the mining and shipping of coal were about to begin. A large force of union miners of the local unions and of District No. 21, and their sympathizers, armed themselves with rifles and other guns furnished and paid for by the District No. 21 Organization, and before day on July 17th began an attack upon the men whom Bache had brought together, and proceeded to destroy the property and equipment. It was a battle, in which two of the employees of the mine, after capture, were deliberately murdered, and not only gunfire and bullets but also dynamite and the torch were used to destroy all the property on the premises of the Prairie Creek Mine and of three of the other mines of the plaintiffs.\n First. Is there any evidence in the present record tending to show that the International Union of the United Mine Workers participated?\n Under article 16 of the constitution of the International Union, it is provided, section 1:\n'No district shall be permitted to engage in a strike involving all or a major portion of its members, without the sanction of an International Convention or the International Executive Board.'\n\n Section 2:\n'Districts may order local strikes within their respective districts on their own responsibility, but where local \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n strikes are to be financed by the International Union, they must be sanctioned by the International Executive Board.'\n\n It does not appear that the International Convention or Executive Board ever authorized this strike or took any part in the preparation for it or in its maintenance, or that they ratified it by paying any of the expenses. It came within the definition of a local strike in the constitutions of both the national and district organizations. The district organization made the preparations and paid the bills. It was sought on both trials to bring the International in by proving that the president of the national body, John P. White, was in Kansas City and heard of the trouble which had taken place on April 6 at Prairie Creek, and that he reported it to the International Board; and further that in May he made a long speech at a special convention of District No. 21, held at Ft. Smith, Ark., for the trial of one of its officers for corruption, in which he referred with earnest approval to the great international union strikes in Colorado any West Virginia, but made no specific allusion to the Prairie Creek difficulty. It was also argued that communications from outsiders and editorials published in the United Mine Workers' journals giving an account of the occurrence at Prairie Creek, and representing that the troubles were due to the aggression of the armed guards, and that the action of the union men was justified in defense of their homes, expressed such sympathy with the union men as to constitute a ratification by the International Union because the United Mine Workers' journal was an authorized publication of the union.\n There were introduced at both trials long accounts of speeches and votes at national conventions of the International Union and meetings between union operators and representatives of the International Union from 1898 to 1914, revealing a constant effort on the part of the \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n operators to force wages down to meet the competition of nonunion mines, accompanied by assurances by the union representatives that they would do everything to unionize the competing nonunion mines and enable the union mine operators to maintain the scale insisted on.\n We though at the first hearing, and we think now, that none of this evidence tends to establish the participation of the International in the Prairie Creek strike and disturbances.\n The new evidence adduced for the purpose is chiefly the testimony of one James K. McNamara. He was the secretary of Local Union No. 1526 at Hartford and check weighman at Mine No. 4 of the Central Coal & Coke Company, a union mine which was a competitor of the Bache-Denman mines and of larger capacity and business. McNamara seems to have been the filed leader of the union forces at the battle of July 17, 1914. He was tried with others and convicted for violation of the injunction as a conspiracy to defeat the process of the federal court, and was confined in the Leavenworth penitentiary. His testimony at the second trial was that in May, 1914, between the riot of April and the July battle, he went to Ft. Smith to see Pete Stewart, the president of District No. 21, who was ill; that Stewart told him that he had been to Kansas City and had a talk with White, the International president, and that they had arranged a plan there to prevent Bache from producing coal. He said that White wished to see McNamara. Thereafter White came to Ft. Smith to participate in the trial of the secretary of No. 21, already mentioned, between the 18th and 23d of May. McNamara said he went to Ft. Smith and met one Jim Slankard, who was a town marshal in Hartford, Sebastian county, and a very active promoter of union violence in this case, that Slankard told him that White wished to see him at the hotel, that he and Slankard went to White's room, that \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n White said, 'How is things at Prairie Creek?' that the witness said, 'Things are a little watery in Prairie Creek No. 4, yet,' referring to the pumping of the water out of the mine which was going on, to which White replied, 'Yes, I have been informed on that,' and said, 'Stewart told me that they cannot get enough men to operate the mine.' Then he continued:\n'If they do that, we must prevent the coal from getting into the market.\n\n'Q. Did he say why? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Tell it. A. He said, 'Because if Bache coal, scab dug coal, got into the market it would only be a matter of time until every union operator in that country would have to close down his mine, or scab it, because the union operators could not meet Bache competition.'\n\n'Q. Did he say anything more after that? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. What did he say? A. He said, 'When you go back to Hartford,' he said, 'I want you to tell the men that I have told you, but don't tell them I have told you.'\n\n'Q. Did he say why not? A. Yes, sir; he said he did not want the National Organization mixed up in this case; he said, 'So far you have handled it, this part, and we have West Virginia and Colorado on our hands, and we cannot bear any more fights.'\n\n'Q. After that, did you go up and down the valley, as he said? A. I went back to Hartford and just quietly told the men what he said.\n\n'Q. How many of them did you tell, in a general way? A. I don't remeber; I told practically everybody, I suppose.\n\n'Q. What did you tell them? A. I told them what White told me.\n\n'Q. Tell them the reasons, as he had given them to you? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And in pursuance of that, was that doctrine trine told all over the valley? A. Yes, sir. I told the men we wouldn't do anything until Bache begun producing coal. ... \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. Now did you know what Pete Stewart did on Monday following that convention about going around the filed? A. He came to Hartford and made a speech. He said he would furnish guns and ammunition to all these men and their families in that valley, and if it was necessary he would sacrifice his own life to prevent Bache getting coal out there.'\n\n McNamara further testified that he saw between 300 and 400 guns in boxes at Hartford, and that part of them were distributed to the union miners and part returned to the secretary of District No. 21 at McAlester, Okl. It was an avowed grievance of McNamara that he had not been paid sufficient money for the sacrifices he had made to the union cause. He said he had received $250 after the battle of July 17 from Stewart of District No. 21 to enable him to escape and avoid arrest, and something more later, but nothing from White or the International. He volunteered in his cross-examinaton the statement that White said to him at the interview:\n'Now you boys will not lose a day and your expenses will be paid for every day you are in this trouble.'\n\n He was led by other questions to add that the trouble referred to by White was his suffering in the penitentiary. When it was called to his attention that his conversation with White in May, 1914, was before he had gone to the penitentiary, he found it necessary to qualify his statement, and in answer to the question: 'Did you have any arrangements to get money from him then?' said:\n'It was generally understood that the National Organization was going to pay us for the time we lost, ... and I thought the only man to go to would be White to get it, because he was the National president.'\n\n And so, he said, two years after he had finished his term at the penitentiary, he met White at Hartford and asked him, 'When will I get my money that I was promised for this work?' \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n to which White replied: 'I will take it up with the Board as soon as I can.' But he said he never got any money. We do not regard this as evidence that he was promised or received money from the International either to induce or reward his unlawful acts.\n Giving the fullest credence to all that McNamara says, it is clear that White did not intend by what he did to make the Prairie Creek difficulty a national affair. The International Board had not approved as the constitution required that they should do in order to make it so. It is quite true that White himself personally can be held as a defendant, if McNamara's evidence is to be believed, for urging and abetting the destruction of the plaintiff's property; but according to McNamara's testimony, repeated by him several times, White was particular to insist that he did not wish to be regarded as acting for the International in the matter or to involve it in the Prairie Creek difficulties. In our previous opinion we held that a trades union, organized as effectively as this United Mine Workers' organization was, might be held liable, and all its funds raised for the purpose of strikes might be levied upon to pay damages suffered through illegal methods in carrying them on; but certainly it must be clearly shown in order to impose such a liability on an association of 450,000 men that what was done was done by their agents in accordance with their fundamental agreement of association.\n As we said in our previous opinion (\n259 \nU.S. 395\n, 42 S. Ct. 577, 27 A. L. R. 762):\n'A corporation is responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the contention that torts are ultra vires of the corporation. But it must be shown that it is in the business of the corporation. Surely no stricter rule can be enforced against an unincorporated organization like this. Here it is not a question of contract or of holding out an appearance of authority on which some \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n third person acts. It is a mere question of actual agency which the constitutions of the two bodies settle conclusively.'\n\n Again:\n'But it is said that the District was doing the work of the International and carrying out its policies and this circumstance makes the former an agent. We cannot agree to this in the face of the specific stipulation between them that in such a case unless the International expressly assumed responsibility, the District must meet it alone.'\n\n The action of the trial court in its direction of a verdict for the defendant, the International Union, must be affirmed.\n Second. The tendency of the evidence to show that District No. 21 through its authorized leaders and agents and certain of its subordinate local unions organized and carried through the two attacks of April 6th and July 17th is so clear that it does not need further discussion. The only issue is whether the outrages, destruction, and crimes committed were intentionally directed toward a restraint of interstate commerce. On the first trial we held that the evidence did not show this. The circumstances seemed amply to supply a different and a merely local motive for the conspiracy. The hostility of the head of District No. 21 and that of his men seemed sufficiently aroused by the coming of nonunion men into that local community, by Mr. Bache's alleged breach of his contract with District No. 21 in employing nonunion men three months before it expired, by his charged evasion of it through a manipulation of his numerous corporations, by his advertised anticipation of trespass and violence in his warning notices, in his inclosing his mining premises with a cable, and in stationing guards with guns to defend them. These preparations in the heart of a territory that had been completely unionized for years were likely to stir a bitterness of spirit in the neighborhood. Bache \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n had himself foreseen such a spirit when he took part in the formulation of a letter to his stockholders for his superintendent to sign, in which it was said:\n'To do this means a bitter fight, but in my opinion it can be accomplished by proper organization.'\n\n He testified that he was entering into a matter he knew was perilous and dangerous to his companies. In view of these circumstances, we said in the previous opinion:\n'Nothing of this is recited to justify in the slightest the lawlessness and outrages committed, but only to point out that as it was a local strike within the meaning of the International and District constitutions, so it was in fact a local strike, local in its origin and motive, local in its waging, and local in its felonious and murderous ending.'\n\n Were we concerned only with the riot of April 6th, we should reach the same conclusion now; but at the second trial plaintiffs were able to present a large amount of new evidence as to the attitude and purpose of the leaders and members of District No. 21, shown especially in the interval between the riot of April 6th and the destruction of the mine property on July 17th following. This is attributed by counsel for the plaintiffs to the fact that the new witnesses had moved away from Sebastian county, Ark., and were freed from local restraint and to grievances of former union sympathizers and participants who thought themselves not sufficiently appreciated.\n Part of the new evidence was an extract from the convention proceedings of District No. 21 at Ft. Smith, Ark., in February, 1914, in which the delegates discussed the difficulties presented in their maintenance of the union scale in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas because of the keen competition from the nonunion fields of Southern Colorado and the nonunion fields of the South in Alabama and Tennessee. Stewart, the president, \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 307]\n\u00a0\n caned attention to a new field in Oklahoma which he said would be a great competitor of union coal fields, and that District No. 21 would be forced to call a strike to bring in to line certain operators in that section, and in the event that they did so the District would fight such a conflict to the bitter end regardless of cost. They also discussed a proposal to reduce the scale at the union mines at McCurtain, Okl., which Stewart advocated, in order that the McCurtain operators might be put on a proper competitive basis in interstate markets with other operators. Several of the delegates at this convention took part in the riot of April 6th and the battle of July 17th following.\n A new witness was one Hanraty, who was for seven years president of District No. 21, then a state mine inspector for three years, and then national organizer from 1912 to 1914, and president of District No. 21 again in 1915, but subsequently separated from the Union. He testified that he had been closely associated as president of the District with Stewart as a member of the District executive board. He had been frequently in close conference with most of the leading men who had taken part in the violence at Prairie Creek. He said that he made speeches all through District No. 21 and did not remember a speech in which he did not mention the danger from nonunion coal in taking the markets of union coal and forcing a nonunion scale, and that it was a constant subject of discussion among the officers and members.\n A leading witness among many others on this subject was a Dr. H. P. Routh, who practiced medicine at Hartford in 1914, and who lives now at Tulsa, Okl. He said he was living at the Davis Hotel in Hartford in May, 1914, when the Executive Board of District No. 21 came down there for a meeting, and he heard a great deal of the conversation between the board members as to the \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 308]\n\u00a0\n effect of this threatened nonunion Bache-Denman operation. The conclusion they reached was that its success would effect so injuriously the trade of the Central Coal & Coke Company in shipping and selling coal in the neighboring states, that this company, the largest coal producer in that section, would have to become nonunion. He talked specifically to several members of the Board and of the union who, the evidence shows, were shown to be actively engaged in the battle of July 17th.\n In addition to this, the testimony of McNamara, already discussed, while ineffective to establish the complicity of the International Union with this conspiracy, contains much, if credited, from which the jury could reasonably infer that the purpose of the union miners in District No. 21 and the local unions engaged in the plan was to destroy the power of the owners and lessees of the Bache-Denman mines to send their output into interstate commerce to compete with that of union mines in Oklahoma, in Kansas, in Lousiana markets, and elsewhere. It appeared that 80 per cent. of all the product of the mines in Sebastian county went into other states.\n New and more elaborate evidence was also introduced in the second trial as to the capacity of the Bache-Denman mines under the open shop. In our previous opinion we declined to hold that the mere elimination from interstate trade of 5,000 tons a week, which we took to be the practical limit of capacity of the plaintiffs, was significant in the total tonnage of the country or state, or that its stoppage furnished a basis of itself for inferring a palpable and intentional restraint of interstate trade with which the defendants could be charged even though coal could be produced at a reduced cost under nonunion conditions. The amount we assumed was based on the averments of the third amended bill in which the normal gross income from the four mines of the plaintiffs used by them, and which were destroyed, was alleged to be in good times before \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 309]\n\u00a0\n the trouble something more than $465,000 a year, At the price at which coal usually sold at the mine, this would make the output 5,000 tons a week. In a petition for a rehearing plaintiffs urged upon us that this was an error and that the potential capacity of all the mines owned and leased by the Bache-Denman Company in that region, nine in number, was 5,000 tons a day rather than 5,000 tons a week. In the view we took of the evidence then before us, we had only the isolated circumstance of the reduction in shipment of the normal product of the four mines destroyed, without other evidence to show an actual intent and plan on the part of the defendants thereby to restrain interstate commerce. Whatever error therefore might have been made in stating the capacity of all the mines of the plaintiffs could not affect our conclusion, and the rehearing was denied. In the second trial, however, the total possible capacity not only of the destroyed mines but of the other unworked mines of plaintiff became more important, in view of the direct testimony as to the moving purpose of District No. 21 to restrain and prevent plaintiffs' competition. The possible total to which their production might be brought was testified to by a number of new expert witnesses who were familiar with the mines and the business of mining and selling coal in the markets of the neighboring states. The conclusion of some of these witnesses was that with the union restrictions removed and a regular demand for the coal, the capacity of all the mines, owned and leased by the plaintiffs, those destroyed and those uninjured, could have been increased to substantially more than 5, 000 tons a day. Such conclusion was possibly subject to criticism as exaggerated and speculative, and dependent on conditions probably not realizable, but it was all relevant evidence for the jury to consider and weigh as a circumstance with the rest of the new testimony in proof of intent of the leaders of District No. 21 to prevent shipments to neighboring states \n\n[268 U.S. 295, 310]\n\u00a0\n of such an amount of nonunion coal at nonunion cost. There was also new evidence tending to show the knowledge by Hanraty, Stewart, and other leaders of District No. 21 of the character of plaintiffs' mines and their capacity.\n The mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture or production is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 408\n, 409 S., 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A. L. R. 762; United Leather Workers v. Herkert, \n265 \nU.S. 457, 471\n, 44 S. Ct. 623, 33 A. L. R. 566; Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64\n, 45 S. Ct. 403, decided April 13, 1925. We think there was substantial evidence at the second trial in this case tending to show that the purpose of the destruction of the mines was to stop the production of nonunion coal and prevent its shipment to markets of other states than Arkansas, where it would by competition tend to reduce the price of the commodity and affect injuriously the maintenance of wages for union labor in competing mines, and that the direction by the District Judge to return a verdict for the defendants other than the International Union was erroneous.\n We affirm the judgment of the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of the International Union of United Mine Workers of America, and reverse that in favor of District No. 21 and the other local unions and the individual defendants and remand the cause as to them for a new trial.\n Affirmed in part, and reversed in part. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. ALEXANDER(1925)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. F. Collins, of El Reno, Okl., and T. P. Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Fred E. Suits, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cattle shipped during federal control over the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific System from stations in New Mexico, through Texas to Oklahoma City, were negligently injured in transit. To recover the damages suffered this suit was brought in a state court of Oklahoma against James C. Davis, as Agent designated by the President, pursuant to section 206(a) of Transportation Act February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc). The injury was inflicted partly in New Mexico, partly in Texas, and partly in Oklahoma. The main controversy was whether plaintiffs could recover for the injury suffered in Texas. The jury returned a verdict for the entire damages. Judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the \n\n[269 U.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n state. 93 Okl. 159, 220 P. 358. A petition for a writ of certiorari was granted under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1214). \n265 \nU.S. 577\n, 44 S. Ct. 634\n\n\n The lines of the Rock Island in Texas were owned by a subsidiary-the Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railway Company, a Texas corporation. The petition described Davis as Agent, United States Railroad Administration, in charge of Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad and Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railroad. In the trial court it was assumed that effective service of the summons pursuant to section 206(b) was made only upon Davis as Agent in charge of the Pacific. There the shippers sought to recover against him as such on the ground that the transportation service undertaken was for the system; that, under federal control as before, the Pacific was the dominant carrier and operated, either alone or jointly with the Gulf, the whole system including the Gulf lines; and that recovery for all damages suffered could, therefore, be had against Davis as Agent in charge of the Pacific. The defendant insisted that the Director General had operated the Pacific and the Gulf, not as parts of a single system, but as individual and distinct entities. The shippers introduced substantial evidence in support of their allegations. The case was submitted to the jury under instructions which made it clear that the verdict must be limited to the damage suffered on lines owned by the Pacific, unless the jury should find that the Gulf lines were being operated with the other Rock Island lines as part of a single system.\n To these instructions exceptions were duly taken, but the Supreme Court of Oklahoma deemed it unnecessary to pass upon their correctness. It affirmed the judgment on the ground that the Director General operated all the railroads of which the President took control as a single national system, not as separate companies or systems; that the Director General was liable in damages for \n\n[269 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n negligent operation regardless of the relation of the different lines to one another; and that under section 206(b) service of process on the service agent for any railroad gave jurisdiction over the Agent of the President in respect to all railroads under federal control in the operation of which the damages complained of resulted. Its opinion was delivered November 6, 1923. Later this court held, in Davis v. Donovan, \n265 \nU.S. 257\n, 44 S. Ct. 513, that under section 10 of the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j) and General Order 50-A the Director General was not suable generally as the operator of all the railroads, but only with reference to the particular transportation system or carrier out of whose operations the liability in question arose. The rule declared in the Donovan Case has been applied in suits brought, under Transportation Act 1920 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4, et seq.), against the Agent of the President on causes of action arising during federal control. Manbar Coal Co. v. Davis (C. C. A.) 297 F. 24. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma reached the same conclusion in Davis, Federal Agent, v. Benson, 105 Okl. 41, 231 P. 536, overruling its decision in the case at bar.\n While the ground on which the Supreme Court of Oklahoma rested its decision was thus unsound, the judgment of affirmance was right. Where one railroad company actually controls another and operates both as a single system, the dominant company will be liable for injuries due to the negligence of the subsidiary company.

GEORGE B NEWTON COAL CO(1925)\nNo. 709\nArgued: January 12, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Clarke Mason, of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Allen S. Olmsted, 2d, of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error. \n\n[267 U.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes present the same points of law and were heard together both here and below. No disputed question of fact remains. In 1919 defendant in error, a \n\n[267 U.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania corporation, doing business at Philadelphia, contracted with producers for large quantities of bituminous coal, f. o. b. the mines, subject to the regulations of the United States Fuel Administration. During January and February, 1920, while thirty-three cars of coal consigned to the corporation under these contracts were moving over the Philadelphia & Reading Railway, the Director General of Railroads took possession of them and used the fuel for operating trains on that line. Eighty cars loaded with the same character of coal and moving on the Pennsylvania Railroad were similarly treated. The claim is that the Director General took this action under lawful rules and orders of the President, acting through the Fuel Administrator and pursuant to the Lever Act, approved August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279, 284 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8e et seq.). The producers of the coal were paid the prices specified in the contracts of purchase, as required by the Fuel Administrator; and it is now maintained that nothing more can be demanded by the owner. The owner's claim is for the difference between the amount received by producers and the market value of the coal- approximately $1.44 per ton.\n The Lever Act conferred upon the President certain powers to regulate the prices and distribution of fuel, to be exercised for the efficient prosecution of the war. August 23, 1917, he delegated these powers to a Fuel Administrator, who freely used them during the continuation of hostilities. Shortly after the armistice substantially all such regulations were suspended and the Administrator ceased to function; but his appointment was not canceled or revoked.\n On October 30, 1919, the President undertook to restore former orders and to employ the Fuel Administrator, as occasion might arise, to change or make regulations relative to the sale, shipment and apportionment of bituminous coal as the latter might think necessary. The next \n\n[267 U.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n day the Administrator delegated to the Director General of Railroads the power to divert coal upon the railroads as might seem 'necessary in the present emergency to provide for the requirements of the country.' March 19, 1920, the President suspended all fuel regulations.\n Seeking to recover the difference between the amounts paid to the shipper-the purchase price-and the market value of the coal, defendant in error commenced these proceedings (June, 1921), in a state court at Philadelphia, against the Agent appointed by the President under the Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461,  206a (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4cc). Judgments went for it and were affirmed by the Supreme Court. Newton Coal Co. v. Davis, 281 Pa. 74, 126 A. 192. The latter court held: That the war with Germany had ceased prior to October 30, 1919, and the purpose of the President's order then issued was to meet an emergency incident to the miners' strike-not to provide for the efficient prosecution of the war. Also that seizure and use of the coal by the Director General rendered the United States liable for just compensation, measured by market value. And, further, that the Director General was not an innocent third person to whom property has been delivered by the sovereign for the public welfare, but an agency of the United States for operating the railroads, and, under the Transportation Act 1920, plaintiff in error might be sued upon claims arising therefrom.\n The plaintiff in error now insists: That the order of October 30, 1919, and the regulations issued by the Fuel Administrator and the Director General of Railroads acting thereunder, were authorized by the Lever Act. That by diverting the coal to himself the Director General incurred no obligation except to pay the amounts due the shippers under the sale contracts-the compensation fixed by the orders. That the act of the Director General in diverting the coal to himself and its use on the railroads imposed no liability for which an action can be maintained \n\n[267 U.S. 292, 301]\n\u00a0\n against the Agent provided for by the Transportation Act.\n From the facts stated it appears, plainly enough, that one hundred and thirteen cars of coal cars of coal belonging to defendant in error were seized by the United States while upon the lines of carriers under their control and thereafter appropriated and used in the operation of such roads. The taking was for a public use. The incantation pronounced at the time is not of controlling importance; our primary concern is with the accomplishment. As announced in United States v. New River Collieries Co., \n262 \nU.S. 341, 343\n, 344 S., 43 S. Ct. 566, 567 (67 L. Ed. 1014) 'where private property is taken for public use, and there is a market price prevailing at the time and place of the taking, that price is just compensation' to which the owner is entitled. Also, 'the ascertainment of compensation is a judicial function, and no power exists in any other department of the government to declare what the compensation shall be or to prescribe any binding rule in that regard.'\n Transportation Act 1920,  206a:\n'Actions at law, suits in equity and proceedings in admiralty, based on causes of action arising out of the possession, use or operation by the President of the railroad or system of transportation of any carrier (under the provisions of the Federal Control Act, or of the Act of August 29, 1916) of such character as prior to federal control could have been brought against such carrier, may, after the termination of federal control, be brought against an agent designated by the President for such purpose, which agent shall be designated by the President within thirty days after the passage of this act. Such actions, suits, or proceedings may, within the periods of limitation now prescribed by state or federal statutes but not later than two years from the date of the passage of this act, be brought in any court which but for federal control would have had jurisdiction of the cause of action had it arisen against such carrier.' \n\n[267 U.S. 292, 302]\n\u00a0\n If the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company or the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, while operating its own line, had seized and used the coal as the United States did while they operated those roads, the jurisdiction of the State court of actions to recover damages or compensation would be clear. And so, under the Transportation Act, that court properly entertained the proceeding now before us.\n\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. JOHN L.

Hughes, Jr., of Norfolk, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. M. Bain, of Norfolk, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n There is here for review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia which affirmed a judgment \n\n[269 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n of the court of law and chancery against petitioner for $1,046.88. 138 Va. 377, 122 S. E. 113. June 24, 1918, at New Bern, N. C., respondent delivered to petitioner, then operating the Norfolk Southern Railroad, a carload of scrap iron for transportation over that line and connecting lines to Clarksburg, W. Va. Petitioner issued a bill of lading, consigning the shipment to the order of respondent, 'notify George Yampolsky at Clarksburg.' It contained a clause requiring surrender of the bill of lading properly indorsed before delivery of the property, and provided that:\n'Claims for loss, damage or delay must be made in writing to the carrier ... within six months after delivery of the property, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within six months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless claims are so made the carrier shall not be liable.'\n\n The shipment arrived at Clarksburg, July 15, 1918, and on that day was delivered to Yampolsky without surrender of the bill of lading and without the knowledge of the respondent, who at all times has been its lawful holder. No claim was made by respondent until March 5, 1920\n\n\n The Act of Congress of March 4, 1915 (known as the first Cummins Amendment), c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196, 1197 (Comp. St.  8604a), amending section 20 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, requires a common carrier, receiving property for transportation in interstate commerce, to issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and makes it liable to the holder for any loss, damage, or injury to such property, and contains these provisos:\n'Provided further, that it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days and for the filing of claims for a shorter period than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in \n\n[269 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.'\n\n There is presented the question whether this case is one in which the right of recovery may be made to depend upon the making of claim as required by the bill of lading. The provisos in section 20 have been recently considered by this court in Barrett v. Van Pelt, \n268 \nU.S. 85\n, 45 S. Ct. 437. It was there pointed out that the purpose of the second proviso is to take some cases out of the general rule declared by the first proviso. And, in view of the inapt language and defective structure of the second, it was held that the word 'damaged' should be read 'damage,' and that the comma after 'unloaded' should be eliminated. It was also held that 'carelessness or negligence' is an element in each case of loss, damage, or injury there named. The judgment now before us was given prior to that decision. The state court held that the damage resulting to respondent from misdelivery occurred while the shipment was 'in transit,' within the meaning of the proviso, and that therefore the provision of the bill of lading requiring claim to be made was invalid. It said that 'in transit' means at any time after the property has been received by the initial carrier and before delivery in accordance with the contract of carriage.\n But that view cannot be sustained. The loss was due solely to misdelivery; that is 'a failure to make delivery' in accordance with the bill of lading. Georgia, Fla. & Ala. Ry. v. Blish Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 195\n, 36 S. Ct. 541. As construed by this court, the second proviso embraces three classes: (1) Loss, damage, or injury due to delay; ( 2) damage while being loaded or unloaded; (3) damage in transit. Clearly, misdelivery is not in the first or second class. And, unless it is in the third class, the proviso does not apply. The context shows that the phrase 'in transit' was not intended to have the broad meaning attributed to it by the \n\n[269 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n state court. In the proviso, claims on account count of damage 'while being loaded or unloaded' are separate and distinct from those for 'damage in transit.' The creation of the former class would be wholly unnecessary and inappropriate, if the latter is to be taken to include both classes. Loading precedes, and unloading follows, transit. In the ordinary and usual meaning of the word, 'transit' ends before delivery at destination. Misdelivery is not mentioned in the proviso; and the language used is inconsistent with and negatives any intention to include claims for damages on account of misdelivery in the class defined as 'damage in transit.'\n Respondent contends that under section 10 of the Bill of Lading Act, c. 415 (39 Stat. 538, 540 (Comp. St.  8604ee)), it was not necessary to comply with the requirement of the bill of lading. The point is without merit. That section provides:\n'Where a carrier delivers goods to one who is not lawfully entitled to the possession of them, the carrier shall be liable to any one having a right of property or possession in the goods. ...'\n\n The rule of liability so declared is not inconsistent with the second proviso in section 20, which relates merely to the enforcement of liability. The provisions of both acts are to be read together, and applied in harmony with the bill of lading. More than nineteen months elapsed before respondent made any claims. There is nothing in the statutory provisions relied on by respondent to excuse its failure to make claim within the time specified in the shipping contract.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. L.L. COHEN & CO.(1925)\nNo. 331\nArgued: April 21, 1925Decided: June 8, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Arthur W. Blackman, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Louis Swig, of Taunton, Mass., for defendant in error. \n\n[268 U.S. 638, 639]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error is brought to review a judgment in favor of Cohen & Co. entered in the Superior Court of Bristol County, Massachusetts, against James C. Davis, as Agent designated by the President under the Transportation Act, 1920.1 After a verdict had been rendered, but before entry of judgment, the case was reported by the Superior Court to the Supreme Judicial Court for instructions upon exceptions that had been reserved by both parties; and thereafter, in accordance with a rescript from the Supreme Judicial Court (247 Mass. 259, 142 N. E. 75), the judgment in question was entered in the Superior Court. Under the Massachusetts practice that was followed, the judgment is to be regarded as the final decision of the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had; and the writ of error was therefore properly directed to the Superior Court. McGuire v. Commonwealth of Mass., 3 Wall. 382, 386; and see Joslin Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668, 673\n, 43 S. Ct. 684\n\n\n A petition for certiorari has also been filed, but as the case is properly here on writ of error, that petition is denied.\n The sole question here presented is whether the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws, c. 231,  51, 138, authorizing amendments in any process, pleading, or proceeding at any time before final judgment, as construed and applied in this case, is invalid because of repugnancy to section 206 of the Transportation Act.\n The suit was brought by Cohen & Co., in January, 1920, against the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company, to recover for damages to a carload of scrap iron shipped over the railroad in 1918, when it was under Federal Control. While the Railroad Company was described \n\n[268 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n in the writ as a corporation 'operated and controlled by the United States Railroad Administration,' the writ was directed to, and served upon, the Railroad Company alone, and the declaration was filed against it alone; no effort being then made to sue the Director General. The Railroad Company appeared and filed an answer denying the allegations of the declaration.\n No further proceedings were had until September, 1922, when, on the ex parte motion of the plaintiff, the writ and declaration were amended by striking out the name of the Railroad Company, and substituting the name of James C. Davis, Agent, and the Director General of Railroads, as the party defendant. An order of notice was then served upon Davis, who appeared specially, and moved that such service be set aside and the action against him dismissed, on the grounds that the service was void and the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action against him, because the proceeding against him had not been instituted within the time prescribed by section 206 of the Transportation Act; and that any provisions of the Massachusetts laws purporting to authorize such proceeding were repugnant to the Transportation Act and void. This motion was denied, and Davis was required to answer. The case, in which, at every stage, he preserved his original objections, finally resulted in the judgment against him which it is now sought to review.\n Our conclusions may be briefly stated. The Railroad Company was not liable for the cause of action that had arisen during Federal Control; the sole liability being that of the Director General as the representative of the Government. Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 41 S. Ct. 593. The original suit against the Railroad Company was not a suit against the Director General, and the service of the original writ upon the Railroad Company did not bring him before the court. While originally, after the passage of the Federal Control Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  31153\/4 a-3115 3\/4p), it was sometimes \n\n[268 U.S. 638, 641]\n\u00a0\n thought that the Government might be held liable in a suit brought against the carrier, describing it as in the hands or possession of the Director General, all doubt as to how the suit should be brought was cleared away by the General Order of the Director General requiring that it should be brought against the Director General of Railroads, and not otherwise. Ault Case, supra, p. 561 (1921).2 And it is immaterial that, as admitted at bar, the service of the writ against the Railroad Company was made upon a clerk upon whom process against the Director General might have been served if the suit had been brought against him. 'The Federal Agent was not bound to take cognizance of an action against the railroad corporation, even though the service was on the same local station agent, and even though the complaint stated a cause of action for personal injuries sustained during government control.' Davis v. Chrisp, 159 Ark. 335, 343, 252 S. W. 606, 609.\n The Transportation Act, which passed in February, 1920, provided that the Federal Control should terminate on March 1, 1920. It further provided, in section 206(a), that suits and proceedings based on causes of action arising out of the possession, use and operation of a railroad under Federal Control, of such character as prior thereto could have been brought against the railroad company, might, after the termination of Federal Control, he brought against an Agent designated by the President for such purpose, 'but not later than two years from the date of the passage of this Act.' It also provided, in section 206(d), that actions of the character above described, pending at the termination of Federal Control, should not abate by reason of such termination, but might be prosecuted to \n\n[268 U.S. 638, 642]\n\u00a0\n final judgment, substituting the Agent designated by the President.\n At the termination of Federal Control there was no suit pending against the Director General to enforce the liability of the Government. The amendment of the writ and declaration in the suit against the Railroad Company, in October, 1922, by substituting the designated Agent as the defendant, was, in effect, the commencement of a new and independent proceeding to enforce this liability. Being commenced more than two years after the passage of the Transportation Act, it was repugnant to the provision of section 206(a) requiring such an action to be instituted not later than two years after the passage of the Act. This was the only consent the Government had given to being sued in such an action after the termination of Federal Control. Nor was this amendment authorized under section 206(d), which related solely to the substitution of the designated Agent as the defendant in a suit which had been previously brought against the Director General to enforce the liability of the Government, that is, merely authorized the substitution, in such a suit, of another Federal Agent for the one already before the court. It had no application to suits pending against a railroad company alone in which there was no Federal Agent for whom the designated Agent could be substituted, where the substitution of the designated Agent for the railroad company would work an entire change in the cause of action.\n These conclusions, we may add, are substantially the same as those of the State courts in Fahey v. Davis, 224 Mich. 371, 195 N. W. 46; Fischer v. Wabash Railway, 235 N. Y. 568, 139 N. E. 738; Currie v. Louisville & N. Railroad, 206 Ala. 402, 90 So. 313, 19 A. L. R. 675; Davis v. Chrisp, 159 Ark. 335, 252 S. W. 606; supra; and Davis v. Industrial Commission, 315 Ill. 341, 146 N. E. 569.\n It results that the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws under which the plaintiff was allowed to amend \n\n[268 U.S. 638, 643]\n\u00a0\n the writ and declaration so as to substitute the designated Agent as the defendant instead of the Railroad Company, as construed and applied in the present case, are void because of repugnancy to section 206 of the Transportation Act.\n The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456 (Comp.

MANRY(1925)\nNo. 147\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. T. M. Cunningham, Jr., for Savannah, Ga., and I. J. Hofmayer, of Albany, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert Douglas Feagin, of Macon, Ga., for respondent. \n\n[266 U.S. 401, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action by Manry for $50,000 against the Director General of Railroads for injuries sustained while engaged in assisting the train crew of the Central of Georgia Railroad. There was a verdict and judgment for $7,500. The judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals of the state. The Supreme Court of the state denied an application by the Director General for a certiorari. A petition for certiorari was granted by this court to review the judgment of the state Court of Appeals.\n The action was brought against Walker D. Hines, who at the time of the injury to Manry was Director General. He was subsequently succeeded by John B. Payne, and the latter by James C. Davis, the petitioner.\n Manry alleges as a ground of action that he was employed as baggageman on a train of the railroad running between Macon, Ga., and Montgomery, Ala., that it became his duty to assist the crew of the engine in coaling it, that he had stepped down from the coal chute onto the tender of the lomotive and was going back to the rear of the tender to climb down the ladder there situated so that he would be in a position at the proper time and place to adjust the couplers between the tender and the train, and to see that the coupling was duly and properly made. He alleges that, just as he was in the act of climbing over the rear of the tender, the engineer \n\n[266 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n put the locomotive in motion and before he (Manry) could turn on the ladder and securely brace and hold himself thereon, and before he could reach his final destination, which was the ladder on the side of the tank, he was, by a sudden, unusual, and unnecessary jerk, thrown to the ground and the locomotive backed over him; that while he was being dragged under the engine his legs came in contact with the wheels under the tender, and both of them were mashed off at, or just below, the knee.\n Negligence in operating the train is charged. Omission to equip the locomotive with the appliances required by law is also charged. To sustain the latter, it is alleged that at the rear of the tender there is a sheet- iron flange that extends up above the top thereof at an angle of about 60 degrees; the ladder on the rear of the tender does not come up and over the top of the flange, so that a person going from the top of the tender over the flange and down on the ladder has no handhold or other thing to securely hold himself, except to clamp his hands on the sheet-iron flange.\n It is contended there was a violation of section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act of April 14, 1910, 36 Stat. 298 (Comp. St.  8618), which provides that:\n'All cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards, and all cars having ladders shall also be equipped with secure handholds or grabirons on their roofs at the tops of such ladders.'\n\n This, it is said on behalf of respondents, could easily be complied with because:\n'The grabiron could easily be riveted on the top of the tender or on the sheet-iron flange at or near the top of the ladder, and this would insure the safety of employees when using the ladder while the train is in motion, or when being put in motion, as was being done in the case at bar, and would for all practical railroad \n\n[266 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n purposes be a compliance with the Safety Appliance Act.'\n\n The trial court charged the jury that the federal statute required that all cars having ladders should be equipped with grabirons, that this applied to a tender of a locomotive though it had no roof, and that if plaintiff's injury was due to the absence of a grabiron, he was entitled o a verdict. This was duly excepted to on the ground that the statute did not apply to ladders on a tender. The issue then was as to the effect of the statute.\n The word 'roofs' is the determining one. The occurring supposition is that it was used with intelligence and to accomplish its definition, its definition being the expression of its purpose, and that gets aid from the associates of the word in the section. We repeat the provision:\n'All cars ... having ladders shall also be equipped with secure handholds or grabirons on their roofs [italics ours] at the tops [ italics ours] of such ladders.'\n\n It is cars therefore which must have handholders or grabirons on their roofs at the tops of such ladders. The section distinguishes between roofs and tops, they do not designate the same thing. And the distinction is natural. This reasoning is not giving exaggeration to verbal differences-defeating purpose. It is made necessary to accomplish the legislative purpose.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission by section 3 of the act (Comp. St .  8619) is empowered to designate the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of the appliances provided for by section 2. The Commission's regulation as to ladders on tenders is as follows:\n'A suitable metal end or side ladder shall be applied to all tanks more than 48 inches in height measured from the top end of sill and securely fastened with bolts or rivets.'\n\n The omission to require a grabiron is a practical construction by the Commission-the tribunal to which the application of section 2 was entrusted and which would be solicitous to enforce \n\n[266 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n it-that it applies to cars with roofs and not to tenders, they having no roofs. While the view of the Commission is not conclusive with us, it is properly persuasive. We agree with it. The trial court therefore erred in its charge on the effect of the statute and as the verdict was general with no special finding upon which the verdict could stand without response to the statute, the case must go back for a new trial.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. PRINGLE(1925)\nNo. 1085\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jerome Michael and A. A. McLaughlin, both of Washington, D.

C., and Godfrey Goldmark, of New York City, for respondent Pringle.\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Ira Lloyd Letts, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Harvey B. Cox, of St. Louis, Mo., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first and second of these cases are claims for freight, storage and demurrage proved in bankruptcy proceedings by the federal agent, for which the agent asserts priority on the ground that such claims arising during federal control of the railroads in 1918 are debts due to the United States and are preferred by Rev. Stats.  3466 (Comp. St.  6372), and by the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,  64, amended by Acts of February 5, 1903, c. 487,  14, 32 Stat. 800, and June 15, 1906, c. 3333, 34 Stat. 267 (Comp. St.  9648). The third is a claim by the United States for amounts paid by the Postmaster General to the bankrupts for bills of exchange and checks drawn by the bankrupts and unpaid, together with protest fees, etc., as to which priority is asserted on the same grounds. The priorty was denied in the first two cases by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 1 F. (2d) 860; Id. 864, but it was allowed in the Second Circuit without any reported opinion, following an earlier case in that Circuit, In re Tidewater Coal Exchange (C. C. A.) 280 F. 648. \n\n[268 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n All the three cases depend upon the question whether the Government has a right to the priority it claims. If that is denied the additional inquiries that would be necessary before the federal agent could prevail in the railroad cases need not be gone into. Therefore we take up that first. It may be assumed that the priority must be found if at all in the Bankruptcy Act and in its supposed incorporation of Rev. Stats.  3466. That Act, as was said in Guaranty Title & Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., \n224 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 32 S. Ct. 457, 460, 'takes into consideration ... the whole range of indebtedness of the bankrupt, national, state and individual, and assigns the order of payment.' It was passed with the United States in the mind of Congress as is shown by the exception of debts due as taxes levied by the United States from the discharge in section 17, pt. 1 (Comp. St.  9601), the limitation on debts owing to the United States as a penalty in section 57j (section 9641), and the provisions as to priority in section 64 with which we are principally concerned. By a of that section-\n'The court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States ... in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors.'\n\n This taken by itself would seem to exclude other debts. But the section goes on in b to give priority in the order named to '(5) debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to priority,' and the Government argues that by section 1 (19) being section 9585, 'persons' shall include corporations and that the United States is a corporation and therefore within these words. Being within them, it is said, it is entitled to priority by a law of the United States, the well known Rev. Stat.  3466. It is said that no other person except the United States itself can be discovered who is given the right by its laws.\n We attach little value to this logical concatenation as against the direct effect of section 64, taken according to the \n\n[268 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n normal usages of speech. It is incredible that after the conspicuous mention of the United States in the first place at the beginning of the section and the grant of a limited priority, Congress should have intended to smuggle in a general preference by muffled words at the end. The States are mentioned in (5) before the United States, showing that their laws were primarily in mind. The United States seems added to avoid some possibly overlooked case. The ordinary dignities of speech would have led to the mention of the United States at the beginning of the clause, if within its purview. Elsewhere in cases of possible doubt when the Act means the United States it says the United States. We are of opinion that to extend the definition of 'person' here to the United States would be 'inconsistent with the context' and therefore is within the exception at the beginning of section 1. We are confirmed in our opinion by the fact that in earlier bankruptcy acts a priority was given to the United States in express terms, and that, for instance in the Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176,  28; 14 Stat. 517, 530, 'Fifth,' persons entitled to priority by the laws of the United States are mentioned when the United States could not have been meant having been fully secured by the same section, 'Second.' If it be legitimate to look at them (Schall v. Camors, \n251 \nU.S. 239, 250\n, 40 S. Ct. 135), the bills that were before Congress when the present law was passed contained the clause relied upon but showed by their context that they could not refer to the United States. There was a change of purpose from that of the earlier acts. Guaranty Title & Trust Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., \n224 U.S. 152\n, 158, et seq., 32 S. Ct. 457. Public opinion as to the peculiar rights and preferences due to the sovereign has changed. We agree with the view of this point taken by the Chief Justice and Justices Van Devanter and Clarke in United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Wood, \n258 U.S. 549\n, \n\n[268 U.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n 574, 42 S. Ct. 386, at a time when it was not necessary for the majority to speak upon it. The priority claimed by the United States is not given to it by the law.\n Decrees in 786 and 787 affirmed.\n Decree in 1085 reversed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND was absent and took no part in this decision. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEL POZO v.

Jones, both of Orlando, Fla., for appellants.\n Messrs. Henry C. Clark of Washington, D. C., and J. C. Cooper, of Jacksonville, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to quiet title to a confirmed land grant in Florida. The plaintiffs claim as heirs of the original grantee. The defendant claims under tax deeds, and also asserts that the plaintiffs are barred from maintaining the suit, first, by adverse possession on the part of the defendant and those through whom it claims for the period fixed in the local statute of limitation; and, secondly, by inexcusable laches.\n The grant was made in 1815 by Spain to Miguel Marcos, purported to cover 5,500 acres, and described the land in terms which made a survey essential to give precision to its boundaries. There was no survey during the Spanish dominion. After the cession to the United States, the heirs of the grantee presented a claim for confirmation to commissioners charged by Congress with the duty of examining and reporting on such claims. The commissioners found that the grant valid and recommended it, with others, to Congress for confirmation. The report stated that the grant was without any condition. 4 Am. State Papers (Duff Green Ed.) pp. 276, 283, 471.\n By the Act of May 23, 1828, c. 70, 4 Stat. 284. Congress acted on the commissioners' report by confirming this and other claims, with the general qualification that, if any claim exceeded the number of acres in a league square, the confirmation was limited to such acreage, to be located by the claimants, within the original grant. That and other acts contemplated that the claims should be surveyed by way of precisely defining their boundaries and of con- \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n necting them with the public land surveys. Because of delay in making the surveys, possibly resulting from inaction on the part of claimants, Congress, by the Act of June 28, 1848, c. 83, 9 Stat. 242, directed that the work proceed as soon as practicable. Early in 1851 this claim was surveyed under the direction of the Surveyor General, and on June 20 of that year the survey received the approval of that officer. As surveyed the claim contained 5,486.46 acres. \n1\n In 1889 the grantee's heirs applied for a patent for the claim as surveyed. The application was denied by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on the mistaken theory that the claim as surveyed was more than a league square, and therefore more than was confirmed by the act of 1828. On an appeal from that ruling the Secretary of the Interior recognized that a league square, in the sense of the confirmatory act, comprised 6,002.50 acres, and directed that a patent issue for the claim 'in accordance with the survey.' 18 Land Dec. 64. In 1895 a patent was issued under that direction.\n The tax deeds under which the defendant claims were issued-the earliest in 1852 and others before 1872. The one of 1852 may be put out of view. The plaintiffs say in their bill that the others 'are fair upon their face,' but otherwise invalid. The bill contains a like statement respecting the mesne conveyances whereby the defendant succeeded to the tax title.\n This suit by the heirs was begun in 1907. The present appeal is the second one to this court.\n Originally the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the title was in the United States, and the land not taxable, until the issue of the patent, and therefore that the tax deeds, all of which preceded the patent, were absolutely void, and did not give even color of title. In that view the District Court gave and the \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decree for the plaintiffs, without considering the conformity of the tax proceedings to the local law, or the questions arising out of the evidence bearing on the defenses of adverse possession and laches. On the first appeal to this court that view was disapproved and the decree reversed. \n236 \nU.S. 635\n, 35 S. Ct. 446. In keeping with prior decisions this court held, in substance, that-\n\n\n (1)\n The purpose of the confirmatory act of 1828 was not to create a new right, but to recognize, in fulfillment of treaty obligations, a right conferred by Spain while the land was under her dominion.\n\n\n (2)\n As the grant contained a less acreage than a league square, the confirmation by that act was subject only to a needed survey giving precision to the boundaries of the grant.\n\n\n (3)\n When the survey was made and received the approval of the Surveyor General, the confirmation was complete, and the land was thenceforth effectively separated from the public domain and subject to the taxing power of the state.\n\n\n (4)\n The survey did not require the special approval of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, for under the law and practice of that period the approval of the Surveyor General sufficed.\n\n\n (5)\n The patent was in the nature of a convenient muniment or record of the confirmation already effected by the act of 1828 and the approved survey rather than a conveyance speaking from the date of its issue.\n The cases of Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478, 497, and Boquillas Cattle Co., v. Curtis, \n213 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 29 S. Ct. 493, were cited in support of the last proposition and were pertinent; but the proposition has further and special support in other cases, where rights based on tax sales, adverse possession, etc., occurring after a like legislative confirmation and before the issue of patent, were upheld, such as \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n Langdeau v. Hanes, 21 Wall. 521, 529; Morrow v. Whitney, \n95 \nU.S. 551, 554\n, 555 S.; Joplin v. Chachere, \n192 \nU.S. 94\n, 24 S. Ct. 214.\n On the first appeal this court did not pass upon the question of the conformity of the tax proceedings to the local law, nor on those arising out of the evidence bearing on the defenses of adverse possession and laches. They had not been considered in the courts below, and were of a kind that should be examined and determined in the first instance by the District Court, and then, if need be, by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The decree of reversal was so framed as to require that this course be taken.\n When the case got back to the District Court, it was heard anew on the record before made. That court found that the defenses of adverse possession and laches were well taken in fact and in law, and accordingly entered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decree. 299 F. 261. The plaintiffs then brought the case here on the present appeal.\n Various motions have been submitted on briefs. One by the appellee asks that the appeal be dismissed, as taken where an appeal was not admissible, or, in the alternative, that the decree be affirmed, on the ground that the questions presented are so unsubstantial as not to need further argument. See rule 6, par. 5, 222 U. S. appendix and 266 S. S. appendix.\n The motion to dismiss must be denied. The appeal was taken under sections 128 and 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120, 1218), as existing when the decree of affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals was entered, and is not affected by the subsequent Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936. Section 128 provided that the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals in certain classes of cases should be final, in the sense of being not reviewable by this court on writ of error or appeal; and section 241 provided that \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n the decisions of those courts in other cases should be subject to such a review where the matter in controversy, exclusive of costs, exceeded $1, 000. This suit was not within any of the classes named in section 128, and the matter in controversy exceeded $1,000, apart from costs. Therefore the suit was one in which an appeal was admissible.\n The motion to affirm is well taken. A reference to the questions presented and to what is plainly shown in the record will make this clear.\n The appellants seek to reopen the questions determined on the first appeal. A full hearing was had at that time. The questions were not novel, but covered by prior decisions. As a result of the hearing those decisions were reaffirmed and applied. There was also a petition for rehearing, which was denied. In this situation the questions reasonably cannot be regarded as now debatable.\n The contention is made that the decision on that appeal proceeded on the assumption that the survey was approved by the Surveyor General in 1951, whereas according to the record the approval was given shortly before the patent issued, which was in 1895. But the record is plainly otherwise. It contains a certified copy of the original plat of the survey, as made in January, 1851, by Marcellus A. Williams, deputy surveyor; and the plat bears an indorsement signed by the then Surveyor General, showing that he examined it, compared it with the field notes, and approved it, June 20, 1851. In addition, the patent recites that the description there given of the land was 'taken from the approved field notes' of Williams' survey made in January, 1851. True, the patent also refers to a descriptive plat and notes 'authenticated and approved' by the Surveyor General shortly before the date of the patent; but it is obvious from the patent and other parts of the record that the descriptive plat and notes so mentioned were made up from the approved survey of 1951 merely as a means of providing a suitable \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n and convenient description of the land for insertion in the patent. Their authentication and approval by the then Surveyor General amounted to no more than a certificate by him that they were accurately taken from the survey made and approved in 1851, as shown on the records of his office. See Joplin v. Chachere, supra, 102, 107 (24 S. Ct. 214).\n A further contention is that there could be no laches, nor any adverse possession, prior to the issue of patent, because the claimants were prohibited by the Act of March 3, 1807, c. 46, 2 Stat. 445, from exercising acts of proprietorship until their claim was 'recognized and confirmed' by the United States. A complete answer to this is that their claim was both recognized and confirmed by the act of 1828, and the confirmation became effective when the claim was surveyed and the survey approved in 1851. The subsequent patent, although serving as a convenient muniment of title as confirmed, added nothing to the force of the confirmation. Langdeau v. Hanes, supra, 530, and other cases before cited.\n Reliance is also had on a provisions in the local statute of limitation declaring that, as respects lands derived from the United States, the period of limitation should not begin to run 'until the passage of the title' from the government. The answer to the last contention is equally good here. Such title as the United States possessed passed to the claimants when the confirmation became effective through the approved survey. The cases just cited are conclusive on this point.\n Lastly, complaint is made of the findings of fact sustaining the defenses of adverse possession and laches. The courts below concurred in these findings and explained them in considered opinions. The record shows with certainty that the findings had very substantial support in the evidence. This court accepts concurrent findings with such support. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How. 491, 495; \n\n[269 U.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 18 S.

State Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 211\n, 44 S. Ct. 289.\n No question is presented which can be regarded as debatable in this court; so there is no need for holding the case for further argument.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In some parts of the record the acreage is mistakenly given as 5, 426.82. \n\n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELAWARE & H CO. v.

Purporting to proceed as required by section 19a, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (Act March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 701; Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 493; Act June 7, 1922, c. 210, 42 Stat. 624 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8591 ]), the Interstate Commerce Commission, on March 28, 1923, declared tentative valuations of the properties which the several companies owned June 30, 1916, and allowed 30 days from April 12th for protests. \n\n[266 U.S. 438, 446]\n\u00a0\n Elaborate protests were duly presented. Before they were acted upon appellants began this proceeding-June 13, 1923-wherein they claim that defects in the valuation order prevented them from adequately protecting their rights by protests, and pray that it be annulled. The petition states that the Commission refused to investigate, ascertain, and report many facts relative to values as required by the statute; refused to investigate, ascertain, and report concerning properties used by the Delaware & Hudson Company for purposes of a common carrier; refused to apply to inventories prices existing and current on June 30, 1916; omitted to report analyses of the methods employed for ascertaining values, costs, etc.; also omitted to investigate and report the amount of working capital actually used for purposes of common carriers.\n Upon motion the petition was dismissed for want of equity, and the matter is here by direct appeal.\n Section 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, provides:\n'(a) That the Commission shall, as hereinafter provided, investigate, ascertain, and report the value of all the property owned or used by every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act. ...\n\n'(b) First. In such investigation said Commission shall ascertain and report in detail as to each piece of property, other than land, owned or used by said common carrier for its purposes as a common carrier, the original cost to date, the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation, and an analysis of the methods by which these several costs are obtained, and the reason for their differences, if any. The Commission shall in like manner ascertain and report separately other values, and elements of value, if any, of the property of such common carrier, and an analysis of the methods of valuation employed, and of the reasons for any differences \n\n[266 U.S. 438, 447]\n\u00a0\n between any such value, and each of the foregoing cost values.\n\n'Second. Such investigation and report shall state in detail and separately from improvements the original cost of all lands, rights of way, and terminals owned or used for the purpose of a common carrier, and ascertained as of the time of dedication to public use, and the present value of the same.\n\n'Third. Such investigation and report shall show separately the property held for purposes other than those of a common carrier, and the original cost and present value of the same, together with an analysis of the methods of valuation employed. ...\n\n'(f) Upon the completion of the valuation herein provided for the Commission shall thereafter in like manner keep itself informed of all extensions and improvements or other changes in the condition and value of the property of all common carriers, and shall ascertain the value thereof, and shall from time to time, revise and correct its valuations, showing such revision and correction classified and as a whole and separately in each of the several states and territories and the District of Columbia, which valuations, both original and corrected, shall be tentative valuations and shall be reported to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. ...\n\n'(h) Whenever the Commission shall have completed the tentative valuation of the property of any common carrier, as herein directed, and before such valuation shall become final, the Commission shall give notice by registered letter to the said carrier, the Attorney General of the United States, the governor of any state in which the property so valued is located, and to such additional parties as the Commission may prescribe, stating the valuation placed upon the several classes of property of said carrier, and shall allow thirty days in which to file \n\n[266 U.S. 438, 448]\n\u00a0\n a protest of the same with the Commission. If no protest is filed within thirty days, said valuation shall become final as of the date thereof.\n\n'(i) If notice of protest is filed the Commission shall fix a time for hearing the same, and shall proceed as promptly as may be to hear and consider any matter relative and material thereto which may be presented in support of any such protest so filed as aforesaid. If after hearing any protest of such tentative valuation under the provisions of this act the Commission shall be of the opinion that its valuation should not become final, it shall make such changes as may be necessary, and shall issue an order making such corrected tentative valuation final as of the date thereof. All final valuations by the Commission and the classification thereof shall be published and shall be prima facie evidence of the value of the property in all proceedings under the Act to Regulate Commerce as of the date of the fixing thereof, and in all judicial proceedings for the enforcement of the act approved February fourth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, commonly known as 'the Act to Regulate Commerce,' and the various acts amendatory thereof, and in all judicial proceedings brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n The 'tentative valuation' of the statute is no more than an ex parte appraisement without probative effect. By the authorized 'protest' the carrier may offer objections to anything done or omitted in respect thereof and secure the Commission's rulings before the valuation becomes final. Prior to the present proceeding protests, raising the very issues now tendered, had been made and were awaiting action. There is nothing to indicate that the Commission willfully disregarded the law as honestly interpreted or failed to proceed in an orderly manner, or that it will not consider and pass upon all the \n\n[266 U.S. 438, 449]\n\u00a0\n matters set up in the protest and repeated here. Pending further action by it the tentative valuation will not become final and no proceedings thereon can be taken. Under the circumstances disclosed appellants must pursue the remedy provided by the statute and give the Commission opportunity to take final action before they can properly ask interposition by the courts.\n The decree below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIRECTION DER DISCONTO-GESELLSCHAFT v.

John Weld Peck, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and John Wilson Brown, III, and Alfred K. Nippert, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Averel Brown, of New York City, for appellee United States Steel Corporation.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederic R. Condert, of New York City, for appellee British Public Trustee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are bills in equity in similar form each raising the same question. In each the plaintiff is  German corporation and the interested defendants are the Public Trustee, an English corporation sole appointed to be custodian of enemy property during the late war, and the United States Steel Corporation. Each plaintiff claims one hundred identified shares in the Steel Corporation and seeks to be declared owner of the same, to have new certificates issued to it and the outstanding certificates cancelled on the books of the corporation, and to recover past dividends declared but unpaid. The cases were submitted by them upon an agreed statement of facts, and the District Court after a discussion that leaves nothing to be added dismissed the bills. The decree declared the Public Trustee to be entitled to the shares and directed the Steel Corporation to issue new certificates to his nominee on surrender of the old ones properly endorsed. 300 F. 741.\n As is usual with shares which it is desired to deal in abroad these shares were registered by tens on the Steel Corporation's books in the name of some well-known broker or the like domiciled in England, and the assignment and power of attorney to transfer the shares printed on the back of the certificate was signed by the broker in blank so that the certificate passed from hand to hand. The Disconto-Gesellschaft had bought a hundred shares and held the certificates thus indorsed in its London branch. The Bank fur Handel had bought the same number and pledged them with an English banking house in a running account. On March 27, 1918, an order of the Board of Trade in pursuance of statutory powers purported to vest in the Public Trustee the rights of the \n\n[267 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n Disconto-Gesellschaft to the shares and the right to take possession of the documents of title. On April 30, 1917, a similar order had been made as to the Bank fur Handel's stock. The Public Trustee thereupon seized the certificates in London as was regular and lawful under the laws of England while the war was going on and freed the pledged securities from the lien upon them by a sale of other stocks. He claims a title confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin and the Treaty of Versailles. The plaintiffs set up that a decree recognizing his title would deprive them of their property without due process of law.\n The appellants starting from the sound proposition that jurisdiction is founded upon power, overwork the argument drawn from the power of the United States over the Steel Corporation. Taking the United States in this connection to mean the total powers of the Central and the State Governments, no doubt theoretically it could draw a line of fire around its boundaries and recognize nothing concerning the corporation or any interest in it that happened outside. But it prefers to consider itself civilized and to act accordingly. Therefore New Jersey having authorized this corporation like others to issue certificates that so far represent the stock that ordinarily at least no one can get the benefits of ownership except through and by means of the paper, it recognizes as owner anyone to whom the person declared by the paper to be owner has transferred it by the indorsement provided for wherever it takes place. It allows an indorsement in blank, and by its law as well as by the law of England an indorsement in blank authorizes anyone who is the lawful owner of the paper to write in a name, and thereby entitle the person so named to demand registration as owner in his turn upon the corporation's books. But the question who is the owner of the paper depends upon the law of the place where the paper is. It does not depend upon the holder's having given value or taking without notice of \n\n[267 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n outstanding claims but upon the things done being sufficient by the law of the place to transfer the title. An execution locally valid is as effectual as an ordinary purchase. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Clarksdale, \n257 \nU.S. 10\n, 42 S. Ct. 27. The things done in England transferred the title to the Public Trustee by English law.\n If the United States had taken steps to assert its paramount power, as in Miller v. Kaliwerke Aschersleben Aktien-Gesellschaft, 283 F. 746, a different question would arise that we have no occasion to deal with. The United States has taken no such steps. It therefore stands in its usual attitude of indifference when title to the certificate is lawfully obtained. There is no conflict in matter of fact or matter of law between the United States and England and therefore Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394\n, 37 S. Ct. 152, does not apply. We deem it so plain that the Public Trustee got a title good as against the plaintiffs by the original seizure that we deem it unnecessary to advert to the treaties upon which he also relies or to the subsequent dealings between England and Germany showing that both of those nations have assumed without doubt that the Trustee could sell the stock. We think it unnecessary also to repeat what was said below as to the possibility of the United States making a claim at some future time.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDONEGAN v.

Gen., and Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment in a habeas corpus case remanding the petitioner. It is brought under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), on the ground that it involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.\n March 5, 1919, Donegan was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and in the Tampa Division, charged with the offense if misapplication and abstraction of funds of a national bank in violation of the banking laws of the United States. At a subsequent term he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a term of three years' imprisonment in the Atlanta Penitentiary. On a writ of error his conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He applied for a writ of certiorari in this court, which was denied. \n265 \nU.S. 585\n, 44 S. Ct. 459. While in the custody \n\n[269 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n of the United States marshal, after the coming down of the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, he filed this petition for the writ of habeas corpus. The ground for the petition is that United States Circuit Judge Julian W. Mack, who presided in the cause in which the petitioner was convicted, had no power or jurisdiction to act as judge in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Mack, as the petition avers, was one of the five additional United States Circuit Judges appointed at the time of the creation of the Court of Commerce, by virtue of the Act of June 18, 1910, 36 Stat. 539, c. 309. The petition sets out the designation in accord with which Judge Mack sat:\n'Honorable Julian W. Mack, United States Circuit Judge, New York, N. Y.-Sir:\n\n'The senior Circuit Judge of the Fifth Circuit having certified that, on account of the accumulation and urgency of business in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, it would be a great public advantage if you could be assigned to service in said District Court, and your consent in writing to be designated and appointed to serve in said District Court having been duly signed and exhibited to me: Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 201 of the Judicial Code of the United States as amended by the acts of Congress approved October 22, 1913, I do hereby designate and assign you for service in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Florida, during the period commencing January 20, 1923, and ending March 31, 1923, and for such further time as may be required to complete unfinished business.\n\n'Dated January 11, 1923, Washington, D. C.\n\n'Wm. H. Taft,\n\n'Chief Justice of the United States.' \n\n[269 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n It is said that this designation was without authority of law, and therefore that the proceeding in the District Court against the petitioner was coram non judice, and his conviction and present custody in pursuance thereof is without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n The original act creating the court had this provision (36 Stat. 541, c. 309,  1):\n'If, at any time, the business of the Commerce Court does not require the services of all the judges, the Chief Justice of the United States may, by writing, signed by him and filed in the Department of Justice, terminate the assignment of any of the judge or temporarily assign him for service in any Circuit Court or Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n When by the Judicial Code the Circuit Courts were abolished (36 Stat. 1087), and in chapter 13 the powers of the Circuit Courts were conferred upon the District Courts, sections 291 and 292 of that chapter (Comp. St .  1268, 1269) provided:\n'Sec. 291. Wherever, in any law not embraced within this act, any reference is made to, or any power or duty is conferred or imposed upon, the Circuit Courts, such reference shall, upon the taking effect of this act, be deemed and held to refer to, and to confer such power and impose such duty upon, the District Courts.\n\n'Sec. 292. Wherever, in any law not contained within this act, a reference is made to any law revised or embraced herein, such reference, upon the taking effect hereof, shall be construed to refer to the section of this act into which has been carried or revised the provision of law to which reference is so made.'\n\n In addition to these provisions, section 201 of the Judicial Code provided expressly as follows (36 Stat. 1087, 1147 (Comp. St.  1110)):\n'Sec. 201. The five additional Circuit Judges authorized by the act to create a Commerce Court, and for other purposes, approved June eighteenth, nineteen hundred and ten, shall hold office during good behavior, and from \n\n[269 U.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n time to time shall be designated and assigned by the Chief Justice of the United States for service in the District Court of any district, or the Circuit Court of Appeals for any circuit, or in the Commerce Court, and when so designated and assigned for service in a District Court or Circuit Court of Appeals shall have the powers and jurisdiction in this act conferred upon a Circuit Judge in his circuit.'\n\n The Commerce Court was abolished by the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32 (38 Stat. 208, 219). While the court was abolished, no attempt was made to abolish the offices of the judges. More than that, there was this special saving clause in the act abolishing the Commerce Court (38 Stat. 219 (Comp. St.  992)):\n'Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the tenure of any of the judges now acting as Circuit Judges by appointment under the terms of said act, but such judges shall continue to act under assignment, as in the said act provided, as judges of the District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals.'\n\n The contention is, first, that sections 200 to 206 of the Judicial Code, which incorporated the provisions of the act establishing the Commerce Court, were necessarily repealed by the Act of October 22, 1913, taking effect December 31, 1913. In view of the saving clause of that act we think this view quite untenable, and that section 201 was entirely saved in its application.\n It is then submitted that, even if section 201 was saved, the Circuit Judge surviving the Court of Commerce is a judge without a circuit, and that when assigned to the Fifth Circuit, or any other circuit, he goes to the circuit as pro tempore a judge of that circuit, and has only the powers and jurisdiction of such Circuit Judge provided in section 201, which are the powers and jurisdiction conferred in the Judicial Code 'upon a Circuit Judge in his circuit.' Now it is said that a regularly appointed Circuit Judge in a circuit can exercise power and jurisdiction in a District \n\n[269 U.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n Court of his circuit only after designation and assignment by the Circuit Justice of his judicial circuit, or by the senior Circuit Judge thereof, in accordance with the language of section 18, which is, as amended September 14, 1922 (42 Stat. 837, c. 306 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  985 )):\n'Sec. 5. The Chief Justice of the United States, or the Circuit Justice of any judicial circuit, or the senior Circuit Judge thereof, may, if the public interest requires, designate and assign any Circuit Judge of a judicial circuit to hold a District Court within such circuit.'\n\n The reference to the Chief Justice, it is said, is to him only as a Circuit Justice in the circuit to which he is allocated by order of the court, and that at the time was the Fourth Circuit, not the Fifth. It is urged, therefore, that after the Chief Justice had under section 201 assigned this former Commerce Court Circuit Judge to the Fifth Circuit, it was, in addition, necessary that the Circuit Justice of the Fifth Circuit, or the senior Circuit Judge of that circuit, should then assign him as a pro tempore Circuit Judge of the Fifth Circuit to the particular District Court of that circuit in which he was to exercise the duties of a District Judge. We think such reasoning is making complex a very simple statute and going out of the way to create confusion. Section 201 gives to the Chief Justice full discretion, without further designation by any other judge, to vest in a Commerce Court Circuit Judge full authority directly to act as judge either in a particular District Court or in the Circuit Court of Appeals of any circuit, and the designation of Judge Mack in this case was ample for the purpose. We thus do not think it necessary to consider whether, even if the designation had not been valid, the sitting judge should be regarded as a judge de facto, whose authority could not be questioned in a collateral attack like a proceeding in habeas corpus.\n No question has been made whether the appeal really involves the construction or application of the federal \n\n[269 U.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n Constitution, such that, if the construction contended for were correct, and the judge were sitting without warrant, the trial would be without due process of law. We have assumed that for the purposes of the decision, and also that the question could be raised on habeas corpus.\n The action of the District Court in dismissing the petition and remanding the prisoner is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOULLUT & WILLIAMS CO. v.

C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The pleadings and proof in these causes are substantially identical, except as to names of vessels, dates of accidents, and damages claimed. Relying upon the Act of Congress approved March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 Stat. 525 (Comp. St.  1251 1\/4-1251 1\/4 l), the appellant instituted proceedings in admiralty to recover damages from the United States for injuries inflicted by their merchant vessels, the City of Elwood and the Galveston, upon clusters of piling standing in the Mississippi river at New Orleans, 150 feet from low-water mark. The court below dismissed the \n\n[268 U.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n libels for want of jurisdiction, and that action is now challenged.\n We copy from the libels and accept the following description of the injured structures:\n'Said piling cluster consists of five wooden piles or timbers, each of approximately 60 feet in length, firmly driven in and attached to the bottom of the river, fastened and held together as a unit having a diameter of not more than 4 feet, the depth of the water surrounding them being at all times not less than 16 feet, said pile cluster extending perpendicularly about 25 feet out of and above the water. ... That at no time has said pile cluster any connections, either actual or anticipated, nor has it any connections for any purpose whatever, with the shore of said river, or with anything on said shores, either of a temporary, prospective, or permanent character, and either actual or anticipated, with any commerce on land, or anything connected with land, or with the shores of said river. That libelant had and has authority from the proper governmental authorities to erect, maintain, and use said pile cluster for such marine purposes as said cluster may be adapted and used. ... That at times of the swift current of the Mississippi river and during bad weather said pile cluster is used by vessels to tie up to, so as to avoid anchor dragging and likewise to lessen the dangers of collision with other vessels whilst navigating in said river. ... At no time do any vessels use said pile cluster to load or unload cargo or passengers, said pile cluster being incapable of so being used, and incapable of being used for any commerce on land, and incapable of being used for any purpose, except in the operation, maintenance, and navigation of vessels in navigable water, and in aid of their navigation or in aid of commerce on water, and having no relation or connection with land or land commerce.'\n\n The damaged piles constituted no part or extension of the shore, as wharves, bridges, and piers do. Although \n\n[268 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n driven into the bottom of the river, and attached in that way only to the land, they were completely surrounded by navigable water, and were used exclusively as aids to navigation. We think injuries to them by a ship come fairly within the principle approved by The Blackheath, \n195 \nU.S. 361\n, 25 S. Ct. 46, and The Raithmoor, \n241 \nU.S. 166\n, 36 S. Ct. 514.

Nash, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order dismissing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on demurrer. The petitioner is imprisoned for contempt in disobeying a temporary injunction issued under Section 22 of Title 2 of the National Prohibition Act 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 314 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 k). The bill upon which the injunction was issued alleged the existence of a public nuisance used for the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquor, and charged that the petitioner among others was conducting the business. An injunction was ordered, pendente lite. Subsequently an information was filed against the petitioner and others for contempt and the petitioner was sentenced to a fine and to imprisonment for one year. He was committed to jail on November 11, 1924. The main ground for the present petition is that Title 2 of the Act, with immaterial exceptions, is unconstitutional because it was enacted before Amendment 18 of the Constitution went into effect. The Amendment prohibits the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, 'after one year from the ratification of this article.' The date of the ratification is fixed as January 16, 1919, Dillon v. Gloss, \n256 \nU.S. 368, 376\n, 41 S. Ct. 510, and the National Prohibition Act was passed on October 28, 1919 before a year from the ratification had expired. It is said that the prohibition is the Amendment; that until there is a prohibition there is no Amendment, and that without the Amendment the Act of Congress, although it was not to go into effect until after the Amendment did, Title 2,  3 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 aa), was unauthorized and void.\n We will give a few words to this argument notwithstanding the difficulties in the way of proceeding by habeas corpus in a case like this, Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181, 189\n, 190 S., 42 S. Ct. 277; Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255\n, 44 S. Ct. 103, and notwithstanding the fact that the validity of the statutes has been supposed to have been established heretofore. It is \n\n[269 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n not correct to say that the Amendment did not exist until its prohibition went into effect; in other words that there was no Amendment until January 16, 1920, although one had been ratified a year before. The moment that the Amendment was ratified it became effective as a law. The operation of its words a year later depended wholly upon what had happened on or before January 16, 1919. Nothing happened after that date except the lapse of time. This distinction is maintained by the language of the Amendment, which is not that the Amendment shall go into operation a year after it is ratified but that the acts against which it is directed are prohibited after that time, although we attach no other importance to the precise form of words used than that of showing an accurate instinct in those who drew it. Whichever form was used, the world had notice of it, and we apprehend that there would be little difficulty in holding void a contract made in July, 1919, and contemplating performance in disregard of the prohibition in July, 1920. Every dogmatic statement of the law is prophetic of what will happen in a certain event. There is no more reason why the Constitution should not give the warning for the next year than there is for its not giving it for the next moment. We have no doubt of the authority of Congress to pass the law. Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454\n, 39 S. Ct. 316. Diamond Glue Co. v. United States Glue Co., \n187 \nU.S. 611, 615\n, 616 S., 23 S. Ct. 206. Indeed it would be going far to say that while the fate of the Amendment was uncertain Congress could not have passed a law in aid of it, conditioned upon the ratification taking place.\n A shorter answer to the whole matter is that the grant of power to Congress is a present grant and that no reason has been suggested why the Constitution may not give Congress a present power to enact laws intended to carry out constitutional provisions for the future when the time comes for them to take effect.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that the preliminary injunction was void for want of the notice required by Equity Rule 73 and the Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323 ,  17, 38 Stat. 730, 737 (Comp. St.  1243a). The statute provides that if it is made to appear that the nuisance exists, a temporary injunction shall issue forthwith. Section 22. In view of the drastic policy of the Amendment and the statute, we see no reason why the words should not be taken literally, to mean what they say. McFarland v. United States (C. C. A.) 295 F. 648. But if notice were required the injunction could not be disregarded as void. Howat v. Kansas, supra.\n We think the case too clear for extended discussion, but it seemed worth while to say what we have said in explanation of our judgment, although we did not think it necessary to hear the other side.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUFFY v. CENTRAL R. CO. OF NEW JERSEY(1925)\nNo. 129\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat. of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. E. Miller, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During the year 1916, respondent, as lessee, was in possession of and operating certian railroads and branches in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The leases were for terms of 999 years and bound respondent to maintain and keep the leased property in good order and repair and fit for efficient use. Each provided that in the event of a default in that respect the lease might be terminated by the lessor. At the same time, respondent had leases of certain piers from the city of New York for various terms with the privilege of renewal, not to exceed in any case 30 years in all. One such lease required respondent to acquire and pay for the interest of private owners in an old pier and to construct a new one in its place. It provided that, if the cost should be less than $2,750,000, respondent was to pay in addition to rent 5 1\/2 per cent. on the \n\n[268 U.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n difference between that amount and the actual cost; but, if the cost should be more than $2,750,000, respondent was to be credited on its annual rental with 5 1\/2 per cent. on such difference for 39 years, in which event the term was to be extended under a formula not necessary to be repeated. Respondent agreed to maintain the premises and structures thereon, or to be erected thereon, in good and efficient repair. The city was authorized to terminate the lease at any time after 10 years, but in such case agreed to pay to respondent such reasonable sum as might be fixed by arbitration. Other leases required respondent to do such dredging as the commissioner of docks considered necessary, and still others to build extensions to the leased piers. All the leases provided that the city could terminate them if respondent failed to pay rent or failed otherwise to observe the covenants or agreements.\n In the year 1916, respondent expended, under the railroad leases, for additions and betterments and, under the pier leases, for the several purposes therein set forth, the aggregate sum of $1,659,924.33, of which $ 1,525,308.72 was for the acquisition of the private rights in the old pier and the construction of the new one.\n In submitting its income tax return for that year, respondent sought to deduct these various expenditures from its gross income under section 12(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756, 767-769, c. 463 [Comp. St .  6336l]), which provides, in the case of a corporation, that annual net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount thereof, among other things:\n'First. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, including rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of property to which the corporation has not taken or is not taking title, or in which it has no equity.' \n\n[268 U.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n The collector refused to allow the deductions, and respondent, under protest, paid the amount of the increased assessment due to such refusal, and brought this action to recover it. Its contention is that the expenditures were 'rentals or other payments' within the meaning of the provision above quoted, and that the whole amount constitutes an allowable deduction for the year 1916. On the other hand, the government contends that the disbursements were capital expenditures and that the only permissible deduction is an annual allowance under section 12(a), subd. Second, 39 Stat. 768,1 for 'depreciation'; but, if the expenditures are to be regarded as additional rentals or other payments within the meaning of section 12(a), subd. First, the amount must be prorated, under a regulation of the Treasury Department, over the life of the improvements or the life of the lease, whichever is the shorter. The federal district court gave judgment for respondent, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (289 F. 354), and the case is here on certiorari (\n263 \nU.S. 693\n, 44 S. Ct. 34).\n\n Clearly the expenditures were not 'expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its [respondent's] business and properties';2 but were for \n\n[268 U.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n additions and betterments of a permanent character, such as would, if made by an owner, come within the proviso in subdivision Second, 'that no deduction shall be allowed for any amount paid out for new buildings, permanent improvements, or betterments made to increase the value of any property,' etc. They were made, not to keep the properties going, but to create additions to them. They constituted, not upkeep, but investment; not maintenance or operating expenses, deductible under subdivision First ,  12(a), but capital, subject to annual allowances for exhaustion or depreciation under subdivision Second.\n Nevertheless, do such expenditures come within the words 'rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of property'? We think not. The statement of the court below that it was conceded by both parties that the expenditures were 'additional rentals' is challenged by the government and does not seem to have support in the record. The term 'rentals,' since there is nothing to indicate the contrary, must be taken in its usual and ordinary sense, that is, as implying a fixed sum, or property amounting to a fixed sum, to be paid at stated times for the use of property. Dodge v. Hogan, 19 R. I. 4, 11, 31 A. 268, 1059; 2 Washburn, Real Property (6th Ed.)  1187; and in that sense it does not include payments, uncertain both as to amount and time, made for the cost of improvements or even for taxes. Guild v. Sampson, 232 Mass. 509, 513, 122 N. E. 712; Garner v. Hannah, 13 N. Y. Super. Ct. 262, 266, 267; Bien v. Bixby, 18 Misc. Rep. 415, 41 N. Y. S. 433, 435; Simonelli v. Di Ericco, 59 Misc. Rep. 485, 110 N. Y. S. 1044, 1045. Expenditures, therefore, like those here involved, made for betterments and additions to leased premises, cannot be deducted under the term 'rentals,' in the absence of circumstances fairly importing an exceptional meaning; and these we do not find in respect of the statute under \n\n[268 U.S. 55, 64]\n\u00a0\n review. Nor do such expenditures come within the phrase 'or other payments,' which was evidently meant to bring in payments ejusdem generis with 'rentals,' such as taxes, insurance, interest on mortgages, and the like, constituting liabilities of the lessor on account of the leased premises which the lessee has covenanted to pay.\n In respect of the 999-year leases, the additions and betterments will all be consumed in their use by the lessee within a fraction of the term, and, as to them, allowances for annual depreciation will suffice to meet the requirements of the statute. In the case of the pier leases, the improvements may and probably will outlast the term, and, as to them, deductions may more properly take the form of proportionate annual allowances for exhaustion.\n The judgment below cannot be sustained except for $37,781.54, the amount of a conceded overpayment, with interest thereon as allowed by the trial court.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded, with instructions to modify the judgment in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Second. All losses actually sustained and charged off within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out of its use or employment in the business: ... Provided, that no deduction shall be allowed for any amount paid out for new buildings, permanent improvements, or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate, and no deduction shall be made for any amount of expense of restoring property or making good the exhaustion thereof for which an allowance is or has been made. ... \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Perhaps a critical analysis of the detailed statement found in the record might reveal items of minor importance which are of this character, or which might be classed as 'rentals or other payments'; but since no point appears to be made in respect of such a differentiation we do not consider it. \n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUMBRA v. U S(1925)\nNo. 546\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Marvin, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Mahlon D. Kiefer, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes to this court on writ of error to the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, for the review of an order of the District Judge denying a motion to quash a search warrant which had been granted by him authorizing the search of a grocery store at 514 East Sixteenth street and the adjoining premises number 512 East Sixteenth street, New York City, at which last-mentional place plaintiffs in error maintained a winery under permit from the government. The warrant directed the seizure of any intoxicating liquor possessed in violation of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.). Execution of the warrant resulted in the seizure of 74 bottles of wine from the grocery store at No. 514 and 50 barrels of wine from the winery on the premises No. 512.\n The motion was made to quash the search warrant so far as it affected the premises 512 East Sixteenth street and for the return of the fifty barrels of wine seized on the premises. The sole grounds of the motion, which are the principal assignments of error here, were that the search warrant was issued without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and that the officer serving the warrant had no authority to receive and execute it.\n The warrant was executed by a prohibition agent who was an agent and employee of the United States. He \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n was regularly appointed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; the appointment was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury and he was charged with enforcing the National Prohibition Act (section 2, title 2, National Prohibition Act, Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 308 [section 10138 1\/2a]; section 6, title 11, Espionage Act, Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, title 11, 40 Stat. 228, et seq. [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10496 1\/4f]).\n The question as to the authority of a prohibition agent to receive and execute a search warrant is disposed of by the decision of this court delivered April 13, 1925, in case No. 636, Steele v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 505\n, 45 S. Ct. 417. In that case it was held that prohibition agents or employees of the United States have the power and authority to serve a search warrant under the provisions of the Espionage Act and the National Prohibition Act. Following that decision, we hold that the warrant here was served by an authorized officer and that no right of plaintiff in error was infringed by reason of the method of service of the warrant.\n The other stated ground of the plaintiff's appeal confines us narrowly to a consideration of the question whether the affidavit on which the search warrant was issued afforded sufficient ground for the issue of the warrant under the laws and Constitution of the United States. We are not concerned with the question whether on trial had, the government may or may not succeed on its libel filed for the condemnation and forfeiture of the seized wines. The proceedings had and now under review do not go to the merits, but only to the sufficiency of the affidavit, on which the search warrant was issued, to set the machinery of the law in motion by way of the summary process of search and seizure.\n Although the affidavit on which the warrant was granted does not disclose the fact, the plaintiffs in error, at all times material to the issues, were the holders of a permit of the Treasury Department issued pursuant to section 3 of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 308 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2aa]) authorizing \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n them to manufacture and sell wines upon the searched premises for nonbeverage purposes. By the terms of the permit they were permitted to have on hand on the premises not more than 100,000 gallons of wine. They were required to give bond, pursuant to Treasury Regulations, in the sum of $50,000. Their premises were subject to inspection of internal revenue officers during business hours. In view of these provisions of the permit and of the provisions of section 9 of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 311 [section 10138 1\/2dd]) authorizing revocation of the permit in the case of its violation and for its temporary suspension pending proceedings for its revocation, the resort to the summary procedure of search and seizure, without disclosing, in the affidavit submitted to the judge issuing the warrant, that a permit had been granted was, to say the least, disingenuous, and would seem to have been a harsh and unnecessary exercise of governmental power by the officials concerned.\n But the permit issued did not authorize the possession of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes by plaintiffs, and it could afford no protection to one who possessed such liquors with intent to use them in violation of the National Prohibition Act. Reid v. United States ( C. C. A.) 276 F. 253. If possessed with such intent, they were subject to search and seizure under section 25 of the act (41 Stat. 315 [section 10138 1\/2m]), and if probable cause were shown, a warrant authorizing such search and seizure might be duly and lawfully issued. Under such circumstances search and seizure are not unauthorized or unconstitutional.\n Section 25 of the National Prohibition Act, so far as pertinent to the present inquiry, reads as follows:\n'It shall be unlawful to have or possess any liquor or property designed for the manufacture of liquor intended for use in violating this title or which has been so used, and no property rights shall exist in any such liquor or property. A search warrant may issue as provided in \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n title XI of public law numbered 24 of the Sixty-Fifth Congress, approved June 15, 1917, and such liquor, the containers thereof, and such property so seized shall be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof.'\n\n Title 11 of the Public Law approved June 15, 1917, known as the 'Espionage Act,' referred to in section 25 of National Prohibition Act, lays down the procedure which must be followed upon the issue of search warrants. Section 5 (40 Stat. 228 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10496 1\/4e]) requires that the warrant shall be issued only on affidavit 'tending to establish the grounds of the application or probable cause for believing that they exist,' and section 16 (section 10496 1\/4p) requires the restoration of the property seized if it appears 'that there is no probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued.'\n The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution provides:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n In Steel v. United States, supra, it was held that a search and seizure of intoxicating liquors possessed in violation of the provisions of the National Prohibition Law upon a warrant satisfying the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and the Espionage Act and issued upon probable cause shown was not an unreasonable search and seizure within the constitutional provision and was in accordance with the Constitution and Statutes of the United States. In that case, quoting from Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, decided March 2, 1925, the court said, with respect to the probable cause shown by the affidavit on which the warrant was issued:\n'If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been committed, it is sufficient.' \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n Without a detailed recital of the facts appearing in the affidavit upon which the warrant in the present case was issued, it will suffice to point out that the affidavit was made by an employee of the Prohibition Bureau, who stated in it that at a time specified, he was present with another prohibition agent at the store, No. 514, adjoining the winery conducted by Dumbra & Co., who are the plaintiffs in error, at No. 512. That while in the store he saw Mrs. Dumbra and her son; that negotiations were then had by affiant with the son for the purchase of two gallons of wine; that the son went to the back of the grocery store behind a partition, turned to the right toward the winery, and in a short time returned with the two gallons of wine for which the agent accompanying affiant paid Mrs. Dumbra. As they left No. 514, the son of Dumbra left the grocery with them and turned into the front door of the winery.\n\n The affiant states that on another occasion he visited the grocery store where he saw the son and negotiated with him for the sale of a gallon of wine. The son again went to the back of the store; turned toward the winery requesting affiant to wait outside. Shortly thereafter the son came out of the front door of the premises at 512, the winery, delivered the wine to affiant, and received payment for it. Affiant swore that he tasted the wine in each instance; that he was familiar with the taste of intoxicating liquor and that the wine in question contained more than one- half of 1 per cent. of alcohol; that at no time did he present any papers or authority for the buying of wine for sacramental or religious purposes. He states that from his investigation and purchases made by other agents he knew that wine was being sold from the grocery store and that the source of supply was the winery located at No. 512.\n The statements of fact contained in the affidavit are based upon affiant's personal knowledge of what he saw; it sets forth evidentiary facts which in our opinion establish \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n probable cause for the charge that intoxicating liquors were possessed at the premises searched with intent to use them in violation of the National Prohibition Act. 'Probable cause' has been defined by this court as 'reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the party is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.' Stacey v. Emery, \n97 U.S. 642\n, 645\n\n\n In determining what is probable cause, we are not called upon to determine whether the offense charged has in fact been committed. We are concerned only with the question whether the affiant had reasonable grounds at the time of his affidavit and the issuance of the warrant for the belief that the law was being violated on the premises to be searched, and if the apparent facts set out in the affidavit are such that a reasonably discreet and prudent man would be led to believe that there was a commission of the offense charged, there is probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant.\n The apparent readiness of members of the family of a person in control of the suspected premises to sell intoxicating liquors to casual purchasers without any inquiry as to their right to purchase, and the actual production of the liquor sold, in one instance from the premises suspected and in the other from the vicinity of those premises, under such circumstances as to lead to the inference that the suspected premises were the source of supply, gave rise to a reasonable belief that the liquors possessed on the suspected premises were possessed for the purpose and with the intent of selling them unlawfully to casual purchasers. Absence of a well-grounded belief that such such was the fact could be ascribed only to a lack of intelligence or a singular lack of practical experience on the part of the officer.\n There was therefore probable cause for the issuing of the warrant, and the search and seizure made pursuant to it were authorized by the statutes of the United States \n\n[268 U.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n and were not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n The motion to quash the warrant was properly denied, and the order of the District Court appealed from is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEBERT v.

Hally, both of Detroit, Mich., for petitioners.\n Mrs. Regene Freund Cohane and Mr. Louis Starfield Cohane, both of Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of certiorari granted (\n263 \nU.S. 694\n, 44 S. Ct. 36) to review a decree of the Supreme Court of Michigan involving the effect of the federal Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act March 8, 1918, c. 20, 40 Stat. 440 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3078 1\/4 a-3078 1\/4 ss), as amended September 3, 1919 (41 Stat. 282, c. 55 ), upon a foreclosure of land made under the laws of that state. 221 Mich. 361, 191 N. W. 202, 193 N. W. 201. There is no controversy concerning any provision \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 550]\n\u00a0\n of state law. The question presented is solely one of the construction of the federal act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The statutes of Michigan provide that a mortgage of real estate duly recorded which contains a power of sale may, without resort to any proceeding in court, be foreclosed by advertisement and sale at public vendue. The deed to the purchaser, which is to be promptly deposited with the register of deeds for the county in which the land is situated and appropriately endorsed, vests in the grantee or his assigns all the right, title, and interest of the mortgagor, upon the mere lapse, without redemption, of one year from the date of the sale. The statutes provide for redemption at any time within the year, also without resort to any proceedings in court, by paying to the purchaser, or the register, the sum which was bid for the property with prescribed interest and fees. If this is done, the deed becomes void; the register destroys it; and an appropriate entry is made in the registry to clear the title. Compiled Laws of Michigan 1915, c. 249.\n In 1920, Poston brought this suit in a court of the state to redeem a parcel of land from a foreclosure made by advertisement and sale at public vendue pursuant to the statutes. The purchasers at the sale and a grantee under them, the petitioners here, were joined as defendants. The mortgage, given in 1916, had been assumed by Poston when he purchased the land in 1917. The foreclosure sale was duly made on February 5, 1918. There was no redemption within the year. After February 5, 1919, the deed, which had been deposited with the register, was delivered by him to the purchasers. The right of redemption, despite the lapse of the statutory period of one year, \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n was asserted under the federal Civil Relief Act. That act was passed about a month after the sale. Poston enlisted in the army, on September 29, 1918, nearly 8 months after the sale. He was discharged on May 14, 1919, more than 3 months after the expiration of one year from the date of sale. On July 24, 1919-that is, nearly 18 months after the date of the foreclosure sale-negotiations were begun by Poston which later ripened into a tender. Under the law of Michigan, these negotiations, followed by the tender, constituted a sufficient basis for the bill to redeem, provided the period of redemption given by the statute had not then expired. The trial court dismissed the bill. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the state held that, by reason of the federal act, the one-year period for redemption had been extended by the length of the period of military service, and that, consequently, the extended period had not yet expired on July 24, 1919. Whether the federal act was correctly construed is the question for decision.\n The court below recognized that the act does not in terms cover the case of a sale by advertisement made before the passage of the act. Its conclusion that the federal act extended the statutory period of redemption rests upon the following reasoning. Under the laws of Michigan, the mortgagees might have brought proceedings in chancery to foreclose the mortgage (Compiled Laws 1915,  12676-12692), instead of proceeding by advertisement. If they had sued in chancery, that court would, by reason of the federal act, have possessed the power to stay execution of its own decree after a sale made thereunder, provided application was made to it before expiration of the time therein fixed for redemption. Therefore the act should be construed so as to accomplish a like result in the case of a foreclosure by advertisement. The provisions in the act which are relied upon in support of this conclusion are section 302 and section 205 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3078 1\/4 ff, 3078 1\/4 e). The former (set forth in \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n the margin2) is the only section which mentions mortgages or powers of sale. The latter (also set forth in the margin3) relates to the statutes of limitation of actions. We are of opinion that neither section supports the conclusion, and that it is erroneous.\n Subsection 2 of section 302 deals with preceedings brought in court to foreclose mortgages. Subsection 3 deals with sales under powers of sale, whether brought in court or effected in pais, as by advertisement. Neither subsection includes within its scope proceedings taken prior to the \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n passage of the act or prior to the commencement of the military service. By their own words, subsection 2 applies to suits commenced 'during the period of military service,' and subsection 3 to sales made 'during the period of military service or within three months thereafter.' But the definition given in subsection 2 of section 101 (section 3078 1\/4 aa) to the words 'period of military service' makes the words used in section 302 mean that part of the military service which follows 'the date of approval of the act.' Thus, a decree for foreclosure may be stayed, or otherwise disposed of, under section 302 only if the suit was commenced after the passage of the act and during the period of military service. And, likewise, it is only sales made after the passage of the act and during military service that are invalidated if made without leave of court.\n Section 205 does not apply to transactions which are effected without judicial action. The statutory right to redeem from a sale by advertisement is not a right of action. It is a primary right as distinguished from a remedy. The defeasible title of the purchaser at the sale becomes absolute if the mortgagor fails to avail himself of the right within the statutory period. The purchaser's title is extinguished if it is availed of. The bill in equity is merely the remedy by which the right, if still existing, may be enforced.\n There is a further contention that the broad purpose of the act declared in section 100 (section 3078 1\/4 a)4 demands that it be liberally \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n construed to include the situation presented by this case. Persuasive legislative reasons for distinguishing between the cases explicitly cared for by sections 302, 205, and the present case suggest themselves. We have no occasion to state them. The judicial function to be exercised in construing a statute is limited to ascertaining the intention of the Legislature therein expressed. A casus omissus does not justify judicial legislation. Compare United States v. Weitzel, \n246 \nU.S. 533, 543\n, 38 S. Ct. 381. This act is so carefully drawn as to leave little room for conjecture. It deals with a single subject and does so comprehensively, systematically, and in detail. There are in the act an aggregate of 36 sections and 27 subsections. To insure certainty, separate provision is made for each of the several classes of transactions to be dealt with and for the situations likely to arise in each. To promote clarity, the act is divided into six articles, each dealing with a different branch of the subject. The difference in treatment accorded to transactions taking place during a period of military service after the passage of the act as distinguished from those occurring before, is not limited to mortgages and other secured obligations dealt with in section 302. A like distinction is made in the act in respect to other classes of transactions. \n5\n Such care and particularity in treatment preclude expansion of the act in order to include transactions supposed to be within its spirit, but which do not fall within any of its provisions. Without resort to the common rule that statutes are ordinarily to be construed as prospective in operation, Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454. It is clear that Congress did not intend \n\n[266 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n to deal with sales on foreclosure made before the passage of the act. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We need not consider the contention of the petitioners that the owner of the right of redemption from a sale by advertisement under the Michigan laws is not an owner of real property within the meaning of subsection 1 of section 302 of the federal act. Nor need we consider the contentions of the respondents that there was no proof of a legal foreclosure and that, independently of the federal act, he was entitled to redeem. The latter present questions wholly of state law.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In a motion for rehearing filed in the state Supreme Court constitutional questions were discussed.

MARTIN(1925)\nNo. 363\nArgued: May 1, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. J. Wills, of Hattiesburg, Miss., for petitioners.\n Mr. Fleet C. Hathorn, of Hattiesburg, Miss., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, complainants below, filed four bills in equity in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against four different defendants to remove cloud on title of four plots of land separately described in the several bills. The suits thus brought were consolidated and tried by the District Court, as one, upon an agreed statement of facts and documentary evidence, and a decree was rendered adjudging that the title to the lands in question was in defendants and denying the prayer of the bill. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the decree was affirmed. 296 F. 442.\n The lands in question were acquired by the state of Mississippi from the United States under act of Congress approved September 28, 1850 (9 Stat. 519). Petitioner's title depends upon the validity of a patent issued, June 27, 1871, by the state of Mississippi to the Pearl River Improvement & Navigation Company, a corporation from which petitioners derived their title by mesne conveyances. The title set up by the defendants was acquired by mesne conveyances under a second patent describing the same lands, issued by the state of Mississippi to Mitchell December 7, 1883. The Mississippi Legislature, by act approved April 8, 1871 (Laws 1871, c. 169), incorporated the Pearl River Improvement & Navigation Company and provided that that company \n\n[268 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n should 'within sixty days after the passage of this act, file in the office of the Secretary of State a bond in the sum of $50,000, with two or more good securities,' and that upon the approval and filing of the bond, 'the said Secretary of State shall from time to time as demanded by said company make out a patent or patents which shall be signed by the Governor and countersigned by the Secretary of State, which patents shall vest the fee simple in said lands in this company.' Within 60 days, the company filed a bond, executed by four individuals only, in the sum specified, and conditioned on the performance by the company of all duties imposed on it by the Act of April 8, 1871. The bond was approved by the Governor, and the patent of June 27, 1871, describing the lands referred to in that statute, including the lands involved in this litigation, was issued, signed by the Governor and countersigned by the Secretary of State.\n The validity of petitioner's title depends upon the determination of the question whether the bond filed by the company was a compliance with the provisions of the statute so as to render operative the patent issued by the officials of the state to the company as a valid conveyance of the fee of the lands in question. Whether or not the bond was a compliance with the statute and the legal effect of the patent, so far as other lands embraced within its description are concerned, are points which have been several times passed upon by the state courts of Mississippi and once before the present litigation, were considered by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n In Hardy v. Hartman (1888) 65 Miss. 504, 4 So. 545, which was an action of ejectment, the court, although referring to the fact that it did not appear from the record that any patent signed by the Governor and countersigned by the Secretary of State was ever issued to the company for the land in question, nevertheless rested its decision on its \n\n[268 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n holding that the Act of April 8, 1871, required, as a condition precedent to the validity of any patent issued pursuant to it, that the company should file in the office of the Secretary of State its own bond in the amount specified; that by filing a bond executed by individuals it had not complied with the condition and the patent was accordingly void.\n In Southern Pine Co. v. Hall, 105 F. 84, 44 C. C. A. 363, decided in 1900, suit was brought, as in the present case, to quiet the title of a plaintiff claiming under the company. In that case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the true meaning of the statute, confirmed by the contemporary construction of it on the part of the Governor and the Secretary of State by their action in issuing the patent, was that the company should file a bond in the specified amount insuring an indemnity to the state in that amount. Having complied with the requirements of the statute by filing the approved bond of four solvent individuals, residents of the state, the patent issued to the company by the state of Mississippi was held to be valid and to pass a fee to the patentee.\n In Becker v. Columbia Bank, 112 Miss. 819, 73 So. 798, decided in 1917, which was also a suit to quiet title of lands claimed under the patent of 1871, the Supreme Court of Mississippi reaffirmed the principle of its decision in Hardy v. Hartman, supra, saying that that 'decision established a rule of property which should not now be disturbed,' and that the failure to comply with the requirements of the statute as interpreted in Hardy v. Hartman, supra, rendered the purported patent to the company void and that the patentee took no title under it.\n In Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. State ex rel. Moore (1924) 134 Miss. 533, 98 So. 158, the Supreme Court of Mississippi again affirmed and adopted the view laid down in Hardy v. Hartman, supra, saying at page 534 (98 So. 158):\n'We are not here concerned with the correctness of the decision in Hardy v. Hartman, supra, and the rule there \n\n[268 U.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n applied, whether correct or not, to titles derived through patents issued to the Pearl River Improvement & Navigation Company has become a rule of property and will not be now departed from.'\n\n The validity of titles derived under the same patent to the company appears to have been upheld in the case of Hines et al., Trustees, v. Martin by the Supreme Court of Mississippi, decided without opinion February 4, 1924, 99 So. 825.\n In all these cases the question ruled upon was whether the bond filed by the company complied with the requirements of the statute and whether the filing of a bond satisfying those requirements was a condition precedent to the execution of the patent and the vesting of title in the patentee. An answer to these questions involved an interpretation of the state statute and the application of it, as interpreted, as a rule of property determinative of rights in titles to land within the state. Both the meaning of statutes of a state and the rules of the unwritten law of a state affecting property within the state are peculiarly questions of local law to be ascertained and established by the state courts. For that reason federal courts ordinarily hold themselves bound by the interpretation of state statutes by the state courts. Walker v. State Harbor Commissioners, 17 Wall. 648; Barrett v.

See Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 598; Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20\n, 2 S. Ct. 10; Barber v. Pittsburgh, etc., Railway, \n166 \nU.S. 83, 99\n, 17 S. Ct. 488; Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S. Ct. 140. This court has refused to follow a rule established only by single state decision rendered, after the rights involved in the case in the federal court accrued, Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., supra, or a single decision when not satisfied that it is conclusive evidence of the state law, Barber v. Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne & Chicago Railway Co., \n166 \nU.S. 83, 99\n, 17 S. Ct. 488. In Burgess v. Seligman, supra, this court refused to follow decisions of the state court conflicting with a previous decision of the United States Circuit Court, in that case, with respect to the interpretation of a state statute, fixing the liability of stockholders of a corporation organized under the laws of the state as applied to a stockholder who was a nonresident of the state and who acquired his interest in the stock outside of the state. But where the rule is one affecting title to real estate within the state and has been repeatedly determined by decisions of state courts so that it is established as the law of the state, there has been no departure from the rule that the federal courts will follow the decisions of the state courts.

To avoid the uncertainty and injustice which result from 'the discordant elements of a substantial right which is protected in one set of courts and denied in the other, with no superior to decide which is right' (Brine v. Insurance Co., \n96 U.S. 627\n), this court has not hesitated, when there has been a conflict of decision between it and the state courts affecting a rule of property within the state, to overrule its own decisions and to follow the state decisions once it has become evident that they have established a 'rule of property' as the settled law of the state.

Blunt, supra, overruling a decision of the Circuit Court antedating a conflicting decision of the state court. We are therefore constrained in the present case to accept the view of the state courts as announced by them without inquiring, as an original proposition, into the justice and sufficiency of the rule which we follow.\n In the argument before this court, petitioners relied upon the effect of chapter 114 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1873 (page 120), as validating his title. This was a private act of the Legislature of Mississippi which relieved the Pearl River Improvement & Navigation Company from some of its obligations under the Act of April 8, 1871, upon certain payments to be made by it to the state treasury, and provided that--\n'All acts, deeds and proceedings, whatever of the Pearl River Improvement and Navigation Company, be, and the same are hereby legalized, ratified and confirmed.' Section 6. \n\n[268 U.S. 458, 465]\n\u00a0\n This appears to be the first occasion in the course of this litigation on which the existence of this statute, and the claim of right under it by the petitioner, have been brought to the attention of the court, although it appears to have been before the state court, but not commented on, in Becker v. Columbia Bank, supra, and Hines Yellow Pine Trustee v. Martin, supra. It is not referred to in the record here. By the agreed statement of facts the Act of April 8, 1871, and the patent issued to the company are the only suggested source of title in the petitioners. No reference is made to the Act of 1873 in the assignments of error. The record gives no information as to the existing situation at the time it was passed; as to what lands had been conveyed by the company or what lands retained. We are left uninformed as to whether the company made the payments stipulated for in the statute. This court is a court of review, and it will not consider questions not raised or disclosed by the record brought to it for a review and which were not considered by the courts below. McClellan v.

CUBA R. CO.(1925)\nNo. 324\nArgued: April 15, 1925Decided: June 8, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, and the Attorney General, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Howard Mansfield and Allen Evarts Foster, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation, owns and operates a railroad in Cuba. In March, 1917, it made return of its income for 1916, and, in due time, paid the tax assessed \n\n[268 U.S. 628, 629]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of its return. Plaintiff had received in 1911 to 1916, inclusive, subsidy payments from the republic of Cuba, amounting in all to $ 1,696,216.20, but did not report any part of them as taxable income. January 1, 1918, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed against plaintiff for 1916 an additional tax of $33,924.32, being 2 per cent.-the rate prescribed in the Revenue Act of 1916 (Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756)-on the total of such payments. Notwithstanding its objection that the assessment was without authority of law, plaintiff was required to pay the tax. It applied for refund. The commissioner adhered to the view that the amounts so received constituted income, but held that the payments were taxable in the years when received. Prior to the act of 1916, the tax rate was 1 per cent. There was repaid to plaintiff one per cent. on the payments made before that year, but its application was denied as to the balance, $20,239.18. This action was brought to recover that amount with interest. The complaint alleged that the subsidy payments were not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. Defendant moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The court denied the motion and gave judgment for plaintiff. Defendant brought the case here on writ of error. Judicial Code  238 ( Comp. St.  1215).\n An act of the Congress of the republic of Cuba of July 5, 1906, authorized the President to contract with one or more companies for the construction and operation of certain lines of railroad on designated routes between places specified. The republic granted a subsidy up to $6, 000 per kilometer, payable in six annual installments, to the companies constructing and maintaining in use the specified lines. Any company having such a contract was entitled to receive subsidies for that part of the railroad constructed after the passage of the act, as well as for the \n\n[268 U.S. 628, 630]\n\u00a0\n part constructed after the making of the contract. March 25, 1909, the President of the republic and the plaintiff made a contract, by which the latter agreed, in consideration of $6,000 per kilometer to be paid by the republic as specified in the law of 1906, to construct and operate a railroad on the routes and between the places specified; and the plaintiff agreed to reduce by one-third the tariffs then in force for the transportation of permanent employees and troops of the government, and, in case of war or any disturbance of the public order, to transport troops in special trains at the rate of one cent per man per kilometer, and also agreed to reduce the fares for all first-class passengers. The entire line covered by this contract was completed in 1911. The subsidy payments amounted in all to $1,642,216.20, about one-third of the cost of the railroad.\n An act of June 1, 1914, added to the law of 1906 an article which provided that the subsidy per kilometer for the construction of a railroad from Casilda to Placetas del Sur should be 6,000 pesos for a part and 12, 000 pesos for the rest of the distance. June 30, 1915, in accordance with that act, the President of the republic and plaintiff made a contract for the construction of the railroad. It bound the company to carry public correspondence free of charge on the lines of this railroad, to carry small produce for 50 per cent. of the tariff, and to allow telegraph and telephone stations to be established by the government alongside the railroad. And there was handed over to the plaintiff certain land, buildings, construction and equipment then in the possession of the state, which theretofore had been acquired and built in an earlier effort to complete that line. The subsidy payment in 1916 was $54,000.\n All the subsidy payments under both contracts were credited to a suspense account and, June 30, 1916, were transferred to the surplus account, and were used for \n\n[268 U.S. 628, 631]\n\u00a0\n capital expenditures. The cost of construction as carried on the books was not reduced by such payments.\n The power given Congress by the Sixteenth Amendment is to 'lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived.' Defendant insists that the subsidy payment made in 1916 was taxable under the Revenue Act of 1916, which imposes an annual tax of 2 per centum 'upon the total net income received ... from all sources by every corporation' (39 Stat. 765; Comp. St.  6336j); that the payments made in 1913, 1914, and 1915 were taxable under Income Tax Law Oct. 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 172, which imposes an annual tax of 1 per centum 'upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources ... to every corporation,' and that the payments made in 1911 and 1912 were taxable under Corporation Excise Tax Law Aug. 5, 1909,  38, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, which provides that 'every corporation ... shall be subject to pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business by such corporation ... equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net income ... from all sources.' Defendant insists that the subsidies were merely payments in advance on account of transportation service, later to be performed by the plaintiff for the government, and therefore are to be deemed income and taxable as such.\n In respect of these subsidy payments, the meaning of 'income,' as used in the Corporation Excise Tax Law of 1909 is not to be distinguished from the meaning of the same word as used in the Income Tax Law of 1913 and the Revenue Act of 1916.

R. 1305\n\n\n The Sixteenth Amendment, like other laws authorizing or imposing taxes, is to be taken as written, and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used. The Cuban laws and contracts are similar \n\n[268 U.S. 628, 632]\n\u00a0\n to legislation and arrangements for the promotion of railroad construction which have been well known in the United States for more than half a century. Such aids, gifts and grants from the government, subordinate political subdivisions or private sources-whether of land, other property, credit or money-in order to induce construction and operation of railroads for the service of the public are not given as mere gratuities. Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 679\n, 34 S. Ct. 907; Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, decided March 2, 1925, \n267 \nU.S. 395\n, 45 S. Ct. 233. Usually they are given to promote settlement and to provide for the development of the resources in the territory to be served. The things so sought to be attained in the public interest are numerous and varied. There is no support for the view that the Cuban government gave the subsidy payments, lands, buildings, railroad construction and equipment merely to obtain the specified concessions in respect of rates for government transportation. Other rates were considered. By the first contract, plaintiff agreed to reduce fares for first-class passengers and by the second, it agreed to reduce the rates on small produce. Clearly, the value of the lands and other physical property handed over to aid plaintiff in the completion of the railroad from Casilda to Placetas del Sur was not taxable income. These were to be used directly to complete the undertaking. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in levying the tax, did not include their value as income, and defendant does not claim that it was income. Relying on the contract for partial reimbursement, plaintiff found the money necessary to construct the railroad. The subsidy payments were proportionate to mileage completed; and this indicates a purpose to reimburse plaintiff for capital expenditures. All-the physical properties and the money subsidies-were given for the same purposes. It cannot reasonably be held that one was contribution to capital assets, and that the other was profit, gain or \n\n[268 U.S. 628, 633]\n\u00a0\n income. Neither the laws nor the contracts indicate that the money subsidies were to be used for the payment of dividends, interest or anything else properly chargeable to or payable out of earnings or income. The subsidy payments taxed were not made for services rendered or to be rendered. They were not profits or gains from the use or operation of the railroad, and do not constitute income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. See Stratton's Independence v.

He, and later his estate, claimed that these dividends were not taxable, because they were a return of capital, not income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue insisted that they were taxable, and assessed the tax at the 1917 rate. It amounted to $173,579.72. The estate paid the tax under protest, and brought, in the federal court for southern New York, this suit against the collector to recover the full amount so paid. The contention was repeated that the dividends were not taxable, because not constituting income. In addition, it was claimed that, if they were taxable at all, it was not at the 1917 rate, but at the rate for 1916. The income tax rate imposed upon individuals for the calendar year 1917 by the 1917 Revenue Act was much higher than that imposed for the year 1916 by the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, part I, 39 Stat. 756 (Comp. St.  6336a et seq.). The District Court concluded that the dividends were income, and that they were taxable at the 1917 rate. It entered judgment for the collector. 287 F. 919.\n This judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It agreed with the District Court that the dividends were not a distribution of capital. But it found \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n that there was on hand on December 31, 1916, in the surplus account, a balance of profits earned in that year amply sufficient to enable the corporation to pay these dividends out of such surplus; held that by reason thereof the dividends received by Douglas should have been taxed under section 31(b) at the 1916 rate; and ordered that a mandate issue directing the District Court, upon a new trial, to enter judgment for the Douglas estate in accordance with its conclusions. 298 F. 229. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n266 \nU.S. 596\n, 45 S. Ct. 94. The assertion of the estate that the dividends were a distribution of capital was not renewed in this court, and the character assigned to the dividends by the corporation was treated here as of no legal significance. The sole question requiring decision1 is whether these dividends paid in 1917 shall be deemed to have been paid out of the earnings of that year, or out of an accumulated surplus built up in 1916 and earlier years. The question does not concern the corporation. The stockholder is interested only because he is an income tax payer.\n The government contends that the phrase 'most recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus' in section 31(b) includes current earnings of the year in which the dividends are paid, and that, as the earnings of 1917 were ample to pay these dividends, the 1917 dividends are conclusively presumed to have been paid out of 1917 earnings. The fiscal year of Phelps Dodge Corporation coincides with the calendar year. The corporation earned in 1917 a net profit of $16,742,487.06. The two distributions here involved amounted to only $3,600,000. The corporation paid from time to time during 1917, in all, 10 \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n dividends, aggregating $14,400,000. A large excess remained, to be added to the surplus account on closing the books as of December 31, 1917. There was no suggestion by the Douglas estate that, when these dividends were paid, the current undistributed 1917 earnings of the corporation then accrued were in fact insufficient to pay the two dividends. The District Court found that, under a pro rata apportionment, they were 'more than sufficient.' It is not suggested that the approximate amount of the undivided current earnings of 1917 accrued and undivided at the times these dividends were paid was not in fact known to be sufficient for this purpose. Nor is it suggested by the Douglas estate that the exact facts, or the knowledge thereof by the corporation at the times when the dividends were declared or paid, are of legal significance.\n The claim of the Douglas estate is that the current profits are not, within the meaning of the act, the 'most recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus,' from which the distributions 'shall be deemed to have been made,' and that what Congress intended was that a dividend should be deemed to have been paid from the most recent accumulation of profits which, before payment of the dividend, appeared on the books as having been added to the undivided profits or surplus account of a fiscal year. The argument is that the income tax is levied generally with reference to the period of a full year; that the net financial results of the full calendar and fiscal year of a corporation cannot be known until the expiration of the fiscal year; that the words used by Congress have in corporate accounting a well-known technical meaning; that this meaning is earnings which have been determined by the taking of inventories and the balancing of books to constitute 'undivided profits or surplus'; that it was after December 31, 1917, before the net financial results of the operations of that year were formally and \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 209]\n\u00a0\n definitely determined by this corporation, by the usual taking of the annual inventory, the balancing of the books, and the carrying of the 'undivided profits or surplus' to the appropriate account; that the most recently accumulated undivided profits so appearing was the undistributed balance of the profits earned in the year 1916, which was shown on the books as closed under date of December 31, 1916, and appeared in the surplus account; that this balance was sufficient in amount to meet these two dividends; and that it must be deemed to have been applied in paying them. In short, the claim of the Douglas estate is that Congress, in providing by section 31(b) that dividends shall be deemed to have been paid 'from the most recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus,' meant from such balance as, at the time of the payment of the dividend, is shown by the undivided profits or surplus account of the preceding fiscal year.\n The Douglas estate, apparently, does not contend that under the 1917 act dividends are not to be taxed at all, unless there was an existing balance of taxable profits in the surplus or undivided profits account from which they can be considered to have been paid. To have so contended would have been to impute to Congress the intention of exempting from taxation the dividends received in 1917 by those individuals who were stockholders in corporations which earned in 1917 large sums and paid them out in dividends during that year,2 but which had no earned surplus at the close of their fiscal year on De- \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 210]\n\u00a0\n cember 31, 1916, or whose earned surplus consisted wholly of profits earned prior to March 1, 1913. The Douglas estate grafts upon the section an implied condition or limitation. Its position seems to be that section 31(b) applies if, and only if, at the time of the payment of the dividend, there was on hand an undistributed part of the taxable earnings of some prior fiscal year or years. In other words, it asserts that Congress, in providing that a distribution to shareholders should 'be deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus,' implied the condition, 'if there are such accumulated profits or surplus not exempt from taxation'; that if there are available no such undivided profits or surplus, accrued subsequent to March 1, 1913, the distribution will be considered to have been made from current earnings; that such dividends, in that event, would be taxable as income under section 2(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 757, as amended by section 1200 of the 1917 act, 40 Stat. 329 (Comp. St. 1918,  6336b (a)); and that the 1917 rates would apply. Whether, at the time these 1917 dividends were paid, there was in the surplus account as of December 31, 1916, such funds sufficient for their payment, as the Circuit Court of Appeals appears to have found, we have no occasion to consider; for we are of the opinion that, in any event, the District Court was right in holding that these 1917 dividends must be deemed to have been paid out of the 1917 earnings, and that the stockholder was taxable thereon at the 1917 rate.\n The legislative history of section 3s(b) is relied upon by the Douglas estate in support of its construction. On \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 211]\n\u00a0\n the other hand, the government relies upon the legislative history of the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 a et seq.)), passed by the same Congress which enacted the Revenue Act of 1917. Inquiries into the detail of legislative history are sometimes helpful in removing a doubt presented by the language used in a statute. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523, 537\n, 40 S. Ct. 397. But we have no occasion here to resort to that aid in construing the phrase in question. To ascertain its meaning, we need only bear in mind the general character of the income tax, the specific practices of corporations concerning profits and dividends, the prior income tax legislation to which section 31(b) is an amendment, and the time of the latter's enactment.\n Ordinarily, an income tax is laid upon all taxable income actually received during the tax year, and the tax is payable at the tax rate of the year in which it is received, although none of the income may have been earned by the taxpayer during that year, or, where the income consists of dividends, although the corporation may not have earned in that year any part of the profits of which the dividend is a distribution. The Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  II, 38 Stat. 114, 166, the first income tax law enacted after the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, was construed by the Treasury Department as embodying this general rule without any exception. Consequently the Treasury exacted such payment on account of all income received by the taxpayer after March 1, 1913, the effective date of the amendment, although it appeared that all of the income had been earned before that date, either by the taxpayer or by the corporation whose profits were distributed as a dividend. The correctness of the Treasury's construction was questioned; and before the second income tax law was enacted (Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, title I, 39 Stat. 756 (Comp. St.  6336a)), lower federal courts had, in Lynch v. Hornby, 236 F. 661, 149 C. C. A. 657, held the Treasury \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 212]\n\u00a0\n construction to be erroneous. There had also been serious contention that, as construed by the Treasury, the provision was, when applied to dividends, both unconstitutional and unjust. \n3\n These contentions apparently prevailed with Congress when, in framing the 1916 act, it raised the normal tax rate from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. and the maximum additional tax (supertax) from 6 per cent. to 13 per cent. The 1916 act, by a proviso to section 2, limited the tax on dividends to distributions 'made or ordered to be made by a corporation ... out of its earnings or profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen. ...' Soon after came the war, the great need of the government for large revenues, and the large war profits. Congress enacted the 1917 War Income Tax Law, which raised the normal tax rate to 4 per cent. and the maximum additional tax to 63 per cent., and it made the provision retroactive, in the main, to January 1 of that year.\n While the 1917 act was under consideration, it was recognized that this rapid increase in the income tax rate might result in unjust discrimination, if no change were made in the then existing rule governing the taxation of dividends. All profits earned by members of a partnership would be taxed at the rate prevailing in the year in which they were earned, although actually withdrawn in a later year, when the tax rate was much higher. On the other hand, the tax upon the profits of a corporation earned in 1916 or earlier would, if paid out in 1917 as dividends, be taxed at the high 1917 rates. There would be similar discrimination among the holders of stock in different corporations. The stockholders in those corporations which had deferred the distribution of profits \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 213]\n\u00a0\n earned prior to 1917, either generally from prudence or specifically with a view to stabilizing over a long period the rate of dividend, would be at a great disadvantage as compared with the stockholders in those corporations which had pursued the practice of distributing each year substantially all profits earned. On the other hand, if corporations were left free to determine out of what year's profits dividends paid in 1917 and subsequent years should be deemed to have been made, a corporation with a surplus derived from earnings made prior to 1917 could, while accumulating the profits of the war years, pay dividends on which its stockholders would escape the heavy war tax, by simply declaring that the dividends were payable out of the earnings of earlier years; and if there were still on hand such sufficient surplus earnings from the period prior to March 1, 1913, the dividends would be exempt from all tax. It was apparently to obviate such inequalities that Congress provided by section 31(b) for an objective consideration of the date when the corporation earned the profits, as well as the date when the taxpayer received his share of them in the form of the dividend. By implying the condition stated above the Douglas estate escapes from a position which would otherwise impute to Congress the intention of enabling the war profits of 1917 and subsequent years actually distributed as dividends to escape from the war taxes. But in implying the condition it imputes to Congress, which was seeking to prevent discrimination against stockholders in those corporations which had on January 1, 1917, surplus profits earned since March 1, 1913, the intention of grossly discriminating in their favor; for, if this condition is read into the act, stockholders in corporations which had no such surplus on December 31, 1917, are taxable on 1917 dividends at the high 1917 rates; while those in corporations which had such surplus are taxable on 1917 dividends at the lower rates of 1916 or earlier years. \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 214]\n\u00a0\n Congress did not use the words 'surplus account' or 'undivided profits account.' Its language is 'undivided profits or surplus.' The word 'surplus' is a term commonly employed in corporate finance and accounting to designate an account on corporate books. But this is not true of the words 'undivided profits.' The surplus account represents the net assets of a corporation in excess of all liabilities including its capital stock. This surplus may be 'paid-in surplus,' as where the stock is issued at a price above par; it may be 'earned surplus,' as where it was derived wholly from undistributed profits; or it may, among other things, represent the increase in valuation of land or other assets made upon a revaluation of the company's fixed property. See La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 385\n, 41 S. Ct. 528. As used in section 31(b) the term undoubtedly means that part of the surplus which was derived from profits which, at the close of earlier annual accounting periods, were carried into the surplus account as undistributed profits. On the other hand, the term 'undivided profits' has not acquired in corporate finance and accounting a like fixed meaning. It is not known as designating generally in business an account on the corporation's books, as distinguished from profits actually earned, but not yet distributed. \n4\n Few business corporations establish an 'undivided profits' account. \n5\n By most corporations the term 'undivided profits' is employed to describe profits which have \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 215]\n\u00a0\n neither been distributed as dividends nor carried to surplus account upon the closing of the books; that is, current undistributed earnings.\n That this is the natural meaning of the term 'undivided profits' is indicated by the action of both Douglas and his estate. \n6\n That this is the meaning in which it was used by Congress is confirmed by the use of the expression 'earnings and profits' later in the same paragraph,7 and also by the use of the term 'undivided profits' in section 207 (Comp. St. 1918 ,  6336 3\/8 h). 8 If it be accepted as the meaning in which Con- \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 216]\n\u00a0\n gress used the words, the course to be pursued under section 31(b) becomes consistent with the general purpose evidenced by other parts of the act. Its general aim was clearly to make the dividend, in whatever year paid, bear the tax rate of the year in which the profits of which it was a distribution had been earned, and for this purpose to treat as a unit the profits of the whole tax year. In providing measures for the attainment of that aim, it could be of no practical significance whether, at the time of the payment of the dividend, these profits appeared in a surplus or undivided profits account (as the profits earned within part of a year would, where a corporation closed its books monthly, quarterly, or semiannually) or whether they wtill rested as current earnings without formal determination or specific allocation.\n Besides this general aim, Congress had the special aim of making the war profits pay the high war taxes. \n9\n To this end it was essential that the law should, in determining the applicable tax rate, disregard any declaration of the corporation as to what year's profits were being distributed. Not only was it essential that every such declaration of the corporation should be disregarded, but also that the dividend should not thereupon be deemed to have been paid from the profits of the earliest year (since March 1, 1913) of which there remained accumulated \n\n[269 U.S. 204, 217]\n\u00a0\n profits available for distribution. To accomplish the purpose of Congress it was necessary that the dividend be deemed to have been paid out of the available profits or earnings of the most recent year or years. Its intention so to provide was adequately expressed by the use of the phrase 'most recently accumulated' in connection with the words 'undivided profits or surplus.' As, in the case at bar, there were profits of the year 1917 ample to cover all dividends, those here in suit must be deemed to have been paid therefrom.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The estate had also contended that the word 'deemed' merely 'gave rise to a rebuttable presumption, subject to be rebutted by showing the fund out of which the corporation actually paid the dividend.' This contention was denied by both lower courts and was not made in this court. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This, as a business matter, could easily be done, and is, in fact, done by many corporations. Nearly every business with a well-developed accounting system can, at any time, without the formal periodic inventory or closing of its books usual at the end of a fiscal year, determine approximately the amount of its current earnings, the amount accrued since the beginning of its fiscal year, and the part thereof undistributed. Many corporations do make such approximate ascertainment of profits monthly, or oftener; and, relying upon their system of cost accounting, they make distributions of current earnings without a closing of the books, as the Phelps Dodge Corporation did in 1917.\n This is shown by the record to be true of the Phelps Dodge Corporation. It paid during 1917 regular and extra dividends on June 28, on September 28, and on December 28, aggregating $8,100,000, which were declared, in its report to stockholders, to have been paid by it 'out of earnings for the year 1917.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The decision in this court of Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S. Ct. 543, which sustained the Treasury's construction and held the act constitutional, was not rendered until June 3, 1918. See, also, Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 \nU.S. 347\n, 38 S. Ct. 546. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Committee on Accounting Terminology of the American Association of Public Accountants was for years engaged in preparing a list of definitions. That contained in the Year Book of 1913, pp. 176-227, gives at page 226 this definition: 'Undivided Profits.-Earnings or profits which have not been divided among the partners in a firm or the stockholders in a corporation.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Interstate Commerce Commission prescribes for the various classes of corporations subject to its supervision about 13 different forms of accounts, all of which include a general balance sheet. The number of items on the liability side of this balance sheet varies in these several forms from 8 to 33. There is no item, 'undivided profits,' in any form.\n By incorporated banks the term is commonly employed to designate the account in which profits are carried more or less temporarily, in contradistinction to the account called surplus in which are carried amounts treated as permanent capital, and which may have been derived from payments for stock in excess of par, or from profits which have been definitely devoted to use as capital. See Fidelity Title & Trust Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 304, 308\n, 42 S. Ct. 514. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Douglas received (see note 2, supra) from Phelps Dodge Corporation during 1917 six other dividends, aggregating $738,900, which were confessedly paid out of the 1917 profits, and which were reported by him as taxable in his return to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The two dividends here in question were reported by him in his return as not taxable, solely on the ground that they were 'depletion dividends.' It was on this ground only that the estate, in its applications to the Treasury, sought recovery of the amount in suit. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Section 31(b): '... But nothing herein shall be construed as taxing any earnings or profits accrued prior to March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, but such earnings or profits may be distributed in stock dividends or otherwise, exempt from the tax, after the distribution of earnings and profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, has been made. This subdivision shall not apply to any distribution made prior to August sixth, nineteen hundred and seventeen, out of earnings or profits accrued prior to March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] In section 207 of the same act, which deals with the war excess profits tax on corporations and makes the tax dependent on the amount of the invested capital, the term 'undivided profits' is likewise used. That section, in paragraph (a) 3 defines invested capital as including 'paid in or earned surplus and undivided profits used or employed in the business, exclusive of undivided profits earned during the taxable year.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] To discourage the hoarding of profits in order to avoid the tax, two supplemental provisions were incorporated in the act. By section 3, incorporating section 3 of the Revenue Act of 1916 (Comp. St. 1918,  6336c) Congress taxed as income received by the stockholder his proportion of profits earned by the corporation and fraudulently hoarded by it to avoid payment of the tax. By section 1206(2), adding section 10(b) to the Revenue Act of 1916 (Comp. St. 1918,  6336j(b)), it subject the corporation to an additional tax of 10 per cent. on undistributed income not employed in the business, unless invested in obligations of the United States. \n\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE COAL & COKE CORPORATION v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  6941c]) authorized the Secretary of War to sell any surplus supplies then owned by and in the possession of the government for the use of the War Department 'upon such terms as may be deemed best.' The petition alleged the following facts: The Secretary of War advertised approximately 40,000 tons of nitrate of sodium for sale at public auction at Washington, April 30, 1922. The advertisement stated that bidders would be required to make deposit of 10 per cent. of the price of the nitrate purchased; that acceptance of any bid would not be final until the execution of a contract and bond and upon the failure by purchaser within 10 days after notice of the acceptance of his bid to execute a contract, the United States might withdraw such acceptance, make other disposition of the nitrate, and retain the deposit as liquidated damages; and that the purchaser would be required, upon acceptance of his bid and before delivery of any nitrate, to enter into a written contract, providing that the government 'at its election may rescind said sale at any time before August 1, 1922, in which event the purchaser shall immediately ... deliver to the government ... sodium nitrate in equal quantity with that theretofore delivered by the government to purchaser ... and the government shall return to purchaser all money theretofore received in payment for such nitrates, and relieve him from any obligation for further payments. ...' The auction was held, and plaintiff was the highest bidder on three lots, amounting in all of 29,520 \n\n[266 U.S. 518, 520]\n\u00a0\n tons. The total of its bids was $711,500.1 It deposited more than 10 per cent. of that amount. The three lots were by the auctioneer knocked down and sold to plaintiff for the amount of its bids and upon the terms and conditions of the advertisement. Plaintiff was ready to perform on its part, and demanded that the Secretary execute a contract of sale in accordance with the terms set forth in the advertisement. But the Secretary refused on the ground that the prices offered were inadequate. Plaintiff's deposits were returned to it without prejudice to any of its claims against the United States. The market value of the nitrate was $1, 919.870. And, by the petition, judgment was demanded for $1,208,370, the excess of market price ove total of plaintiff's bids.\n The terms and conditions of the sale as set forth in the advertisement were binding alike upon the United States and the bidders. If, after the receipt of plaintiff's bids, the contemplated contract had been executed, the United States thereby would have been authorized immediately to rescind the sale and bring the matter to an end by return of the deposit. But the Secretary, unwilling to accept the bids, refused to execute a contract and returned plaintiff's deposit. The right under the proposed contract to rescind was the equivalent of a reservation, in the published terms and conditions of the auction sale, of the right of vendor to reject any and all bids. Exercise of the option to terminate the contract of sale would have had the same effect and accomplish the same result as the rejection of the bids. The Secretary was not bound uselessly to execute the contract and then to rescind the sale in order to give effect to his decision not to let plaintiff \n\n[266 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n have the nitrates at the prices offered. It follows that the refusal of the Secretary to make the contract of sale gave rise to no cause of action in favor of the plaintiff.\n Moreover, section 3744, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6895), required the Secretary of War to cause every contract made by him, or by officers under him appointed to make contracts, 'to be reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof.' The Act of July 11, 1919, authorizing the Secretary to sell surplus war supplies, is not inconsistent with that section and does not repeal or modify it. There is no reason why it should not apply to contracts made in pursuance of the later act. It must be held that, because of the failure to make and sign a written contract as required by section 3744, the United States was not bound. Clark v.

Graham, Superintendent of the Chicago House of Correction, Cook County, Ill. The defendant has answered the rule to show cause. The facts are not in dispute.\n On November 24, 1920, the United States filed a bill in equity against Philip Grossman in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, under section 22 of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305, 314, c. 85; Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2k), averring that Grossman was maintaining a nuisance at his place of business in Chicago by sales of liquor in violation of the act and asking an injunction to abate the same. Two days alter the District Judge granted a temporary order. January 11, 1921, an information was filed against Grossman, charging that after the restraining order had been served on him, he had sole to several persons liquor to be drunk on his premises. He was arrested, tried, found guilty of contempt and sentenced to imprisonment in the Chicago House of Correction for one year and to pay a fine of $1,000 to the United States and costs. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Grossman v. United States, 280 F. 683. In December, 1923, the President issued a pardon in which he commuted the sentence of Grossman to the fine of $1,000 on condition that the fine be paid. The pardon was accepted, the fine was paid and the defendant was released. In May, 1924, however, the District Court committed Grossman to the Chicago House of Correction to serve the sentence notwithstanding the pardon. United States v. Grossman, 1 F.(2d) 941. The only \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 108]\n\u00a0\n question raised by the pleadings herein is that of the power of the President to grant the pardon.\n Special counsel, employed by the Department of Justice, appear for the defendant to uphold the legality of the detention. The Attorney General of the United States, as amicus curiae, maintains the validity and effectiveness of the President's action. The petitioner by his counsel urges his discharge from imprisonment.\n Article 2,  2, cl. 1, of the Constitution, dealing with the powers and duties of the President, closes with these words:\n'And he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.'\n\n The argument for the defendant is that the President's power extends only to offenses against the United States and a contempt of court is not such an offense, that offenses against the United States are not common- law offenses but can only be created by legislative act, that the President's pardoning power is more limited than that of the king of England at common law, which was a broad prerogative and included contempts against his courts chiefly because the judges thereof were his agents and acted in his name, that the context of the Constitution shows that the word 'offenses' is used in that instrument only to include crimes and misdemeanors triable by jury and not contempts of the dignity and authority of the federal courts, and that to construe the pardon clause to include contempts of court would be to violate the fundamental principle of the Constitution in the division of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches, and to take from the federal courts their independence and the essential means of protecting their dignity and authority.\n The language of the Constitution cannot be interpreted safely except by reference to the common law and to \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 109]\n\u00a0\n British institutions as they were when the instrument was framed and adopted. The statemen and lawyers of the Convention who submitted it to the ratification of the Convention of the Thirteen States, were born and brought up in the atmosphere of the common law, and thought and spoke in its vocabulary. They were familiar with other forms of government, recent and ancient, and indicated in their discussions earnest study and consideration of many of them, but when they came to put their conclusions into the form of fundamental law in a compact draft, they expressed them in terms of the common law, confident that they could be shortly and easily understood.\n In a case presenting the question whether a pardon should be pleaded in bar to be effective, Chief Justice Marshall said of the power of pardon ( United States v. Wilson, 7 Pet. 150, 160 [8 L. Ed. 640]):\n'As this power had been exercised, from time immemorial, by the executive of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear a close resemblance, we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it.'\n\n In Ex parte William Wells, 18 How. 307, 311, the question was whether the President under his power to pardon could commute a death sentence to life imprisonment by granting a prdon of the capital punishment on condition that the convict be imprisoned during his natural life. This court, speaking through Mr. Justice Wayne, after quoting the above language of the Chief Justice, said:\n'We still think so, and that the language used in the Constitution, conferring the power to grant reprieves and pardons, must be donstrued with reference to its meaning \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 110]\n\u00a0\n at the time of its adoption. At the time of our separation from Great Britain, that power had been exercised by the king, as chief executive. Prior to the revolution, the colonies, being in effect under the laws of England, were accustomed to the exercise of it in the various forms, as they may be found in the English law books. They were, of course, to be applied as occasions occurred, and they constituted a part of the jurisprudence of Anglo-America. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution. American statesmen were conversant with the laws of England, and familiar with the prerogatives exercised by the crown. Hence, when the words to grant pardons were used in the Constitution, they conveyed to the mind the authority as exercised by the English crown, or by its representatives in the colonies. At that time both Englishmen and Americans attached the same meaning to the word pardon. In the Convention which framed the Constitution, no effort was made to define or change its meaning, although it was limited in cases of impeachment.'\n\n The king of England before our Revolution, in the exercise of his prerogative, had always exercised the power to pardon contempts of court, just as he did ordinary crimes and misdemeanors and as he has done to the present day. In the mind of a common-law lawyer of the eighteenth century the word 'pardon' included within its scope the ending by the king's grace of the punishment of such derelictions, whether it was imposed by the court without a jury or upon indictment, for both forms of trial for contempts were had. Thomas of Chartham v. Benet of Stamford (1313) 24 Selden Society, 185; Fulwood v. Fulwood (1585) Toothill, 46; Rex v. Buckenham (1665) 1 Keble, 751, 787, 852; Anonymous (1674) Cases in Chancery, 238; King and Codrington v. Rodman (1630) Cro. Car. 198; Bartram v. Dannett (1676) Finch, 253; Phipps v. Earl of Angelsea (1721) 1 Peere Williams, 696. \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 111]\n\u00a0\n These cases also show that long before our Constitution, a distinction had been recognized at common law between the effect of the king's pardon to wipe out the effect of a sentence for contempt in so far as it had been imposed to punish the contemnor for violating the dignity of the court and the king, in the public interest and its inefficacy to halt or interfere with the remedial part of the court's order necessary to secure the rights of the injured suitor. IV Blackstone, 285, 397, 398; Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (6th Ed. 1787) vol. 2, 553. The same distinction, nowadays referred to as the difference between civil and criminal contempts, is still maintained in English law. In the Matter of a Special Reference from Bahama Islands \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 1893]\n\u00a0\n Appeal Cases, 138; Wellesley v. Duke of Beaufort, 2 Russell & Mylne, 639, 667 (where it is shown in the effect of a privilege from arrest of members of Parliament analogous in its operation to a pardon); In re Freston, 11 Q. B. D. 545, 552; Queen v. Barnardo, 23 Q. B. D. 305; O'Shea v. O'Shea and Parnell, 15 P. & D. 59, 62, 63, 65; Lord Chancellor Selborne in the House of Lords, 276 Hansard, 1714, commenting on Greene's Case, 6 Appeal Cases, 657.\n In our own law the same distinction clearly appears. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418\n, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874; Doyle v. London Guarantee Co., \n204 \nU.S. 599, 607\n, 27 S. Ct. 313; Bessette v. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324\n, 24 S. Ct. 665; Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117\n, 26 S. Ct. 356; Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 109\n, 42 S. Ct. 427. In the Gompers Case this court points out that it is not the fact of punishment but rather its character and purpose that makes the difference between the two kinds of contempts. For civil contempts, the punishment is remedial and for the benefit of the complainant, and a pardon cannot stop it. For criminal contempts the sentence is punitive in the public interest to vindicate the authority of the Court and to deter other like derelictions. \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 112]\n\u00a0\n With this authoritative background of the common law and English history before the American Revolution to show that criminal contempts were within the understood scope of the pardoning power of the executive, we come now to the history of the clause in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The proceedings of the Convention from June 19, 1787 to July 23d, were by resolution referred to a Committee on Detail for report of the Constitution (II Farrand's Records of Constitutional Convention, 128, 129) and contained the following (II Farrand, 146): 'The power of pardoning vested in the executive (which) his pardon shall not however, be pleadable to an impeachment.' On August 6th, Mr. Rutledge of the Committee on Detail ( II Farrand, 185) reported the provision as follows: 'He shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons; but his pardon shall not be pleadable in bar of impeachment.' This is exactly what the king's pardon was at common law with the same limitation. IV Blackstone, 399. On August 25th (II Farrand, 411), the words 'except in cases of impeachment' were added after 'pardons' and the succeeding words were stricken out. On Saturday, September 8th (II FArrand, 547), a committee of five to revise the style of and arrange the articles was agreed to by the House. As referred to the Committee on Style, the clause read (II Farrand, 575): 'He shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons except in cases of impeachment.' The Committee on Style reported this clause as it now is: 'And he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States except in cases of impeachment.' There seems to have been no discussion over the substance of the clause except that a motion to except cases of treason was referred to the Committee on Style, September 10th ( II Farrand, 564), was not approved by the Committee and after discussion was defeated in the Convention September 15th (II Farrand, 626, 627.) \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 113]\n\u00a0\n We have given the history of the clause to show that the words 'for offenses against the United States' were inserted by a Committee on Style, presumably to make clear that the pardon of the President was to operate upon offenses against the United States as distinguished from offenses against the states. It cannot be supposed that the Committee on Revision by adding these words, or the Convention by accepting them, intended sub silentio to narrow the scope of a pardon from one at common law or to confer any different power in this regard on our executive from that which the members of the Convention had seen exercised before the Revolution.\n Nor is there any substance in the contention that there is any substantial difference in this matter between the executive power of pardon in our government and the king's prerogative. The ocurts of Great Britain were called the king's courts, as indeed they were; but for years before our Constitution they were as independent of the king's interference as they are to-day. The extent of the king's pardon was clearly circumscribed by law and the British Constitution, as the cases cited above show. The framers of our Constitution had in mind no necessity for curtailing this feature of the king's prerogative in transplanting it into the American governmental structures, save by excepting cases of impeachment; and even in that regard, as already pointed out, the common law forbade the pleading a pardon in bar to an impeachment. The suggestion that the President's power of pardon should be regarded as necessarily less than that of the king was pressed upon this court and was agreed to by Mr. Justice McLean, one of the dissenting judges, in Ex parte William Wells, 18 How. 307, 321, but it did not prevail with the majority.\n It is said that 'offenses against the United States,' in the pardon clause can include only crimes and misde meanors \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 114]\n\u00a0\n defined and denounced by congressional act, because of the decision of this court in United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32. This was a criminal case certified from the District Court upon a demurrer to an indictment for criminal libel at common law. The court sustained the demurrer, on the ground that indictments in federal courts could only be brought for statutory offenses. The reasoning of the court was that the inferior courts of the United States must be created by Congress, that their jurisdiction, though limited by the Constitution, was in its nature very indefinite, applicable to a great variety of subjects, varying in every state in the Union, so that the courts could not assume to exercise it without legislative definition. The legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it and declare the court that shall have jurisdiction of the offense. The court admitted that 'certain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice from the nature of their institution. But jurisdiction of crimes against the state is not among those powers. To fine for contempt-imprison for contumacy-enforce the observance of order, etc., are powers which cannot be dispensed with in a court because they are necessary to the exercise of all the others and so far our courts no doubt possess powers not immediately derived from statute; but all exercise of criminal jurisdiction in common-law cases we are of opinion is not within their implied powers.' The decision was by a majority of the court and among the dissenting members was Mr. Justice Story, who expressed himself with vigor to the contrary in United States v. Coolidge, 1 Gall. 488, Fed. Cas. No. 14,857, which was reversed by a majority of the court in 1 Wheat. 415. The Hudson decision was made in 1812. It is not too much to say that immediately after the ratification of the Constitution, the power and jurisdiction of federal courts to indict and prosecute common-law \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 115]\n\u00a0\n crimes within the scope of federal judicial power was thought to exist by most of the them members of this court. The charge of Chief Justice Jay to the grand jury in the United States Circuit Court at Richmond in May, 1793, and the ruling by United States Circuit Court in Henfield's Case, Fed. Cas. No. 6,360, Wharton's State Trials, 49, in which Mr. Justice Wilson and Mr. Justice Iredell constituted the court sustained this view. Mr. Warren, in his valuable history of this court, volume I, p. 433, says that in the early years of the court, Chief Justice Ellsworth and Justices Cushing, Paterson and Washington had also delivered opinions or charges of the same tenor. Justices Wilson and Paterson were members of the Constitutional Convention, and the former was one of the five on the Committee on Style which introduced the words 'offenses against the United States' into the pardon clause. We can hardly assume under these circumstances that the words of the pardon clause were then used to include only statutory offenses against the United States and to exclude therefrom common-law offenses in the nature of contempts against the dignity and authority of United States Courts, merely because this court more than twenty years later held that federal courts could only indict for statutory crimes though they might punish for common law contempts.\n Nothing in the ordinary meaning of the words 'offenses against the United States' excludes criminal contempts. That which violates the dignity and authority of federal courts such as an intentional effort to defeat their decrees justifying punishment violates a law of the United States (In re Neagle, \n135 U.S. 1\n, 59, et seq. 10 S. Ct. 658 ), and so must be an offense against the United States. Moreover, this court has held that the general statute of limitation which forbids prosecutions 'for any offense unless instituted within three years next after such offense shall have been committed,' applies to criminal contempts. \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 116]\n\u00a0\n Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604\n, 34 S. Ct. 693, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1044. In that case this court said (page 610 [34 S. Ct. 695]):\n'It is urged in the first place that contempts cannot be crimes, because, although punishable by imprisonment and therefore, if crimes, infamous, they are not within the protection of the Constitution and the amendments giving a right to trial by jury, etc., to persons charged with such crimes. But the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth. Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 282 S.. It does not follow that contempts of the class under consideration are not crimes, or rather, in the language of the statute, offenses, because trial by jury as it has been gradually worked out and fought out has been thought not to extend to them as a matter of constitutional right. These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (N. S.) p. 147 (1885), and that at least in England it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way. See 7 Halsbury, Laws of England, 280, sub. v. Contempt of Court (604); Re Clements v. Erlanger, 46 L. J. (N. S.) pp. 375, 383; Matter of Macleod, 6 Jur. 461; Schreiber v. Lateward, 2 Dick. 592. Wellesley's Case, 2 Russ. & M. 639, 667. In re Pollard, L. R. 2 P. C. 106, 120. Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 43. Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 328\n, 331 S., 332; Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., \n221 U.S. 418\n, 441.' \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 117]\n\u00a0\n The recent case of Michaelson v. United States fully bears out the same view. \n266 \nU.S. 42, 66\n, 67 S., 45 S. Ct. 18, 69 L. Ed. --.\n\n It is said, however, that whatever may be the scope of the word 'offenses' in the particular statute construed in the Gompers Case, its association in the Constitution is such as to show a narrower meaning. The word 'offenses' is only used twice in the original Constitution, once in the pardon clause, and once in article 1,  8, among the powers of Congress 'to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations.' In the amendments, 'offense' occurs but once and that in the Fifth Amendment in the clause forbidding double jeopardy. We do not see how these other two uses of the word can be said to limit the meaning of 'offenses' in the pardon clause.\n The argument is that the word 'offenses' is used in the Constitution interchangeably with 'crimes' and 'criminal prosecutions.' But as has been pointed out in Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65\n, 24 S. Ct. 826, 1 Ann. Cas. 585, the term 'offenses' is used in the Constitution in a more comprehensive sense than are the terms 'crimes' and 'criminal prosecutions.' In Myers v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 105 S., 44 S. Ct. 272, 273 (68 L. Ed. 577), we have but recently held that--\n'While contempt may be an offense against the law and subject to appropriate punishment, certain it is that since the foundation of our government proceedings to punish such offenses have been regarded as sui generis and not 'criminal prosecutions,' within the Sixth Amendment or common understanding.' Bessette v. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 326\n, 24 S. Ct. 665.\n\n Contempt proceedings are sui generis because they are not hedged about with all the safeguards provided in the bill of rights for protecting one accused of ordinary crime from the danger of unjust conviction. This is due, of course, to the fact that for years before the American Constitution, courts had been held to be inherently empowered \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 118]\n\u00a0\n to protect themselves and the function they perform by summary proceeding without a jury to punish disobedience of their orders and disturbance of their hearings. So it is clear to us that the language of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and of other cited parts of the Constitution are not of significance in determining the scope of pardons of 'offenses against the United States' in article 2,  2, cl. 1, of the enumerated powers of the President. We think the arguments drawn from the common law, from the power of the king under the British Constitution, which plainly was the prototype of this clause, from the legislative history of the clause in the Convention, and from the ordinary meaning of its words, are much more relevant and convincing.\n Moreover, criminal contempts of a federal court have been pardoned for 85 years. In that time the power has been exercised 27 times. In 1830, Attorney General Berrien, in an opinion on a state of fact which did not involve the pardon of a contempt, expressed merely in passing the view that the pardoning power did not include impeachments or contempts, using Rawle's general words from his work on the Constitution. Examination shows that the author's exception of contempts had reference only to contempts of a House of Congress. In 1841, Attorney General Gilpin approved the pardon of a contempt on the ground that the principles of the common law embraced such a case and this court had held that we should follow them as to pardons. 3 Op. Attys. Gen. 622. Attorney General Nelson in 1844 (4 Op. Attys. Gen. 317), Attorney General Mason in 1845 (4 Op. Attys. Gen. 458), and Attorney General Miller in 1890 (19 Op. Attys. Gen. 476), rendered similar opinions. Similar views were expressed though the opinions were not reported by Attorney General Knox in 1901 and by Attorney General Daugherty in 1923. Such long practice under the pardoning power and acquiescence in it strongly \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 119]\n\u00a0\n sustains the construction it is based on. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299, 308; Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How, 299, 315; Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, \n111 \nU.S. 53, 57\n, 4 S. Ct. 279; The Laura, \n114 \nU.S. 411, 416\n, 5 S. Ct. 881.\n Finally it is urged that criminal contempts should not be held within the pardoning power because it will tend to destroy the independence of the judiciary and violate the primary constitutional principle of a separation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers. This argument influenced the two District Judges below. 1 F.(2d) 941. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit sustained it in a discussion, though not necessary to the case, in Re Nevitt, 117 F. 448, 54 C. C. A. 622. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin by a majority upheld it in State ex rel. Rodd v. Verage, 177 Wis. 295, 187 N. W. 830, 23 A. L. R. 491, in remarks which were also obiter. Taylor v. Goodrich, 25 Tex. Civ. App. 109, 40 S. W. 515, is the only direct authority and that deals with a clause a little differently worded. The opposite conclusion was reached in Re Mullee, 7 Blatch. 23, Fed. Cas. No. 9,911; Ex parte Hickey, 4 Smedes & M. (12 Miss.) 751; Louisiana v. Sauvinet, 24 La. Ann. 119, 13 Am. Rep. 115; Sharp v. State, 102 Tenn. 9, 49 S. W. 752, 43 L. R. A. 788, 73 Am. St. Rep. 851; State v. Magee Publishing Co., 29 N. M. 455, 224 P. 1028\n\n\n The federal Constitution nowhere expressly declares that the three branches of the government shall be kept separate and independent. All legislative powers are vested in a Congress. The executive power is vested in a President. The judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time establish. The judges are given life tenure and a compensation that may not be diminished during their continuance in office, with the evident purpose of securing them and their courts an independence of Congress and the executive. Complete independence and separation between the three branches, however, are not attained, or intended, as other provisions of the Constitution and the normal operation of government under it \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 120]\n\u00a0\n easily demonstrate. By affirmative action through the veto power, the executive and one more than one-third of either House may defeat all legislation. One-half of the House and two-thirds of the Senate may impeach and remove the members of the judiciary. The executive can reprieve or pardon all offenses after their commission, either before trial, during trial or after trial, by individuals, or by classes, conditionally or absolutely, and this without modification or regulation by Congress. Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall 333, 380. Negatively one House of Congress can withhold all appropriations and stop the operations of government. The Senate can hold up all appointments, confirmation of which either the Constitution or a statute requires, and thus deprive the President of the necessary agents with which he is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n These are some instances of positive and negative restraints possibly available under the Constitution to each branch of the government in defeat of the action of the other. They show that the independence of each of the other is qualified and is so subject to exception as not to constitute a broadly positive injunction or a necessarily controlling rule of construction. The fact is that the judiciary, quite as much as Congress and the executive, are dependent on the co-operation of the other two, that government may go on. Indeed while the Constitution has made the judiciary as independent of the other branches as is practicable, it is, as often remarked, the weakest of the three. It must look for a continuity of necessary co-operation, in the possible reluctance of either of the other branches, to the force of public opinion.\n Executive clemency exists to afford relief from undue harshness or evident mistake in the operation or enforcement of the criminal law. The administration of justice by the courts is not necessarily always wise or certainly considerate of circumstances which may properly mitigate \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 121]\n\u00a0\n guilt. To afford a remedy, it has always been thought essential in popular governments, as well as in monarchies, to vest in some other authority than the courts power to ameliorate or avoid particular criminal judgments. It is a check entrusted to the executive for special cases. To exercise it to the extent of destroying the deterrent effect of judicial punishment would be to prevent it; but whoever is to make it useful must have full discretion to exercise it. Our Constitution confers this discretion on the highest officer in the nation in confidence that he will not abuse it. An abuse in pardoning contempts would certainly embarrass courts, but it is questionable how much more it would lessen their effectiveness than a wholesale pardon of other offenses. If we could conjure up in our minds a President willing to paralyze courts by pardoning all criminal contempts, why not a President ordering a general jail delivery. A pardon can only be granted for a contempt fully completed. Neither in this country nor in England can it interfere with the use of coercive measures to enforce a suitor's right. The detrimental effect of excessive pardons of completed contempts would be in the loss of the deterrent influence upon future contempts. It is of the same character as that of the excessive pardons of other offenses. The difference does not justify our reading criminal contempts out of the pardon clause by departing from its ordinary meaning confirmed by its common-law origin and long years of practice and acquiescence.\n If it be said that the President by successive pardons of constantly recurring contempts in particular litigation might deprive a court of power to enforce its orders in a recalcitrant neighborhood, it is enough to observe that such a course is so improbable as to furnish but little basis for argument. Exceptional cases like this if to be imagined at all would suggest a resort to impeachment rather than to a narrow and strained construction of the general powers of the President. \n\n[267 U.S. 87, 122]\n\u00a0\n The power of a court to protect itself and its usefulness by punishing contemnors is of course necessary, but it is one exercised without the restraining influence of a jury and without many of the guaranties which the bill of rights offers to protect the individual against unjust conviction. Is it unreasonable to provide for the possibility that the personal element may sometimes enter into a summary judgment pronounced by a judge who thinks his authority is flouted or denied? May it not be fairly said that in order to avoid possible mistake, undue prejudice or needless severity, the chance of pardon should exist at least as much in favor of a person convicted by a judge without a jury as in favor of one convicted in a jury trial? The pardoning by the President of criminal contempts has been practiced more than three-quarters of a century, and no abuses during all that time developed sufficiently to invoke a test in the federal courts of its validity.\n It goes without saying that nowhere is there a more earnest will to maintain the independence of federal courts and the preservation of every legitimate safeguard of their effectiveness afforded by the Constitution than in this court. But the qualified independence which they fortunately enjoy is not likely to be permanently strengthened by ignoring precedent and practice and minimizing the importance of the co-ordinating checks and balances of the Constitution.\n The rule is made absolute and the petitioner is discharged. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE GRUBER(1925)\nNo. 9624\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1925\n\n\n\n Const. art. 3,  2, cl. 2, giving Supreme Court original jurisdiction 'in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,' refers to diplomatic and consular representatives accredited to the United States by foreign power, not to those representing this country abroad, and Supreme Court is without jurisdiction of mandamus proceeding to compel consul general of the United States at Montreal, Canada, to visa a transport or certificate of origin and identity. \n\n[269 U.S. 302, 303]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Boynton, of Waco, Tex., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Walker Grain Company, on July 27, 1918, borrowed from the American National Bank of Fort Worth, Tex., $10,000, for which it executed its demand note \n\n[266 U.S. 503, 505]\n\u00a0\n payable to the bank. August 16th following, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the grain company, upon which it was adjudicated a bankrupt. After the petition was filed the bankrupt paid the amount of the note and thereafter appellant succeeded to all the assets and rights and assumed all the liabilities of the American National. Upon these facts the trustee in bankruptcy filed a motion with the referee to summarily require appellant to restore the amount of such payment. Appellant, by proper pleading, denied the jurisdiction of the referee, insisted that the trustee should proceed by a plenary suit, and alleged that the note was secured by property of the bankrupt and that the payee bank was entitled to priority of payment. The referee found that the note was not so secured, that appellant had no color of right to the payment made after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, and ordered appellant to pay over to the trustee the amount received. The findings and conclusions of the referee were approved by an order of the District Court, and its order was affirmed upon petition to revise by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (295 F. 120), and this court denied a petition for certiorari (\n264 \nU.S. 588\n, 44 S. Ct. 402). After the mandate had gone down to the District Court, the referee ordered appellant to comply therewith, but appellant refused to do so, which refusal was certified to the District Court for its action. At the same time the trustee moved the court for an order to compel compliance with the mandate. After a hearing the District Court found appellant guilty of contempt, and, in addition to commanding payment of the amount ordered by the referee, imposed a fine of $ 2,500, as punishment for appellant's contumacious behavior, one-half payable to the United States and one-half to the trustee in bankruptcy. From this order appellant has not only taken this appeal but also a petition to revise to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n\n[266 U.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n Appellee has submitted a motion to dismiss the appeal or affirm the decree of the District Court upon the grounds, among others, that this court is without authority to entertain the appeal, and that there is no substance in the questions sought to be presented. The motion to dismiss must be granted.\n Upon the appeal here appellant seeks a review of the order adjudging appellant in contempt and also of the jurisdictional issues disposed of by the original decree approving the action of the referee which the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to disturb. All questions concerning the validity and merits of that decree were finally disposed of by the decree of the Dircuit Court of Appeals and the denial of the application for a certiorari by this court. The District Court was bound to give effect to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, so that what, in effect, we are asked to do is to review and reverse the decree of the latter. The power here to review that decree has been exhausted, but, in any event, it could not be exercised upon direct appeal or error. Brown v. Alton Water Co., \n222 U.S. 325\n, 331-334, 32 S.

It may be said in passing that the case is here upon appeal not upon writ of error, the appropriate mode of review in criminal contempts; but that is unimportant under chapter 448,  4, 39 Stat. 726, 727 (Comp. St.  1649a), requiring disregard of such mistakes.\n Appellant insists, however, that the jurisdiction of this court attaches upon the grounds that the District Court was without jurisdiction to make the order, and that there was a denial of constitutional rights. See Grant v. United States, \n227 U.S. 74\n, 78-79, 33 S. Ct. 190. Jurisdiction of the District Court here over the person and over the subject-matter of contempts is beyond question; and the challenge to the jurisdiction, as well as the assumed denial of constitutional rights, apparently, are made to rest only upon the assertion that it was not within the power of the referee or the District Court, as a court of bankruptcy, to require the bank, by a summary order, to restore to the trustee the amount of the payment in question; the contention being that the only remedy was by plenary action with the right of trial by jury. But, since the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, as already stated, is conclusively against appellant upon that issue, and prevented any further consideration of it by the District Court, the asserted basis for a direct resort to this court is without any substance.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Opinion amended 267 U.

The case is brought here directly upon the somewhat strained assumption that the construction of our treaty with Mexico is involved. Being here, out of a natural anxiety to save the appellant if possible from being sent from New Hampshire to Mexico for trial, it has been presented as if this were the final stage and every technical detail were to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This is not the law. Form is not to be insisted upon beyond the requirements of safety and justice. Glucksman v. Henkel, \n221 \nU.S. 508, 512\n, 31 S. Ct. 704.

That writ as has been said very often cannot take the place of a writ of error. It is not a means for rehearing what the magistrate already has decided. The alleged fugitive from justice has had his hearing and habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction, whether the offense charged is within the treaty and, by a somewhat liberal extension, whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.

The complaint was filed by an As sistant \n\n[268 U.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n District Attorney of the United States for the District of New Hampshire. It alleged that the complaint was informed 'through diplomatic channel' that the appellant was duly and legally charged by the United States of Mexico with the crime, and on behalf of that government prayed the arrest. Of course whatever form of words was used, the complaint necessarily was upon information, but as appeared at the hearing it was filed by order of the Attorney General, upon request of the Secretary of State, enclosing a request for the extradition from the Mexican Government and a copy of proceedings in a Mexican Court finding that the crime was duly proved against the appellant and ordering his arrest, many pages of evidence being appended. This was enough. Yordi v. Nolte, \n215 \nU.S. 227, 231\n, 232 S., 30 S. Ct. 90; Rice v. Ames, \n180 \nU.S. 371, 375\n, 376 S., 21 S. Ct. 406; Glucksman v. Henkel, \n221 \nU.S. 508, 514\n, 31 S. Ct. 704. The crime charged is embezzlement of peculation of the public funds between May, 1922, and February 1, 1923, while a public officer of the United States of Mexico, to wit, the Cashier of the Department of Special Taxes. The crime is within the treaty and sufficiently alleged. The warrant is said to be bad because it names Mariana Viamonte, and not Mariana Viamonte Fernandez, the appellant. He is named both ways in the proceedings and is identified by testimony. There is nothing in this objection, if a warrant is required.\n The final objection is that there is no evidence that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. This is rather a bold contention seeing that upon the evidence the appellant was Cashier in the Department of Special Taxes, had sole charge of the money, kept the books in his own handwriting, that those books disclose a considerable deficit in the cash, and that he fled the country. He is said to have gambled. On his books the appellant mingled two classes of accounts and by so doing made detection difficult if he was guilty. First there are the items \n\n[268 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n of cash actually received and paid out entered respectively under the heads ingress and egress. But besides these were other transactions called virtual in which he did not receive the cash but was to enter a series of debits and credits. These concerned the petroleum tax, which was a stamp tax. The taxpayers handed to the national treasurer their tax returns, called manifestations, paid their tax and received from him a memorandum receipt. The manifestation and receipt then were handed to the appellant. He forwarded the receipt to the comptroller and entered the amount in his egress column. He should then send the manifestation to the stamp department, which put on the proper stamps and returned it to appellant, the amount being entered as ingress. In the interval between the egress and the ingress, he appeared as having paid out so much money and could use that amount until it was necessary to enter the cross item. As the taxpayers were not very prompt in calling for their papers it was possible for him to keep their manifestations for a time without charging himself, withdraw the amount with which he should charge himself for them and present an account that was correct upon its face. By repeating the process is was possible to disguise an embezzlement for a considerable time. This is what from his books he seems to have done. It is unnecessary to go into greater detail. We are of opinion that probable cause to believe the defendant guilty was shown by competent evidence and that the judgment remanding the appellant must be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND was absent and took no part in this decision. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFISHERIES PRODUCTS CO. v.

The only question here is whether the State Courts erred in holding that the plaintiff (Flanagan, the petitioner) could not recover for an undeniable breach because at the time when the defendant, the Federal Company, refused to accept the coal the plaintiff's license as a coal dealer had \n\n[267 U.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n expired. The plaintiff says that the transaction was interstate commerce and therefore not subject to such regulation by state laws.\n The contract was made on August 19, 1920, and bound the plaintiff to deliver and defendant to accept approximately two hundred cars of Tracy City run of mine coal at nine dollars per ton f. o. b. cars mines, i. e., at Tracy City, Tennessee. Shipments to be approximately fifty cars per month. Time, September 1, 1920, to December 31, 1920. Payments to be made weekly for coal shipped in previous week. The Federal Coal Company bought to sell again. It did not receive the coal itself but gave orders to Flanagan who took bills of lading from the Railroad Company at Tracy City in the name of the Federal Coal Company and consigned the coal to that Company's customers in other States as directed. The Company usually did not sell in Tennessee. It broke off its contract because the price of coal went down and, as it said, its customers refused to keep to their bargains in their turn.\n There was some discussion below to show that Flanagan also bought this coal as a dealer and so was subject to the law in respect of this transaction. But for the present purpose it is immaterial how he came by what he sold. For if he was engaged in interstate commerce he could not be impeded because he was a dealer any more than if he was selling from his own mine. It was understood between the parties that these dealings were steps in sending coal from the mines to purchasers in other States. Very likely the Federal Coal Company might have stopped the coal at Tracy City in Tennessee, but it had no thought of doing so and Flanagan understood the course of business in which he was expected to cooperate and did cooperate. Therefore in this matter the parties were engaged in interstate commerce and the state law even if valid as a tax could not invalidate their contract. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v.

Fitzhugh, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. George W. Dodd, of Ft. Smith, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Ft. Smith Light & Traction Company owns and operates in that city a street railway system with about 22 miles of line. Included in the system is a line extending, for a third of a mile, on Greenwood avenue. Under the law of Arkansas, a street railway is not permitted to abandon any part of its line without leave of the city commission which exercise the powers of a public utility commission. The company applied to that board for leave to abandon the line on Greenwood avenue because it was, and would be, unremunerative. It appeared, among other things, that the city had concluded to change the grade of Greenwood avenue; that in accepting its franchise the company had agreed to conform to the city ordinances; that these required a street railway, in case of any change in the grade of a street, to make the grade of the tracks conform thereto; that the cost of so relaying the tracks on Greenwood avenue was estimated at $11,000; that the allocated daily earnings of this small part of the system were $2.40, the cost of operating it $8.25; and that the total net earnings of the system in 1922 were $16,000, which amount is about 1.7 per cent. of $934,540, the estimated value of the property. The \n\n[267 U.S. 330, 332]\n\u00a0\n request to abandon the Greenwood avenue line was denied. This suit was then brought in a court of the state to set aside the order on the ground among others, that it deprived the company of its property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court denied the relief sought. Its judgment was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 160 Ark. 1, 254 S. W. 481. The case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The Greenwood avenue line had been in operation nearly 20 years. No change in conditions had supervened which required the commission to permit the abandonment, unless it were the fact that this particular part of the system was being operated at a loss; that continued operation would involve practical rebuilding of that part of the line; that such rebuilding would entail a large expenditure; and that the system as a whole was not earning a fair return upon the value of the property used and useful in the business. The order complained of does not deal with rates. Nor does it involve the question of the reasonableness of service over a particular line. Compare Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n206 U.S. 1\n, 23-27, 27 S. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398; Railroad Commission v. Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 388\n, 37 S. Ct. 602. It merely requires continued operation. We cannot say that it is inherently arbitrary. A public utility cannot, because of loss, escape obligations voluntarily assumed. Milwaukee Electric Ry. Co. v. Milwaukee, \n252 \nU.S. 100, 105\n, 40 S. Ct. 306, 10 A. L. R. 892. The fact that the company must make a large expenditure in relaying its tracks does not render the order void. Nor does the expected deficit from operation affect its validity. A railway may be compelled to continue the service of a branch or part of a line, although the operation involves a loss. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 279\n, 30 S. Ct. 330; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 \nU.S. 603, 607\n, 37 S. Ct. 234.

This is true even where the system as a whole fails to earn a fair return upon the value of the property. So far as appears, this company is at liberty to surrender its franchise and discontinue operations throughout the city. It cannot, in the absence of contract, be compelled to continue to operate its system at a loss. Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 \nU.S. 396\n, 40 S. Ct. 183.

Smith, Ark., for defendant in error. \n\n[267 U.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Clear Creek Oil & Gas Company, a corporation of Arkansas, petitioned the Corporation Commission of the State for an increase of rates for gas used by smelters and the like. The Ft. Smith Spelter Company objected on the ground that it received the gas under a private contract made by the Gas Company, when it was a private corporation, with two men to whose rights the Spelter Company had succeeded; and that therefore the contract was not subject to the modification asked. The Commission increased the rate and after intermediate proceedings the order of the Commission was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 161 Ark. 12, 255 S. W. 903; Id., 153 Ark. 170, 239 S. W. 733; 148 Ark. 260, 230 S. W. 897. The case is brought here by writ of error on the ground that the order is a law impairing the obligation of contracts. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 318\n, 34 S. Ct. 48.\n The Supreme Court decided that the Gas Company had power under the laws of the State to become a public service corporation but was not bound to do so. Soon after the contract in question was made the Gas Company did become such a corporation and as such exercised the power of eminent domain. The Supreme Court held that if the contract was made when the Company had not yet devoted itself to the public service still the instrument on its face and also the circumstances showed that public service on the part of the Company was contemplated with the consequence that the Company and all its contracts would become subject to public regulation. We see no sufficient reason for disturbing this finding. As was said below, the fact that the gas was to be delivered at Ft. Smith, 18 to 20 miles from the gas field specified in the agreement, showed that a pipe line would be necessary, which in the ordinary course of events would require the exercise of eminent domain. The gas field \n\n[267 U.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n was large and additions were agreed for. The contractors were entitled to call for 150,000,000 cubic feet of gas for each 30 days, with a possible extension up to 300,000,000. They were given the 'first call' upon the Company's gas supplies and it was agreed that if the Company should sell gas to consumers, except churches, schools, hospitals, or charitable institutions, at a rate less than that fixed by the contract there should be a corresponding reduction. Everything in short pointed to a very extensive enterprise which hardly would be possible without the power incident to this public service under the laws of the State. It would be most unusual, as all know, for such a Company to attempt to work in any other way. It already had franchises in several towns and cities to supply gas.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRESHMAN v. ATKINS(1925)\nNo. 41\nArgued: October 14, 1925Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Paul Carrington and Joseph Manson McCormick, both of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner. \n\n[269 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On November 1, 1915, the petitioner filed in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. Within the statutory time he applied for his discharge, which was contested. The referee, to whom it had been referred as special master, having died after a hearing, his successor as referee reviewed the record and recommended that the discharge be denied. The referee's report was filed with the clerk, but not acted upon by the court, nor was the matter ever brought to the court's attention by the petitioner or any other interested party. On November 11, 1922, a second voluntary petition was filed by the bankrupt. The creditors listed in the first petition were, together with others, included in the second. In February, 1923, the petitioner filed an application for a discharge under the second proceeding. The referee recommended that the discharge be granted. The court, upon its own initiative, took judicial notice of the pendency of the former application and denied the second, in respect of the creditors included in the first petition, granted it as to the additional creditors, and, upon an inspection of the record, denied, by a separate order, the discharge sought under the original proceeding. 290 F. 609. The order denying in part the second application was affirmed on appeal by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 294 F. 867. A motion was made in the District Court for a rehearing of the question of discharge under the original proceeding, but what, if any, action has been taken respecting it, does not appear.\n The opinions of the two courts do not proceed upon precisely similar grounds, but they reach the same conclusion, which is, in effect, that the pendency of the first application precluded a consideration of the second in respect of the same debts. In this conclusion we concur. A proceeding in bankruptcy has for one of its objects the \n\n[269 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n discharge of the bankrupt from his debts. In voluntary proceedings, as both of these were, that is the primary object. Denial of a discharge from the debts provable, or failure to apply for it within the statutory time, bars an application under a second proceeding for discharge from the same debts. Kuntz v. Young, 131 F. 719, 65 C. C. A. 477; In re Bacon, 193 F. 34, 113 C. C. A. 358; In re Fiegenbaum, 121 F. 69, 57 C. C. A. 409; In re Springer (D. C.) 199 F. 294; In re Loughran, 218 F. 619, 134 C. C. A. 377; In re Cooper (D. C.) 236 F. 298; In re Warnock (D. C.) 239 F. 779; Armstrong v. Norris, 247 F. 253, 159 C. C. A. 347; In re Schwartz (D. C.) 248 F. 841; Horner v. Hamner, 249 F. 134, 161 C. C. A. 186, L. R. A. 1918E, 465; Monk v. Horn (C. C. A.) 262 F. 121. A proceeding in bankruptcy has the characteristics of a suit, and since the denial of a discharge, or failure to apply for it, in a former proceeding, is available as a bar, by analogy the pendency of a prior application for discharge is available in abatement as in the nature of a prior suit pending, in accordance with the general rule that the law will not tolerate two suits at the same time for the same cause.\n Here there was no plea or objection by any interested party, and it is argued that this is a necessary prerequisite to a consideration of the matter-that the court may not refuse a discharge ex mero motu. That such is the rule where the action of the court is based upon one or more of the acts of the bankrupt which operate to preclude a discharge may be conceded. But the objection that the issue is already pending, as that it has been adjudged, goes to the right of the bankrupt to maintain the later application, not to the question of the evidence or grounds upon which the relief may be granted if the application be maintainable. The refusal to discharge was not on the merits, but upon the proceedural ground that the matter could not properly be considered or adjudged, except upon the prior application. This application had been reported upon adversely by the referee, was still pending, and, in ordinary course, could have been considered and acted \n\n[269 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n upon by the court. To ignore it, and make a second application, involving a new hearing, was an imposition upon and an abuse of the process of the court, if not a clear effort to circumvent the statute by enlarging the statutory limitation of time within which an application for a discharge must be made. In such a situation the court may well act of its own motion to suppress an attempt to overreach the due and orderly administration of justice. What is said in the Fiegenbaum Case, supra (121 F. 70, 57 C. C. A. 410), is appropriate here:\n'Not only should the court of bankruptcy protect the creditors from an attempt to retry an issue already tried and determined between the same parties, but the court, for its own protection, should arrest, in limine, so flagrant an attempt to circumvent its decrees.'\n\n There is nothing in Bluthental v. Jones, \n208 \nU.S. 64\n, 28 S. Ct. 192 to the contrary. There the previous denial of a discharge had been in another court sitting in another state. This court held that, while an adjudication in bankruptcy, refusing a discharge, came within the rule of res judicata, the court in which the second proceeding was brought was not bound to search the records of other courts and give effect to their judgment. This is far from saying that the court may not take judicial notice of, and give effect to, its own records in another, but interrelated, proceeding, as this was.

C.) 190 F. 111, 112.\n The order of the District Court denying the first application is not before us for consideration. If erroneous, relief may be afforded by proper and timely application to that court, or by an appellate review of the order.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRICK v. COM. OF PENNSYLVANIA(1925)\nNo. 122\nArgued: December 7, 1923Decided: June 1, 1925\n\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., and George B. Gordon, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David A. Reed, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 473, 486]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These four cases involve the constitutional validity of particular features of a statute of Pennsylvania imposing a tax on the transfer of property by will or intestate laws. Act No. 258 (Pa. Laws 1919, p. 521; Pa. St. 1920,  20465-20499). \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 487]\n\u00a0\n Henry C. Frick, domiciled in Pennsylvania, died testate December 2, 1919, leaving a large estate. By his will he disposed of the entire estate- giving about 53 per cent. for charitable and public purposes and passing the rest to or for the use of individual beneficiaries. Besides real and personal property in Pennsylvania, the estate included tangible personalty having an actual situs in New York, tangible personalty having a like situs in Massachusetts, and various stocks in corporations of states other than Pennsylvania. The greater part of the tangible personalty in New York, 1 having a value of $13,132,391, was given to a corporation of that state for the purposes of a public art gallery, and the other part,2 having a value of $77,818.75, to decedent's widow. The tangible personalty in Massachusetts,3 having a value of $325,534.25, was also given to the widow. The will was probated in Pennsylvania, and letters testamentary were granted there. It was also proved in New York and Massachusetts, and ancillary letters were granted in those states. Under the laws of the United States the executors were required to pay to it, and did pay, an estate tax of $6,338,898.68; and under the laws of Kansas, West Virginia, and other states they were required to pay to such states, and did pay, large sums in taxes imposed as a prerequisite to an effective transfer from a nonresident deceased of stocks in corporations of those states.\n The Pennsylvania statute provides that where a person domiciled in that state dies seised or possessed of \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 488]\n\u00a0\n property, real or personal, a tax shall be laid on the transfer of the property from him by will or intestate laws, whether the property be in that state or elsewhere; that the tax shall be 2 per cent. of the clear value of so much of the property as is transferred to or for the use of designated relatives of the decedent and 5 per cent. of the clear value of so much of it as is transferred to or for the use of others; and that the clear value shall be ascertained by taking the gross value of the estate and deducting therefrom the decedent's debts and the expenses of administration, but without making any deduction for taxes paid to the United States or to any other state.\n In applying this statute to the Frick estate, the taxing officers included the value of the tangible personalty in New York and Massachusetts in the clear value on which they computed the tax; and in fixing that value refused to make any deduction on account of the estate tax paid to the United States or the stock transfer taxes paid to other states. In proceedings which reached the Supreme Court of the state the action of the taxing officers and the resulting tax were upheld by that court. 277 Pa. 242, 121 A. 35. The matter was then brought here on writs of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n The plaintiffs in error are the executors and an interested legatee. They contended in the state court, and contend here, that in so far as the Pennsylvania statute attempts to tax the transfer of tangible personal property having an actual situs in states other than Pennsylvania it transcends the power of that state, and thereby contravenes the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n This precise question has not been preented to this court before, but there are many decisions dealing with cognate questions which point the way to its solution. These decisions show, first, that the exaction by a state of a tax which it is without power to impose is a taking \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 489]\n\u00a0\n of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; secondly, that while a state may so shape its tax laws as to reach every object which is under its jurisdiction it cannot give them any extraterritorial operation; and, thirdly, that as respects tangible personal property having an actual situs in a particular state, the power to subject it to state taxation rests exclusively in that state, regardless of the domicile of the owner.

Kentucky the question presented was whether consistently with the restriction imposed by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state of Kentucky could tax a corporation of that state upon its tangible personal property having an actual situs in other states. The question was much considered, prior cases were reviewed, and a negative answer was given. The grounds of the decision are reflected in the following excerpts from the opinion:\n'It is also essential to the validity of a tax that the property shall be within the terrorial jurisdiction of the taxing power. Not only is the operation of state laws limited to persons and property within the boundaries of the state, but property which is wholly and exclusively within the jurisdiction of another state, receives none of the protection for which the tax is supposed to be the compensation. This rule receives its most familiar illustration in the cases of land which, to be taxable, must be \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 490]\n\u00a0\n within the limits of the state. Indeed, we know of no case where a Legislature has assumed to impose a tax upon land within the jurisdiction of another state, much less where such action has been defended by any court. It is said by this court in the Foreign-held Bond Case, 15 Wall. 300, 319, that no adjudication should be necessary to establish so obvious a proposition as that property lying beyond the jurisdiction of a state is not a subject upon which her taxing power can be legitimately exercised. The argument against the taxability of land within the jurisdiction of another state applies with equal cogency to tangible personal property beyond the jurisdiction. It is not only beyond the sovereignty of the taxing state, but does not and cannot receive protection under its laws.'\n\n'The arguments in favor of the taxation of intangible property at the domicile of the owner have no application to tangible property. The fact that such property is visible, easily found and difficult to conceal, and the tax readily collectible, is so cogent an argument for its taxation at its situs, that of late there is a general consensus of opinion that it is taxable in the state where it is permanently located and employed and where it receives its entire protection, irrespective of the domicile of the owner.'\n\n'The adoption of a general rule that tangible personal property in other states may be taxed at the domicile of the owner involves possibilities of an extremely serious character. Not only would it authorize the taxation of furniture and other property kept at country houses in other states or even in foreign countries, [and] of stocks of goods and merchandise kept at branch establishments when already taxed at the state of their situs, but of that enormous mass of personal property belonging to railways and other corporations which might be taxed in the state where they are incorporated, though their charters \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 491]\n\u00a0\n contemplated the construction and operation of roads wholly outside the state, and sometimes across the continent, and when in no other particular they are subject to its laws and entitled to its protection.'\n\n In United States v. Bennett, \n232 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 34 S. Ct. 433, 437 ( 59 L. Ed. 612), where this court had occasion to explain the restrictive operation of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to the taxation by one state of property in another, and to distinguish the operation of the like clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the taxation by the United States of a vessel belonging to one of its citizens and located in foreign waters, it was said:\n'The application to the states of the rule of due process relied upon comes from the fact that their spheres of activity are enforced and protected by the Constitution and therefore it is impossible for one state to reach out and tax property in another without violating the Constitution, for where the power of the one ends the authority of the other begins. But this has no application to the government of the United States so far as its admitted taxing power is concerned. It is coextensive with the limits of the United States; it knows no restriction except where one is expressed in or arises from the Constitution and therefore embraces all the attributes which appertain to sovereignty in the fullest sense. Indeed the existence of such a wide power is the essential resultant of the limitation restricting the states within their allotted spheres.'\n\n Other decisions show that the power to regulate the transmission, administration, and distribution of tangible personal property on the death of the owner rests with the state of its situs, and that the laws of other states have no bearing save as that state expressly or tacitly adopts them; their bearing then being attributable to such adoption and not to any force of their own. Mager \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 492]\n\u00a0\n v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493; Crapo v. Kelly, 16 Wall. 610, 630; Kerr v. Moon, 9 Wheat. 565, 571; Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 204\n, 23 S. Ct. 277; Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 631\n, 36 S. Ct. 473; Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 589; Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 \nU.S. 113, 163\n, 166 S., 16 S. Ct. 139.\n The Pennsylvania statute is a tax law, not an escheat law. This is made plain by its terms and by the opinion of the state court. The tax which it imposes is not a property tax but one laid on the transfer of property on the death of the owner. This distinction is stressed by counsel for the state. But to impose either tax the state must have jurisdiction over the thing that is taxed, and to impose either without such jurisdiction is mere extortion and in contravention of due process of law. Here the tax was imposed on the transfer of tangible personalty having an actual situs in other states-New York and Massachusetts. This property, by reason of its character and situs, was wholly under the jurisdiction of those states and in no way under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. True, its owner was domiciled in Pennsylvania, but this neither brought it under the jurisdiction of that state nor subtracted anything from the jurisdiction of New York and Massachusetts. In these respects the situation was the same as if the property had been immovable realty. The jurisdiction possessed by the states of the situs was not partial but plenary, and included power to regulate the transfer both inter vivos and on the death of the owner, and power to tax both the property and the transfer.\n Mr. Justice Story said, in his work on Conflict of Laws (section 550):\n'A nation within whose territory any personal property is actually situate has as entire dominion over it while therein, in point of sovereignty and jurisdiction, as it has over immovable property situate there. It may regulate its transfer, and subject it to process and execution, and provide for and control the uses and disposition \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 493]\n\u00a0\n of it, to the same extent that it may exert its authority over immovable property.'\n\n And in Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 11 S. Ct. 876, 877 (35 L. Ed. 613), where this court held the actual situs of tangible personalty rather than the domicile of its owner to be the true test of jurisdiction and of power to tax, it was said:\n'No general principles of law are better settled, or more fundamental, than that the legislative power of every state extends to all property within its borders, and that only so far as the comity of that state allows can such property be affected by the law of any other state. The old rule expressed in the maxim mobilia sequentur personam, by which personal property was regarded as subject to the law of the owner's domicile, grew up in the Middle Ages, when movable property consisted chiefly of gold and jewels, which could be easily carried by the owner from place to place, or secreted in spots known only to himself. In modern times, since the great increase in amount and variety of personal property, not immediately connected with the person of the owner, that rule has yielded more and more to the lex situs, the law of the place where the property is kept and used.'\n\n In support of the tax, counsel for the state refer to statutes of New York and Massachusetts evidencing an election by those states to accept and give effect to the domiciliary law regulating the transfer of personal property of owners dying while domiciled in other states; and from this they contend that the transfer we are considering was brought under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania and made taxable there. We think the contention is not sound. The statutes do not evidence a surrender or abandonment of jurisdiction, if that were admissible. On the contrary, they in themselves are an assertion of jurisdiction and an exercise of it. They declare what law shall apply and require the local courts to give effect to it. And it should be observed that here the property was \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 494]\n\u00a0\n administered in those courts and none of it was taken to the domiciliary state. Obviously the accepted domiciliary law could not in itself have any force or application outside that state. Only in virtue of its express or tacit adoption by the states of the situs could it have any force or application in them. Through its adoption by them it came to represent their will and this was the sole basis of its operation there. Burdick on American Constitution,  257. In keeping with this view, New York and Massachusetts both provide for the taxation of transfers under the adopted domiciliary law; and they have imposed and collected such a tax on the transfer we are now considering.\n Counsel for the state cite and rely on Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, and Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473. Both cases related to intangible personalty, which has been regarded as on a different footing from tangible personalty. When they are read with this distinction in mind, and also in connection with other cases before cited, it is apparent that they do not support the tax in question.\n We think it follows from what we have said that the transfer of the tangible personalty in New York and Massachusetts occurred under and in virtue of the jurisdiction and laws of those states, and not under the jurisdiction and laws of Pennsylvania, and therefore that Pennsylvania was without power to tax it.\n One ground on which the state court put its decision was that, in taxing the transfer of the property which the decedent owned in Pennsylvania, it was admissible to take as a basis for computing the tax the combined value of that property and the property in New York and Massachusetts. Of course, this was but the equivalent of saying that it was admissible to measure the tax by a standard which took no account of the distinction between what the state had power to tax and what it had \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 495]\n\u00a0\n no power to tax, and which necessarily operated to make the amount of the tax just what it would have been had the state's power included what was excluded by the Constitution. This ground, in our opinion, is not tenable. It would open the way for easily doing indirectly what is forbidden to be done directly, and would render important constitutional limitations of no avail. If Pennsylvania could tax according to such a standard, other states could. It would mean, as applied to the Frick estate, that Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts could each impose a tax based on the value of the entire estate, although severally having jurisdiction of only parts of it. Without question each state had power to tax the transfer of so much of the estate as was under its jurisdiction, and also had some discretion in respect of the rate; but none could use that power and discretion in accomplishing an unconstitutional end, such as indirectly taxing the transfer of the part of the estate which was under the exclusive jurisdiction of others.

Ct. 435; Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 \nU.S. 385, 395\n, 23 S. Ct. 463.\n The state court cited in support of its view Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 539\n, 40 S. Ct. 2. The case is on the border line, as is evidenced by the dissent of four members of the court. But it does not go so far as its citation by the state court suggests. The tax there in question was one imposed by New Jersey on the transfer of stock in a corporation of that state. The stock was part of the estate of a decedent who had resided elsewhere. The state statute, described according to its essence, provided for a tax graduated in rate according to the value of the entire estate, and required that where the estate was \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 496]\n\u00a0\n partly within and partly without the state the transfer of the part within should bear a proportionate part of what according to the graduated rate would be the tax on the whole. The only bearing which the property without the state had on the tax imposed in respect of the property within was that it affected the rate of the tax. Thus, if the entire estate had a value which put it within the class for which the rate was three per cent. that rate was to be applied to the value of the property within the state in computing the tax on its transfer, although its value separately taken would put it within the class for which the rate was 2 per cent. There was no attempt, as here, to compute the tax in respect of the part within the state on the value of the whole. The court sustained the tax, but distinctly recognized that the state's power was subject to constitutional limitations, including the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also that it would be a violation of that clause for a state to impose a tax on a thing within its jurisdiction 'in such a way as to really amount to taxing that which is beyond its authority.'\n Another case cited by the state court is Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 829, where it was held that a state, in taxing the transfer by will or descent of property within its jurisdiction, might lawfully measure the tax according to the value of the property, even though it included tax-exempt bonds of the United States; and this because the tax was not on the property but on the transfer. We think the case is not in point here. The objection to the present tax is that both the property and the transfer were within the jurisdiction of other states and without the jurisdiction of the taxing state.\n For the reasons which have been stated, it must be held that the Pennsylvania statute, in so far as it attempts to tax the transfer of tangible personalty having an actual situs in other states, contravenes the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is invalid. \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 497]\n\u00a0\n The next question relates to the provision which requires that, in computing the value of the estate for the purpose of fixing the amount of the tax, stocks in corporations of other states shall be included at their full value without any deduction for transfer taxes paid to those states in respect of the same stocks.\n The decedent owned many stocks in corporations of states, other than Pennsylvania, which subjected their transfer on death to a tax and prescribed means of enforcement which practically gave those states the status of lienors in possession. \n4\n As those states had created the corporations issuing the stocks, they had power to impose the tax and to enforce it by such means, irrespective of the decedent's domicile, and the actual situs of the stock certificates. Pennsylvania's jurisdiction over the stocks necessarily was subordinate to that power. Therefore to bring them into the administration in that state it was essential that the tax be paid. The executors paid it out of moneys forming part of the estate in Pennsylvania and the stocks were thereby brought into the administration there. We think it plain that such value as the stocks had in excess of the tax is all that could be regarded as within the range of Pennsylvania's taxing power. Estate of Henry Miller, 184 Cal. 674, 683, 195 P. 413, 16 A. L. R. 694. So much of the value as was required to release the superior claim of the other states was quite beyond Pennsylvania's control. Thus the inclusion of the full value in the computation on which that state based its tax, without any deduction for the tax paid to the other states, was nothing short of applying that state's taxing power to what was not within its range. That the stocks, with their full value, were ultimately brought into the administration in that state, does not \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 498]\n\u00a0\n help. They were brought in through the payment of the tax in the other states out of moneys of the estate in Pennsylvania. The moneys paid out just balanced the excess in stock value brought in. Yet in computing the tax in that state both were included.\n We are of opinion that in so far as the statute requires that stocks of other states be included at their full value, without deducting the tax paid to those states, it exceeds the power of the state and thereby infringes the constitutional guaranty of due process of law.\n The remaining question relates to the provision declaring that, in determining the value of the estate for the purpose of computing the tax, there shall be no deduction of the estate tax paid to the United States. The plaintiffs in error contend that this provision is invalid, first, as being inconsistent with the constitutional supremacy of the United States, and, secondly, as making the state tax in part a tax on the federal tax.\n In support of the contention we are referred to several cases in which state courts have held that the federal tax should be deducted in determining the value on which such a state tax is computed. But the cases plainly are not in point. In them the state courts were merely construing an earlier type of statute requiring that the state tax be computed on the clear or net value of the estate and containing no direction respecting the deduction of the federal tax. An earlier Pennsylvania statute of that type was so construed. Later statutes in the same states expressly forbidding any deduction of the federal tax have been construed according to their letter. This is true of the present Pennsylvania statute. The question here is not how the statute shall be construed, but whether, as construed by the state court, it is open to the constitutional objections urged against it.\n While the federal tax is called an estate tax and the state tax is called a transfer tax, both are imposed as \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 499]\n\u00a0\n excises on the transfer of property from a decedent and both take effect at the instant of transfer. Thus both are laid on the same subject, and neither has priority in time over the other. Subject to exceptions not material here, the power of taxation granted to the United States does not curtail or interfere with the taxing power of the several states. This power in the two governments is generally so far concurrent as to render it admissible for both, each under its own laws and for its own purposes, to tax the same subject at the same time. A few citations will make this plain. In Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 199 (6 L. Ed. 23), Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court, said:\n'Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes, etc., to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. This does not interfere with the power of the states to tax for the support of their own governments; nor is the exercise of that power by the states, an exercise of any portion of the power that is granted to the United States. In imposing taxes for state purposes, they are not doing what Congress is empowered to do. Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the states. When, them, each government exercises the power of taxation, neither is exercising the power of the other.'\n\n Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution (section 1068), said:\n'The power of Congress, in laying taxes, is not necessarily or naturally inconsistent with that of the state. Each may lay a tax on the same property, without interfering with the action of the other.'\n\n And in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 58-60, 20 S. Ct. 747, Mr. Justice White, speaking for this court, said that 'under our constitutional system both the national and state governments, moving in their respective orbits, have a common authority to tax many and diverse objects,' and he further pointed out that the transfer of property on death 'is a usual subject of taxation' and one which falls within that common authority.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 473, 500]\n\u00a0\n With this understanding of the power in virtue of which the two taxes are inposed, we are of opinion that neither the United States nor the state is under any constitutional obligation in determining the amount of its tax to make any deduction on account of the tax of the other. With both the matter of making such a deduction rests in legislative discretion. In their present statutes both direct that such a deduction be not made. It is not as if the tax of one, unless and until paid, presented an obstacle to the exertion of the power of the other. Here both had power to tax and both exercised it as of the same moment. Neither encroached on the sphere or power of the other. The estate out of which each required that its tax be paid is much more than ample for the payment of both taxes. No question of supremacy can arise in such a situation. Whether, if the estate were not sufficient to pay both taxes, that of the United States should be preferred (see Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 77), need not be considered. That question is not involved here.\n The objection that when no deduction is made on account of the federal tax the state tax becomes to that extent a tax on the federal tax and not a tax on the transfer is answered by what already has been said. But by way of repetition it may be observed that what the state is taxing is the transfer of particular property, not such property depleted by the federal tax. The two taxes were concurrently imposed and stand on the same plane, save as the United States possibly might have a preferred right of enforcement if the estate were insufficient to pay both.\n In conclusion we hold: First, that the value of the tangible personalty in New York and Massachusetts should not have been included in determining the clear value on which the Pennsylvania tax was computed; secondly, that in determining such clear value the stocks in corporations \n\n[268 U.S. 473, 501]\n\u00a0\n of other states should not have been included at their full value without deducting the transfer tax paid to such states in respect of those stocks; and, thirdly, that there was no error in refusing to make any deduction from the clear value on account of the estate tax imposed by the United States.\n Petitions for certiorari were presented in these cases, but as the cases are properly here on writs of error, the petitions will be denied.\n Judgments reversed on writs of error.\n Petitions for certiorari denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This consisted of rare paintings, rugs, furniture, bronzes, porcelains and other art treasures known as 'The Frick Collection' and housed in a building in New York City especially constructed for the purpose. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] This consisted of furniture, household furnishings, automobiles, tools, etc., in Mr. Frick's New York house and garage. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] This consisted of paintings, other objects of art, furniture, household furnishings, farming implements, etc., of Mr. Frick's estate at Prides Crossing. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The nature of the tax and the provisions adopted for enforcing it are illustrated by chapter 357,  1, 2, 13, Laws Kansas 1915, p. 452; chapter 33,  1, 6, 7, Barnes' West Virginia Code, p. 586. \n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFULLERTON-KRUEGER LUMBER CO. v.

The record plainly discloses that a right under an act of Congress was claimed below and denied. The cause is properly here by certiorari, and upon it the issue can be decided. That adequate ground for the writ of error was specially set up below is not clear. It will be dismissed.\n On January 24, 1921, the original action was brought in the district court, Hennepin county, to recover excess freight charges demanded by respondent between November 25, 1912, and September 16, 1913, in violation of section 4347, Minnesota General Statutes. Admitting original liability, the railway company relied upon the local statute of limitation, fixing six years as the time within which such actions must be begun. To this the \n\n[266 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n reply was that the prescribed period of limitation had been extended by paragraph (f),  206, Federal Transportation Act 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 462 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc), which provides:\n'The period of federal control shall not be computed as a part of the periods of limitation in actions against carriers or in claims for reparation to the Commission for causes of action arising prior to federal control.'\n\n And upon the sole point of law thus raised the cause is before us.\n The petitioner maintains that Congress intended to revive actions against carriers when the period designated by the state statute for bringing them had expired during federal control, and asserts that the mischief to be remedied indicates such purpose and the ordinary meaning of the words employed discloses it. The respondent insists that a statute should never be given retroactive effect where another construction is fairly permissible, as here; that if in the circumstances the act of Congress be so construed it would create new causes of action and thus permit the taking of property without due process of law.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota held, rightly, we think, that the Transportation Act was not intended to revive or restore rights of action barred before it became effective.\n'It is a rule of construction, that all statutes are to be considered prospective, unless the language is express to the contrary, or there is a necessary implication to that effect.'

BANK OF ATLANTA v. HOZIER(1925)\nNo. 260\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Marion Smith, John D. Little, Arthur G. Powell, and Max F. Goldstein, all of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner. \n\n[267 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur Heyman, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause arises from an intervention petition filed by respondent Hozier in a proceeding to administer the assets of Imbrie & Co., a partnership, pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia. The following statement from the opinion of that court (287 F. 158, 159) sufficiently indicates the material issues:\n'On March 3, 1921, in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, was filed a creditors' bill against Imbrie & Co., stock and bond dealers and brokers, citizens of New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, whose principal place of business was New York. Receivers were appointed. On the same day, in the superior court of Fulton county, Ga., other creditors, citizens of Georgia, sought and obtained a receiver for assets of Imbrie & Co. in Georgia connected with a branch office operated in Atlanta. On March 7, 1921, the New York receivers, by direction of the New York court, applied for ancillary receivership in this court and were, with the state court receiver, made such ancillary receivers. On March 8th, \n\n[267 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n Imbrie & Co. removed to this court the case in the Fulton superior court. The two proceedings were then consolidated by consent, and numerous interventions have been allowed in this court, among them that of I. S. Hozier. His claim, in brief, is that he gave Imbrie & Co. in Atlanta, on February 21, 1921, a check for $2,656.13, to be used as his brokers in buying certain stocks; that Imbrie & Co. deposited it to their credit in Fulton National Bank on February 23d; that the proceeds of its collection were still to the credit of Imbrie & Co. at said bank, though in equity belonging to Hozier, when the firm failed without having bought the stock, whereupon Fulton National Bank, on March 3d, offset certain notes it held against Imbrie & Co. against the deposit, absorbing it. Hozier prays that the bank be made a party and be required to pay the $2,656.13 to the receivers or to him. By an amendment he asks also a judgment against the estate in the receivers' hands, with a first lien or otherwise, if the bank could not be required to repay the money to them for him. This intervention was allowed, the bank was made a party and the issues made by answers to the intervention referred to a master. Exceptions to his report raise three principal questions: First, has this court, as a federal court, jurisdiction of this controversy; second, should it pass upon it, or remand the parties to the primary jurisdiction in New York; third, on the merits has the bank the right to make the set-off as against Hozier.'\n\n The trial court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the intervention petition as a dependent controversy, and decreed:\n'That the receivers in the above-stated consolidated cause recover from the Fulton National Bank of Atlanta the principal sum of twenty- six hundred fifty-six and 13\/100 dollars ($2,656.13), together with interest at the rate of seven per cent. (7%) per annum from the date of this judgment, and upon the recovery of same, that \n\n[267 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n said receivers pay said amount to I. S. Hozier, intervener, or his counsel of record.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment. The cause is here by certiorari. It is insisted that the trial court erred (1) in assuming jurisdiction of the intervention petition; and (2) in holding the bank liable for the amount of the deposited check.\n We are of opinion that in no proper sense was the petition dependent or ancillary to the cause instituted for the purpose of administering the assets of Imbrie & Co. Consequently, the trial court could not entertain it.\n The general rule is that, when a federal court has properly acquired jurisdiction over a cause, it may entertain, by intervention, dependent or ancillary controversies; but no controversy can be regarded as dependent or ancillary unless it has direct relation to property or assets actually or constructively drawn into the court's possession or control by the principal suit. Hoffman v. McClelland, \n264 \nU.S. 552, 558\n, 44 S. Ct. 407, and authorities there cited. And see Simkins' Federal Practice, pp. 740, 741. All parties seem to recognize this doctrine; they differ concerning its application to the facts presented by the present record.\n The proceeding under consideration cannot properly be called a suit by a receiver, on authority of the appointing court, to collect assets or to defend property rights. It was begun to recover property, claimed by a customer of the insolvent firm, which had passed into the hands of a third person.\n Hozier might have proceeded against the bank by an original proceeding and demanded adjudication of his claim to the alleged trust fund-pursued thus something which he insisted belonged to him and was unjustly withheld by the bank. This course was successfully taken in Union Stockyards Bank v. Gillespie, \n137 \nU.S. 411\n, 11 S. Ct. 118.\n As between Imbrie & Co., or the receivers appointed to administer their assets, and the bank, the \n\n[267 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n latter had the superior claim to the deposit or credit here involved; whether it could be required to account to the customer as for his money was a question between them. Bank of Metropolis v. New England Bank, 1 How. 234; 6 How. 212; Wilson & Co. v. Smith, 3 How. 763; National Bank v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n; Union Stockyards Bank v. Gillespie, supra. There were no funds in the receivers' possession and none subject to their demand as to which Hozier asserted any right; his claim was against something in the bank's possession and beyond the receivers' reach. His petition sought to compel them to litigate with the bank for his sole interest and without possibility of benefit to the estate. As shown by the decree quoted above, the expected fruit of the litigation was for petitioner alone. He had no right to bring the bank, which for jurisdictional purposes was to be deemed a citizen of Georgia (Judicial Code,  24, subd. 16 [Comp. St.  991]), into the federal court, or to interfere with the affairs of the estate by injecting this controversy concerning which the receivers had no material interest-wherein the estate might lose much, but could gain nothing.\n The decree is reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court. The costs in all the courts will be taxed against the intervener, respondent here. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGE W.

Maloy, all of Baltimore, Md., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Maryland prohibits common carriers of merchandise or freight by motor vehicle from using the public highways over specified routes without a permit. The Public Service Commission is charged with the duty to 'investigate the expediency of granting said permit' when applied for, and it is authorized to refuse the same if it 'deems the granting of such permit prejudicial to the welfare and convenience of the public.' Laws Md., 1922, c. 401,  4.\n George W. Bush & Sons Company applied for a permit to do an exclusively interstate business as a common carrier of freight over specified routes, alleging its willingness and intention to comply with all applicable regulations concerning the operation of motor vehicles. After due hearing the permit was denied. This suit was brought in a court of the state to restrain the state officials from interfering \n\n[267 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n with such use of the company's trucks. The bill alleged, and it was admitted by demurrer, that the highways were not unduly congested; that they are so constructed that they can carry burdens heavier than that which would be imposed by plaintiff's trucks; that the operation of its trucks would impose no different burden upon the highways than the operation of the trucks of the same kind and character by private persons, which was freely permitted; and that, in refusing the permit, the commission had considered merely 'whether or not existing lines of transportation would be benefited or prejudiced and in this way the public interest affected.' The plaintiff claimed that, regardless of permit, it was entitled to use the highways as a common carrier in exclusively interstate commerce. The trial court dismissed the bill. Its decree was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 143 Md. 570.1 The case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n This case presents two features which were not present in Buck v. Kuykendall (No. 345) \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 69 L. Ed. --, decided this day. The first is that the highways here in question were not constructed or improved with federal aid. This difference does not prevent the application of the rule declared in the Buck Case. The federal aid legislation is of significance, not because of the aid given by the United States for the construction of particular highways, but because those acts make clear the purpose of Congress that state highways shall be open to interstate commerce. The second feature is that here the permit was refused by the commission, not in obedience to a mandatory provision of the state statute, but in the exercise, in a proper manner, of the broad discretion vested in it. This difference also is not of legal significance in this connection. The state action in the Buck Case was held to be unconstitutional, not because the statute prescribed an arbitrary test for the granting of permits, or because the director of \n\n[267 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n public works had exercised the power conferred arbitrarily or unreasonably, but because the statute as construed and applied invaded a field reserved by the commerce clause for federal regulation.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents.

As yet nobody definitely knows what should be done. Manifestly, the exigency cannot be met through uniform rules laid down by Congress.\n Interstate commerce has been greatly aided-amazingly facilitated, indeed-through legislation and expenditures by the states.

Control by the states must continue; otherwise chaotic conditions will quickly develop. The problems are essentially local, and should be left with the local authorities unless and until something is done which really tends to obstruct the free flow of commercial in tercourse.\n The situation is similar to the one growing out of the necessity for harbor regulations.

Criminal anarchy is the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force or violence, or by assessination of the executive head or of any of the executive officials of government, or by any unlawful means. The advocacy of such doctrine either by word of mouth or writing is a felony.\n\n'Sec. 161. Advocacy of Criminal Anarchy. Any person who:\n\n'1.

The first charged that the defendant had advocated, advised and taught the duty, necessity and propriety of overthrowing and overturning organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, by certain writings therein set forth entitled 'The Left Wing Manifesto'; the second that he had printed, published and knowingly circulated and distributed a certain paper called 'The Revolutionary Age,' containing the writings set forth in the first count advocating, advising and teaching the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force, violence and unlawful means.\n The following facts were established on the trial by undisputed evidence and admissions: The defendant is a member of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, a dissenting branch or faction of that party formed in opposition to its dominant policy of 'moderate Socialism.' Membership in both is open to aliens as well as citizens. The Left Wing Section was organized nationally at a conference in New York City in June, 1919, attended by ninety delegates from twenty different States. The conference elected a National Council, of which the defendant was a member, and left to it the adoption of a 'Manifesto.' This was published in The Revolutionary Age, the official organ of the Left Wing. The defendant was on the board of managers of the paper and was its business manager. He arranged for the printing of the paper and took to the printer the manuscript of the first issue which contained the Left Wing Manifesto, and also a Communist Program and a Program of the Left Wing that had been adopted by the conference. Sixteen thousand \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 656]\n\u00a0\n copies were printed, which were delivered at the premises in New York City used as the office of the Revolutionary Age and the head quarters of the Left Wing, and occupied by the defendant and other officials. These copies were paid for by the defendant, as business manager of the paper. Employees at this office wrapped and mailed out copies of the paper under the defendant's direction; and copies were sold from this office. It was admitted that the defendant signed a card subscribing to the Manifesto and Program of the Left Wing, which all applicants were required to sign before being admitted to membership; that he went to different parts of the State to speak to branches of the Socialist Party about the principles of the Left Wing and advocated their adoption; and that he was responsible for the Manifesto as it appeared, that 'he knew of the publication, in a general way and he knew of its publication afterwards, and is responsible for the circulation.'\n There was no evidence of any effect resulting from the publication and circulation of the Manifesto.\n No witnesses were offered in behalf of the defendant.\n Extracts from the Manifesto are set forth in the margin. \n2\n Coupled with a review of the rise of Socialism, it \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 657]\n\u00a0\n condemned the dominant 'moderate Socialism' for its recognition of the necessity of the democratic parliamentary state; repudiated its policy of introducing Socialism by legislative measures; and advocated, in plain and unequivocal language, the necessity of accomplishing the 'Communist Revolution' by a militant and 'revolutionary Socialism,' based on 'the class struggle' and mobilizing \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 658]\n\u00a0\n the 'power of the proletariat in action,' through mass industrial revolts developing into mass political strikes and 'revolutionary mass action,' for the purpose of conquering and destroying the parliamentary state and establishing in its place, through a 'revoluntionary dictatorship of the proletariat,' the system of Communist Socialism. The then recent strikes in Seattle and Winnepeg3 were cited as instances of a development already verging on revolutionary action and suggestive of proletarian \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 659]\n\u00a0\n dictatorship, in which the strike-workers were 'trying to usurp the functions of municipal government'; and revolutionary Socialism, it was urged, must use these mass industrial revolts to broaden the strike, make it general and militant, and develop it into mass political strikes and revolutionary mass action for the annihilation of the parliamentary state.\n At the outset of the trial the defendant's counsel objected to the introduction of any evidence under the \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 660]\n\u00a0\n indictment on the grounds that, as a matter of law, the Manifesto 'is not in contravention of the statute,' and that 'the statute is in contravention of' the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This objection was denied. They also moved, at the close of the evidence, to dismiss the indictment and direct an acquittal 'on the grounds stated in the first objection to evidence,' \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 661]\n\u00a0\n and again on the grounds that 'the indictment does not charge an offense' and the evidence 'does not show an offense.' These motions were also denied.\n The court, among other things, charged the jury, in substance, that they must determine what was the intent, purpose and fair meaning of the Manifesto; that its words must be taken in their ordinary meaning, as they would be understood by people whom it might reach; that a mere statement or analysis of social and economic facts and historical incidents, in the nature of an essay, accompanied by prophecy as to the future course of events, but with no teaching, advice or advocacy of action, would not constitute the advocacy, advice or teaching of a doctrine for the overthrow of government within the meaning of the statute; that a mere statement that unlawful acts might accomplish such a purpose would be insufficient, unless there was a teaching, advising the advocacy of employing such unlawful acts for the purpose of overthrowing government; and that if the jury had a reasonable doubt that the Manifesto did teach, advocate or advise the duty, necessity or propriety of using unlawful means for the overthrowing of organized government, the defendant was entitled to an acquittal.\n The defendant's counsel submitted two requests to charge which embodied in substance the statement that to constitute criminal anarchy within the meaning of the statute it was necessary that the language used or published should advocate, teach or advise the duty, necessity or propriety of doing 'some definite or immediate act or acts' or force, violence or unlawfulness directed toward the overthrowing of organized government. These were denied further than had been charged. Two other requests to charge embodied in substance the statement that to constitute guilt the language used or published must be 'reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite certain persons' to acts of force, violence or unlawfulness, \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 662]\n\u00a0\n with the object of overthrowing organized government. These were also denied.\n The Appellate Division, after setting forth extracts from the Manifesto and referring to the Left Wing and Communist Programs published in the same issue of the Revolutionary Age, said:4\n'It is perfectly plain that the plan and purpose advocated ... contemplate the overthrow and destruction of the governments of the United States and of all the States, not by the free action of the majority of the people through the ballot box in electing representatives to authorize a change of government by amending or changing the Constitution, ... but by immediately organizing the industrial proletariat into militant Socialist unions and at the earliest opportunity through mass strike and force and violence, if necessary, compelling the government to cease to function, and then through a proletarian dictatorship, taking charge of and appropriating all property and administering it and governing through such dictatorship until such time as the proletariat is permitted to administer and govern it. ... The articles in question are not a discussion of ideas and theories. They advocate a doctrine deliberately determined upon and planned for militantly disseminating a propaganda advocating that it is the duty and necessity of the proletariat engaged in industrial pursuits to organize to such an extent that, by massed strike, the wheels of government may ultimately be stopped and the government overthrown. ...'\n\n The Court of Appeals held that the Manifesto 'advocated the overthrow of this government by violence, or by unlawful means.' \n5\n In one of the opinions representing \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 663]\n\u00a0\n the views of a majority of the court,6 it was said:\n'It will be seen ... that this defendant through the Manifesto ... advocated the destruction of the state and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. ... To advocate ... the commission of this conspiracy or action by mass strike whereby government is cripped, the administration of justice paralyzed, and the health, morals and welfare of a community endangered, and this for the purpose of bringing about a revolution in the state, is to advocate the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means.'\n\n In the other7 it was said:\n'As we read this Manifesto ... we feel entirely clear that the jury were justified in rejecting the view that it was a mere academic and harmless discussion of the advantages of communism and advanced socialism' and 'in regarding it as a justification and advocacy of action by one class which would destory the rights of all other classes and overthrow the state itself by use of revolutionary mass strikes. It is true that there is no advocacy in specific terms of the use of ... force or violence. There was no need to be. Some things are so commonly incident to others that they do not need to be mentioned when the underlying purpose is described.'\n\n And both the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals held the statute constitutional.\n The specification of the errors relied on relates solely to the specific rulings of the trial court in the matters hereinbefore set out. \n8\n The correctness of the verdict is not \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 664]\n\u00a0\n questioned, as the case was submitted to the jury. The sole contention here is, essentially, that as there was no evidence of any concrete result flowing from the publication of the Manifesto or of circumstances showing the likelihood of such result, the statute as construed and applied by the trial court penalizes the mere utterance, as such, of 'doctrine' having no quality of incitement, without regard either to the circumstances of its utterance or to the likelihood of unlawful sequences; and that, as the exercise of the right of free expression with relation to government is only punishable 'in circumstances involving likelihood of substantive evil,' the statute contravenes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The argument in support of this contention rests primarily upon the following propositions: 1st, That the 'liberty' protected by the Fourteenth Amendment includes the liberty of speech and of the press; and 2d, That while liberty of expression 'is not absolute,' it may be restrained 'only in circumstances where its exercise bears a causal relation with some substantive evil, consummated, attempted or likely,' and as the statute 'takes no account of circumstances,' it unduly restrains this liberty and is therefore unconstitutional.\n The precise question presented, and the only question which we can consider under this writ of error, then is, whether the statute, as construed and applied in this case, by the State courts, deprived the defendant of his liberty of expression in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The statute does not penalize the utterance or publication of abstract 'doctrine' or academic discussion having no quality of incitement to any concrete action. It is not aimed against mere historical or philosophical essays. It does not restrain the advocacy of changes in the form of government by constitutional and lawful means. What it prohibits is language advocating, advising or teaching \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 665]\n\u00a0\n the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. These words imply urging to action. Advocacy is defined in the Century Dictionary as: '1. The act of pleading for, supporting, or recommending; active espousal.' It is not the abstract 'doctrine' of overthrowing organized government by unlawful means which is denounced by the statute, but the advocacy of action for the accomplishment of that purpose. It was so construed and applied by the trial judge, who specifically charged the jury that:\n'A mere grouping of historical events and a prophetic deduction from them would neither constitute advocacy, advice or teaching of a doctrine for the overthrow of government by force, violence or unlawful means. [And] if it were a mere essay on the subject, as suggested by counsel, based upon deductions from alleged historical events, with no teaching, advice or advocacy of action, it would not constitute a violation of the statute. ...'\n\n The Manifesto, plainly, is neither the statement of abstract doctrine nor, as suggested by counsel, mere prediction that industrial disturbances and revolutionary mass strikes will result spontaneously in an inevitable process of evolution in the economic system. It advocates and urges in fervent language mass action which shall progressively foment industrial disturbances and through political mass strikes and revolutionary mass action action overthrow and destroy organized parliamentary government. It concludes with a call to action in these words:\n'The proletariat revolution and the Communist reconstruction of society-the struggle for these-is now indispensable. ... The Communist International calls the proletariat of the world to the final struggle!'\n\n This is not the expression of philosophical abstraction, the mere prediction of future events; it is the language of direct incitement.\n The means advocated for bringing about the destruction of organized parliamentary government, namely, mass industrial \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 666]\n\u00a0\n revolts usurping the functions of municipal government, political mass strikes directed against the parliamentary state, and revolutionary mass action for its final destruction, necessarily imply the use of force and violence, and in their essential nature are inherently unlawful in a constitutional government of law and order. That the jury were warranted in finding that the Manifesto advocated not merely the abstract doctrine of overthrowing organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, but action to that end, is clear.\n For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press-which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress-are among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States. We do not regard the incidental statement in Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, \n259 \nU.S. 530, 543\n, 42 S. Ct. 516, 27 A. L. R. 27, that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no restrictions on the States concerning freedom of speech, as determinative of this question. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It is a fundamental principle, long established, that the freedom of speech and of the press which is secured by the Constitution, does not confer an absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible use of language and prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom. 2 Story on the Constitution ( 5th Ed.)  1580, p. 634; Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 17 S. Ct. 326; Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S. Ct. 556, 10 Ann. Cas. 689; Fox v. Washington, 236 \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 667]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 273, 276, 35 S. Ct. 383; Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 204, 206\n, 39 S. Ct. 249; Debs v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 211, 213\n, 39 S. Ct. 252; Schaefer v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 466, 474\n, 40 S. Ct. 259; Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 41 S. Ct. 125; Warren v. United States, 183 F. 718, 721, 106 C. C. A. 156, 33 L. R. A. (N. S.) 800. Reasonably limited, it was said by Story in the passage cited, this freedom is an inestimable privilege in a free government; without such limitation, it might become the scourge of the republic.\n That a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to corrupt public morals, incite to crime, or disturb the public peace, is not open to question. Robertson v. Baldwin, supra, p. 281 (17 S. Ct. 326); Patterson v. Colorado, supra, p. 462 (27 S. Ct. 556); Fox v. Washington, supra, p. 277 (35 S. Ct. 383); Gilbert v. Minnesota, supra, p. 339 (41 S. Ct. 125); People v. Most, 171 N. Y. 423, 431, 64 N. E. 175, 58 L. R. A. 509; State v. Holm, 139 Minn. 267, 275, 166 N. W. 181, L. R. A. 1918C, 304; State v. Hennessy, 114 Wash. 351, 359, 195 P. 211; State v. Boyd, 86 N. J. Law, 75, 79, 91 A. 586; State v. McKee, 73 Conn. 18, 27, 46 A. 409, 49 L. R. A. 542, 84 Am. St. Rep. 124. Thus it was held by this Court in the Fox Case, that a State may punish publications advocating and encouraging a breach of its criminal laws; and, in the Gilbert Case, that a State may punish utterances teaching or advocating that its citizens should not assist the United States in prosecuting or carrying on war with its public enemies.\n And, for yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of organized government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means. These imperil its own existence as a constitutional State. Freedom of speech and press, said Story, supra, does not protect disturbances to the public peace or the attempt to subvert the government. It does not protect publications or teachings which tend to subvert or imperil the government or to impede or hinder it in the performance of its governmental duties. State v. \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 668]\n\u00a0\n Holm, supra, p. 275 (166 N. W. 181). It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow of government by force; the punishment of those who publish articles which tend to destroy organized society being essential to the security of freedom and the stability of the state. People v. Most, supra, pp. 431, 432 (64 N. E. 175). And a State may penalize utterances which openly advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of government of the United States and the several States, by violence or other unlawful means. People v. Lloyd, 304 Ill. 23, 34, 136 N. E. 505. See, also, State v. Tachin, 92 N. J. Law, 269, 274, 106 A. 145, and People v. Steelik, 187 Cal. 361, 375, 203 P. 78. In short this freedom does not deprive a State of the primary and essential right of self preservation; which, so long as human governments endure, they cannot be denied. Turner v. Williams, \n194 \nU.S. 279, 294\n, 24 S. Ct. 719. In Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 419\n, 38 S. Ct. 560, 564 (62 L. Ed. 1186), it was said:\n'The safeguarding and fructification of free and constitutional institutions is the very basis and mainstay upon which the freedom of the press rests, and that freedom, therefore, does not and cannot be held to include the right virtually to destroy such institutions.'\n\n By enacting the present statute the State has determined, through its legislative body, that utterances advocating the overthrow of organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized in the exercise of its police power. That determination must be given great weight. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S. Ct. 273. And the case is to be considered 'in the light of the principle that the State is primarily the judge of regulations required in the interest of public safety and welfare'; and that its police 'statutes may only be declared unconstitutional where they are arbitrary or unreasonable \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 669]\n\u00a0\n attempts to exercise authority vested in the State in the public interest.' Great Northern Ry. v. Clara City, \n246 \nU.S. 434, 439\n, 38 S. Ct. 346, 347 ( 62 L. Ed. 817). That utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means, present a sufficient danger of substantive evil to bring their punishment within the range of legislative discretion, is clear. Such utterances, by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the State. They threaten breaches of the peace and ultimate revolution. And the immediate danger is none the less real and substantial, because the effect of a given utterance cannot be accurately foreseen. The State cannot reasonably be required to measure the danger from every such utterance in the nice balance of a jeweler's scale. A single revolutionary spark may kindle a fire that, smouldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration. It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration. It cannot reasonably be required to defer the adoption of measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency. In People v. Lloyd, supra, p. 35 (136 N. E. 512), it was aptly said:\n'Manifestly, the legislature has authority to forbid the advocacy of a doctrine designed and intended to overthrow the government without waiting until there is a present and imminent danger of the success of the plan advocated. If the State were compelled to wait until the apprehended danger became certain, then its right to protect itself would come into being simultaneously with the overthrow of the government, when there \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 670]\n\u00a0\n would be neither prosecuting officers nor courts for the enforcement of the law.'\n\n We cannot hold that the present statute is an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State unwarrantably infringing the freedom of speech or press; and we must and do sustain its constitutionality.\n This being so it may be applied to every utterance-not too trivial to be beneath the notice of the law-which is of such a character and used with such intent and purpose as to bring it within the prohibition of the statute. This principle is illustrated in Fox v. Washington, supra, p. 277 ( 35 S. Ct. 383); Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 624\n, 40 S. Ct. 17; Schaefer v. United States, supra, pp. 479, 480 (40 S. Ct. 259); Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239, 250\n, 251 S., 40 S. Ct. 205,10 and Gilbert v. Minnesota, supra, p. 333 (41 S. Ct. 125). In other words, when the legislative body has determined generally, in the constitutional exercise of its discretion, that utterances of a certain kind involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be punished, the question whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely, in and of itself, to bring about the substantive evil, is not open to consideration. It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that the use of the language comes within its prohibition.\n It is clear that the question in such cases is entirely different from that involved in those cases where the statute merely prohibits certain acts involving the danger of substantive evil, without any reference to language itself, and it is sought to apply its provisions to language \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 671]\n\u00a0\n used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the prohibited results. There, if it be contended that the statute cannot be applied to the language used by the defendant because of its protection by the freedom of speech or press, it must necessarily be found, as an original question, without any previous determination by the legislative body, whether the specific language used involved such likelihood of bringing about the substantive evil as to deprive it of the constitutional protection. In such case it has been held that the general provisions of the statute may be constitutionally applied to the specific utterance of the defendant if its natural tendency and probable effect was to bring about the substantive evil which the legislative body might prevent. Schenck v. United States, supra, p. 51 (39 S. Ct. 247); Debs v. United States, supra, pp. 215, 216 (39 S. Ct. 252). And the general statement in the Schenck Case, p. 52 (39 S. Ct. 249) that the 'question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils,'-upon which great reliance is placed in the defendant's argument-was manifestly intended, as shown by the context, to apply only in cases of this class, and has no application to those like the present, where the legislative body itself has previously determined the danger of substantive evil arising from utterances of a specified character.\n The defendant's brief does not separately discuss any of the rulings of the trial court. It is only necessary to say that, applying the general rules already stated, we find that none of them involved any invasion of the constitutional rights of the defendant. It was not necessary, within the meaning of the statute, that the defendant should have advocated 'some definite or immediate act or acts' of force, violence or unlawfulness. It was sufficient if such acts were advocated in general terms; and it was not essential that their immediate execution should \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 672]\n\u00a0\n have been advocated. Nor was it necessary that the language should have been 'reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite certain persons' to acts of force, violence or unlawfulness. The advocacy need not be addressed to specific persons. Thus, the publication and circulation of a newspaper article may be an encouragement or endeavor to persuade to murder, although not addressed to any person in particular. Queen v. Most, L. R. 7 Q. B. D. 244.\n We need not enter upon a consideration of the English common law rule of seditious libel or the Federal Sedition Act of 1798,11 to which reference is made in the defendant's brief. These are so unlike the present statute, that we think the decisions under them cast no helpful light upon the questions here.\n And finding, for the reasons stated, that the statute is not in itself unconstitutional, and that it has not been applied in the present case in derogation of any constitutional right, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and I are of opinion that this judgment should be reversed. The general principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to be included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has been given to the word 'liberty' as there used, although perhaps it may be accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is allowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to govern the laws of the United States. If I am right then I think that the criterion sanctioned by the full Court in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Ct. 247, 249 (63 L. Ed. 470), applies:\n'The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive \n\n[268 U.S. 652, 673]\n\u00a0\n evils that [the State] has a right to prevent.'\n\n It is true that in my opinion this criterion was departed from in Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616\n, 40 S. Ct. 17, but the convictions that I expressed in that case are too deep for it to be possible for me as yet to believe that it and Schaefer v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 466\n, 40 S. Ct. 259, have settled the law. If what I think the correct test is applied it is manifest that there was no present danger of an attempt to overthrow the government by force on the part of the admittedly small minority who shared the defendant's views. It is said that this manifesto was more than a theory, that it was an incitement. Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth. The only difference between the expression of an opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the result. Eloquence may set fire to reason. But whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us it had no chance of starting a present conflagration. If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.\n If the publication of this document had been laid as an attempt to induce an uprising against government at once and not at some indefinite time in the future it would have presented a different question. The object would have been one with which the law might deal, subject to the doubt whether there was any danger that the publication could produce any result, or in other words, whether it was not futile and too remote from possible consequences. But the indictment alleges the publication and nothing more. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws 1909, c. 88; Consol. Laws 1909, c. 40. This statute was originally enacted in 1902.

Capitalism, the prevailing system of society, is in process of disintegration and collapse. ... Humanity can be saved from its last excesses only by the Communist Revolution. There can now be only the Socialism which is one in temper and purpose with the proletarian revolutionary struggle. ... The class struggle is the heart of Socialism. Without strict conformity to the class struggle, in its revolutionary implications, Socialism becomes either sheer Utopianism, or a method of reaction. ... The dominant Socialism united with the capitalist governments to prevent a revolution. The Russian Revolution was the first act of the proletariat against the war and Imperialism. ... [The] proletaiat, urging on the poorer peasantry, conquered power. It accomplished a proletarian revolution by means of the Bolshevik policy of 'all power to the Soviets,'-organizing the new transitional state of proletarian dictatorship. ... Moderate Socialism affirms that the bourgeois, democratic parliamentary state is the necessary basis for the introduction of Socialism. ... Revolutionary Socialism, on the contrary, insists that the democratic parliamentary state can never be the basis for the introduction of Socialism; that it is necessary to destroy the parliamentary state, and construct a new state of the organized producers, which will deprive the bourgeoisie of political power, and function as a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. ... Revolutionary Socialism alone is capable of mobilizing the proletariat for Socialism, for the conquest of the power of the state, by means of revolutionary mass action proletarian dictatorship. ... Imperialism is dominant in the United States, which is now a world power. ... The war \n\n has aggrandized American Capitalism, instead stead of weakening it as in Europe. ... These conditions modify our immediate task, but do not alter its general character; this is not the moment of revolution, but it is the moment of revolutionary struggle. ... Strikes are developing which verge on revolutionary action, and which the suggestion of proletarian dictatorship is apparent, the striker-workers trying to usurp functions of municipal government, as in Seattle and Winnipeg. The mass struggle of the proletariat is coming into being. ... These strikes will constitute the determining feature of proletarian action in the days to come. Revolutionary Socialism must use these mass industrial revolts to broaden the strike, to make it general and militant; use the strike for political objectives, and, finally, develop the mass political strike against Capitalism and the state. Revolutionary Socialism must base itself on the mass struggles of the proletariat, engage directly in these struggles while emphasizing the revolutionary purposes of Socialism and the proletarian movement. The mass strikes of the American proletariat provide the material basis out of which to develop the concepts and action of revolutionary Socialism. ... Our task ... is to articulate and organize the mass of the unorganized industrial proletariat, which constitutes the basis for a militant Socialism. The struggle for the revolutionary industrial unionism of the proletariat becomes an indispensable phase of revolutionary Socialism, on the basis of which to broaden and deepen the action of the militant proletariat, developing reserves for the ultimate conquest of power. ... Revolutionary Socialism adheres to the class struggle because through the class struggle alone-the mass struggle-can the industrial proletariat secure immediate concessions and finally conquer power by organizing the industrial government of the working class. The class struggle is a political struggle ... in the sense that its objective is political-the overthrow of the political organization upon which capitalistic exploitation depends, and the introduction of a new social system. The direct objective is the conquest by the proletariat of the power of the state. Revolutionary Socialism does not propose to 'capture' the bourgeois parliamentary state, but to conquer and destroy it. Revolutionary Socialism, accordingly, repudiates the policy of introducing Socialism by means of legislative measures on the basis of the bourgeois state. ... It proposes to conquer by means of political action ... in the revolutionary Marxian sense, which does not simply mean parliamentarism, but the class action of the proletariat in any form having as its objective the conquest of the power of of the state . ... Parliamentary action which emphasizes the implacable character of the class struggles is an indispensable means of agitation. ... But parliamentarism cannot conquer the power of the state for the proletariat . ... It is accomplished, not by the legislative representatives of the proletariat, but by the mass power of the proletariat in action. The supreme power of the proletariat inheres in the political mass strike, in using the industrial mass power of the proletariat for political objectives. Revolutionary Socialism, accordingly, recognizes that the supreme form of proletarian political action is the political mass strike . ... The power of the proleatariat lies fundamentally in its control of the industrial process. The mobilization of this control in action against the burgeois state and Capitalism means the end of Capitalism, the initial form of the revolutionary mass action that will conquer the power of the state. ... The revolution starts with strikes of protest, developing into mass political strikes and then into revolutionary mass action for the conquest of the power of the state. Mass action becomes political in purpose while extra-parliamentary in form; it is equally a process of revolution and the \n revolution itself in operation. The final objective of mass action is the conquest of the power of the state, the annihilation of the bourgeois parliamentary state and the introduction of the transition proletarian state, functioning as a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat . ... The bourgeois parliamentary state is the organ of the bourgeoisie for the coercion of the proletariat. The revolutionary proletariat must, accordingly, destroy this state. ... It is therefore necessary that the proletariat organize its own state for the coercion and suppression of the bourgeoisie. ... Proletarian dictatorship is a recognition of the necessity for a revolutionary state to coerce and suppress the bourgeoisie; it is equally a recognition of the fact that, in the Communist reconstruction of society, the proletariat as a class alone counts. ... The old machinery of the state cannot be used by the revolutionary proletariat. It must be destroyed. The proletariat creates a new state, based directly upon the industrially organized producers, upon the industrial unions or Soviets, or a combination of both. It is that state alone, functioning as a dictatorship of the proletariat, that can realize Socialism. ... While the dictatorship of the proletariat proforms its negative task of crushing the old order, it performs the positive task of constructing the new. Together with the government of the proletarian dictatorship, there is developed a new 'government,' which is no longer government in the old sense, since it concerns itself with the management of production and not with the government of persons. Out of workers' control of industry, introduced by the proletarian dictatorship, there develops the complete structure of Communist Socialism,-industrial self- government of the communistically organized producers. When this structure is completed, which implies the complete expropriation of the bourgeoisie economically and politically, the dictatorship of the proletariat ends, in its place coming the full and free social and individual autonomy of the Communist order. ... It is not a problem of immediate revolution. It is a problem of the immediate revolutionary struggle. The revolutionary epoch of the final struggle against Capitalism may last for years and tens of years; but the communist International offers a policy and program immediate and ultimate in scope, that provides for the immediate class struggle against Capitalism, in its revolutionary implications, and for the final act of the conquest of power. The old order is in decay. Civilization is in collapse. The proletarian revolution and the Communist reconstruction of society-the struggle for these-is now indispensable. This is the message of the Communist International to the workers of the world. The Communist International calls the proletariat of the world to the final struggle!' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] There was testimony at the trial that 'there was an extended strike at Winnipeg commencing May 15, 1919, during which the production and supply of necessities, transportation, postal and telegraphic communication and fire and sanitary protection were suspended or seriously curtailed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] People v.

HARRIS(1925)\nNo. 187\nArgued: January 16, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 352, 353]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert M. Rainey and Streeter B. Flynn, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Robert F. Blair, of Tulsa, Okl., and George S. Ramsey, of Muskogee, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in a state court of Oklahoma to determine title to an undivided half interest in certain lands in that state lying within the former Creek Nation. The case is here both on error and certiorari. \n263 \nU.S. 696\n, 44 S. Ct. 133. The latter is the appropriate remedy, and the writ of error will he dismissed.\n Defendants in error claim title through one Cloria Grayson, and it is admitted that they acquired by mesne conveyances, and have whatever title she had. The lands were originally allotted in the names of two freedmen, citizens of the Creek Nation, who had died prior to the allotment, leaving Gertrude Grayson and another as \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n their only Creek heirs at law, and ownership of an undivided half interest in the lands passed to each of them. Gertrude Grayson died intestate and without issue in 1907, leaving as her next of kin her maternal grandmother, Cloria Grayson, who was not a Creek citizen, nor a descendant of a Creek citizen, and these plaintiffs in error, remote kindred in various degrees, all of whom were Creek citizens. This was prior to the admission of Indian Territory and the territory of Oklahoma as the state of Oklahoma, and by the Act of May 2, 1890, c. 182, 26 Stat. 81, 95,  31, the general law in force in Indian Territory in respect of descents and distributions was chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas. If this law applies, it is conceded that Cloria Grayson succeeded to the half interest of Gertrude Grayson as her sole heir at law, in which event title of defendants in error is good, and plaintiffs in error have no case. The contention on behalf of plaintiffs in error, however, is that the rights of the parties are controlled by the provisos found in paragraph 6 of the Supplemental Creek Agreement, ratified and confirmed by the Act of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, 501, as follows:\n'6. The provisions of the Act of Congress approved March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. 861), in so far as they provide for descent and distribution according to the laws of the Creek Nation, are hereby repealed and the descent and distribution of land and money provided for by said act shall be in accordance with chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas now in force in Indian Territory: Provided, that only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendants shall inherit lands of the Creek Nation: And provided further, that if there be no person of Creek citizenship to take the descent and distribution of said estate, then the inheritance shall go to noncitizen heirs in the order named in said chapter 49.' \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n In addition to claim of title, defendants in error denied that plaintiffs in error were Creek citizens, and alleged in bar adverse possession of the lands for the applicable statutory period. The trial court found for plaintiffs in error on all issues, and rendered a decree in their favor. Upon appeal the state Supreme Court reversed the decree, upon the assumption that the provisos in paragraph 6 related only to the devolution of the allotment from the allottee-that is, the first succession-and that, since Gertrude Grayson was not the allottee, but inherited her half interest by operation of law, the provisos had no application. 90 Okl. 147, 216 P. 446. The effect of this ruling was to read into the provisos a limitation which plainly is not there, apparently induced by the belief that a literal interpretation would lead to absurd and unwise results.\n\n The conclusion is not in accord with the prior views of this court, to which the state Supreme Court gave no consideration. In Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422\n, 35 S. Ct. 119, it was held that the proviso, that only citizens of the Creek Nation and their Creek descendants should 'inherit lands of the Creek Nation,' looked to the future as well as to the present. The theory had been advanced that lands which had passed into private ownership were no longer lands of the tribe ( that is to say, no longer 'lands of the Creek Nation'), and therefore not within the words of the proviso. Answering that theory this court said ( page 427 [35 S. Ct. 121]):\n'We think the words indicated were merely descriptive of the body of lands which were being allotted in severalty and subjected to the incidents of individual ownership, that is, the lands in the Creek Nation. In that sense they would include the lands as well after allotment as before. The section as a whole shows that it looked to the future no less than to the present, and was intended to prescribe rules of descent applicable to all Creek allotments. Nothing in the provisos indicates that they were to be less comprehensive. Their purpose was to \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n give Creek citizens and their Creek descendants a preferred right to inherit, and no reason is perceived for giving such a preference where a citizen entitled to an allotment died before receiving it that would not be equally applicable if he had died after it was received.'\n\n In the present case stress is laid by defendants in error upon the use of the word 'allotments' in the phrase 'to prescribe rules of descent applicable to all Creek allotments,' and it is insisted that the court meant thereby to limit the operation of the proviso to lands in their descent from the allottee and not thereafter. The word was not used in that restricted sense, but in the broader sense, which includes all Creek lands which had gone through the process of allotment.\n The purpose and policy of the provisos rest upon tribal rather than family sentiment, a sentiment which put the interests of the tribe above those of the family, and regarded the claims which spring from tribal membership rather than those arising from close degrees of kinship. This view is expressed in the later case of Campbell v. Wadsworth, \n248 \nU.S. 169, 175\n, 39 S. Ct. 63, dealing with the Seminole Agreement of 1899 (31 Stat. 250). Under the provision in that agreement that, if any member of the tribe die after enrollment, the lands, etc., to which he would be entitled, if living, 'shall descend to his heirs who are Seminole citizens,' it was held that the lands of an Indian, enrolled as a Seminole, did not descend to his wife and daughters, enrolled only as Creeks. Answering the position of the state Supreme Court that only 'the most powerful and impelling reasons' could induce it to hold that the Indians intended to exclude their own children from sharing in their property after death, this court said:\n'While it is true that it seems unnatural for the Indians to have preferred more distant relatives to their own children in providing for the descent and distribution of their property, yet from the terms of the act before us, and also \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n from the provisions of the Supplemental Creek Agreement that 'only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendants shall inherit lands of the Creek Nation' (32 Stat. 500), it is clear that with the Indians the interests of the tribe were paramount to those of the family and it was with a knowledge of the mode of life of their primitive people, better and more intimate than the courts can now command, that they determined that this paramount purpose would best be served by giving to children born of mixed marriages the tribal status of their mother.'\n\n The lands of the Creek Nation were tribal lands and the evident purpose of the Indians was to continue at least a semblance of that status so far as it could be done consistently with their distribution in severalty. With the wisdom of that purpose we have nothing to do. It is enough that Congress respected it and gave to it the sanction of law.\n On behalf of defendants in error, it is asserted: (1) That there was an entire absence of proof that plaintiffs in error are citizens of the Creek Nation, and we are asked to review the record in that respect in order to determine whether there was any basis for the claim of federal right; and (2) that an examination of the record will show that the plea of the statute of limitations was fully established and, therefore, the decision of the state Supreme Court reasonably may be affirmed on that nonfederal ground.\n The point that the evidence fails to show that plaintiffs in error were Creek citizens presents a pure question of fact. The trial court found they were. The state Supreme Court expressly affirmed the finding, and, recognizing the existence of the federal question in the case, put its decision denying the federal right upon an erroneous view of the law. The denial was not the result of the finding of fact, nor is that finding so intermingled with the conclusion of law in respect of the federal right as to cause \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n it to be necessary to consider the matter of fact in order to pass upon the federal question. See AEtna Life Ins. Co. et al. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389\n, 45 S. Ct. 129, 69 L. Ed. -- (December 15, 1924); Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 325 S., 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L.

The effect of the finding was to establish the existence of a preliminary fact, related to the federal right only in the sense that it brought the case within the reach of the federal law relied on, and called for a determination of the federal question then presented. In other words, the finding simply established a condition, not as a basis upon which to rest a decision of the question of federal right one way or the other, but upon which that question became an issue for consideration and determination. In such case, the ordinary rule applies that the decision of the state court upon a question of fact cannot be made the subject of inquiry here. Telluride Power Co. v. Rio Grande, etc., Ry., \n175 \nU.S. 639, 645\n, 20 S. Ct. 245; Illinois v. Economy Power Co., \n234 \nU.S. 497, 523\n, 524 S., 34 S. Ct. 973; Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 668, et seq., 14 S.

Williams, 9 Wall. 785, 786.\n Nor need we inquire into the defense of the statute of limitations. The decision now under review entirely ignores it. The rule that when the decision of a state court may rest upon a nonfederal ground adequate to support it, this court will not take jurisdiction to determine the federal question, has no application where, as here, the nonfederal ground might have been considered by the state court but was not.

But that opinion, it appears, was \n\n[267 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n withdrawn and the present decision, rendered after a rehearing, is the only one open to our consideration.

ROAD DIST.(1925)\nNo. 389\nArgued: January 8, 1925Decided: January 19, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George B. Rose, D. H. Cantrell, J. F. Loughborough, and A. W. Dobyns, all of Little Rock, Ark., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry D. Ashley, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the petitioner against Road Improvement District No. 7 of Poinsett County, Arkansas. It alleges that the District was organized under acts creating the District and in the second \n\n[267 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n statute confirming the District's assessment of benefits; that after the assessment the District issued its negotiable bonds, as authorized by the acts; that the bonds are in the hands of innocent purchasers for value before maturity; that, as also authorized, the bonds are secured by a mortgage of the assessments and all other assets of the District, to the plaintiff as trustee for the bondholders; and that by the terms of the acts after a default for more than thirty days in payment of interest or principal, a receiver shall be appointed to take charge of the affairs of the District. A default is alleged and is explained by a decree of the Chancery Court of Poinsett County that set aside the assessment securing the bonds and enjoined the District from paying any money belonging to it. The plaintiff and the bondholders were not parties to the suit and the decree saved their rights, but of course it prevents their getting any payment until they are relieved. The District Court made a decree for the plaintiff and directed a receiver appointed by it to collect the taxes theretofore levied to the extent necessary to pay the outstanding bonds and coupons. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court had no jurisdiction and ordered the bill to be dismissed. Road Imp. Dist. No. 7 of Poinsett County, Ark., v. Guardian Savings & Trust Co., 298 F. 272.\n The acts from which the District got its existence and power were Act No. 322 of Road Laws of the State for 1919, and Act No. 45 of the Acts of 1920, the second being an amendment of the first and a declaration and enactment that the assessments of benefits have been made and are confirmed. The plan of the first was that the assessment should be made at the outset and that thereupon the county court should enter an order 'which shall have all the force of a judgment' that there should be assessed upon the real property of the district a tax sufficient to pay the estimated cost of the improvement with ten per cent. added, in the proportion of the benefits, to be paid in annual instalments, not to exceed ten per cent. for any \n\n[267 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n one year. The tax is made a lien upon the land and in this way a security is created and the statute allows it to be mortgaged, as was done in this case. If any bond or coupon is not paid within thirty days of its maturity it is made the duty of the Chancery Court of Poinsett County to appoint a receiver to collect the taxes and pay what is due, and power is given to direct the receiver to foreclose the lien on the lands.\n The ground on which jurisdiction was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals was that the power to levy and collect taxes was a legislative function of the state which could not be usurped by a federal court. But while that may be true as a general doctrine, it cannot apply when a state has authorized and confirmed an assessment and a mortgage of it as security for bonds that the public is invited to buy, and has provided in terms for a collection by a receiver appointed in equity if there should be a default. There is no longer any legislative act to be done, and there is no usurpation of powers in following the course provided by state law. It seems to be recognized Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 U.S. 472\n, that a receiver might be appointed by a Court of Chancery when that remedy was contemplated by the contract, as it fairly may be said to have been contemplated here. The subject-matter of the mortgage and the possible foreclosure of the lien require the intervention of such a court if right is to be done. In the argument before us there was some suggestion that the chancery power was confined to the state court named in the statute. But the decisions have done away with such a limitation and it was not relied upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., \n196 \nU.S. 239\n, 25 S. Ct. 251; Road Improvement District v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 547, 555\n, 42 S. Ct. 250. The state law is not merely an enlargement of the remedial powers of a local court as in Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, 261 \n\n[267 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 491, 43 S. Ct. 454, it recognizes the inadequacy of the remedy at law and is an attempt to give to purchasers of bonds the assurance of adequate relief against shortcomings that experience has taught the business world to apprehend. We see no reason why it should not succeed. Campbellsville Lumber Co. v. Hubbert, 112 F. 718, 50 C. C. A. 435; Stansell v. Levee Board (D. C.) 13 F. 846; Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall. 175.\n The respondent attempted to open the general merits of the case. If there is anything in the effort, which we do not imply, we shall leave that for further consideration below. The Circuit Court of Appeals regarded the case as stopped at the outset by want of jurisdiction. In that we think it erred.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGULF REFINING CO. v.

United States, 260 U. S. \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 134]\n\u00a0\n 545, 43 S. Ct. 200. The suits were brought by the United States to have its title to certain tracts of land confirmed, its possession thereof restored, and defendants enjoined from setting up claims thereto, etc. In addition, the government prayed for an accounting in respect of the oil and gas removed from the lands by the defendants. We held that the suits primarily involved the question of title to the lands and their protection against continuing trespasses, to which the accounting was incidental and dependent, and that the causes of action being, therefore, essentially local, the measure of damages to be allowed on the accounting came within the controlling scope of article 501 of the Civil Code of Louisiana, under which the cost of production must be first deducted from the value of the oil produced, even though the defendants went into possession in technical bad faith, but in moral good faith.\n The cases were referred to a master, who found the primary issues in favor of the government, and made an accounting up to January 1, 1918. At that time, the cost of drilling, equipping, and operating the wells, through and by means of which the oil was extracted, greatly exceeded the value of the oil produced, and, in accordance with the Louisiana rule, no recovery on the accounting was allowed by the master or the trial court, except in a particular not affected by the rule. The decree in each case was for the government and contained the following clause:\n'That the defendants be and they are hereby ordered, directed, and required to make a full, true, and accurate accounting to plaintiff of all oil extracted from said land since January 1, 1918, and to pay to plaintiff the value thereof, as ascertained by said accounting, together with all rents and royalties derived therefrom, and that all of plaintiff's rights to recover the oil produced from said land by the defendants since January 1, 1918, be reserved.'\n\n Following the decision of this court, a stipulation was submitted to the trial court, by which it was agreed that a \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 135]\n\u00a0\n decree should be entered against each of the defendants for a stated sum, if 'the court should hold that plaintiff is entitled to recover the net value of the oil produced after January 1, 1918.' It was further stipulated that the total value of all the oil produced from the beginning of operations until the abandonment of the wells was less in each case than the cost of production; that is to say, that the entire operations of each defendant in the production of oil were conducted at a loss, the profit after January 1, 1918, not being sufficient to offset the loss incurred in the production of oil prior to January 1, 1918. Upon the strength of the latter stipulation the trial court held that the government was not entitled to recover anything. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, holding that defendants were not entitled to offset any part of the cost of production prior to January 1, 1918, against the value of the oil produced after that date. United States v. Norvell (C. C. A.) 298 F. 281.\n The government first contends that the decrees are not final, and that the appeals should be dismissed, because the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the cases 'for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.' The general rule established by many decisions, of which Haseltine v. Cent. Bk. of Springfield (No. 1), \n183 \nU.S. 130\n, 22 S. Ct. 49, is an example, is that the face of the judgment is the test of its finality, and that by this test a judgment of reversal, remanding the cause for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of the court, ordinarily is not final. But the direction to proceed consistently with the opinion of the court has the effect of making the opinion a part of the mandate, as though it had been therein set out at length. Metropolitan Water Co. v. Kaw Valley District, \n223 \nU.S. 519, 523\n, 32 S. Ct. 246. Under the stipulations above recited, the trial court was bound to enter decrees for the government for the stated sums of money if that court found that the government \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 136]\n\u00a0\n was entitled to recover the net value of the oil produced. The trial court found that the government was not so entitled and the decrees went accordingly. Turning to the opinion, it will be seen that the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the trial court erred in entering the decrees denying the complainant the right to recover the net value of the oil,' etc. The instruction for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion, therefore, was equivalent to a direction to render judgment for the net value-that is, for the exact sums set forth in the stipulations. See Moody v. Century Bank, \n239 \nU.S. 374, 376\n, 36 S. Ct. 111; Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238, 241\n, 22 S. Ct. 881. There was no evidence to be taken or considered, and no change in the issue was possible; nothing remained but the ministerial duty of entering a decree for the precise sums which had been fixed beyond the power of alteration. It follows that the jurisdictional objection is without merit.\n The original decrees of the trial court rendered August 12, 1919, confirmed the accounting to January 1, 1918. But defendants had operated the properties during the pendency of the suit and they were ordered to make a further accounting of oil extracted after that date. The decrees, however, were final for purposes of the original appeals to this court, since they decided the title to the properties, ordered their delivery to the plaintiff, and enjoined further trespasses upon them; jurisdiction being retained merely of so much of the decrees as might be necessary to carry them into execution by compelling an additional accounting in respect of oil extracted pendente lite.

Dean, 7 Wall. 342, 345.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have proceeded from the standpoint that one who continues \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 137]\n\u00a0\n in possession of lands, originally taken in good faith, after judgment against him, may not have the advantage of the good faith of his original entry to enable him to offset his expenditures against the value of the oil extracted after judgment pending proceedings on appeal. Whether, thus stated, this is an accurate view of the law, we need not stop to inquire, since we are not here dealing with the common-law doctrine in respect of trespassers in good faith, but with the case of persons who knew all the facts from the beginning, and who in the light of those facts, upon common- law principles, were possessors in legal bad faith, but in moral good faith. The adjudication of the trial court added nothing to their knowledge of these facts. It simply informed them that the conclusion in respect of their rights which they had drawn from the facts was erroneous, a conclusion with the knowledge of which they must be charged from the beginning, since legally, though not morally, they were conclusively bound to know the law even before it had been declared by the court. The moral quality of their possession was not affected by the institution of the government's suit, or the resistance which they interposed before judgment to the government's contentions. And how can it be said that the moral quality of that possession was altered by the entry of the decrees? for non constat that they would not turn out on appeal to be wrong. An appeal is not a new suit in the appellate court, but a continuation of the suit in the court below, or, as this court has recently said, 'a proceeding in the original cause, and the suit is pending until the appeal is disposed of.' Mackenzie v. Engelhard Co., \n266 \nU.S. 131, 142\n, 143 S., 45 S. Ct. 68, 36 A. L. R. 416. It is but a step toward the final adjudication of the original cause, which the law allows quite as much as it allows a defense in the first instance. We are of opinion that within the principle of the Louisiana rule the defendants continued in possession in moral good faith until the final adjudication upon appeal. \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 138]\n\u00a0\n But it is said, further that the accounting for oil produced after January 1, 1918, must be kept entirely separate and distinct from the operations prior to that date, because they had been concluded and finally adjusted by the previous accounting, and that, therefore, the costs incurred prior to January 1, 1918, were not to be considered in determining the offset against the value of the oil produced after that date. To this we cannot agree. The possession of the defendants was continuous. Its character after January 1, 1918, was the same as it had been before. The limitation of time over which the first accounting extended was purely adventitious. It as well might have been for a shorter or for a longer period. So far as the accounting was concerned, the effect of the decrees was to fix the principles, approve the master's report of a partial accounting, and direct a completion of it, retaining jurisdiction over the decrees only so far as might be necessary to that end.\n If the production costs had been less than, or equal to, the value of the oil extracted prior to January 1, 1918, they would have been absorbed as credits. But they exceeded this value, and it was impossible on the first accounting to give defendants the benefit of the excess, since such costs could be utilized only by way of recoupment and not as the basis of an independent claim. The two accountings, it is true, were separate; but the separation was purely artificial. In substance, the latter was a continuation of the former, and, since the excess costs could not, and therefore did not, enter into the preliminary accounting, we see nothing in the mere form of the proceedings which should stand in the way of the excess being allowed in the final accounting where the circumstances were so far changed as to furnish a proper basis for allowing it as a further credit. The direction for the final accounting was interlocutory and incidental to the main decrees, made for the purpose of carrying them into \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 139]\n\u00a0\n effect, and hence left the matter to which the direction related open to change and adjustment by the trial court, and, upon its final disposition there, subject to separate appellate review. See Forgay et al. v. Conrad, supra, pages 205, 206; Adams v. Sayre, 76 Ala. 509.\n There remains to be considered a matter of costs in No. 59. By the original decree in that cause, defendants were ordered to pay the aggregate sum of $4,000 for royalties received from the Gulf Refining Company by the other defendants. This amount, together with interest, was paid to the clerk in satisfaction. That officer demanded a commission of one per cent. under section 828, R. S. (Comp. St.  1383), which provides:\n'For receiving, keeping, and paying out money, in pursuance of any statute or order of court, one per centum on the amount so received, kept, and paid.'\n\n The trial court, upon a rule to show cause why the commission should not be paid as part of the costs, entered an order disallowing the item, which order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We are satisfied with the reasoning and decision of the appellate court which follows its previous decision in United States v. Hunsicker (C. C. A.) 298 F. 278. See, also, United States v. Pennsylvania R. Co. (C. C. A.) 283 F. 937; Blake v. Hawkins (C. C.) 19 F. 204. The point is made that, after the passage of the statute placing clerks of court on a salary basis (Act Feb. 26, 1919, c. 49, 40 Stat. 1182, amended by Act Feb. 11, 1921, c. 46, 41 Stat. 1099 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1385a)), the commission was not a proper item of taxable costs, and that, since the government is not obligated for the 1 per cent., it cannot recover. The salary act provides that:\n'All fees and emoluments authorized by law to be paid to the clerks ... shall be charged as heretofore, ... collected ... and paid into the Treasury of the United States.'\n\n The effect of this is to leave the matter of the taxability of clerk's charges where it was. The government pays the salaries and steps into the shoes of the clerk in respect of the right to fees and emoluments collected, where the government is a party as well as in other cases. \n\n[269 U.S. 125, 140]\n\u00a0\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed, except the matter of costs, as to which the decree in No. 59 is affirmed.\n Affirmed in part.\n Reversed in part. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENDERSON WATER CO. v. CORPORATION COMMISSION OF STATE OF NORTH(1925)\nNo. 249\nArgued: November 18, 1925Decided: December 14, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 278, 279]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. H. Bridgers, of Henderson, N. C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243) from an order refusing a temporary injunction heard before three judges. The Henderson Water Company is the owner by assignment of a franchise to furnish to Henderson, N. C., a supply of water. The franchise, with a term of 40 years, was granted in 1892 by the city, when it was a town, to certain grantees, from whom it came in 1894 to the Water Company, which was complainant below, and is appellant here. The ordinance provided a schedule of prices for water to be furnished beyond which the grantee could not go. Later the state of North Carolina created a Corporation Commission, having power to fix rates for public utilities of the state. Consol. Stats. of North Carolina 1919,  1037, 1066, 1097-1103, 2783\n\n\n On September 27, 1922, the complainant filed with the Corporation Commission a petition, setting forth the original cost of construction of its plant, the amount expended in permanent improvements, and the earning capacity of the same under the schedule of rates provided in the fran- \n\n[269 U.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n chise, and, because of the alleged inadequate return from them, asked the Corporation Commission to grant to it the right to charge rates higher by 10 per cent. The commission heard the complaint, and March 29, 1923, ordered an increase of about one-half asked for, to take effect July 27, 1923, with the direction that, after the corporation had tried the rates fixed for six months, it might apply again for such relief as the results would justify.\n The end of the six months test proposed was January 27, 1924. Without applying again to the commission, the Water Company, on February 22, 1924, filed this bill to enjoin the commission from continuing to enforce the rates fixed by the order made in the spring of 1923, on the ground that they were confiscatory.\n Meantime, the city of Henderson had brought suit against the commission, to which the Water Company was not a party, to enjoin the commission from fixing rates different from the rates stipulated in the franchise, on the ground that its contract rights were being violated. In that action the city of Henderson was defeated in the court of first instance, and in the Supreme Court of North Carolina on appeal. Corporation Commission v. Henderson Water Co., 190 N. C. 70, 128 S. E. 465. See also Corporation Commission v. Cannon Mfg. Co., 185 N. C. 17, 25, 116 S. E. 178; Southern Public Utilities Co. v. City of Charlotte, 179 N. C. 151, 101 S. E. 619.\n The District Court puts refusal to grant the injunction in the present case on the ground that the complainant had not sufficiently exhausted its remedies before the Corporation Commission. We think the District Court was entirely right in this.\n It is urged on behalf of the company that it has a constitutional right to try the question whether it is suffering confiscation, and should not be denied that right, even during such a test as six months. It relies on Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S. Ct. 353. In that \n\n[269 U.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n case a public utility corporation sought an injunction to prevent the enforcement of an alleged confiscatory rate, pending an appeal from the court of first instance in Oklahoma, to the state Supreme Court, in a proceeding in which both the court of first instance and the Supreme Court were exercising the legislative function of fixing rates. The complaint was that plaintiffs were suffering daily from confiscation under the rate to which they were limited by the state commission, and that even if the state Supreme Court changed the rate thereafter on appeal they would have no adequate remedy for their losses before the court acted. They had applied to the Supreme Court for a supersedeas, but it had been denied. This court held that comity must give way to constitutional right, and that the Gas Company was entitled to a hearing on its application for an injunction without awaiting the action of the state court. In the case of Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 231\n, 29 S. Ct. 67, on the other hand, a state commission of Virginia fixed rates for a railway and an appeal was taken under the statute to the Supreme Court of the state which had power legislatively to fix or change rates. A bill was filed by the railway to restrain the rates fixed by the commission before the appeal had been perfected and passed on. The company had made no effort to secure a revision and there had been no present invasion of its rights under the order of the state commission, but only the taking of preliminary steps toward cutting the rates down. So this court directed the bill in that case to be retained until the result of the appeal to the Supreme Court if the company saw fit to take it.\n The present case differs from the cases cited, in that when the Water Company applied to the Corporation Commission for an order increasing rates, it was bound by the terms of a contract with the city contained in its franchise, to furnish water at a low schedule of rates fixed \n\n[269 U.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n therein. It was not entitled to any judicial relief from this situation, however inadequate the rates. Columbus Railway Power & Light Co. v. Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399\n, 39 S. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648: Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, \n265 \nU.S. 352\n, 44 S. Ct. 492. Only by securing the waiver of the franchise rates by order of the Corporation Commission speaking for the state, did the Water Company have any standing to ask for a fixing of rates in excess of the franchise rates. Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 \nU.S. 182\n, 43 S. Ct. 534, 29 A. L. R. 1471. It was therefore plainly within the power and discretion of the commission after granting partial relief to delay further action in the same proceeding until it could satisfy itself by actual trial to what extent its waiver should go. No constitutional rights of the Water Company to be protected against confiscation would be infringed by such reasonable delay.\n We concur with the District Court in the view that the Water Company should have applied for a resumption of the hearing after the test and exhausted its remedy there before a resort to this suit.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHICKS v. GUINNESS(1925)\nNo. 80\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Alexander B. Siegel, of New York City, for Guinness and others.\n Mr. Dean Hill Stanley, of Washington, D. C., for Alien Property Custodian.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N. J., for Joerger and others.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 71, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are cross petitions based upon a suit brought against the Alien Property Custodian by Guinness and others, doing business under the firm name of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. in New York. The facts are not in dispute. A German firm, Joerger and others doing business under the name of Delbru ck, Schickler & Co., was indebted to the American firm under an account stated on December 31, 1916, for 1,079.35 marks, subject to a set- off of $35.35. The debt was not paid when the war between Germany and the United States began, April 6, 1917. The Alien Property Custodian had taken property of the German firm of a value greater than the debt and the American firm brought this suit in equity to recover what was due to it, as provided by the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106,  9, 40 Stat. 411, 419, amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e). The only questions raised and argued here are whether interest is to be allowed for the time covered by the war, from April 6, 1917, to July 14, 1919, and at what date the value of the mark is to be estimated in dollars in order to fix the amount of the decree. The District Court held that interest was suspended during the war, 291 F. 768, and that the value of the mark at the time when the debt should have been paid was the proper measure. (This value is fixed as 17 1\/2 cents.) 291 F. 769. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 299 F. 538. The Alien Property Custodian in the interest of the German debtors seeks to reverse the latter ruling, in No. 80, and the American firm seeks to reverse the former ruling, in No. 81.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 71, 80]\n\u00a0\n We take up the second question first as the principles that govern it have some bearing upon the matter of interest also. We are of opinion that the Courts below were right in holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the value in dollars that the mark had when the account was stated. The debt was due to an American creditor and was to be paid in the United States. When the contract was broken by a failure to pay, the American firm had a claim here, not for the debt, but, at its option, for damages in dollars. It no longer could be compelled to accept marks. It had a right to say to the debtors you are too late to perform what you have promised and we want the dollars to which we have a right by the law here in force. Gould v. Banks, 8 Wend. (N. Y.) 562, 567, 24 Am. Dec. 90. The event has come to pass upon which your liability becomes absolute as fixed by law. Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., \n190 \nU.S. 540, 543\n, 23 S. Ct. 754. There is no doubt that this rule prevails in actions for a tort, Preston v. Prather, \n137 \nU.S. 604\n, 11 S. Ct. 162, and in actions for the failure to deliver merchandise. Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat. 109. The principle is the same in a contract for the payment of marks. The loss for which the plaintiff is entitled to be indemnified is 'the loss of what the contractor would have had if the contract had been performed,' Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 \nU.S. 97, 100\n, 40 S. Ct. 504, it happens at the moment when the contract is broken, just as it does when a tort is committed, and the plaintiff's claim is for the amount of that loss valued in money at that time. The inconveniences and speculations that would be the result of a different rule have been pointed out in arguments and decisions, and on the other hand the momentary interest of the country of the forum may be in favor of taking the date of the judgment, but the conclusion to which we come seems to us to flow from fundamental theory and not to need other support. It is in accord with the decisions of several State Courts \n\n[269 U.S. 71, 81]\n\u00a0\n and Circuit Courts of Appeal as well as of the English House of Lords. Hoppe v. Russo-Asiatic Bank, 235 N. Y. 37, 138 N. E. 497; Katcher v. American Express Co., 94 N. J. Law, 165, 171, 109 A. 741; Simonoff v. Granite City National Bank, 279 Ill. 248, 255, 116 N. E. 636; Wichita Mill & Elevator Co. v. Naamlooze, etc., Industrie (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 931; S. S. Celia v. S. S. Volturno, (1921) 2 A. C. 544.\n The denial of interest for the time covered by the war seems to us wrong. The cause of action had accrued before the war began, Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall. 562, and after it had accrued the question was no longer one of excuse for not performing a contract, but of the continuance of a liability for damages that had become fixed. The obligation of a contract is subject to implied exceptions, but when a liability is incurred by wrong or default it is absolute. Interest is due as one of its incidentals, and inability to pay it no more excuses from that than it does from the principal amount. Of course while the damages remain unpaid interest during one time is as necessary as interest during another to effect the indemnification to which the delinquent is held by the law. There are indications that local and momentary interests have led to a diversity of decisions but here again what we regard as principle has prevailed in later days, Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243\n, 45 S. Ct. 73; Hugh Stevenson & Sons, Ltd., v. Aktiengesellschaft fur Cartonnagen-Industrie, (1918) A. C. 239, 245; s. c. (1917) 1 K. B. 842, 850. The case of Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall. 177, although criticized in the last cited decision, is consistent on its facts with the principle adopted here, since war existed at the time when the cause of action otherwise would have accrued, and it very possibly might be held that war excuses the performance of a contract although it does not impair or diminish a liability already fixed by law. Our decision makes it unnecessary to consider arguments drawn from \n\n[269 U.S. 71, 82]\n\u00a0\n the Treaty with Germany (42 Stat. 1939) and the Trading with the Enemy Act. \n No. 80\n, decree affirmed.\n No. 81, decree reversed as to interest.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in this case. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHICKS v.

Kemp Bartlett, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit for an accounting was begun in the federal District Court for Mayland on June 12, 1920, by the receivers of the United Surety Company, a corporation of that state, against the Munich Reinsurance Company, a Bavarian corporation. The controversy arose out of a written agreement entered into by the companies in 1906. There had been active litigation in the Maryland courts where much became res judicata. See Munich Reinsurance Co. v. United Surety Co., 113 Md. 200, 77 A. 579; Id., 121 Md. 479, 88 A. 271; Poe v. Munich Reinsurance Co., 126 Md. 520, 95 A. 164. This suit was then begun under section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411, 419 as amended (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e), because the receivers sought to reach funds of the Munich Company in the possession of the Alien Property Custodian. The District Court, after careful opinions, entered a decree for the receivers for $189,517.16 with interest. 276 F. 949; 293 F. 764. The Court of Appeals affirmed it without opinion. Miller v. Poe, 293 F. 766. The appeal to this court, allowed January 7, 1924, was taken as of right under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). We find no reversible error. Two matters only require mention. Neither presents a question federal in its nature.\n The United engaged in the business known as surety, fidelity, and burglary insurance. The Munich, by what is called a participation contract, agreed with it to assume one-third of the liability on every such risk written during a period of five years. The management of the business was to be left to the United without restriction. Upon an annual accounting the Munich was to receive one-third of any profits or pay one-third of any losses. A \n\n[269 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n decree entered against the Munich in the state court for losses incurred during the five-year period had been satisfied. This suit is for losses incurred after its expiration on insurance of the United then still outstanding. The company had been unsuccessful. The state court after the expiration of the five-year period appointed receivers who proceeded to wind up the business. They sought in vain to reinsure all outstanding risks. Then, with the approval of the court, they secured, so far as possible, cancellation of the outstanding insurance by returning unearned premiums. The losses on account of which this suit was brought were on risks entered into during the existence of the participation contract and remaining unexpired upon its termination and which the receivers did not succeed in getting cancelled.\n The Munich argues that by the course pursued the assets were wasted through returning the unearned premiums on good risks, and that thus the poor risks were left unprotected; insists that it was entitled to have all the insurance carried to its expiry; and contends that the receivers, by securing the cancellation of much of it for the purpose of winding up the business, committed a breach of the participation contract which released it from further liability. The contention is unfounded. The participation contract did not restrict the discretion to be exercised by the United, and its receivers, in the conduct of the business or in winding it up after the termination of the agreement. The case of Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n240 \nU.S. 581\n, 36 S. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917B, 580, upon which appellants rely, is without application.\n There is a further contention that, because the United has not paid to its creditors any part of the amounts due on its contracts, and is likely to pay only 25 cents on the dollar, the Munich is under no liability to pay to it anything on account of losses incurred thereunder or, in any event, more than a pro rata share of the payments actually made by the United. The Munich became a re- \n\n[269 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n insurer. The liability of a reinsurer is not affected by the insolvency of the reinsured company or the inability of the latter to fulfill its own contracts with the original insured. Allemannia Fire Insurance Co. v. Firemen's Insurance Co., \n209 \nU.S. 326\n, 28 S. Ct. 544, 14 Ann. Cas. 948. The participation contract differs from customary reinsurance in this: The Munich, instead of receiving premiums and paying its share of losses, was to participate in profits and losses. The difference is not one which affected the scope or character of the Munich's obligation.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHIDEMITSU TOYOTA v. U.

Lombard, of Boston, Mass., for Toyota.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 402, 406]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Hidemitsu Toyota, a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, entered the United States in 1913. He served substantially all the time between November of that year and May, 1923, in the United States Coast Guard Service. This was a part of the naval force of the United States nearly all of the time the United Staes was engaged in the recent war. He received eight or more honorable discharges, and some of them were for service during the war. May 14, 1921, he filed his petition for naturalization in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The petition was granted, and a certificate of naturalization was issued to him. This case arises on a petition to cancel the certificate on the ground that \n\n[268 U.S. 402, 407]\n\u00a0\n it was illegally procured. Section 15, Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596, 601 (Comp. St.  4374). It is agreed that if a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of section 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1918, c. 69, 40 Stat. 542 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4352), or under the Act of July 19, 1919, c. 24, 41 Stat. 222 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4352aaa), Toyota is legally naturalized. The District Court held he was not entitled to be naturalized, and entered a decree canceling his certificate of citizenship. 290 F. 971. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court under section 239, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1216), certified to this court the following questions: (1) Whether a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of section 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1918; and ( 2) whether such subject may legally be naturalized under the Act of July 19, 1919. The material provisions of these enactments are printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[268 U.S. 402, 408]\n\u00a0\n Until 1870, only aliens being free white persons were eligible to citizenship.

The substance of prior legislation is expressed in section 2169, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4358), which is:\n'The provisions of this title [Naturalization] shall apply to aliens being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.'\n\n A person of the Japenese race, born in Japan, is not eligible under that section.

Ct. 65).\n It has long been the rule that in order to be admitted to citizenship an alien is required, at least two years prior to his admission, to declare his intention to become a citizen, and to show that he has resided continuously in the United States for at lease five years immediately preceding his admission. Revised Statutes,  2165, 2170 (Comp. St.  4360); \n\n[268 U.S. 402, 409]\n\u00a0\n subdivision 1,  4, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596. But at different times, as to specially designated aliens serving in the armed forces of the United States, Congress modified and lessened these requirements. Section 2166, Revised Statutes (Act of July 17, 1862,  21, c. 200, 12 Stat. 594, 597); Act of July 26, 1894, c. 165, 28 Stat. 123, 124; Act of June 30, 1914, c. 130, 38 Stat. 392, 395. In each of the first two of these acts, the phrase 'any alien' is used as a part of the description of the person for whose benefit the act was passed. In the last, the language is 'any alien ... who may, under existing law, become a citizen of the United States.' Prior to this act, it had been held that the phrase 'any alien,' used in the earlier acts, did not enlarge the classes defined in section 2169. In re Buntaro Kumagai (D. C. 1908) 163 F. 922; In re Knight (D. C. 1909) 171 F. 299; Bessho v. United States (1910) 178 F. 245, 101, C. C. A. 605; In re Alverto (D. C. 1912) 198 F. 688. The language used in the Act of 1914 merely expresses what was implied in the earlier provisions.\n The seventh subdivision of section 4 of the Act of 1918 permits 'any native-born Filipino' or 'any alien, or any Porto Rican not a citizen of the United States' belonging respectively to the classes there described, on presentation of the required declaration of intention, to petition for naturalization without proof of five years' residence within the United States; and the act permits 'any alien' serving in the forces of the United States 'during the time this country is engaged in the present war' to file his petition for naturalization without making the preliminary declaration of intention and without proof of five years' residence in the United States. The act of 1919 gave 'any person of foreign birth,' there mentioned, the benefits of the seventh subdivision of section 4. Evidently, a principal purpose of these acts was to facilitate the naturalization of service men of the classes specified. There is nothing to show an intention to eliminate from the \n\n[268 U.S. 402, 410]\n\u00a0\n definition of eligibility in section 2169 the distinction based on color or race. Nor is there anything to indicate that, if the seventh subdivision stood alone, the words 'any alien' should be taken to mean more than did the same words when used in the Acts of 1862 and 1894. But section 2 of the Act of 1918 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4352aa) provides that nothing in the act shall repeal or in any way enlarge section 2169 'except as specified in the seventh subdivision of this act and under the limitation therein defined.' This implies some enlargement of section 2169 in respect of color and race; but it also indicates a purpose not to eliminate all distinction based on color and race so long continued in the naturalization laws. If it was intended to make such change and to extend the privilege of naturalization to all races, the provision of section 2 so limiting the enlargement of section 2169 would be inappropriate. And if the phrase 'any alien' in the seventh subdivision is read literally, the qualifying words 'being free white persons' and 'of African nativity' in section 2169 are without significance. See In re Geronimo Para (D. C.) 269 F. 643, 646; Petition of Easurk Emsen Charr (D. C.) 273 F. 207, 213.\n When the Act of 1918 was passed, it was doubtful whether section 30 of the Act of 1906 (Comp. St.  4366) extended the privilege of naturalization to all citizens of the Philippine Islands. They were held eligible for naturalization in Re Bautista (D. C.) 245 F. 765, and in Re Mallari (D. C.) 239 F. 416. And see 27 Op. Attys. Gen. 12. They were held not eligible in Re Alverto (D. C.) 198 F. 688, in Re Lampitoe (D. C.) 232 F. 382, and in Re Rallos (D. C.) 241 F. 686. But we hold that until the passage of that act, Filipinos not being 'free white persons' or 'of African nativity' were not eligible, and that the effect of the Act of 1918 was to make eligible, and to authorize the naturalization of, native- born Filipinos of whatever color or race having the qualifications specified in the seventh subdivision of section 4.\n Under the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain, December 10, 1898, 30 Stat. 1754, Congress \n\n[268 U.S. 402, 411]\n\u00a0\n was authorized to determine the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. And by the Act of July 1, 1902,  4, c. 1369, 32 Stat. 691, 692, it was declared that all inhabitants continuing to reside therein who were Spanish subjects on April 11, 1899, and then resided in the Islands and their children born subsequent thereto, 'shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine Islands and as such entitled to the protection of the United States, except such as shall have elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain,' according to the treaty. The citizens of the Philippine Islands are not aliens. See Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 24 S. Ct. 177. They owe no allegiance to any foreign government. They were not eligible for naturalization under section 2169 because not aliens and so not within its terms. By section 30 of the Act of 1906, it is provided:\n'That all the applicable provisions of the nauralization laws of the United States shall apply to and be held to authorize the admission to citizenship of all persons not citizens who owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and who may become residents of any state or organized territory of the United States, with the following modifications: The applicant shall not be required to renounce allegiance to any foreign sovereignty; he shall make his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States at least two years prior to his admission; and residence within the jurisdiction of the United States, owing such permanent allegiance, shall be regarded as residence within the United States within the meaning of the five years' residence clause of the existing law.' 34 Stat. 606.\n\n Section 26 of that act (Comp. St.  4381) repeals certain sections of title 30 of the Revised Statutes, but leaves section 2169 in force. It is to be applied as if it were included in the Act of 1906. Plainly, the element of alienage included in section 2169 did not apply to the class made eligible by section 30 of the Act of 1906. The element of color and race included in that section \n\n[268 U.S. 402, 412]\n\u00a0\n is not specifically dealt with by section 30, and, as it has long been the national policy to maintain the distinction of color and race, radical change is not lightly to be deemed to have been intended. 'Persons not citizens who owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and who may become residents of any state,' may include Malays, Japanese, and Chinese, and others not eligible under the distinction as to color and race. As under section 30 all the applicable provisions of the naturalization laws apply, the limitations based on color and race remain; and the class made eligible by section 30 must be limited to those of the color and race included by section 2169. As Filipinos are not aliens and owe allegiance to the United States, there are strong reasons for relaxing as to them the restrictions which do not exist in favor of aliens who are barred because of their color and race. And in view of the policy of Congress to limit the naturalization of aliens to white persons and to those of African nativity or descent the implied enlargement of section 2169 should be taken at the minimum. The legislative history of the act indicates that the intention of Congress was not to enlarge section 2169, except in respect of Filipinos qualified by the specified service. Senate Report No. 388, pp. 2, 3, 8; House Report No. 502, pp. 1, 4, Sixty-Fifth Congress, Second Session. See, also, Congressional Record, vol. 56, part 6, pp. 6000- 6003. And we hold that the words 'any alien' in the seventh subdivision are limited by section 2169 to aliens of the color and race there specified. We also hold that the phrase 'any person of foreign birth' in the Act of 1919 is not more comprehensive than the words 'any alien' in the Act of 1918. It follows that the questions certified must be answered in the negative.\n The answer to the first question is: No.\n The answer to the second question is: No.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Seventh.

U S(1925)\nNo. 74\nArgued: October 15, 1924Decided: March 9, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Raymond M. Hudson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Merrill E. Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by Horowitz, under the Tucker Act,1 to recover damages for the alleged breach of a contract relating to the purchase of silk from the Ordance Department. The petition was dismissed, on demurrer, for failure to state a cause of action. 58 Ct. Cl. 189.\n The petition alleges, in substance, these facts: On December 20, 1919, the claimant, a resident of New York, submitted a bid for certain Habutai silk offered for sale by the New York Ordnance Salvage Board. At that time the 'Chief of the Textile Division of New York City,' agreed, 'on behalf of such Board,' that the claimant would be given an opportunity to re-sell the silk before completing the payment of the purchase price, and that the 'departments of the government having jurisdiction in matters of this kind' would ship the silk-which was then in Washington-within a day or two after shipping instructions were given. On December 22 he was notified by the Board that the sale of the silk to him had been 'approved'; and he thereupon paid part of the purchase price. On January 30, 1920, he sold the silk to a silk company in New York. On February 16 he paid the balance of the purchase price, and wrote the Board to \n\n[267 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n ship the silk at once, by freight, to the silk company. Two days later he was notified by the Board that it had received the shipping instructions and had ordered the silk to be shipped. Thereafter the price of silk declined greatly in the New York market, until March 4. On that date the 'claimant learned ... that the silk was still in Washington, and had not been shipped because the Government through one of its agencies, the U. S. Railroad Administration, had prior to March 1, 1920, placed an embargo on shipments of silk by freight, and the shipment of Habutai silk for claimant had been held up.' Afterwards the Government shipped the silk to the consignee, by express. It arrived in New York 'on or about March 12.' The consignee then refused to accept delivery on account of the fall in prices. And 'by reason of the Government's breach of the contract and agreement in placing an embargo, and failing to ship the silk either by express or freight prior to March 4, 1920, the price of silk having declined, the claimant was forced to sell the said silk for $10,811.84 less than the price the consignee had agreed to pay for same had it been delivered in time.'\n The petition alleges that the claimant is entitled to recover from the United States the said sum of $10,811.84, 'for and on account of the violation of the said agreement'; and prays judgment therefor.\n We assume, without determining, that the petition shows a valid contract with the Salvage Board for the sale of the silk and its prompt shipment after the receipt of shipping instructions. The sole breach of this contract which is alleged is the failure to ship the silk prior to March 4, 1920. This, according to the averment of the petition, was caused by an embargo placed by the Railroad Administration on shipments of silk by freight. Neither the validity of this embargo nor its effect in delaying the shipment is challenged by the petition. \n\n[267 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n It has long been held by the Court of Claims that the United States when sued as a contractor cannot be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of the particular contract resulting from its public and general acts as a sovereign. Deming v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190, 191; Jones v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 383, 384; Wilson v. United States, 11 Ct. Cl. 513, 520. In the Jones Case, supra, the court said:\n'The two characters which the government possesses as a contractor and as a sovereign cannot be thus fused; nor can the United States while sued in the one character be made liable in damages for their acts done in the other. Whatever acts the government may do, be they legislative or executive, so long as they be public and general, cannot be deemed specially to alter, modify, obstruct or violate the particular contracts into which it enters with private persons. ... In this court the United States appear simply as contractors; and they are to be held liable only within the same limits that any other defendant would be in any other court. Though their sovereign acts performed for the general good may work injury to some private contractors, such parties gain nothing by having the United States as their defendants.'\n\n It was upon this ground that the demurrer in the present case was sustained by the Court of Claims. We think this was correct, and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 505, c. 359; Judicial Code,  145 (Comp.

Podell, of New York City, for appellants.\n Messrs. S. H. Hofstadter and Felix C. Benvenga, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These appeals challenge the constitutionality of chapters 580 and 581, 2 Laws of New York 1922, pp. 1314, 1315, as being in contravention of the due process and equal protection of the law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. So far as these cases are concerned, the statutes are substantially alike, and it is enough to refer to chapter 581 which provides that any person who with intent to defraud:\n'... 4. Sells or exposes for sale any meat or meat preparation and falsely represents the same to be kosher, or as having been prepared under and of a product or products sanctioned by the orthodox Hebrew religious requirements; or falsely represents any food product or the contents of any package or container to be so constituted and prepared, by having or permitting to be inscribed thereon the word 'kosher' in any language; or sells or exposes for sale in the same place of business both kosher and nonkosher meat or meat preparations who fails to indicate on his window signs and all display advertising, in block letters at least four inches in hight, 'kosher and nonkosher meat sold here'; or who exposes for sale in any show window or place of business \n\n[266 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n both kosher and nonkosher meat or meat products who fails to display over such meat or meat preparation so exposed a sign in block letters at least four inches in height reading 'kosher meat,' or 'nonkosher meat,' as the case may be,' is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n Separate suits were brought against appellees to enjoin them from proceeding against appellants for any alleged failure to comply with the foregoing statutory requirements or from making any threats of prosecuting or from conducting any prosecutions by reason of any failure to label any of the meats sold as 'not kosher' or otherwise interfering with or seeking to prevent the full, free and unhampered sale of their products without labeling, etc., and from injuring their business 'by compelling it to be discredited in standing and reputation, and by having its merchandise wrongfully branded as 'nonkosher' in accordance with the requirements of said enactments.'\n The several bills allege that appellees 'have threatened to prosecute all complaints against persons or concerns engaged as manufacturers, dealers, retailers, or otherwise in the sale of raw or prepared meat commodities, who are charged with violating the statutes'; that by reason of these threats and of the fear inspired by the requirements of the statutes, when called upon at their peril to determine whether their products are kosher and label the same, appellants have decided and will continue to decide that all products sold by them are not kosher; that such determination has been and will be induced by the fear that some judge or jury might determine that the rabbinical law or the customs, traditions, and precedents \n\n[266 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n of the orthodox Hebrew religious requirements necessitate that even such meats as appellants sell as kosher are not kosher. The bills contain allegations tending to show the impossibility, or, at least, the great difficulity, of determining with certainty what is kosher according to the rabbinical law and the customs, traditions, and precedents of the orthodox Hebrew religious requirements; but appellants allege that whenever they could possibly determine in advance whether any meat commodity in their honest belief might be called kosher, they have sold the same as kosher, but not otherwise. The bills aver that irreparable injury to appellants' business, property, good will, and reputation will result. It does not appear that any of the appellants has ever been prosecuted for a violation of the statutes or has ever been specifically threatened with prosecution, the threats alleged being, in substance, simply that all violators of the statutes will be prosecuted. The District Court, in each case, after a hearing upon an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue, upheld the statutes, denied the injunction and dismissed the bill.\n The general rule is that equity will not interfere to prevent the enforcement of a criminal statute even though unconstitutional. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 143\n, 44 S. Ct. 257; In re Sawyer, \n124 U.S. 200\n, 209-211, 8 S. Ct. 482; Davis & Farnum Manufacturing Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 23 S. Ct. 498. But appellants seek to bring themselves within an exception to this general rule, namely, that a court of equity will interfere to prevent criminal prosecutions under an unconstitutional statute when that is necessary to effectually protect property rights. Packard v. Banton, supra; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S. Ct. 15. That these bills disclose such a case of threatened actual and imminent injury as to come within the exception is not beyond doubt. But upon a liberal view of the decisions above cited and other decisions of this court (see Kennington v. Palmer, \n255 \nU.S. 100\n, 41 S. Ct. 303, and cases referred to in footnote), we accept the conclusion of the lower court, based on the decisions of this court, that if the statutes under review are unconstitutional appellants are entitled to equitable relief; and pass to a consideration of the constitutional questions. \n\n[266 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n 1. The specific complaint is that the word 'kosher' and the phrase 'orthodox Hebrew religious requirements' are so indefinite and uncertain as to cause the statutes to be unconstitutional for want of any ascertainable standard of guilt. It is in support of this assumption that appellants allege they are unable to determine with any degree of certainty whether a particular meat product is kosher, and, when called upon, at their peril, to make a determination and label the product accordingly, they have decided and will continue to decide that all of the products sold by them are nonkosher. But obviously the statutes put no such burden upon them, since they expressly require that any representation that a product is kosher must not only be false but made with intent to defraud. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, upholding the validity of a statute substantially the same as those now under review, in People v. Altas, 183 App. Div. 595, 596, 597, 170 N. Y. S. 834, 835, thus characterized it:\n'The purpose of the statute, manifestly, is to prevent and punish fraud in the sale of meets or meat preparation, and it only operates on those who knowingly violate its provisions, for it is expressly provided that there must be both an intent to defraud and a false representation.'\n\n It thus appears that, whatever difficulty there may be in reaching a correct determination as to whether a given product is kosher, appellants are unduly apprehensive of the effect upon them and their business, of a wrong conclusion in that respect, since they are not required to act at their peril but only to exercise their judgment in good faith, in order to avoid coming into conflict with the statutes. Indeed, putting the statutes aside, such judgment they would be bound to exercise upon ordinary principles of fair dealing. By engaging in the business of selling kosher products they in effect assert an honest purpose to distinguish to the best of their judgment between \n\n[266 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n what is and what is not kosher. The statutes require no more. Furthermore, the evidence, while conflicting, warrants the conclusion that the term 'kosher' has a meaning well enough defined to enable one engaged in the trade to correctly apply it, at least as a general thing. If exceptional cases may sometimes arise where opinions might differ, that is no more than is likely to occur, and does occur, in respect of many criminal statutes either upheld against attack or never assailed as indefinite. In Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 377 S., 33 S. Ct. 780, 781 (57 L. Ed. 1232), this court had before it a similar contention in respect of the Anti-Trust Act and disposed of it as follows:\n'And thereupon it is said that the crime thus defined by the statute contains in its definition an element of degree as to which estimates may differ, with the result that a man might find himself in prison because his honest judgment did not anticipate that of a jury of less competent men. ...\n\n'But apart from the common law as to restraint of trade thus taken up by the statute the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may be incur a fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may incur the penalty of death.'\n\n See, also, Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1) \n212 \nU.S. 86, 109\n, 29 S. Ct. 220; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Ct. 147; Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52\n, 35 S. Ct. 501; Coomer v. United States, 213 F. 1, 5, 129 C. C. A. 617. Many illustrations will readily occur to the mind, as for example statutes prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors and statutes prohibiting the transmission through the mail of obscene literature, neither of which have been found to be fatally indefinite because in some instances opinions differ in respect of what falls within their terms. Moreover, as already suggested, since the statutes require a specific intent to de \n\n[266 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n fraud in order to encounter their prohibitions, the hazard of prosecution which appellants fear loses whatever substantial foundation it might have in the absence of such a requirement. Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323.\n\n 2. \nLewis & Fox Company is a Massachusetts corporation conducting a general provision supply business including the shipment and sale of original packages into and within the state of New York. It is this situation which forms the basis of the contention that the commerce clause is violated. It is enough to say that the statutes now assailed are not aimed at interstate commerce, do not impose a direct burden upon such commerce, make no discrimination against it, are fairly within the range of the police power of the state, bear a reasonable relation to the legitimate purpose of the enactments, and do not conflict with any congressional legislation. Under these circumstances they are not invalid because they may incidentally effect interstate commerce. Slight v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 60\n, 61 S., 35 S. Ct. 501; Savage v.

St.  8820 et seq.). The bill prays for an injunction restraining the further execution of the alleged conspiracy, for a dissolution of certain of the associations as illegal, and for other relief. After a hearing, the federal District Court declined to dissolve any of the appellants or interfere with their general activities, but entered a decree enjoining them specifically from (a) requiring any permit for the pur chase, \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n sale, or use of building materials or supplies produced without the state of California and coming into that state in interstate or foreign commerce ; (b) making, as a condition for the issuance of any permit for the purchase, sale, or use of building materials or supplies, any regulations that will interfere with the free movement of building materials, plumbers' or other supplies produced without the state; (c) attempting to prevent or discourage any person without the state from shipping building materials, or other supplies to any person within the state; or (d) aiding, abetting, or assisting, directly or indirectly, individually or collectively, others to do any of the foregoing matters or things. 293 F. 925. A reversal of this decree is sought upon the ground, mainly, that the evidence wholly fails to show any contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade or commerce, or a violation in any respect of the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act. Other grounds assigned, in view of the conclusion we have reached, we put aside as unnecessary to be considered.\n That there was a combination and concerted action among the appellants, is not disputed. The various agreements, courses of conduct and acts relied upon to establish the case for the government arose out of a long-continued controversy-or, more accurately, a series of controversies-between employers engaged in the construction of buildings in San Francisco, upon the one side, and the building trade unions of San Francisco, of which there were some 50 in number with a combined membership of about 99 per cent. of all the workmen engaged in the building industries of that city, upon the other side.\n Prior to February 1, 1921, the unions had adopted and enforced, and were then enforcing, many restrictions bearing upon the employment of their members, which the employers, and a large body of other citizens, considered to be unreasonable, uneconomic, and injurious to \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n the building industries, resulting, it was asserted, in decreased production, increased cost, and generally retarded progress. Among the restrictions complained of, were rules limiting the number of apprentices, limiting the amount of work, limiting or forbidding the use of labor- saving devices, and interfering with the legitimate authority of the employer. The plumbers' union, for example, enforced the following, among others: No union plumber, whatever the emergency, was permitted to work on nonunion material or to work overtime on Saturday without permission of the union; detailed reports were required, showing the number of fixtures set each day, and men who exceeded the standard fixed by the union were disciplined; the time which any employer was permitted to stay on a job was limited to two hours a day; as many men as the union saw fit could be ordered on a job, regardless of the wishes of the employer. Among the restrictions imposed by the painters' union were these: Wide brushes with long handles for roof painting were prohibited, and it was required that all such work should be done with a small brush; certain labor-saving devices were prohibited; and union painters declined to paint nonunion lumber.\n The unions rigidly enforced the 'closed shop'-that is, they denied the right of the employer to employ any workman, however well qualified, who was not a member of a San Francisco union; and this applied to a member of a labor union in another locality, who, moreover, practically was precluded from joining a San Francisco union by reason of the cost and onerous conditions imposed. They were confederated under the name of the Building Trades Council, by means of which their combined power was exerted in support of the demands and policies of each, until they had acquired a virtual monopoly of all kinds of building trade labor in San Francisco, and no building work of any consequence could be done in that \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n city, except in subordination to these demands and policies.\n Early in 1921, serious differences having arisen between the unions and the employers in respect of wages, hours, and working conditions, an agreement for arbitration was made and a board of arbitrators selected. The board, after a hearing, made a tentative award reducing the scale of wages for the ensuing six months. Challenging the authority of the board to reduce wages, the unions refused to be bound by the award and repudiated and abandoned the arbitration. Strikes ensued, efforts to bring the strikers back to work failed, and building operations in San Francisco practically came to a standstill. Thereupon, in an endeavor to find a solution of the difficulty, mass meetings were held by representative citizens in large numbers and from all walks of life. At these meetings it was resolved that the work of building must go forward, and that, if San Francisco mechanics refused to work, others must be employed from the outside. Funds were raised and placed in the hands of a committee of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and under its direction workmen were brought in from the outside with promises of employment at the wages fixed by the arbitrators. Subsequently the Industrial Association of San Francisco was organized to take the place of the committee and carry on its work. The strikers, however, returned to work, and for a time no objection was made to the employment of nonunion workmen. But later demands were made by certain of the unions for the discharge of all nonunion workmen and the restoration of the 'closed shop.' These demands were disregarded, and there was another strike. A boycott was instituted, and acts of violence against persons and property committed. In the meantime, one of the appellants, the Builders' Exchange of San Francisco, with a membership of more than 1,000 building contractors and dealers \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n in building materials, in co-operation with the Industrial Association and other appellants, devised and put into effect what is called the 'American plan.'\n The basic requirement of the plan was that there should be no discrimination for or against an employee on account of his affiliation or nonaffiliation with a labor union, except that at least one nonunion man in each craft should be employed on each particular job as an evidence, it is suggested, of good faith. In effect, the 'American plan' and the 'open shop' policy are the same.\n The principal means adopted to enforce the plan was the 'permit system,' the object of which was to limit sales of certain specified kinds of materials to builders who supported the plan. To render this restriction effective, the person concerned was required to obtain a permit from the Builders' Exchange, specifying the kinds and quantities of materials to be furnished and the particular job on which they were to be used. The materials specified were cement, lime, plaster, ready-mixed mortar, brick, terra cotta and clay products, sand, rock, and gravel. Substantially all of these were California productions and were deliberately selected for that reason, in order to avoid interference with interstate commerce. The only material exception was plaster, which was brought in from the outside, but consigned to local representatives of the manufacturers or to local dealers in San Francisco, and brought to rest in salesrooms and warehouses, and commingled with other goods and property, before being subjected to the permit rule. A suggestion was made at one time that, if necessary, the rule would be extended to all other materials used in the building trades; but it does not appear that this was done. It is said that lath of various kinds, wallboard, and Keene cement also were put under the rule; but we think the record discloses that, in fact, this was never agreed upon or carried into effect. \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n There is evidence of efforts to extend the 'American plan' to other cities and states. Permits were extensively withheld in respect of buildings where the 'American plan' was not adopted or not enforced. Builders and contractors were constantly urged to observe the plan and were warned that failure to do so would result in a denial of future permits. A check was kept upon shops and building jobs by inspectors, and daily reports were made as to whether the plan was being observed. Whenever it appeared in any case that the plan was not being lived up to, a warning letter was sent out. Under appropriate by-laws, members of organizations subscribing to the plan who violated it were fined, and in some instances expelled, and other methods, not necessary to be recited, in part persuasive and in part coercive, were adopted and enforced, in order to secure a thorough-going maintenance of the plan.\n With the conflict between the policy of the 'closed shop' and that of the 'open shop,' or with the 'American plan,' per se, we have nothing to do. And since it clearly appears that the object of the plan was one entirely apart from any purpose to affect interstate commerce, the sole inquiry we are called upon to make is whether the means employed to effectuate it constituted a violation of the Anti-Trust Act, and, in the light of the evidence adduced, that inquiry need be pursued little beyond a consideration of the nature of the permit system, what was done under it, and the effect thereof upon interstate commerce.\n The bases of the decree, which, in the opinion of the court below, were established, may be briefly and categorically stated as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Permits were required for the purchase of building materials and supplies produced in and brought from other states into California.\n\n\n (2)\n Permits, even if limited to California produced materials, nevertheless interfered with and prevented the \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n free movement of building materials and supplies from other states into California.\n\n\n (3)\n Persons in other states were directly prevented or discouraged from shipping building materials and supplies into California.\n It will be well, in limine, to emphasize certain clearly established general facts, in the light of which these grounds must be considered. Interference with interstate trade was neither desired nor intended. On the contrary, the desire and intention was to avoid any such interference, and, to this end, the selection of materials subject to the permit system was substantially confined to California productions. The thing aimed at and sought to be attained was not restraint of the interstate sale or shipment of commodities, but was a purely local matter, namely, regulation of building operations within a limited local area, so as to prevent their domination by the labor unions. Interstate commerce-indeed, commerce of any description-was not the object of attack, 'for the sake of which the several specific acts and courses of conduct were done and adopted.' Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 397\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, 279 (49 L. Ed. 518). The facts and circumstances which led to and accompanied the creation of the combination and the concert of action complained of, which we have briefly set forth, apart from other and more direct evidence, are 'ample to supply a full local motive for the conspiracy.' United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 411\n, 42 S. Ct. 570, 583 (66 L. Ed. 975, 27 A. L. R. 762).\n But it is not enough that the object of a combination or conspiracy be outside the purview of the act, if the means adopted to effectuate it directly and unduly obstruct the free flow of interstate commerce. The statute is not aimed alone at combinations and conspiracies which contemplate a restraint of interstate commerce, but includes those which directly and unduly cause such restraint in fact. See American Column Co. v. United \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 78]\n\u00a0\n States, \n257 \nU.S. 377, 400\n, 42 S. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093; Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 613\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788.\n It remains to apply these principles, in the light of the facts, to the several grounds above stated, upon which the decree rests.\n First. That permits were required for the purchase of materials produced in and brought from other states. To the extent that this may imply that permits were required in respect of building materials or supplies produced outside the state of California and shipped into the state, it is not sustained by the evidence. The record contains two letters signed by the president of the Builders' Exchange to the effect, in one, that there 'are added,' and, in the other of later date, that 'it is now necessary to add, to the permit system,' other materials than those in the enumerated list, and the person addressed in the second is asked to govern himself accordingly. But the positive, uncontradicted evidence is that, in fact, permits were required for the originally listed materials and for nothing else. While about 28,000 permits in all were issued, there is a significant absence of evidence that any of them so issued related to other than such listed materials. Upon the proof, we reasonably cannot accept the view that these letters are enough to show a departure from the declared and established purpose of the movement on the whole to avoid interference with interstate trade by confining the permit system substantially to California produced articles.\n It is true, however, that plaster, in large measure produced in other states and shipped into California, was on the list; but the evidence is that the permit requirement was confined to such plaster as previously had been brought into the state and commingled with the common mass of local property, and in respect of which, therefore, the interstate movement and the interstate commercial \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 79]\n\u00a0\n status had ended. This situation is utterly unlike that presented in the Swift Case, supra, where, the only interruption of the interstate transit of live stock being that necessary to find a purchaser at the stockyards, and this the usual and constantly recurring course, it was held (pages 398- 399 [25 S. Ct. 276]) that there was thus constituted 'a current of commerce among the states,' of which the purchase was but a part and incident. The same is true of Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 516\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229, which likewise dealt with the interstate shipment and sale of live stock. The stockyards, to which such live stock was consigned and delivered, are there described, not as a place of rest or final destination, but as 'a throat through which the current flows,' and the sale as only an incident which does not stop the flow but merely changes the private interest in the subject of the current without interfering with its continuity. In Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 309\n, 44 S. Ct. 96, a commodity produced in one state was consigned to a local agency of the producer in another not as a consummation of the transit, but for delivery to the customer. This court held that the intermediate delivery did not end, and was not intended to end, the movement of the commodity, but merely halted it 'as a convenient step in the process of getting it to its final destination.'\n But here the delivery of the plaster to the local representative or dealer was the closing incident of the interstate movement, and ended the authority of the federal government under the commerce clause of the Constitution. What next was done with it was the result of new and independent arrangements.\n In respect of other materials of the character of those on the selected list, brought from other states, it is enough to say that the quantities were not only of little comparative consequence, but it is not shown that they were subjected to the permit rule. \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 80]\n\u00a0\n Second. That the permit requirement for California produced materials interfered with the free movement of materials and supplies from other states. No doubt there was such an interference, but the extent of it, being neither shown nor perhaps capable of being shown, is a matter of surmise. It was, however, an interference not within the design of the appellants, but purely incidental to the accomplishment of a different purpose. The court below laid especial stress upon the point that plumbers' supplies, which for the most part were manufactured outside the state, though not included under the permit system, were prevented from entering the state by the process of refusing a permit to purchase other materials, which were under the system, to any one who employed a plumber who was not observing the 'American plan.' This is to say, in effect, that the building contractor, being unable to purchase the permit materials, and consequently unable to go on with the job, would have no need for plumbing supplies, with the result that the trade in them, to that extent, would be diminished. But this ignores the all-important fact that there was no interference with the freedom of the outside manufacturer to sell and ship or of the local contractor to buy. The process went no further than to take away the latter's opportunity to use, and, therefore, his incentive to purchase. The effect upon, and interference with, interstate trade, if any, were clearly incidental, indirect and remote-precisely such an interference as this court dealt with in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., supra, and United Leather Workers v. Herkert, \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S. Ct. 623, 33 A. L. R. 566.\n In the Coronado Case there was an attempt on the part of the owners of a coal mine to operate it upon the 'open shop' basis. The officers and members of a local miners' union thereupon engaged in a strike, which was carried on with circumstances of violence resulting in the destruction of property and the injury and death of persons. A \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 81]\n\u00a0\n conspiracy and an intent to obstruct mining operations were established, and it was proved that the effect thereof was to prevent a part of the product of the mine from going into interstate commerce. It was held that this would not constitute a conspiracy to restrain such commerce, in the absence of proof of an intention to restrain it or proof of such a direct and substantial effect upon it, that such intention reasonably must be inferred. It was pointed out that there was nothing in the circumstances or declarations of the parties to indicate that the strikers had in mind any interference with interstate commerce or competition, when they engaged in the attempt to break up the plan to operate the mines with nonunion labor, and, conceding that the natural result would be to keep the preponderating part of the output of the mine from being shipped out of the state, the effect on interstate commerce was not of such substance that a purpose to restrain interstate commerce might be inferred.\n In the United Leather Workers Case there was a strike, accompanied by illegal picketing and intimidation of workers, to prevent, and which had the effect of preventing, the continued manufacture of goods by a trunk company. It was held that this was not a conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce within the Anti-Trust Act, even though the goods, to the knowledge of the strikers, were to be shipped in interstate commerce to fill orders already received and accepted from the company's customers in other states, since there was no actual or attempted interference with their transportation to, or their sale in, such states. There is in this case a complete review of the prior decisions on the subject, upon which the court concludes (page 471 [44 S. Ct. 627]):\n'This review of the cases makes it clear that the mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce, by the illegal or tortious prevention of \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 82]\n\u00a0\n its manufacture, is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. It is only when the intent or necessary effect upon such commerce in the article is to enable those preventing the manufacture to monopolize the supply, control its price or discriminate as between its would-be purchasers, that the unlawful interference with its manufacture can be said directly to burden interstate commerce. ...\n\n'We concur with the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals when, in speaking of the conclusion of the majority, he said: 'The natural, logical and inevitable result will be that every strike in any industry or even in any single factory will be within the Sherman Act and subject to federal jurisdiction provided any appreciable amount of its product enters into interstate commerce.\"\n\n In its essential features, the present case is controlled by this reasoning. If an executed agreement to strike, with the object and effect of closing down a mine or a factory, by preventing the employment of necessary workmen, the indirect result of which is that the sale and shipment of goods and products in interstate commerce is prevented or diminished, is not an unlawful restraint of such commerce, it cannot consistently be held otherwise in respect of an agreement and combination of employers or others to frustate a strike and defeat the strikers by keeping essential domestic building materials out of their hands and the hands of their sympathizers, because the means employed, whether lawful or unlawful, produce a like indirect result. The alleged conspiracy and the acts here complained of, spent their intended and direct force upon a local situation-for building is as essentially local as mining, manufacturing or growing crops-and if, by a resulting diminution of the commercial demand, interstate trade was curtailed either generally or in specific instances that was a fortuitous consequence so remote and indirect as plainly to cause it to fall outside the reach of the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.). \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 83]\n\u00a0\n The government relies with much confidence upon Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, and Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196; but the facts there and the facts here were entirely different. Both cases, like the Coronado and the United Leather Workers Cases and the present case, arose out of labor disputes; but in the former cases, unlike the latter ones, the object of the labor organizations was sought to be attained by a countrywide boycott of the employer's goods for the direct purpose of preventing their sale and transportation in interstate commerce in order to force a compliance with their demands. The four cases and the one here, considered together, clearly illustrate the vital difference, under the Sherman Act, between a direct, substantial, and intentional interference with interstate commerce and an interference which is incidental, indirect, remote, and outside the purposes of those causing it.\n Third. That persons in other states were directly prevented or discouraged from shipping into California. In respect of the alleged instances of direct interference with interstate sales and shipments, the evidence is sharply conflicting, with the preponderance in most cases, we think, on the side of appellants. In many of them the interferences had no connection with the 'American plan,' or the system and efforts employed to effectuate it, but were in furtherance of independent trade policies or other isolated and disconnected purposes. One such case was that of the Golden Gate Building Material Company, consisting of five plastering contractors, where the basis of the refusal to accept orders for supplies was a protest by certain dealers that the company was buying for individual use and not for resale, and had been formed merely to obtain dealers' prices. A class of interferences strongly pressed in argument was that in respect of plumbing supplies, practically all of which were manufactured outside the state of California. Lists of plumbing contractors \n\n[268 U.S. 64, 84]\n\u00a0\n who were not observing the 'American plan' were sent to the plumbing supply houses, and some of them refused to sell materials to such contractors. That there was, at least, a sympathetic connection between this action and the 'American plan,' may be assumed, although plumbing supplies were not within the scope of the permit list. However this may be, and whatever may have been the original situation, the practice was abandoned long before the present suit was instituted, and nothing appears by way of threat or otherwise to indicate the probability of its ever being resumed. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for present relief by injunction. United States v. U. S. Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417, 444\n, 445 S., 40 S. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121\n\n\n By the foregoing process of elimination, the interferences which may have been unlawful are reduced to some three or four sporadic and doubtful instances, during a period of nearly two years. And when we consider that the aggregate value of the materials involved in these few and widely separated instances, was, at the utmost, a few thousand dollars, compared with an estimated expenditure of $100,000,000 in the construction of buildings in San Francisco during the same time, their weight, as evidence to establish a conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce or to establish such restraint in fact, becomes so insignificant as to call for the application of the maxim, 'de minimus non curat lex.' To extend a statute intended to reach and suppress real interferences with the free flow of commerce among the states to a situation so equivocal and so lacking in substance would be to cast doubt upon the serious purpose with which it was framed.\n The decree of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIRWIN v.

The Collector demurred to the complaint. The demurrer was overruled and judgment given for the plaintiff by the District Court (275 F. 643), and the Circuit Court of Appeals (295 F. 84). A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n264 \nU.S. 579\n, 44 S. Ct. 453.\n The question is whether the sums received by the plaintiff under the will of Anthony N. Brady in 1913, 1914 and 1915, were income and taxed. The will, admitted to probate August 12, 1913, left the residue of the estate in trust to be divided into six equal parts, the income of one part to be applied so far as deemed proper by the trustees to the education and support of the testator's granddaughter, Marcia Ann Gavit, the balance to be divided into two equal parts and one of them to be paid to the testator's son-in-law, the plaintiff, in equal quarter-yearly payments during his life. But on the granddaughter's reaching the age of twenty-one or dying the fund went over, so that, the granddaughter then being six years old, it is said, the plaintiff's interest could not exceed fifteen years. The Courts below held that the payments received were property acquired by bequest, were not income and were not subject to tax.\n The statute in Section 2, A, subdivision 1, provides that there shall be levied a tax 'upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding calendar year to every citizen of the United States.' If these payments properly may be called income by the common understanding of that word and the statute has failed to hit them it has missed so much of the general purpose that it expresses at the start. Congress intended to use its power to the full extent. Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 203\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. By B the net income is to include 'gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever, including the income from but not not the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent.' \n\n[268 U.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n By D trustees are to make 'return of the net income of the person for whom they act, subject to this tax,' and by D trustees and others, having the control or payment of fixed or determinable gains, etc., of another person who are required to render a return on behalf of another are 'authorized to withhold enough to pay the normal tax.' The language quoted leaves no doubt in our minds that if a fund were given to trustees for A for life with remainder over, the income received by the trustees and paid over to A would be income of A under the statute. It seems to us hardly less clear that even if there were a specific provision that A should have no interest in the corpus, the payments would be income none the less, within the meaning of the statute and the Constitution, and by popular speech. In the first case it is true that the bequest might be said to be of the corpus for life, in the second it might be said to be of the income. But we think that the provision of the act that exempts bequests assumes the gift of a corpus and contrasts it with the income arising from it, but was not intended to exempt income property socalled simply because of a severance between it and the principal fund. No such conclusion can be drawn from Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 207 S., 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. The money was income in the hands of the trustees and we know of nothing in the law that prevented its being paid and received as income by the donee.\n The courts below went on the ground that the gift to the plaintiff was a bequest and carried no interest in the corpus of the fund. We do not regard those considerations as conclusive, as we have said, but if it were material a gift of the income of a fund ordinarily is treated by equity as creating an interest in the fund. Apart from technicalities we can perceive no distinction relevant to the question before us between a gift of the fund for life and a gift of the income from it. The fund is appropriated \n\n[268 U.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n to the production of the same result whichever form the gift takes. Neither are we troubled by the question where to draw the line. That is the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560. Day and night, youth and age are only types. But the distinction between the cases put of a gift from the corpus of the estate payable in instalments and the present seems to us not hard to draw, assuming that the gift supposed would not be income. This is a gift from the income of a very large fund, as income. It seems to us immaterial that the same amounts might receive a different color from their source. We are of opinion that quarterly payments, which it was hoped would last for fifteen years, from the income of an estate intended for the plaintiff's child, must be regarded as income within the meaning of the Constitution and the law. It is said that the tax laws should be construed favorably for the taxpayers. But that is not a reason for creating a doubt or for exaggerating one when it is no greater than we can bring ourselves to feel in this case.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n By the plain terms of the Revenue Act of 1913, the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent is not to be included in net income. Only the income derived from such property is subject to the tax. The question, as it seems to me, is really a very simple one. Money, of course, is property. The money here sought to be taxed as income was paid to respondent under the express provisions of a will. It was a gift by will-a bequest. United States v. Merrian, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 184\n, 44 S. Ct. 69, 29 A. L. R. 1547. It, therefore, fell within the precise letter of the statute; and, under well settled principles, judicial inquiry may go no further. The taxpayer is entitled to the \n\n[268 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n rigor of the law. There is no latitude in a taxing statute; you must adhere to the very words. United States v. Merriam, supra, pages 187, 188 ( 44 S. Ct. 69).\n The property which respondent acquired being a bequest, there is no occasion to ask whether, before being handed over to him, it had been carved from the original corpus of, or from subsequent additions to, the estate. The corpus of the estate was not the legacy which respondent received, but merely the source which gave rise to it. The money here sought to be taxed was not the fruits of a legacy; it was the legacy itself. Matter of Stanfield, 135 N. Y. 292, 294, 31 N. E. 1013\n\n\n With the utmost respect for the judgment of my brethren to the contrary, the opinion just rendered, I think without warrant, searches the field of argument and inference for a meaning which should be found only in the strict letter of the statute.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAMES SHEWAN & SONS v.

Supp. 1923,  1251 1\/4-1251 1\/4 l). Nothing was said in the opinion about costs. The ordinary rule is that costs are not allowed against the United States. Pine River Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279, 296\n, 22 S. Ct. 920; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 272\n, 16 S. Ct. 754; United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 163; The Antelope, 12 Wheat. 546, 550. The mandate issued by the clerk accordingly did not award any costs against the United States. The appellant now applies for a withdrawal of the mandate, in order to award them. He relies on section 3 of the act (section 1251 1\/4 b) under which the suit was brought. That provides that such suits shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties. A decree against the United States may include costs of suit, and when the decree is for money judgment, interest also at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall be stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based. Interest is to run as ordered by the court. In accordance with this provision we must assess the costs of this appeal against theUnited States, and direct the District Court to assess also the costs of suit in that court and interest as that court shall order it in accordance with the statute.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY STRUCTURAL STEEL CO. v. STATE OF ARKANSAS(1925)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Armwell L. Cooper, or Kansas City, Mo., and Charles T. Coleman and J. W. House, Jr., both of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. R. Wilson, of El Dorado, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, a corporation organized under the laws of Missouri, brings here for review (section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214)) a judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas which affirmed a judgment of the circuit court of Shelby county imposing a fine of $1,000 on plaintiff in error for doing business in Arkansas without obtaining permission. The laws of the state require every corporation incorporated in any other state, doing business in Arkansas, to file in the office of the secretary of state certain evidence of its organization and a financial statement, to designate its general office and place of business in Arkansas, and to name an agent there and authorize process to be served upon him. It is provided that any corporation which shall do business in Arkansas without having complied with these requirements shall be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000. Sections 1825-1832, Crawford & Moses' Digest of Laws of Arkansas.\n Plaintiff in error contends that, as applied in this case, the state enactments are repugnant to the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. \n\n[269 U.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n The material facts are these: May 3, 1921, plaintiff in error made a bid to the Wilmot road district for the construction of a steel bridge near Wilmot, in Ashley county, Ark. Its offer was accepted, and on that day a contract covering the work was signed in Arkansas by the representatives of the parties. The contract was not to become effective until a bond was given by the contractor to secure its faithful performance. The bond was executed in Missouri two days later. June 14, 1921, plaintiff in error sublet all the work except the erection of the steel superstructure to the Yancy Construction Company, a partnership whose members were residents of Kansas. August 17, 1921, plaintiff in error secured permission, as required by the laws of Arkansas, to do business in that state. Before such permission was obtained, the greater part of the work sublet had been completed; plaintiff in error had made certain shipments of steel, consisting of reinforcing rods, steel piers, tubes and angles from Kansas City, Mo., to itself at Wilmot, Ark., for use in the construction of the bridge; and these materials had been delivered to the subcontractor and used in the performance of the work done by it. The steel for the superstructure was fabricated by plaintiff in error in its plant in Kansas City, some before and some after the permission was obtained.\n The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the things done by plaintiff in error before August 17, 1921, constituted intrastate business in Arkansas. But the plaintiff in error contends that all was interstate commerce. We accept the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas as to what constitutes the doing of business in that state within the meaning of its own laws. Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 \nU.S. 472, 483\n, 44 S. Ct. 369. But this court will determine for itself whether what was done by plaintiff in error was interstate commerce and whether the state enactments as applied are repugnant to the commerce clause. Plain- \n\n[269 U.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n tiff in error cites Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106. It was there held that 'such commerce (among the states) is not confined to transportation from one state to another, but comprehends all commercial intercourse between different states and all the component parts of that intercourse' (page 290 (42 S. Ct. 108)), and that 'a corporation of one state may go into another, without obtaining the leave or license of the latter, for all the legitimate purposes of such commerce; and any statute of the latter state which obstructs or lays a burden on the exercise of this privilege is void under the commerce clause' (page 291 (42 S. Ct. 109)). In that case, a Tennessee corporation, in pursuance of its practice of purchasing grain in Kentucky, to be transported to and used in its Tennessee mill, made a contract for the purchase of wheat to be delivered in Kentucky on the cars of a public carrier, intending to forward it as soon as delivery was made. It was held that the transaction was interstate commerce, notwithstanding the contract was made and was to be performed in Kentucky. All the things done in Kentucky had reference to and were included in the interstate transaction.\n But in the case now before the court the construction of the bridge necessarily involved some work and business in Arkansas, which were separate and district from any interstate commerce that might be involved in the performance of the contract. From the beginning, transactions local to Arkansas were contemplated. In fact, plaintiff in error obtained permission to do business in Arkansas in order to be authorized to erect the steel superstructure-the part of the work it had not sublet. But, before obtaining such permission, it made the bid and signed the contract in Arkansas; it shipped from Kansas City to itself at Wilmot the materials for the performance of the work it had sublet, and, after the interstate transit had ended, delivered them to the subcontractor who used them in the work. We need not \n\n[269 U.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n consider whether, under the circumstances shown, the making of the bid, the signing of the contract, and execution of the bond would be within the protection of the commerce clause, if these acts stood alone. But it is certain that, when all are taken together, the things done by plaintiff in error in Arkansas before obtaining the permission constitute or include intrastate business. The delivery of the materials to the subcontractor was essential to the building of the bridge, and that was an intrastate and not an interstate transaction. The fact that the materials had moved from Missouri into Arkansas did not make the delivery of them to the subcontractor interstate commerce. So far as concerns the question here involved, the situation is the equivalent of what it would have been if the materials had been shipped into the state and held for sale in a warehouse, and had been furnished to the subcontractor by a dealer. We think it plain that the plaintiff in error did business of a local and intrastate character in Arkansas before it obtained permission. General Railway Signal Co. v.

Donovan, for appellee. \n\n[267 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order dismissing a petition of the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition alleges that the petitioner is a citizen of the United States, and that she is unlawfully detained by the respondent under a warrant of deportation issued by the Assistant Secretary of Labor, without jurisdiction and without due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. An appeal was taken directly to this Court on the alleged infringement of the appellant's constitutional rights. Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 13\n, 28 S. Ct. 201; Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 42 S. Ct. 492.\n The appellant was born in Russia. On July 20, 1914, being then about thirteen years old, she was brought to this country, where her father already was, by her mother. Upon examination she was certified to be feeble minded, and was ordered to be excluded, but before the order could be carried into effect the European war had begun. Deportation necessarily was suspended, and she was kept at Ellis Island until June, 1915. In the latter half of that month she was handed over to the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society upon its undertaking to accept custody of the child until she could be deported safely, to return her when required, and meanwhile to prevent her becoming a public charge. The Society allowed her to live with her father, which she has done ever since. On December 14, 1920, her father was naturalized, she being then about nineteen. The warrant of deportation was issued on January 19, 1923; the writ of habeas corpus was allowed on April 24, and was dismissed on the following October 9.\n It is not questioned that the appellant rightly was denied admission in July, 1914, or that she is feeble minded \n\n[267 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n still. Act of March 26, 1910, c. 128; 36 Stat. 263. But it is said that she became a citizen by the naturalization of her father while she was a minor and in this country, Rev. St.  2172 (Comp. St.  4367) and that she cannot be deported upon a warrant issued more than five years after her entry into the United States. Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29,  19, 39 Stat. 874, 889 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  42891\/4 jj); Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134,  20; 34 Stat. 898, 904. The answers to both arguments are much the same. Naturalization of parents affects minor children only 'if dwelling in the United States.' Rev. St.  2172. The appellant could not lawfully have landed in the United States in view of the express prohibition of the Act of 1910 just referred to, and until she legally landed 'could not have dwelt within the United States.' Zartarian v. Billings, \n204 \nU.S. 170, 175\n, 27 S. Ct. 182, 184 (51 L. Ed. 428). Moreover while she was at Ellis Island she was to be regarded as stopped at the boundary line and kept there unless and until her right to enter should be declared. United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 263\n, 25 S. Ct. 644. When her prison bounds were enlarged by committing her to the custody of the Hebrew Society, the nature of her stay within the territory was not changed. She was still in theory of law at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the United States. Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651, 661\n, 12 S. Ct. 336. She never has been dwelling in the United States within the meaning of the Act. Still more clearly she never has begun to reside permanently in the United States within the later Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2534,  5; 34 Stat. 1229 (Comp. St.  3962). United States ex rel. Patton v. Tod (C. C. A.) 297 F. 385, affirming (D. C.) 292 F. 243; United States ex rel. De Rienzo v. Rodgers, 185 F. 334, 107 C. C. A. 452.\n The later of the limitation acts, the Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29 ,  19, 39 Stat. 874, 889, applies to 'any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law' and to 'any alien who shall have entered or who shall be found in the United \n\n[267 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n States in violation of this Act.' For the reasons already stated the appellant never has entered the United States within the meaning of the law, and is not properly described in the warrant as 'found in the United States in violation of the immigrant authorities.' Theoretically she is in custody at the limit of the jurisdiction awaiting the order of the authorities. It would be manifestly absurd to hold that the five years run in favor of one held at Ellis Island for deportation, and as we have said the position of the appellant is the same.\n Order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNEWEL v. EGAN(1925)\nNo. 622\nArgued: April 2, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Byron S. Payne, of Pierre, S. D., for appellant.\n Mr. George W. Egan, of Sioux Falls, S. D., pro se.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of South Dakota from \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n an order and judgment of that court on writ of habeas corpus, discharging the appellee from the custody of the appellant as sheriff of Minnehaha county, S. D.\n Appellee was charged, on information by the state's attorney of that county, with the presentation of a false insurance claim in violation of section 4271 of the Revised Code of 1919 of South Dakota. He was convicted of violation of the statute, after trial by jury, in the South Dakota circuit court in May, 1920, and was sentenced to serve a term in the state penitentiary. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, judgment of conviction was vacated and new trial granted. State v. Egan, 44 S. D. 273, 183 N. W. 652.\n Egan was again brought to trial on the same charge in April, 1922, and was again found guilty, and sentenced to serve a term in the state penitentiary. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, the judgment of conviction was affirmed. State v. Egan (S. D.) 195 N. W. 642.\n Before the District Court, the appellee urged, as he urges here, two principal grounds for granting the writ, namely, that the information on which the conviction was had did not describe a public offense; that in it no venue was laid; and that in consequence the trial court was without jurisdiction in the cause.\n Section 4271 of the Revised Code of South Dakota, under which the conviction was had, so far as pertinent, reads as follows:\n'Every person who presents or causes to be presented any false or fraudulent claim, or any proof in support of any such claim, upon any contract of insurance for the payment of any loss, ... is punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary not exceeding three years, or by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or both.'\n\n The information charged in substance that the Fireman's Insurance Company, a corporation of Newark, N. J., was empowered to do business in the state of South \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n Dakota and in pursuance of this authority insured certain property of petitioner located in Minnehaha county, that the property was destroyed by fire, and that thereafter petitioner presented a false claim to its agents; the language of the information being:\n'And that thereafter and on or about the 9th day of January, 1920, the said defendant, George W. Egan, then and there did willfully, unlawfully and feloniously present and cause to be presented to F. C. Whitehouse & Co., who were at that time acting as the agents for the Firemen's Insurance Company of Newark, N. J., a false and fraudulent claim and proof in support of such claim.'\n\n The circuit court of Minnehaha county, in which appellee's trial and conviction were had, by the provisions of the Constitution of South Dakota ( section 14, art. 5) and the Revised Code of South Dakota, 1919,  4653, is given original jurisdiction of all actions and causes both at law and in equity and original jurisdiction to try and determine all cases of felony. It accordingly had plenary jurisdiction to try the charge of violation of section 4271 of the Revised Code which makes the presentation of false or fraudulent insurance claims a crime punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary, which, by section 3573, is made a felony. The circuit court is not limited in its jurisdiction by the statutes of the state to any particular county. Its jurisdiction extends as far as the statute law extends in its application, namely, throughout the limits of the state. The only limitation in this regard, contained in the statute, is found in section 4654, which provides in substance that the issue of fact in any criminal case can only be tried in the court in which it is brought, or to which the place of trial is changed by order of the court.\n Section 4771 provides that defendant may demur to the information when it appears upon its face 'that the court is without jurisdiction of the offense charged.' Section 4779 provides that objections to which demurrers may be \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n interposed under section 4771 are waived, with certain exceptions not here material, unless taken by demurrer.\n Appellee pleaded 'not guilty' to the indictment. His application, made later, to withdraw the plea and demur was denied, the court acting within its discretionary power. State v. Egan (S. D.) 195 N. W. 642. The Supreme Court of South Dakota, in sustaining the verdict and upholding the conviction, held that the information sufficiently charged a public offense under section 4271, State v. Egan, 44 S. D. 273, 183 N. W. 652, and it also held that the objection to the failure to state the venue in the information was waived by the failure to demur. From the foregoing it will be observed that what appellee is really seeking on this appeal is a review on habeas corpus of the determination of the Supreme Court of South Dakota that the information was sufficient as a pleading and a determination that the decision of the state court holding that under the Revised Code of 1919 (sections 4725, 4771, 4779) the appellee waived the objection that the information did not state the venue by not demurring, was a denial of his constitutional rights which can be reviewed on habeas corpus.\n It is the settled rule of this court that habeas corpus calls in question only the jurisdiction of the court whose judgment is challenged. Andrews v. Swartz, \n156 \nU.S. 272\n, 15 S. Ct. 389; Bergemann v. Backer, \n157 \nU.S. 655\n, 15 S. Ct. 727; In re Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S. Ct. 658; Felts v.

Ct. 582.\n A person convicted of crime by a judgment of a state court may secure the review of that judgment by the highest state court and if unsuccessful there may then resort to this court by writ of error if an appropriate federal question be involved and decided against him, or if he be imprisoned under the judgment, he may proceed by writ of habeas corpus on constitutional grounds summarily to determine whether he is restrained of his liberty by judgment of a court acting without jurisdiction. \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n See Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241\n, 6 S. Ct. 734. But if he pursues the latter remedy, he may not use it as a substitute for a writ of error. Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n; In re Coy, \n127 \nU.S. 731\n, 8 S. Ct. 1263. It is fundamental that a court upon which is conferred jurisdiction to try an offense has jurisdiction to determine whether or not that offense is charged or proved. Otherwise every judgment of conviction would be subject to collateral attack and review on habeas corpus on the ground that no offense was charged or proved. It has been uniformly held by this court that the sufficiency of an indictment cannot be reviewed in habeas corpus proceedings. Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 U.S. 651\n;1 Ex parte Parks, supra; In re Coy, supra; Bergemann v. Backer, supra; Howard v. Fleming, \n191 \nU.S. 126\n, 24 S.

Ct. 525\n\n\n Appellee stands in no better situation with respect to the failure to allege venue in the information. A mere failure to allege venue, and thus to show affirmatively that the crime was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, does not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the cause, and the sufficiency of the indictment cannot be called in question upon habeas corpus. Even though an indictment thus drawn might have been found defective upon demurrer or writ of error, it is not so fatal, upon its face, as to be open to collateral attack after trial and conviction. United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 \nU.S. 48, 59\n, 14 S. Ct. 746; and see State v. Egan, 44 S. D. 273, 277, 183 N. W. 652.\n Moreover, as this case was conducted in the state court, the ultimate question presented is whether the procedure established by the statutes of South Dakota providing that failure to allege venue in the information is waived, unless demurred to, is a denial of a constitutional right. With respect to that question, we hold, as \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n this court has repeatedly held, that the judgment of state courts in criminal cases will not be reviewed on habeas corpus merely because some right under the Constitution of the United States is alleged to have been denied to the person convicted. The proper remedy is by writ of error. Markuson v. Boucher, \n175 \nU.S. 184\n, 20 S. Ct. 76. And see Baker v. Grice, \n169 \nU.S. 284\n, 18 S. Ct. 323, and Tinsley v. Anderson, \n171 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 18 S. Ct. 805. See, also, with respect to review, on habeas corpus, of judgments of United States District Courts, Riddle v. Dyche, \n262 \nU.S. 333\n, 43 S. Ct. 555, and Craig v. Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255\n, 44 S. Ct. 103. The judgment of the District Court was without warrant under the decisions of this court and must be reversed.\n The appeal in this case was applied for by counsel for the appellant; an assignment of errors was filed and the appeal was allowed conditional upon filing the usual appeal bond. The bond was executed by appellant, and was duly approved and filed.\n Later a motion was made to this court by other counsel appearing for appellant for that purpose, to strike from the record the brief and argument filed on his behalf by the counsel by whom the appeal was taken, on the ground that appellant never authorized the preparation or presentation of any brief in this proceeding, and that he never authorized any attorneys to appear in this court for him as appellant. Motion has also been made on the same ground by appellee to strike from the record the brief filed in behalf of appellant and to dismiss the appeal. The affidavit of appellant in support of appellee's motion purports to show that the appeal was taken by members of the bar representing the Attorney General of South Dakota, and that the appeal was taken without appellant's unqualified approval, and states that he is satisfied with the decision of the District Court in the premises and that he desires the appeal to be dismissed. \n\n[268 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n The attorneys who took the appeal have also filed a motion to substitute for the appellant one Boardman, who since the taking of the appeal has been duly elected sheriff in the place of appellant and who consents to the substitution. The state of South Dakota also has filed a motion by its Attorney General appearing by the counsel who took the appeal, to be allowed to intervene on this appeal. All the motions referred to are now pending.\n The affidavit of appellant in support of appellee's motion to dismiss discloses an obviously collusive attempt by appellant and appellee to defeat the ends of justice by dismissing the appeal without the consent of any officer representing either the state or the present sheriff, who are the real parties in interest as appellants. Appellant in his affidavit admits that while he was in office as sheriff, he took the present appeal and he executed the appeal bond. He is therefore in this court as party appellant; the court has full jurisdiction of the appeal and it cannot be withdrawn without its consent. The real parties in interest in prosecuting the appeal are the state and the present sheriff who is a public officer representing the county and the state. The substitution of the sheriff as appellant should be made (Thompson v. United States, \n103 U.S. 480\n, 483), and the state be allowed to intervene.\n The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\n The motions for substitution of the present sheriff for the appellant and for the intervention by the state are granted.\n The order of the District Court discharging the appellee from custody is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with direction to remand him to the custody of the present sheriff.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 4 S.

C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for the United States. \n\n[266 U.S. 537, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing, on demurrer, a petition filed by Kunhardt & Co., Inc., against the United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 718.\n The material facts alleged in the petition and shown by the accompanying exhibits, are these: The claimant is a New York corporation, engaged in importing. On September 10, 1918, the Director of Aircraft Production issued to it a purchase order for the growth of 50,000 to 75, 000 bushels of castor beans, to be delivered by the claimant, at a specified price, at Puerto Cortez, Honduras, or, at the option of the Government, at a specified higher price, at any United States port on the Gulf of Mexico. On September 16 this order was incorporated in a contract between the United States and the claimant. In October the Government officers insisted that as they were having difficulty in finding transportation and the claimant had a schooner, the Herbert May, it should provide transportation for the beans from Honduras and Guatemala to New Orleans-as it could be required to do under the option reserved respecting the place of delivery. The claimant, having no use for the schooner, was then negotiating its sale and had received an offer of $75,000. But as this was the only means of transportation available to it, the claimant, it is alleged, was 'forced' to retain possession of the schooner, and had it prepared for the trip to the West Indies. On November 6 the Director of Aircraft Production issued to the claimant a second purchase order for 75, 000 to 100,000 bushels of castor beans, to be grown or purchased in Honduras or Guatemala and delivered at New Orleans, at a specified price. This order was incorporated in a second contract between the United States and the claimant, dated November 12, although executed later. This contract contained a provision that if the Director \n\n[266 U.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n of Aircraft Production should terminate it prior to completion, the United States should, among other things, pay the claimant 'on account of depreciation of plant, facilities and equipment' provided by the claimant for the performance of the contract, the amount by which their cost to the claimant should exceed their fair market value at the time of such termination, as determined by three appraisers. On November 14 the Director of Aircraft Production suspended the second contract, and a few days later canceled both contracts. The claimant, then having no use for the schooner, sold it for $40,000, the highest price obtainable, thus, it is alleged, suffering 'a loss from depreciation in the value of the schooner of $35,000.' Negotiations were subsequently had for settlement of the losses caused to the claimant by the cancellation of the contracts. In January, 1919, the contracting officer and the claimant executed a contract providing that its claim should be settled for $35,000, including $ 10,521.22 for depreciation loss on the schooner. This contract provided that it should not become binding until approved by the Board of Contract Review; and it was not so approved. In May, 1919, the contracting officer and the claimant executed another contract of settlement-which was duly approved-under which the United States paid $24,478.78 as full compensation for the services rendered and expenditures and obligations incurred by the claimant under both of the purchase contracts,1 and in discharge of all its claims thereunder except that 'for depreciation on schooner,' which was reserved.\n The petition prays judgment for $35,000, the amount of the loss alleged to have resulted to the claimant from depreciation in the value of the schooner, and for general relief. \n\n[266 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n The demurrer to the petition is based on the ground that the facts therein set forth do not state a cause of action against the United States.\n This demurrer was properly sustained. It is clear that on the facts alleged the depreciation in the sale value of the schooner cannot be recovered on the theory which the claimant here urges, that this is compensation for a taking of the schooner 'under eminent domain' in the performance of 'obligatory orders or requisitions' for the sale and delivery of the castor beans. The United States did not requisition or take over the schooner, or appropriate its use. The first purchase contract gave the United States the option to require the castor beans to be delivered at any Gulf port in the United States; and the second specifically required them to be delivered at New Orleans. The United States, therefore, was entirely within its contract rights in insisting that the claimant should deliver the beans at New Orleans, as agreed; and if the claimant had no other means of so delivering them than by using its own schooner for that purpose, it was, in preparing so to do, merely conforming to its contract obligation.\n There can be no recovery under the provision in the second contract that if terminated before completion the United States would pay the claimant for depreciation of the plant, facilities and equipment provided for its performance. Even if the use for transportation purposes of a schooner previously owned by the claimant could be regarded as the providing of a facility or equipment within the meaning of the contract, the obligation was merely to pay the difference between the 'cost' of the facility or equipment to the claimant and its value at the termination of the contract, as determined by appraisers. There is no allegation as to the cost of the schooner; and no averment that its value at the termination of the contract was determined by appraisers. And for all that appears its \n\n[266 U.S. 537, 541]\n\u00a0\n cost to the claimant may have been less than the amount for which it was sold.\n Nor can there be any recovery on the theory that under the contract executed by the contracting officer in January, 1919, the United States agreed to pay $10,521.22 or any other sum, for depreciation loss on the schooner. This contract, not having been approved by the Board of Contract Review, became by its own terms of no binding force or effect whatever.\n The petition does not state a cause of action against the United States; and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This contract recited that the second purchase contract had superseded the first. This does not otherwise appear from the allegations of the petition. \n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL RICHARDSON & CO. v. U S(1925)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Raymond M. Hudson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by L. Richardson & Company, Inc., to recover damages for the breach of an agreement alleged \n\n[266 U.S. 541, 542]\n\u00a0\n to have been made by the United States for the purchase of a quantity of wool, grading higher than fifty-sixes, imported by the claimant from South Africa. The United States demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not state a cause of action. This demurrer was sustained, without opinion, and judgment entered dismissing the petition. 58 Ct. Cl. 717.\n In November, 1917, the President issued a Proclamation prohibiting the importation of wool and other enumerated articles into the United States, except under licenses granted by the War Trade Board, in accordance with its regulations or orders. \n1\n In December, the Board issued a regulation requiring every applicant for a wool import license to sign an agreement granting the United States an option to purchase all or any part of the wool covered by the application, for ten days after its custom house entry, at a specified price basis. In January, 1918, this was superseded by another regulation issued by the Board, requiring that the importers of wool should sign agreements granting such options of purchase to the United States, before the delivery or release of the wool to them. Thereafter, as appears from exhibits to the petition, the Quartermaster General of the Army wrote certain letters containing announcements as to the grades of wool on which it was intended to exercise the options granted to the Government by the importers. These are described in the petition as 'regulations issued by the Quartermaster General in behalf of the War Department;' and it is alleged that under them he exercised the options on the grades of wool enumerated and thereby made 'purchases' of such wool. Two of them were written to the Wool Administrator, an official in the Quartermaster Corps. In one of these, dated April 1, 1918, the Wool Administrator was directed to announce, among other things, that the \n\n[266 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n Quartermaster Corps would not exercise the option in respect to wool finer than fifty-sixes that had been bought prior to April 1, but reserved the right to exercise it on wool bought on or after that date. In the other, dated May 17, the Quartermaster General announced that the War Industries Board having then fixed the price of wool in the United States, he would 'until further notice' exercise the import license option on all imported wool, except that grading above fifty-sixes bought prior to April 1, and certain wool grading forties and below; and directed the Wool Administrator to distribute this information to all importers interested. The petition alleges that this 'regulation' was issued through the Wool Top and Yarn Branch of the Quartermaster General's Office, and was an exercise of the option retained by the Government under the 'regulation' of April 1, on all wool imported into the United States after April 1 that graded above fifty-sixes.\n The petition further alleges, in general and indefinite terms, without giving details, and omitting many specific dates, that 'subsequent to April 1, 1918, and prior to July 12, 1918,' the claimant purchased 7, 168 bales and 1,518 bags of South African wool of the grade finer than fifty-sixes, and duly executed the proper import license applications and the options and agreements to sell to the Government as required under the January regulation of the War Trade Board; that under said options and agreements and by the 'regulation' of May 17, the Government agreed to buy this wool and to pay the claimant therefor '$1,434,045.60, being the price fixed by the War Industries Board'; that 'subsequent to May 17,' the 'Government officers' canceled the claimant's import licenses and issued new ones requiring that the wool be consigned to a designated Government agency and that the bills of lading be assigned to the Quartermaster General;2 \n\n[266 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n that on July 18, when the claimant sought to charter a vessel from the Shipping Board to transport a part of the wool, it was required to guarantee that only wool destined for the Quartermaster General would be carried; that on December 23, 1918, the Wool Administrator, who 'was authorized by the Quartermaster General and by the Government to buy and accept said wool,' wrote the claimant a letter stating that he had notified its agent that he would take 17,200 bales of wool therein described, including the said 7,168 bales and 1,518 bags, which, it is alleged, 'he so agreed to buy'; that the claimant imported said wool and offered delivery thereof to the Government, but that although the Government accepted and paid for part of said 17,200 bales it arbitrarily refused to accept and pay for said 7,168 bales and 1,518 bags; that the claimant was forced to dispose of this wool, and obtained the best possible price therefor, realizing, after deducting the cost of resale, $ 270,746 less than the price fixed by the War Industries Board; and that the claimant was caused to lose this sum by the Government's refusal to accept and pay for this wool 'as it had agreed to do.' The claimant prays judgment for this sum on account of the violation of 'said agreement' of the United States to purchase and pay for the wool, and for general relief.\n The petition does not show whether the claimant bought this wool before or after the 'regulation' of May 17. And it does not show the dates on which the claimant either applied for the import licenses, executed the option agreements, shipped the wool from South Africa, imported it into the United States, or tendered delivery to the Government. \n\n[266 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that the demurrer was rightly sustained.\n The facts alleged do not show that any authorized officer of the Government entered into any 'agreement' to purchase the claimant's wool, as claimed in the petition. The letter of May 17 from the Quartermaster General to the Wool Administrator-which is incorrectly characterized in the petition as a 'regulation' issued in behalf of the War Department- manifestly did not constitute an exercise of the options granted to the Government to purchase any or all wools finer than fifty-sixes bought after April 1, but was merely an announcement of the intention of the Quartermaster General as to the exercise of such options, and, at the most, an instruction to the Wool Administrator in reference to the exercise thereof. It neither constituted an agreement to purchase any or all of the wools that might be imported by any particular importer, nor a purchase of them. Nor is it alleged in the petition that at the time the claimant's wool was imported, the 'regulation' of May 17 was in force, or that the Quartermaster General had not given 'further notice' in reference to the exercise of the options on wools imported after the Armistice.\n There is no averment that either the 'Government officers' who required the bills of lading to be assigned to the Quartermaster General, or the Shipping Board which required a guarantee that a vessel chartered by the claimant should carry only wool destined for the Quartermaster General, had, or assumed to have, any authority to purchase wool for the Government; and it is clear that their actions did not constitute an agreement binding the United States to exercise the options on any of the wool thus imported.\n Nor does the Wool Administrator's letter of December 23 constitute an agreement to purchase the wool. The letter itself, a copy of which is exhibited with the petition, shows no such agreement. It merely notified the claimant \n\n[266 U.S. 541, 546]\n\u00a0\n that the Wool Administrator had written to its agent stating that he would take 17,200 bales of wool-which apparently had not then been imported-or the 'scoured product' thereof. It does not appear to be an exercise by the Government of any options previously executed by the claimant; it mentions no prices; and it states that as to 14,200 bales of this wool which the claimant had bought in the grease, the 'scoured product' would be taken, on the basis of a 35 per cent. shrinkage. The petition does not allege that the claimant had given the Government any options to purchase the wool on this basis, or that the proposal of the Wool Administrator to take it on this basis was ever accepted by the claimant. In short, it does not appear that any agreement was ever reached between the claimant and the Wool Administrator as to the terms and conditions on which the wool should be taken by the Government.\n It is unnecessary to review in detail various contentions urged in behalf of the claimant. They show no error in the judgment of the Court of Claims; and it is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 1721. This Board had been established by the President by an Executive Order of Oct. 12, 1917. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It appears from the petition that on July 12 the War Trade Board, after consultation with the War Industries Board and War Department, issued a 'ruling' revoking all outstanding licenses for the importation of wool from South Africa and other countries on shipments made after July 28, and providing that no licenses for such importations should be issued except to the Quartermaster General. \n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANCASTER v. MCCARTY(1925)\nNo. 148\nArgued: Decided: March 9, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. D. Gresham, of Dallas, Tex., F. H. Prendergast, of Marshall, Tex., and George Thompson, of Fort Worth, Tex., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. John J. Butts, of Cisco, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit for damages in the county court of Eastland county, Tex., by the defendants in error, partners as the Cisco Furniture Company, to recover from the plaintiffs in error, the receivers of the Texas & Pacific Railway, $198 for injury to two rugs and to three chairs shipped by the Furniture Company from Fort Worth, Tex., over the railway to Cisco, Tex., and $20 for attorney's fees exacted by a state statute for the delay of the railway in allowing and paying the claim. The real issue here is whether the amount of the damages for the admitted injury should be measured by the statutory law of Texas or by the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to the classification of traffic and fixing of rates as directed by it in accordance with the decree by the Commerce Court of the United States, affirmed by this court in Houston East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833, known as the Shreveport Case. The damage to the chairs is not involved. The question arises only as to the two rugs. The transportation \n\n[267 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n began at Fort Worth, Tex., and ended at Cisco, Tex. It was carried on under a bill of lading according to the forms of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which provided that the rates should be 70 cents per 100 pounds on rugs classified as not exceeding in value $75. The bill of lading was stamped with the following notation: 'Valuation on rugs less than $75 per 100 pounds.' The rugs in the transit were much damaged by acid and were said to be worth but $5 apiece after the damage. The shippers claim that their value when shipped was $95 apiece. Under the valuation noted on the bill of lading, their value could not have exceeded $ 60 because each rug weighed 40 pounds.\n The Texas Court of Civil Appeals, which was the highest court to which the case could be brought, because the Supreme Court of Texas held that it had no jurisdiction, relied upon article 708 of the Revised Statutes of Texas, which provides that railroad companies within the state shall not limit or restrict their liability as it existed at common law by any general or special notice or by inserting exceptions in the bill of lading, or by memorandum given upon the receipt of the goods for transportation or in any other manner, and that any such special agreement shall be invalid. These rugs were shipped March 13, 1920, after the second Cummins Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (Act Aug. 9, 1916, 39 Stat. 441, c. 301 [Comp. St.  8604a]) which permits to carriers a limitation of liability upon property received for transportation concerning which the carrier shall have been authorized by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish and maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper, or agreed upon in writing as the release value of the property. In such a case, such declaration or agreement shall have no other effect than to limit liability and recovery to an amount not exceeding the value so declared or released. \n\n[267 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n The writ of error is brought here under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214), on the ground that this order of the Interstate Commerce Commission fixing the classification and rates thereunder in an authority exercised under the United States which by the contention of the shippers was drawn in question and its validity denied by the state court. Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 \nU.S. 445, 451\n, 33 S. Ct. 329. It is not disputed, therefore, that if the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Western Classification No. 56 apply, the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas should be reversed; if article 708, R. S. of Texas, applies, the judgment should be affirmed.\n The Shreveport Case began by an application of railway carriers running west from Shreveport across the Texas state line to Houston and Dallas to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, on the ground that it exceeded its authority. The order was made in a proceeding initiated by the Railroad Commission of Louisiana before the Commission. The complaint in that proceeding was that the carriers maintained unreasonable rates from Shreveport, La., to various points in Texas, and that the carriers in the adjustment of their rates over their respective lines discriminated in favor of traffic within the state of Texas and against similar traffic between Shreveport and Texas points, that Shreveport competed in business with Houston and Dallas, and that the rates from Dallas and Houston east to intermediate points in Texas were much less according to distance than from Shreveport westward to the same points with conditions similar in all respects. The difference was substantial and injuriously affected the commerce of Shreveport. The Commission found that interstate rates out of Shreveport to main Texas points were unreasonable and it fixed maximum rates for that traffic. It also found that the rates from Houston and Dallas \n\n[267 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n eastward to Texas points were so low as to be a discrimination and an undue and unlawful preference against Shreveport and against its interstate commerce. Accordingly the carriers were directed to desist from charging higher rates from Shreveport to Dallas and Houston respectively and intermediate points than were contemporaneously charged for the same carriage from Dallas and Houston to Shreveport for equal distances. The Commerce Court sustained the order, and so did this court, leaving it to the railroad company to bring about the equality required either by decreasing the rates from Shreveport to the Texas points between that city and Dallas and Houston, or by increasing the intrastate rates from Houston and Dallas eastward to the Texas points between those cities and Shreveport. This Western Classification which the carrier applied in this case was adopted by the railroads under the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission thus sustained in the Shreveport Case. That authority rested on the supremacy of Federal authority in respect to interstate commerce. The intrastate rates fixed by the Texas State Railway Commission from Houston and Dallas eastward to Texas points were a discrimination against the interstate traffic between Shreveport and those same points, and therefore it was held to be within the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission in preventing such unlawful discrimination under the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) to direct the railways to ignore the Texas Commission rates and to establish rates, not unduly discriminating against interstate commerce, in intrastate traffic. Such an order of course included classification as well as rates. The two are so bound together in the regulation of interstate commerce that the effect of both must be reasonable and without undue discrimination. The Interstate Commerce Commission, therefore, had full authority to issue this order for the adoption of the Western Classification \n\n[267 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n for intrastate points between Houston and Cisco, both in Texas. The conflict between the revised statutes of Texas and the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission can only be settled by recognition of the supremacy of the federal authority. It is plain from the agreed statements of facts that the only recovery which could be had under the Western Classification in this case was less than $60. The limitation of liability was in accordance with the second Cummins Amendment, was properly agreed to, and was binding upon the shipper as well as the carrier.\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAW v.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  514a, 514k et seq.). The United States filed an answer denying liability and moved for trial without a jury. The motion was granted. At the close of plaintiff's evidence the defendant moved for judgment. The motion was denied. No special findings of fact were made. Judgment for $3,335 was entered for the plaintiff upon a general finding. 290 F. 972. Upon writ of error sued out by the government the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and directed the District Court to enter judgment for the defendant. 299 F. 61. The case is here on the plaintiff's writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1218).\n The action was brought by the insured. The contract provided for payment in installments in case of total and permanent disability. Whether the plaintiff was so disabled was the main issue. The evidence introduced by him occupies forty pages of the printed record. It disclosed, among other things, that, at the time of enlistment, plaintiff was a common laborer with but several months of recent high school education; that he was seriously wounded overseas; that, after discharge, he resumed his studies; that later, in the rehabilitation process, he entered upon the study of law; and that he acted as his own counsel in the trial of the case. The government's motion for judgment was made on the ground, among \n\n[266 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n others, that plaintiff had failed to prove that he ever had been, or then was, totally disabled, within the meaning of the contract of insurance.\n The Court of Appeals held that the motion should have been granted. Its judgment must be reversed and that of the District Court must stand, because the case was tried without a jury and there was only the general finding for the plaintiff. Neither the evidence, nor the questions of law presented by it, were reviewable by the Court of Appeals. To inquire into the facts and the conclusions of law on which the judgment of the lower court rests was not permissible. Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125; Insurance Co. v.

The petition confessedly set forth a good cause of action. The District Court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter. Its decision is final.\n The jurisdiction possessed was that to be exercised in accordance with the laws governing the usual procedure of the court in actions at law for money compensation. Crouch v.

Of this error the Government cannot complain. Nor can it complain of the denial by the trial court of the motion for special findings. It did not except thereto. Whether special findings can ever avail where there was no stipulation in writing waiving the jury, we need not consider. Compare Kearney v. Case, 12 Wall. 275; Campbell v.

FIDELITY TRUST CO(1925)\nNo. 184\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. H. Gordon McCouch, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Fidelity Trust Company to recover $450 and interest paid by it under protest for internal revenue stamps which the Collector, Lederer, required it to attach to railroad equipment certificates drawn in a form set forth. The parties agree that the only question is whether these certificates are subject to a stamp tax under the Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, tit. 11,  1100, and Schedule A (1), 40 Stat. 1057, 1133, 1135 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6318i-6318p, 6371 1\/4a). The section imposes a tax according to the schedule and the material part of the schedule is a follows:\n'1. Bonds of indebtedness: On all bonds, debentures, or certificates of indebtedness issued by any person, and all instruments, however termed, issued by any corporation with interest coupons or in registered form, known generally as corporate securities, on each $ 100 of face value or fraction thereof, 5 cents.'\n\n The question more narrowly stated is whether the certificates are instruments issued, etc., known generally as corporate securities. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of the District Court held that they were not within the schedule, that 'no indebtedness is involved or obligation incurred by the trustee to the holder, but it is simply a certificate of the holder's right to proportionate participation in a rental when paid.' Fidelity Trust Co. v. Lederer, 289 F. 1009, 1012. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n Using a familiar device the Fidelity Trust Company agreed to furnish and let to the Interstate Railroad Company \n\n[267 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n 500 specified cars and the lessee agreed to pay $90,000, being one-tenth of the cost of the cars, annually at certain dates, and three per cent. half yearly on the part then unpaid. When the whole amount should be paid the trustee agreed to sell the cars to the Railroad Company for one dollar. As part of the same transaction by an instrument reciting that subscriptions had been secured through certain bankers to a fund, to be known as Interstate Railroad Equipment Trust, Series 'C,' for the payment of the price of the railroad equipment described in the lease, and that the trustee proposed 'to secure to the parties subscribing' to the fund the payment thereof in ten annual installments with interest at six per cent., the trustee covenanted with the railroad on receipt of the money subscribed to issue to the bankers the certificates in question here. The essential features are that the bearer or registered holder is entitled to one share of $1,000 in Interstate Railroad Equipment Trust, Series 'C,' in accordance with the above agreement, referred to; that the principal shall be payable at the dates of the payments by the railroad, one-tenth of the certificates, identified by number, each year, and in the meantime dividends will be payable as evidenced by dividend warrants attached, principal and interest payable in gold, etc., 'but only from and out of the deferred rentals as provided in' the lease referred to.\n The petitioner asks us to look through the form of the arrangement and give it a somewhat different meaning. The respondent on the other hand says in the language of United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 'whatever upon its face (the instrument) purports to be, that it is for the purpose of ascertaining the stamp duty.' We are content to adopt the respondent's rule for this case, as upon any rule the result seems to us clear.\n As a matter of common speech, to which the statute refers, we have no doubt that these instruments would be \n\n[267 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n known as corporate securities. They would be called so more accurately than some other documents which we believe also would be known generally by that name. Their purpose, as stated in the agreement of the trustee with the railroad, is to secure payment to the holder with interest. They do nothing else. We do not regard the precise limits of the Trust Company's undertaking as important. If it were only to collect and pay money received by the Company under the secured contract of the Railroad it would be a security for money payment. But the counsel for the Company seemed not prepared to argue that the Company could not put the money received from the Railroad into its general account without a breach of trust, and give the certificate holder cash or a check for his interest or principal. But be the undertaking greater or less, the security better or worse, we cannot regard these certificates as anything but corporate securities by general understanding and in fact.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE v. LEHIGH VALLEY COAL CO.(1925)\nNo. 222\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. M. Hitchings and Frank Wolcott, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Charles W. Pierson, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought against the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, lessee of a coal mine, by John Alden Lee who owns one-half of the mine in his own right and as trustee for his brother. Kate P. Dixon owns the other half. The bill seeks a construction of the lease and of an agreement made on behalf of the plaintiff's interest on January 21, 1913; a declaration that certain parts of the agreement are a fraud upon the plaintiff and Kate P. Dixon; an account to the plaintiff and Kate P. Dixon from the Coal Company, and that the lease may be declared to be and to have been since January 21, 1913, in \n\n[267 U.S. 542, 543]\n\u00a0\n full force and effect. The Coal Company is a corporation of Pennsylvania, the plaintiff Lee a citizen and resident of New York, and Kate P. Dixon is a citizen and resident of Pennsylvania. She is made a defendant, the bill alleges, because of her refusal to be made a plaintiff 'and because to make her such party plaintiff would oust the Court of jurisdiction.' The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction by the District Court, we presume on the ground that so far as appeared the arrangement of the parties was merely a contrivance for the purpose of founding a jurisdiction that otherwise would not exist. Dawson v. Columbia Avenue Saving Fund, Safe Deposit, Title & Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 181\n, 25 S. Ct. 420.\n The plaintiff and appellant now argues that Kate P. Dixon is not a necessary party. When a defendant seeks to remove a suit from a State Court to the District Court, of course he is entitled to contend that a party joined by the plaintiff is not a necessary party and therefore does not make the removal impossible by defeating the jurisdiction.

It is a different question whether the plaintiff can repudiate the effect of his own joinder, can retain a party to the relief sought and yet keep him on the wrong side in order to avoid the effect of his own act. Without inquiring whether the plaintiff could have maintained the suit alone had he so elected and had he found it impossible to join Kate P. Dixon, obviously she was a 'necessary' even if not an indispensable party. Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 139. It would be hard upon the Coal Company to compel it to submit to an adjudication upon the lease, upon a fraud alleged to have been committed against both owners, and to an account, in the absence of one of the lessors. The joinder of both is much more than a mere form. As both are named they must be arranged upon the side on which they belong. Menefee v. Frost (C. C.) 123 F. 633. Blacklock v.

DIST.(1925)\nNo. 336\nArgued: April 21, 1925Decided: June 8, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Prewitt Semmes and Charles M. Bryan, both of Memphis, Tenn., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. J. T. Coston, Osceola, Ark., for defendant in error. \n\n[268 U.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Osceola & Little River Road Improvement District brought this suit in a Chancery Court of Arkansas against Lee and the other plaintiffs in error to collect an assessment of taxes that had been made against them for the benefit accruing to their lands by the improvements. The Chancellor found the issues in favor of the District, and decreed that the statutory lien for the assessments be foreclosed and the lands sold to pay the same. This decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 162 Ark. 4, 257 S. W. 370. The case is properly here on writ of error; and a pending petition for certiorari is accordingly denied.\n The sole question presented is whether the Arkansas statute under which the taxes in question were assessed, as construed and applied in this case, deprives the land owners of their property without due process of law in violation of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n When the District was originally organized, the lands involved in this suit, which are known as 'lake lands, or sunk lands' were included in it. The benefits accruing from the improvements were then assessed against all the land owners, including various persons who were supposed to be the riparian owners of the lake lands. It was subsequently ascertained, before the completion of the improvements, that the United States was the owner of these lake lands. It was recognized, however, that it was not liable to assessment, and no attempt was made to collect from it any part of the assessed benefits. After the improvements had been completed, the United States conveyed these lake lands, under the Homestead Act (12 Stat. 392), to the present owners. Thereafter, the Board of Commissioners of the District caused a reassessment to be made of the benefits accruing to all the lands within the District, including the lake lands which had formerly belonged to the \n\n[268 U.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n United States. This reassessment was made under a section of the Arkansas statute which provided that: 'The board of commissioners may not oftener than once a year order a reassessment of the benefits, which shall be made, advertised, revised and confirmed as in the case of the original assessment and with like effect.' Crawford & Moses' Digest of Arkansas Statutes,  5430. It is the reassessment of benefits thus made which the District by this suit has sought to collect.\n It was settled many years ago that the property of the United States is exempt by the Constitution from taxation under the authority of a State so long as title remains in the United States. Van Brocklin v. State of Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151, 180\n, 6 S. Ct. 670. This is conceded. It is urged, however, that this rule has no application after the title has passed from the United States, and that it may then be taxed for any legitimate purposes. While this is true in reference to general taxes assessed after the United States has parted with its title, we think it clear that it is not the case where the tax is sought to be imposed for benefits accruing to the property from improvements made while it was still owned by the United States. In the Van Brocklin Case, supra, p. 168, it was said that the United States has the exclusive right to control and dispose of its public lands, and that 'no State can interfere with this right, or embarrass its exercise.' Obviously, however, the United States will be hindered in the disposal of lands upon which local improvements have been made, if taxes may thereafter be assessed against the purchasers for the benefits resulting from such improvements. Such a liability for the future assessments of taxes would create a serious incumbrance upon the lands, and its subsequent enforcement would accomplish indirectly the collection of a tax against the United States which could not be directly imposed. In Nevada National Bank v. Poso Irr. Dist., 140 Cal. 344, 347, 73 P. 1056, 1058, in which it was held that the State could not \n\n[268 U.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n include lands of the United States in an irrigation district so as to impose an assessment for benefits which would become a liability upon a subsequent purchaser, it was said that 'if the grantee of the United States must take the land burdened with the liability of an irrigation district made to include it without the assent of the government or the purchaser, it attaches a condition to the disposal of the property of the government without its sanction or consent, ... which must, in such cases, interfere with its disposal.'\n There is nothing leading to a contrary conclusion in Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 \nU.S. 351\n, 25 S. Ct. 44, and Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207\n, 36 S. Ct. 66, which involved merely questions as to the assessment of benefits for local improvements after they had been completed, upon lands which at no time had been the property of the United States.\n We find that the provision of the Arkansas statute under which the reassessment of benefits was made, as construed and applied in the present case, was beyond the constitutional authority of the State; and there being no power to impose such a tax, its exaction is a taking of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

England, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 238, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the executors of Henry C. Frick to recover the amount of taxes collected by duress under the supposed authority of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, on the ground that the Act is unconstitutional so far as it purports to tax the matters here concerned. The District Court gave judgment \n\n[268 U.S. 238, 250]\n\u00a0\n for the plaintiffs for the whole sum demanded. 298 F. 803. The case was tried without a jury and the Court adopted as its findings among others the following facts which were agreed: Henry C. Frick died on December 2, 1919, and his will was admitted to probate on December 6. There were outstanding policies upon his life, four payable to his wife and seven to his daughter. The total amount received under them was $474,629.52, and as his estate apart from this was more than ten million dollars, an additional tax of $108,657.88, or twenty-five per cent. of the sum received less the statutory deduction of $40,000, was required to be paid. All the policies were taken out before the Revenue Act was passed. The largest one, for $114,000, was a paid-up policy issued in 1901, payable to Mrs. Frick without power in Mr. Frick to change the beneficiary. Another, similar so far as material, was for $50,000. Others were assigned or the beneficiary named (Frick's estate) was changed to Frick's wife or daughter before the date of the statute. All premiums were paid by Mr. Frick, and some seem to have been paid after the statute went into force.\n The tax imposed by the Act is a tax 'upon the transfer of the net estate' of the decedent. Section 401; 40 Stat. 1096 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/4 b). 'For the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined' by deducting certain allowances from the gross estate. Section 403 (section 6336 3\/4 d). By section 402 (section 6336 3\/4 c):\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property. ... ( f) To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.'\n\n These last words are the ground of the Collector's claim. \n\n[268 U.S. 238, 251]\n\u00a0\n By section 408; 40 Stat. 1100 (section 6336 3\/1i):\n'If any part of the gross estate consists of proceeds of policies of insurance upon the life of the decedent receivable by a beneficiary other than the executor, the executor shall be entitled to recover from such beneficiary such portion of the total tax paid as the proceeds, in excess of $40,000, of such policies bear to the net estate.'\n\n By section 409 (section 6336 3\/4 j), a personal liability is imposed upon the beneficiaries if the tax is not paid when due. The defendants in error say that if these policies are covered by the statute these sections show that the beneficiaries are taxed upon their own property, under the guise of a tax upon the transfer of his estate by Mr. Frick, and that this is taking their property without due process of law; citing Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 63 N. E. 789, 57 L. R. A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791, and other cases. In view of their liability the objection cannot be escaped by calling the reference to their receipts a mere measure of the transfer tax. The interest of the beneficiaries is established by statutes of the states controlling the insurance and is not disputed. It also is strongly urged that the tax would be a direct tax. In view of our conclusion it is not necessary to state the position of the defendants in error more in detail.\n We do not propose to discuss the limits of the powers of Congress in cases like the present. It is enough to point out that at least there would be a very serious question to be answered before Mrs. Frick and Miss Frick could be made to pay a tax on the transfer of his estate by Mr. Frick. There would be another if the provisions for the liability of beneficiaries were held to be separable and it was proposed to make the estate pay a transfer tax for property that Mr. Frick did not transfer. Acts of Congress are to be construed if possible in such a way as to avoid grave doubts of this kind. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S. Ct. 391. Not only are such doubts avoided by construing the statute as referring only \n\n[268 U.S. 238, 252]\n\u00a0\n to transactions taking place after it was passed, but the general principle 'that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage' is preserved, when to disregard it would be to impose an unexpected liability that if known might have induced those concerned to avoid it and to use their money in other ways. Schwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454. This case and the following ones, Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 537\n, 42 S. Ct. 393, Levy v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 542\n, 42 S. Ct. 395, and Knox v. McElligott, \n258 \nU.S. 546\n, 42 S. Ct. 396, go far toward deciding the one how before us. They also indicate that the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,  302(h); 43 Stat. 253, 305, making (g) (the equivalent of (f) above) apply to past transactions, does not help but if anything hinders the Collector's construction of the present law.

Ritter, both of Birmingham, Ala., for petitioner.\n Mr. William H. Sadler, Jr., of Birmingham, Ala., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Lewis, recovered a judgment against the Montevallo Mining Company for personal injuries caused by its negligence. The Company was thereafter adjudicated a bankrupt in the Northern District of Alabama. Lewis filed in the bankruptcy proceeding a proof of claim upon the judgment. The District Court confirmed an order of the referee disallowing this claim, upon the ground that a judgment founded upon a tort was not provable in bankruptcy. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 294 F. 171. The writ of certiorari was then granted. \n264 \nU.S. 578\n, 44 S. Ct. 335.\n This decision is in conflict with an unbroken line of decisions in other Circuit Courts of Appeals and in the District Courts. In re New York Tunnel Co. (C. C. A.) 159 F. 688, 690, 86 C. C. A. 556; Moore v. Douglas, ( C. C. A.) 230 F. 399, 401, 144 C. C. A. 541; In re Putnam (D C.) 193 F. 464, 468. And see In re Lorde (D. C) 144 F. 320; Ex parte Margiasso (D C.) 242 F. 990; In re Madigan (D. C.) 254 F. 221.\n We think these prior decisions were correct.\n Section 63a of the Bankruptcy Act,1 entitled 'Debts Which May be Proved,' provides that:\n'Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidence by a judgment \n\n[267 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n ... absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition. ... '\n\n Section 1(11), being Comp. St.  9585 declares that the word 'debt' as used in the Act shall, unless inconsistent with the context, be construed to include 'any debt, demand, or claim provable in bankruptcy.'\n It is clear that a judgment for tort is provable under the express provisions of section 63a(1). The language is broad and unqualified. It includes a 'fixed liability' evidenced by a judgment ex delicto as well as by a judgment ex contractu, and makes the one as well as the other a provable 'debt' There is nothing in the language or in the context which suggests its limitation to judgments founded on debts or warrants the reading in of such a limitation.\n This conclusion is confirmed by a consideration of other provisions of the Act. By section 17 (30 Stat. 550) as originally enacted, it was provided that:\n'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as ... (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another.'2\n\n This express exception of certain judgments for torts from the 'provable debts' released by a discharge, plainly indicates that Congress understood that under section 63a judgments for torts were 'provable debts,' and is strongly persuasive as a construction of that section.\n Furthermore, if a judgment for tort is not a provable claim in bankruptcy under section 63a, it could not, under section 1(11), be considered in determining whether one against whom an involuntary petition has been filed, is insolvent within the meaning of section 1(15) providing that: \n\n[267 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n 'A person shall be deemed insolvent ... whenever the aggregate of his property ... shall not ... be sufficient in amount to pay his debts.'\n The result of this would be that a person having property in excess of his other debts could not be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt under section 3b of the Act (Comp. St.  9587) although owing judgments for tort exceeding the amount of his property. Clearly Congress did not intend so anomalous a result.\n The trustee contends, however, that despite the broad language of section 63a(1), the decision in Wetmore v. Markoe, \n196 \nU.S. 68\n, 25 S. Ct. 172, 2 Ann. Cas. 265, necessarily leads to the conclusion that only judgments founded in debt are provable claims. It was there held that under section 17 of the Act the arrears of alimony previously awarded to the wife of the bankrupt for the support of herself and their minor children under a final decree of absolute divorce was not a provable debt which was released by the bankrupt's discharge. The ground of the decision was that the court could look into the proceedings to determine the nature of the liability which had been reduced to judgment; that a decree awarding alimony was not in any just sense a debt which had been put into the form of a judgment, but rather the legal means of enforcing the obligation of the husband to support his wife and children which was imposed upon him by the policy of the law; and that it could not be presumed, in the absence of a direct enactment, that Congress intended that the Bankruptcy Act should be made an instrument by which the wife and children should be deprived of the support which it was the purpose of the law to enforce. It is clear that this decision rested on the peculiar and exceptional nature of a decree for alimony. There was no suggestion in the opinion that an ordinary claim ex delicto that had been previously reduced to judgment was not a provable debt; and we think that its reasoning neither leads to nor warrants such a conclusion. \n\n[267 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n Nor is there anything to support this conclusion in Schall v. Camors, \n251 \nU.S. 239\n, 40 S. Ct. 135, which dealt solely with unliquidated claims arising in tort, not previously reduced to judgment, and held merely that such unliquidated claims, not being included in the enumeration of provable debts under section 63a, could not be liquidated and proven under the provisions of section 63b.\n The decrees of the District Court and of the Circuit Court of Appeal are reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544 (Comp.

Shortly given the alleged facts follow. Petitioner, a duly licensed and registered physician, without an official written order therefor, knowingly, \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 16]\n\u00a0\n willfully and unlawfully did sell, barter and give to Ida Casey one tablet of morphine and three tablets of cocaine; he knew she was addicted to habitual use of these drugs and did not require administration of either because of any disease other than such addiction, and he did not dispense them for the treatment of any other disease or condition; they were not administered by him or by any nurse or other person acting under his direction, nor were they consumed or intended for consumption in his presence; the amount was more than sufficient to satisfy the recipient's cravings if wholly consumed at one time; petitioner put the drugs into her possession expecting that she would administer them to herself in divided doses over a period of time; they were in the form in which addicts usually consume them to satisfy their cravings; the recipient was in no way prevented or restrained from disposing of them.\n Petitioner maintains that the facts stated are not sufficient to constitute an offense. The United States submit that, considering United States v. Behrman, \n258 \nU.S. 280\n, 42 S. Ct. 303, the sufficiency of the indictment is clear.\n The trial court charged:\n'If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that this woman was addicted to the use of narcotics, and if he dispensed these drugs to her for the purpose of catering to her appetite or satisfying her cravings for the drug, he is guilty under the law. If, on the other hand, you believe from the testimony that the defendant believed in good faith this woman was suffering from cancer or ulcer of the stomach, and administered the drug for the purpose of relieving her pain, or if you entertain a reasonable doubt upon that question, you must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.'\n\n In effect, the indictment alleges that the accused, a duly registered physician, violated the statute by giving \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 17]\n\u00a0\n to a known addict four tablets containing morphine and cocaine with the expectation that she would administer them to herself in divided doses, while unrestrained and beyond his presence or control, for the sole purpose of relieving conditions incident to addiction and keeping herself comfortable. It does not question the doctor's good faith nor the wisdom or propriety of his action according to medical standards. It does not allege that he dispensed the drugs otherwise than to a patient in the course of his professional practice or for other than medical purposes. The facts disclosed indicate no conscious design to violate the law, no cause to suspect that the recipient intended to sell or otherwise dispose of the drugs, and no real probability that she would not consume them.\n The declared object of the Narcotic Law is to provide revenue, and this court has held that whatever additional moral end it may have in view must 'be reached only through a revenue measure and within the limits of a revenue measure.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 402\n, 36 S. Ct. 658, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854. Congress cannot, under the pretext of executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the federal government. And we accept as established doctrine that any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably adapted to the effective exercise of such power, but solely to the achievement of something plainly within power reserved to the states, is invalid and cannot be enforced. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat, 316 423; License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462; United States v. De Witt, 9 Wall. 41; Keller v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 138\n, 29 S. Ct. 470, 16 Ann. Cas. 1066; Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724; Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449. In the light of these principles, and not forgetting the familiar rule that 'a statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid, not only the conclusion that it is \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 18]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score,' the provisions of this statute must be interpreted and applied.\n Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a revenue measure. The enactment under consideration levies a tax, upheld by this court, upon every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals in, dispenses or gives away opium or coca leaves or derivatives therefrom, and may regulate medical practice in the states only so far as reasonably appropriate for or merely incidental to its enforcement. It says nothing of 'addicts' and does not undertake to prescribe methods for their medical treatment. They are diseased and proper subjects for such treatment, and we cannot possibly conclude that a physician acted improperly or unwisely or for other than medical purposes solely because he has dispensed to one of them in the ordinary course and in good faith, four small tablets of morphine or cocaine for relief of conditions incident to addiction. What constitutes bona fide medical practice must be determined upon consideration of evidence and attending circumstances. Mere pretense of such practice, of course, cannot legalize forbidden sales, or otherwise nullify valid provisions of the statute, or defeat such regulations as may be fairly appropriate to its enforcement within the proper limitations of a revenue measure.\n United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra, points out that the Narcotic Law can be upheld only as a revenue measure. It must be interpreted and applied accordingly. Further, grave constitutional doubts concerning section 8 cannot be avoided unless limited to persons who are required to register by section 1. Mere possession of the drug creates no presumption of guilt as against any other person. \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 19]\n\u00a0\n In United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 95 S., 39 S. Ct. 214, a registered physician was accused of unlawfully selling, giving away and distributing 500 one-sixth grain tablets of heroin without official written order. Another count charged selling, dispensing and distributing 500 such tablets not in the course of regular professional practice. The trial court held section 2 invalid because it invaded the police power of the state. This court declared:\n'Of course Congress may not in the exercise of federal power exert authority wholly reserved to the states. ... If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it. ... We cannot agree with the contention that the provisions of section 2, controlling the disposition of these drugs in the ways described, can have nothing to do with facilitating the collection of the revenue, as we should be obliged to do if we were to declare this act beyond the power of Congress acting under its constitutional authority to impose excise taxes.'\n\n The sharp division of the court in this cause and the opinion in Jin Fuey Moy's Case clearly indicated that the statute must be strictly construed and not extended beyond the proper limits of a revenue measure.\n Webb v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 96, 99\n, 39 S. Ct. 217, came here on certified questions. Two were answered upon authority of Doremus' Case. The third inquired whether a regular physician's order for morphine issued to an addict, not in the course or professional treatment with design to cure the habit, but in order to provide enough of the drug to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is a 'physicians prescription.' The answer was that 'to call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's prescription would be so plain a pervision of meaning that no discussion of the subject is required.' The lower \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 20]\n\u00a0\n court had sought instruction in order that it might decide the particular cause. The question specified no definite quantity of drugs, nor the time intended for their use. The narrated facts show, plainly enough, that physician and druggist conspired to sell large quantities of morphine to addicts under the guise of issuing and filling orders. The so-called prescriptions were issued without consideration of individual cases and for the quantities of the drugs which applicants desired for the continuation of customary use. The answer thus given must not be construed as forbidding every prescription for drugs, irrespective of quantity, when designed temporarily to alleviate an addict's pains, although it may have been issued in good faith and without design to defeat the revenues. This limitation of the reply is confirmed by Behrman's Case, \n258 \nU.S. 280\n, 42 S. Ct. 303, infra, decided three years later, which suggests at least that the accused doctor might have lawfully dispensed some doses.\n In Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 41 S. Ct. 98, doctor and druggist conspired to sell opiates. The prescriptions were not issued in the course of professional practice. The doctor became party to prohibited sales.\n'Manifestly the phrases 'to a patient' and 'in the course of his professional practice only' are intended to confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A 'prescription' issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it.'\n\n The quoted language must be confined to circumstances like those presented by the cause. In reality, the doctor became party to sales of drugs. He received a \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 21]\n\u00a0\n fixed sum per dram under guise of issuing prescriptions. The quoted words are repeated in Behrman's Case, which recognizes the possible propriety of prescribing small quantities.\n United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 254 S., 42 S. Ct. 301, holds:\n'It is very evident from a reading of it [section 2] that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the taxing officers of the government and that it merely uses a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic.'\n\n United States v. Behrman, \n258 \nU.S. 280, 287\n, 42 S. Ct. 303, came up under the Criminal Appeals Act (Comp. St.  1704). The indictment charged that Behrman, a registered physician, did unlawfully sell, barter, and give to one King, an 'addict,' 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine, by issuing three prescriptions. Further, that the drugs were not intended or required for treatment of any disease or condition other than such addiction, but for self-administration over a period of several days. The question was:\n'Do the acts charged in this indictment constitute an offense within the meaning of the statute?'\n\n And, replying, this court said:\n'The District Judge who heard this case was of the opinion that prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such quantity to addicts as charged in the indictment. ... In our opinion the District Judge who heard the case was right in his conclusion and should have overruled the demurrer. Former decisions of this court have held that the purpose of the exception is to confine the distribution of these drugs to the regular and lawful course of professional practice, and that not everything called a prescription is necessarily such. [Webb v. \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 22]\n\u00a0\n United States and Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, supra, are cited.] It may be admitted that to prescribe a single dose, or even a number of doses, may not bring a physician within the penalties of the act; but what is here charged is that the defendant physician by means of prescriptions has enabled one, known by him to be an addict, to obtain from a pharmacist the enormous number of doses contained in 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine'-3,000 ordinary doses!\n\n This opinion related to definitely alleged facts and must be so understood. The enormous quantity of drugs ordered, considered in connection with the recipient's character, without explanation, seemed enough to show prohibited sales and to exclude the idea of bona fide professional action in the ordinary course. The opinion cannot be accepted as authority for holding that a physician, who acts bona fide and according to fair medical standards, may never give an addict moderate amounts of drugs for self-administration in order to relieve conditions incident to addiction. Enforcement of the tax demands no such drastic rule, and if the act had such scope it would certainly encounter grave constitutional difficulties.\n The Narcotic Law is essentially a revenue measure and its provisions must be reasonably applied with the primary view of enforcing the special tax. We find no facts alleged in the indictment sufficient to show that petitioner had done anything falling within definite inhibitions or sufficient materially to imperil orderly collection of revenue from sales. Federal power is delegated, and its prescribed limits must not be transcended even though the end seems desirable. The unfortunate condition of the recipient certainly created no reasonable probability that she would sell or otherwise dispose of the few tablets intrusted to her; and we cannot say that by so dispensing \n\n[268 U.S. 5, 23]\n\u00a0\n them the doctor necessarily transcended the limits of that professional conduct with which Congress never intended to interfere.\n The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIPSHITZ & COHEN v. U.S.(1925)\nNo. 68\nArgued: October 21, 1925Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry A. Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[269 U.S. 90, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error seek to recover profits which, it is alleged, would have been realized if the United States had complied with their agreement to deliver approximately 1,530,600 pounds of obsolete material. The cause was heard by the District Judge without a jury. He found the facts and upon them held that the contract had not been broken.\n An agent of the United States put out a schedule which stated that certain obsolete material, classed as cast iron, cast and forged steel, armor steel, brass, bronz and lead, was held for sale at six specified forts. It set out the weights of each class at each place, and was headed:\n'List of Junk for Sale and Location of Same. The weights as shown below are approximate and must be accepted as correct by the bidder.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error made a written offer at the foot of the schedule sheet to pay $1,055, 'for all the above described material, as is where is, for which we are enclosing you cashier's check for 20% of the amount-$211- with our option to remove material within six months from acceptance of this bid. ...' This was accepted May 24, 1922. 'At the time the offer was made and accepted the plaintiff did not inspect the material for sale at any of the fortifications, and had no knowledge of such material other than that given by the contract. It was later found in junk piles at the various forts.'\n In the following July the purchasers began to remove the material and found nearly all items short. Aggregated these shortages amounted to approximately one-half of the total weight stated in the original schedule, but there is nothing to indicate bad faith. They complained, but made no effort to repudiate or annul the contract.\n Supporting his judgment in favor of the United States the District Judge said:\n'Since the government is not in \n\n[269 U.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n the business of buying and selling, and its agents are authorized only to offer for sale such material as has been condemned as obsolete or useless, taking the language of this offer and acceptance, I am of opinion that the contract must be construed as one offering to sell an approximate quantity of such cast iron, brass (cast and forged steel, bronz, armor steel) or lead, and as one offering to sell all of the materials of these descriptions which were on hand at the various points named, the intention being not to make a sale by the pound or ton, but to make an entire sale of specific lots of obsolete material, whether more or less than the weight, and to include all thereof. ... I am satisfied that they (plaintiffs) cannot claim that this contract, worded as it was, has been broken because it turned out that there was less, even greatly less, of some of the materials described as on hand than the description would have led the purchaser to suppose. It is not made to appear that the United States failed or refused to deliver any of the material that was actually at the forts named at the time the contract was made.'\n\n We approve this construction of the agreement. Applicable principles of law were announced by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court in Brawley v. United States, \n96 U.S. 168\n, 171. The negotiations had reference to specific lots. The naming of quantities cannot be regarded as in the nature of a warranty, but merely as an estimate of the probable amounts in reference to which good faith only could be required of the party making it.\n It is not necessary for us to consider whether the contract is sufficiently formal to comply with the requirements of R. S.  3744 (Comp. St.  6895).\n The judgment of the court below must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R. CO. v. U S(1925)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount by which tariff rate freight charges on certain coal were reduced by government land grant deductions; and also to recover certain charges for switching and handling. The court made findings of fact, and gave judgment for defendant. 57 Ct. Cl. 268. One of the lines of appellant's railroad enters Alabama from the north and extends southerly, through Decatur, Birmingham, and Flomaton, to Pensacola, Fla., and thence easterly to River Junction, Fla. This is a land-aided \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n line. Appellant has another line extending southwesterly from Flomaton to Mobile. At Mobile and Pensacola, it owns wharves and hoists for transferring coal from cars to boats, and has constructed switches from its main line to the wharves. All of these were built without government aid. The wharves and hoists at Mobile are operated by a coal company and those at Pensacola by appellant.\n All the coal in question came from mines in the Birmingham district and was purchased by the United States for engineering work at Mobile, Pensacola, and other places on or near the Gulf, except 250 tons bought for the use of the United States steamship Tonopah. It was transported on government bills of lading and was carried in whole or in part by the use of such land-aided railroad. The coal was furnished to the United States under a contract with the Gulf States Coal Company of March 15, 1915, a contract with the Imperial Coal & Coke Company of August 21, 1916, advertisements, specifications, bids, and acceptances without formal contracts, between November 2, 1914, and September 10, 1917, and a bid and acceptance as of April 8, 1915, for the Tonopah.\n The Court of Claims held that all shipments, except those made under the contract of March 15, 1915, were subject to land grant deductions. Appellant maintains that none was subject to the reduced rates. We are of opinion that all the coal, except that furnished the Tonopah, was delivered to and became the property of the United States before it was hauled by appellant, and was entitled to the reduced rates.\n The general rule is that, if a consignee accepts a shipment, he becomes liable as a matter of law for the full amount of freight charges. Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. Central Iron Co., \n265 \nU.S. 59, 70\n, 44 S. Ct. 441; Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 \nU.S. 577, 580\n, 40 S. Ct. 27. Under the Land Grant Acts, the United States was entitled to the reduced \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n rates if the coal when hauled was its property. Acts of May 17, 1856, June 3, 1856, and March 3, 1857, 11 Stat. 15, 17, 200; Acts of April 10, 1869, and March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 45, 580; Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 509; Illinois Central R. R. v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 209\n, 44 S. Ct. 485. But the mere use of government forms of bills of lading is not conclusive on the question of ownership of property at the time of transportation, and does not give the United States the right of transportation at land grant rates. See Transportation Involved in Furnishing Articles by Contractor, 20 Comp. Dec. 721, 723.\n The contract of March 15, 1915, was made pursuant to advertisement and specifications. The specifications, which were attached to and made a part of the contract, show that, in order to permit the United States to take advantage of land grant rates, the form of proposal contemplated either 'delivery of the whole quantity at the mine, from which shipment will then be made on government bill of lading to Mobile, Pascagoula, or Gulfport, as may be necessary, or delivery of about 7,000 tons at Mobile, Ala., about 5,000 tons at Pascagoula, Miss., and about 6,000 tons at Gulfport, Miss.' And it was specified:\n'The United States will select the method of delivery which under the proposals received proves to be most economical and advantageous. If mine delivery is selected, the coal will be ordered in carload lots for shipment on government bills of lading to be furnished by the contracting officer, but the contractor will be required to transfer it from cars to barges belonging to the United States and will therefore include in his price his cost for so transferring the coal at all three points of delivery. ... If prices based on delivery at Mobile, Pascagoula, and Gulfport prove to be more advantageous, then these prices will be accepted and order will be given for carload lots or less as may be required on board United States barges or in bunkers' at the three places \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n named.\n\n The contract contains the following:\n'In conformity with the advertisement and specifications hereunto attached, which form a part of this contract, the said contractor shall furnish and have delivered on United States barges, or in bunkers, from hoists, in carload lots, at Mobile, Alabama, when requested, eighteen thousand short tons, more or less. ... Coal to be shipped on government bill of lading, to be furnished by the contracting officer, the United States to pay railroad freight charges between Dixiana [where the mines were located] and Mobile, and the contractor to provide for transferring the coal from cars to United States barges and to pay all demurrage charges that may accrue.'\n\n The United States reserved the option to call on the contractor to tow the coal from Mobile to Pascagoula and Gulfport, and agreed to make additional payments for that service, and also reserved the right to inspect and test the coal after transportation and to reject such as did not conform to specifications. The purchase price was to be paid after delivery and final acceptance.\n The language, 'shall furnish and have delivered on United States barges, ...' if it stood alone, might be taken to indicate that delivery was to made after transportation. But when read, as it must be, with the advertisement and specifications, and in the light for what was done, it appears with reasonable certainty that delivery at the mines was contemplated. The specifications distinctly show that if mine delivery should be selected, the coal would be ordered in carload lots and shipped on government bills of lading. In harmony with that provision, the contract required shipment in carload lots on forms of bills of lading furnished by the contracting officer, and bound the United States to pay freight charges from the mine to Mobile. This meant that the contractor was not to be concerned with or responsible for the transportation by rail. But, if delivery \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 400]\n\u00a0\n at Gulf ports had been selected, the contractor would have been bound to hire the carrier and to pay the freight. The provisions of the contract and specifications together amount to a declaration of the parties that there was to be delivery of the whole quantity at the mine, and the conduct of the parties was in harmony with that purpose and inconsistent with an intention that delivery to the United States should be made after transportation by rail was ended. The general rule is that title passes from seller to buyer with the delivery of the goods. All the coal except that furnished the Tonopah was delivered by the seller to the United States at the mines on board railroad cars of appellant, a common carrier designated by the United States by the furnishing of government bills of lading. It must be held that title passed at the time of such deliveries. See United States v. Andrews, \n207 \nU.S. 229, 240\n, 243 S., 28 S. Ct. 100.\n The contract contemplated service by the contractor, as well as the sale of coal. The contractor agreed to have the coal transferred from cars to government barges, his compensation therefor to be included in the price, and agreed for specified prices to tow it to points on the Gulf coast, if requested so to do, and also undertook to furnish and deliver at various places some 9,000,000 gallons of fresh water for steam and drinking purposes. The services were not essential to or part of the sale, and, as against the other facts found the agreements to transfer and tow the coal do not indicate that the parties intended that delivery by the seller to the purchaser should not be made until after transportation. Hatch v. Oil Co., \n100 U.S. 124\n, 137; McElwee v. Metropolitan Lumber Co., 69 F. 302, 305, 16 C. C. A. 232; H. Baars & Co. v. Mitchell, 154 F. 322, 326, 83 C. C. A. 466.\n The United States reserved the right to inspect and test the coal after transportation and to reject it, if found not to conform to specifications. None of the coal was \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 401]\n\u00a0\n rejected. This right was not inconsistent with transfer of title to the United States at the time of delivery of the coal on cars at the mine. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 363, 371\n, 372 S., 34 S. Ct. 65; Illinois Central R. R. v. United States, supra.\n By the contract of August 21, 1916, the seller expressly agreed to deliver the coal on railroad cars at the mines at Dixiana. Deliveries of the coal furnished without formal contracts were covered by specifications which were the same as those forming a part of the contract of March 15, 1915\n\n\n The conclusion that the coal furnished the Tonopah was to be delivered at the mine is not sustained by the facts found. Under the invitation to bid, proposal and acceptance, delivery was to be made alongside the vessel at Pensacola. The coal was transported on government bills of lading. The United States paid the freight less land grant deductions. The use of government bills of lading and the payment of reduced charges by the United States are not sufficient to sustain a finding that the coal was the property of the United States when hauled by appellant. There is nothing to indicate that title passed before delivery at the vessel.\n We agree with the Court of Claims that acceptance of payment of the land grant rates concludes appellant. Its conduct was inconsistent with an intention to claim the amount of land grant deduction, as to any of the coal. Appellant rendered bills as to the coal furnished under the above- mentioned contracts of March 15, 1915, and August 21, 1916, upon which it stated the basic rate and the amount to be deducted on account of land grant, and claimed the net remaining after the deduction. There was no evidence tending to show that, in presenting its bills at land grant rates, appellant did not act with full knowledge of all the facts. Settlements for transporting some of the coal were made after the commencement of \n\n[267 U.S. 395, 402]\n\u00a0\n this suit, April 26, 1916, but before the amended and supplemental petition was filed, January 9, 1922. Appellant did not protest against any land grant deductions. It is bound by its acquiescence and consent and cannot recover the amounts deducted. Oregon-Washington R. R. Co. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 329; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 40 S. Ct. 67; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 32\n, 42 S. Ct. 209; Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 374\n, 42 S. Ct. 337.\n The Court of Claims was right in disallowing additional pay for switching cars to wharves or for transferring coal from cars to boats. The tariff rates on this coal for bunkerage and purposes other than export or coastwise traffic were $1.10 per short ton via Flomaton to Mobile or Pensacola. Under the tariff the cost of transferring such coal from cars to vessels at Mobile and Pensacola was assumed by appellant, where the road haul revenue was $1 per ton or more; but if such revenue was less there was an additional charge of 10 cents per ton, plus $2 per car for switching, subject to a maximum of $1 per ton. After land grant deduction, the balance to be paid in money was less than a dollar per ton. But the land grant, made many years ago, in aid of the railroad enterprise was not a mere gift or gratuity. See Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 679\n, 34 S. Ct. 907. The carrier's obligation to haul property of the United States at reduced rates was a part of the consideration for which the land grant was made. Part of appellant's compensation for hauling the coal was paid in land, and the balance was paid in money. It cannot be said that the total was less than a dollar per ton.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N. R. CO. v.

St.  8584)), was brought against the Louisville & Nashville Railroad in the Federal District Court for Northern Alabama. By it the Sloss-Sheffield Company sought to recover $ 63,982.80, with interest, being the amount of a reparation order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission for excessive freight charges exacted in violation of section 1 of the act (Comp. St.  8563) Sloss- Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 60 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 595; Id., 62 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 646. The charges here in question were paid between April 17, 1910, and September 15, 1915, on shipments of pig iron from the company's furnances in Alabama, over lines of the Louisville & Nashville as initial carrier, to purchasers at Ohio river crossings and points beyond in central freight association territory. 1 The reparation directed was an incident of proceedings commenced April 16, 1912, to secure a reduction of the tariff rates. On June 1, 1914, an order was entered reducing rates for the future 35 cents a ton. Later a finding was made that to this extent the existing tariff rates had exceeded what was reasonable throughout the whole period, commencing two years prior to the filing of the original complaint before the Commission. The order sued on, which was entered July 12, 1921, accompanied \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n what is known as the Seventh Supplemental Report. See Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 30 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 597; Id., 35 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 460; Id., 40 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 738; Id., 46 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 558; Id., 51 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 635; Id., 52 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 576.\n The District Court, which heard the case without a jury, entered judgment in accordance with the Commission's order, except that it disallowed damages for the period between April 16, 1912, and July 22, 1913. Writs of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals were sued out by both the plaintiff and the defendant. That court entered judgment for $103, 367.47, being the full amount awarded by the Commission, with interest, and thus affirmed, as modified, the judgment of the District Court. 295 F. 53. The carrier then sued out a writ of error from this court. It also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the writ of error. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 535\n, 38 S. Ct. 186. As the case is properly here on writ of error, the petition for certiorari is denied. Seventy-seven errors are formally assigned. Only 7 distinct contentions require separate consideration. Some of these relate to matters of procedure; others, to substantive rights. Some assert that complete defenses to the suit were erroneously overruled; others, that the amount of the recovery should have been reduced. Those which deal with matters of procedure will be considered first.\n First. It is claimed that the order of reparation dated July 12, 1921, on which the suit rests, is void, because entered without notice to the Louisville & Nashville or opportunity to be heard thereon, in violation both of the rules of the Commission and of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The essential facts are these: The order sued on differed from an earlier one entered March 8, 1921, accompanying the so-called Sixth Supplemental Report, only in this. It reduced the amount payable from \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n $68,728.80 to $63,982.80. It deferred the final date for payment from June 1, 1921, as prescribed by the earlier order, to September 1, 1921, and it declared in terms that the order of 'March 8, 1921, be and the same is hereby vacated and set aside.' These modifications were made in response to a petition filed by the Sloss-Sheffield Company on June 30, 1921, which recited, among other things, that certain items of excess charges had been inadvertently included in earlier computations, and prayed that the order theretofore entered be modified by making the reduction stated. The Louisville & Nashville had no notice of this application, but it had had notice and opportunity to be heard, and was fully heard on all proceedings leading up to the entry of the Sixth Supplemental Report and accompanying order. Neither of the two reports, and neither of the accompanying orders, recited the items of excess charges of which the sums named therein were the aggregates. The District Court found that, by the order of July 12, 1921, the Commission merely corrected its Sixth Supplemental Report and award, through striking out and deducting a certain part of the amount theretofore awarded; that the substituted order did not award the Sloss- Sheffield Company reparation on any shipment that was not included and allowed for in its order of March 8, 1921; that the award of July 12, 1921, was based entirely upon evidence furnished the Commission prior to entering the March 8 order; and that the company did not, in connection with its petition of June 30, 1921, submit to the Commission any new or additional evidence. The Louisville & Nashville did not, after learning of the entry of the substitute order, take any proceedings before the Commission to have it set aside or corrected; nor was other objection made thereto until it raised the point in this suit.\n The Louisville & Nashville concedes that this claim of invalidity is unfounded if the order of July 12, 1921, did \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n nothing except reduce the amount required to be paid. The contention is that the Commission did more than reduce the amount payable; that the order not only eliminated certain items of excess charges inadvertently included, but added certain items inadvertently omitted; that this fact is established by recitals in the petition of June 30, 1921, by a passage in the Seventh Supplemental Report, and by evidence introduced by the carrier in the District Court; that the evidence to the contrary introduced by the shipper, and on which that court relied, was incompetent, was duly objected to, and should have been excluded; and that the finding made thereon is in direct conflict with matter of record in the Commission.\n The Commission, like a court, may, upon its own motion or upon request, correct any order still under its control without notice to a party who cannot possibly suffer by the modification made. Compare Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. United States (D. C.) 288 F. 88. This power of the Commission is, in adversary proceedings, narrowly circumscribed, and its exercise is not to be encouraged. Whether in this instance these narrow limits were transcended by the Commission we have no occasion to inquire. The original order was sufficient to sustain the findings and the judgments of the District Court, as modified and affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A copy of it was annexed to the petition in the District Court, and was introduced in evidence there. If lack of notice to the Louisville & Nashville rendered the later order void, the original order remained in full force. Compare Chicago M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Hormel & Co ., 240 F. 381, 383, 384, 153 C. C. A. 307. The petition of the Sloss- Sheffield Company of June 30 for a modification may be treated as a remittitur by that company of a part of the amount originally awarded. Pacific Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. O'Connor, \n128 \nU.S. 394\n, 9 S. Ct. 112. The order of July 12 operates as the entry of the remittitur, and appropriate amend- \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 226]\n\u00a0\n ments in the pleadings may be deemed to have been made here. The insistence of the Louisville & Nashville that the order of July 12 should be deemed valid and of full force and effect in so far as it sets aside, vacates, and annuls the prior order of March 8, but void in so far as it cirects a payment to be made, is without support in reason or authority. Thus the alleged errors in ruling on the admissibility of evidence do not appear to have affected the substantial rights of the parties. Act Feb. 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1246).\n Second. It is claimed that the order of reparation sued on is void to the extent that it includes damages on account of shipments made between April 17, 1910, and April 16, 1912, because the cause of action for this period was barred by the special two-year statute of limitations contained in section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act. In the original petition filed April 16, 1912, reparation for this period was specifically prayed for in these words:\n'That the rates and charges herein complained of be found and declared to have been unjust, unreasonable, and discriminatory for a period of at least two years preceding the filing of this complaint, and that the complainants ... may have reparation to the extent of the difference between the rates and charges actually paid by them severally and the rates and charges that may herein be found and declared the just and reasonable maximum rates to be charged in the future.'\n\n This claim rests primarily upon the assertion that the prayer is so general as to be, under sections 13 and 16 of the act (Comp. St.  8581, 8584) and the rules of the Commission, insufficient to invoke its jurisdiction to award reparation. \n2\n The argument is \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 227]\n\u00a0\n that a petition before the Commission for reparation must give, not only the names of the parties complainant and of the carrier against which the claim is asserted, but also a detailed description of the specific claims arising out of the several shipments involved; that this detail is indispensable, because under section 13 the carrier has, after the presentation of the claim to the Commission, a locus poenitentiae in which to determine whether he will satisfy the claim or contest it; and that a later specification of the claim is of no avail, because the filing of such a definite description of the claim with the Commission within the two years is a jurisdictional requirement. It is true that the two-year requirement is jurisdictional. United States ex rel. Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638\n, 38 S. Ct. 408. But no statute or rule imposes upon the Commission procedure so exacting as to make fatal mere failure to present within the period of limitation the detail of a statement which under the procedure prevailing in courts of law may ordinarily be supplied by amendment or a bill of particulars. As was clearly shown by Judge Knapp in Arcadia Mills v. Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Ry. Co. (D. C.) 293 F. 639, the contention of the Louisville & Nashville would involve the adoption of procedure contrary to the long-established practice of the Commission and would defeat the convenient and effective administration of the act. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 217, 228]\n\u00a0\n The Louisville & Nashville also contends that the order, in so far as it awards reparation for the two-year period, is void upon another ground. The main contention is that, if the Commission acquired jurisdiction, it was later lost, because the order of June 1, 1914, denied reparation, and, not having been suspended, became irrevocable at the expiration of one year thereafter, although the main proceeding was then being actively prosecuted, and a petition for rehearing of the application for reparation was later filed. \n4\n The earliest order fixing the amount of the reparation was that entered March 8, 1921. The argument is that, although the rules of the Commission then in force fixed no time for filing petitions for rehearing, a one-year limit must be implied as to the rehearing of orders denying reparation, because section 16 provides that suit on orders granting repparation can be brought only if commenced within one year after entry of the order. This \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 229]\n\u00a0\n argument, which seeks to reverse a settled practice of the Commission as to the time within which petitions for rehearing could then be filed, is not persuasive. The further contention that the delay of the Commission in disposing of the application for rehearing deprived it of jurisdiction is obviously unfounded.\n Third. It is claimed that the order sued on is void to the extent that it includes damages on account of shipments made between April 16, 1912, and July 22, 1913. The contention is that the prayers of the original complaint, filed April 16, 1912, asked for reparation only on account of shipments made within 2 years theretofore; that a prayer for reparation on account of shipments to be made thereafter was first introduced by the supplemental petition filed July 22, 1915; and that therefore the special 2-year statute of limitations barred recovery on account of shipments made during this 15 months' period. We think the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in refusing to limit the prayer in the original petition. The language used does not require a construction which would so narrow its scope. A reading of the prayer as seeking damages for losses suffered in the past through the exaction of existing rates, but not for losses which will result while the proceeding to reduce them is pending, would deny to the words used their natural meaning and impute to the complainant a strange eccentricity of desire. The action of the Commission was in harmony with its own long-settled practice and with the practice of courts in analogous cases. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 217, 230]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. It is claimed that the order of reparation sued on is void to the extent that it includes damages on account of shipments made between April 17, 1910, and July 22, 1913, over lines of the Louisville & Nashville, the initial carrier, to points on the lines of certain connecting carriers operating in central freight association territory. The contention is that the cause of action against the Louisville & Nashville was barred as to such shipments by the special two-year statute of limitations, because these connecting carriers were not made parties to the proceeding before the Commission until the scope of the enquiry was widened by its order of November 3, 1914. This contention rests primarily upon the assertion that the original complaint was not broad enough to justify any relief as to rates over connecting lines and that the claim for reparation arising out of shipment over these was not made until the filing of the supplemental complaint on July 22, 1915. We are of the opinion that in this respect, also, the prayer for reparation in the original complaint (which includes a prayer for general relief) should not be so narrowly construed. The delay in joining these connecting carriers did preclude an award of reparation as against them for the period without the statutory limit, and this was recognized by the Commission in the order entered. But the delay in making these connecting carriers parties to the proceeding before the Commission did not afford a defense to the Louisville & Nashville, because, for reasons about to be stated in dis- \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 231]\n\u00a0\n cussing another objection, the liability for exacting unlawful charges is joint and several. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. (C. C.) 118 F. 613.\n Fifth. It is claimed that the order of reparation is void to the extent that it includes damages payable by the Louisville & Nashville in excess of 23 cents a ton on shipments transported, under joint through rates, over lines of connecting carriers to points beyond the Ohio river crossings. The contention is that the liability of the connecting carriers is not joint and several, that each is liable individually only for the part which it received of the excess unlawfully exacted, and that the Louisville & Nashville must be deemed to have received only 23 cents of the excess because the Commission, when requested by the carriers to decide under section 15 (Comp. St. & 8583) in what proportions the future reduction of 35 cents in the joint through rates already ordered should be borne, decided that the Louisville & Nashville should bear a shrinkage of 23 cents in the existing division and the lines north of the river a shrinkage of the remaining 12 cents. The argument is that the joint through rate, although in fact established by the voluntary act of the carriers, should be deemed to have been compelled by law, since section 1( 4) made it the duty of carriers to establish through routes and section 15( 3) empowered the Commission to enforce that duty; that the joint through rates should be treated as if they were merely a combination of the full individual rates of the several carriers, because the rates in question were in fact construed by combining as factors the existing published proportional rates of the several carriers; that carriers necessarily exercise a fallible judgment as to reasonableness when initiating and in agreeing upon a joint rate; that a later decision by the Commission that the joint rate is excessive does not involve a finding that the carriers acted either arbitrarily or from bad motives in establish- \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 232]\n\u00a0\n ing it; that the excess charge for which a carrier should be made liable is only that which results from its own error in judgment; that the court should assume that no carrier had any control over any factor in the joint rate except the proportion attributable to its own line; and that consequently the Louisville & Nashville should be held to have contributed to the injury of this shipper only to the extent of 23 cents a ton. \n6\n The argument is unsound.\n The cause of action sued on is of statutory origin. It rests primarily upon section 8 (Comp. St.  8572) which declares that if 'any common carrier ... shall do, cause to be done, or permit to be done any act, matter, or thing in this act prohibited or declared to be unlawful ... such common carrier shall be liable ... for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this act. ...' The Commission held early, and has consistently held since, that carriers who by means of a joint through rate make excessive charges are liable jointly and severally for all damages sustained. \n7\n It is true that participation in joint rates does not make connecting carriers partners and that each does not become liable like a partner for every tort of any of the others engaged in the common enterprise. Central R. R. Co. v. United States, \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 233]\n\u00a0\n \n257 \nU.S. 247, 259\n, 42 S. Ct. 80. Each connecting carrier is liable only for its own act. But the establishment of a joint rate by the concurrence of connecting carriers is necessarily the act of each, because the establishment of the rate is done by their joint agreement. The case at bar is not like Insurance Co. v. Railroad Co., \n104 U.S. 146\n, on which the Louisville & Nashville relies.\n The fact that the joint rate had been constructed out of existing proportional rates is not of legal significance. The rates complained of were not merely the aggregate of individual local or proportional rates customarily charged by the respective lines for the transportation included in the through routes. The rates in question were strictly joint through rates. Each through rate was complained of as a unit. Compare Parsons v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 447, 455\n, 456 S., 17 S. Ct. 887. A single charge was made for the transportation from point of origin to point of destination.\n Nor does the fact that the connecting carriers may have been induced to enter into these agreements for joint through rates, because the Interstate Commerce Act had declared this to be the general duty of all carriers, prevent the agreement actually entered into from being the joint \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 234]\n\u00a0\n act of these carriers. Every local or individual rate is likewise established pursuant to a duty. Whether a rate be individual or joint the Commission may enforce performance if the duty to establish it is neglected. The liability in the case at bar arises out of the wrongful exaction from the shipper, not out of the unlawful receipt or unjust enrichment by the carrier. Every carrier who participates in the infliction of this wrong is liable in solido like every other joint tort- feasor. The tariff rate, although unlawful because excessive, was as between shipper and carrier the only legal rate. Neither would have been at liberty to avail itself of more favorable rates for any part of the through carriage. Compare Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Settle, \n260 \nU.S. 166, 171\n, 43 S. Ct. 28. The Louisville & Nashville, the initial carrier, exacted the excessive joint rates on behalf of itself and of all of the connecting carriers who with it were parties to the joint through rates.\n The division of the joint rate among the participating carriers is a matter which in no way concerns the shipper. The shipper's only interest is that the joint rate be reasonable as a whole. It may be unreasonable although each of the factors of which it is constructed was reasonable. It may be reasonable although some of the factors, or of the divisions of the participants, were unreasonable. Moreover, there is no finding that the excess received by the Louisville & Nashville was only 23 cents a ton. The Commission did not fix or determine the rights of the several carriers as against each other in respect to the reparation awarded; nor had it, so far as appears, fixed the divisions of the joint rate theretofore existing. Awarding reparation for excessive charges in the past and regulating rates for the future involve the determination of matters essentially different. Baer Bros. Mercantile Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n233 \nU.S. 479\n, 34 S. Ct. 641\n\n\n Sixth. It is claimed that the Sloss-Sheffield Company cannot recover, because it was not damaged by the ex- \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 235]\n\u00a0\n cessive freight charges. The Commission and the District Court found that the Sloss-Sheffield Company bore the transportation charges and was damaged to the extent of the difference between the charges paid and those that would have accrued at the rates found reasonable. Both tribunals found further that all the iron was sold f. o. b. destination; that it was shipped to purchasers named as consignees on straight bills of lading; that it was invoiced and charged on the seller's books at the full delivered price; that, pursuant to arrangement between seller and purchaser, the consignee physically paid the freight upon acceptance of the delivery; and that he was credited with this at the rate specified in the sales contract as a part payment of the purchase price, and remitted only the balance of the purchase price.\n The objection urged is not that the company failed to make specific proof of pecuniary loss-the failure held in Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 206\n, 33 S. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315, to be fatal in a suit under section 2 (Comp. St.  8564) for unjust discrimination, and in Davis v. Portland Seed Co., \n264 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S. Ct. 380, to be fatal in a suit under section 4 (Comp. St.  8566) for violation of the long and short haul clause. The carrier concedes, as it must under Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531\n, 38 S. Ct. 186, that a recovery for excessive freight charges can be had under section 1 without specific proof of pecuniary loss, and that the measure of damages is the amount of the excess exacted. It was likewise settled by Southern Pacific v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co. (see Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co. v. Southern Pac. Co. (C. C.) 190 F. 659; Id., 221 F. 890, 137 C. C. A. 460), that where goods are sold f. o. b. destination, it is ordinarily the seller who bears the freight, who suffers from the excessive charge, and who consequently is entitled to sue. \n8\n The \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 236]\n\u00a0\n contention is that facts specifically found differentiate the case at bar and overcome the prima facie effect of the Commission's finding as to damages; that because of these specific facts it was not the Sloss- Sheffield Company, but the purchasers of the iron from it, who paid and bore these freight charges; and that it was these purchasers alone who were entitled to reparation.\n The additional facts relied upon to support this objection to recovery are these: All the shipments were made under a standard form of contract which was applicable to sales for future delivery in installments and which contained a provision substantially as follows:\n'Price. Fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents ($14.85) per ton of 2, 240 pounds delivered at Chicago, Illinois.\n\n'This price is based on present tariff freight rate of $4.35 per ton. In case the tariff rate declines, the buyer is to have the benefit of such decline. In case the tariff freight rate advances, the buyer is to pay the advance.\n\n'Freight, cash; balance, cash 30 days from average date of monthly deliveries (invoice date). ... The seller will not be liable for any overchange in freight when correct rate is expressed in bill of lading.'\n\n The provision in question is common one in contracts of sale. Its effect upon the consignor's right to recover \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 237]\n\u00a0\n overcharges was carefully considered by the Commission in 1911 in Baker Mfg. Co. v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., 21 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 605. It was then held that the consignor must sue if goods were sold f. o. b. destination. This case has been consistently followed by the Commission since,9 and it was cited in Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 534\n, 38 S. Ct. 186. In the case at bar, both the consignor and the consignees claimed reparation; and the Commission's decision denying relief to the consignees seems to have been acquiesced in before that tribunal by all parties.\n The Louisville & Nashville argues now that a sale at the delivered price of $14,85 is, by reason of this provision, the legal equivalent of a sale at $10.50 plus freight; that under a contract of sale at a fixed price plus freight the purchaser would be entitled 'in case the tariff rate declines' to the benefit of 'the decline'; that a decision that a published rate exacted was excessive is the legal equivalent of a decline in rates; that under the provision quoted the purchaser would be entitled, as against the seller, to any damages payable by the carrier for having established and collected the higher tariff rate thereafter found to be unlawful because excessive; and that, since the refund to be made by the carrier would ultimately inure to the purchaser's benefit, no damage was suffered by the seller by reason of the excessive freight charge.\n The construction urged ignores the commercial significance of selling at a delivered price. When a seller \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 238]\n\u00a0\n enters a competitive market with a standard article he must meet offerings from other sources. On goods sold f. o. b. destination, the published freight charge from the point of origin becomes, in essence, a part of the seller's cost of production. An excessive freight charge for delivery of the finished article affects him as directly as does a like charge upon his raw materials. Moreover, the burden of the published freight rate rested upon the consignor under the bill of lading, Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Central Iron & Coal Co., \n265 \nU.S. 59, 67\n, 44 S. Ct. 441, as well as under the contract of sale. The purchaser who paid the freight did so solely as agent for the seller. The carrier did not know of the provision in the sales contracts. With the rights or equities as between seller and purchaser it had and has no concern, nor need we concern ourselves with them.\n Seventh. It is claimed that the order of reparation is void to the extent that it included as damages interest amounting to $25,979.49 accrued prior to the entry of the final order on July 12, 1921; and that the judgment is erroneous for the further reason that it included interest upon interest to the extent of $1,363.93, as it allowed interest generally from the date of the award. The main contention is that no interest is allowable prior to the date of the final award because until then there was no obligation to pay the claim in suit. The argument is that until entry of the award, it was uncertain whether any amount was payable by way of reparation, since the Commission might reduce rates for the future without awarding any damages for the past; that, moreover, the claim was unliquidated; that the claim was, in its nature, one which the parties could never voluntarily have liquidated, since a shipper must, in any event, pay freight rates in accordance with the tariff as published and the carrier must retain the amount received; that failure by the carriers to observe this rule would have been a criminal \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 239]\n\u00a0\n violation of the Elkins Act (32 Stat. 847 (Comp. St.  8597-8599); 34 Stat. 584); that repayment by the carrier could, therefore, not have been made legally until after the final award (Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 33 S. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315); that, for this reason, there could be no culpable delay in failing to repay the excess earlier; and that consequently there was lacking the only legal basis for allowing interest.\n It has been the uniform practice of the Commission to recognize as an element of the damages loss of interest on charges unlawfully exacted; and, in ordering reparation, it has usually included as a part of the damages such interest from the date of the payment. \n10\n In Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 420\n, 35 S. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691, in Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 434, 437\n, 35 S. Ct. 337, and in Mills v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 473, 477\n, 478 S., 35 S. Ct. 888, in each of which cases a judgment enforcing such an order was affirmed by this court, the opinions show that interest had been allowed in accordance with this practice. \n11\n The practice of the Commission conforms to \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 240]\n\u00a0\n the general rules governing the allowance of interest. The wrong for which the statute renders the carrier liable is the exacting of payment pursuant to an unlawful rate, not the withholding of the excess unlawfully exacted. The mere fact that the validity of the claim is disputed and that the amount recoverable is uncertain obviously does not bar the recovery of interest. The Commission properly determined not only whether interest should be included, but also the date from which it shall be included. Compare Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis, S. W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 147\n, 39 S. Ct. 237; Eddy v. Lafayette, \n163 \nU.S. 456, 467\n, 16 S. Ct. 1082; The Scotland, \n118 \nU.S. 507, 519\n, 6 S. Ct. 1174. On the findings made we cannot say that the conclusion of the Commission that interest should be paid from the date of the illegal exaction was unwarranted.\n The further contention is that by allowing interest from September 12, 1921, the effective date of the Commission's order, on the whole amount then payable, compound interest to the extent of $1,363.93 was allowed. It is true that the judgment entered involves such payment; but it does not follow that this was error. Payment of some compound interest often results when a judgment of affirmance is entered by an appellate court. It results, likewise, whenever a trial court enters judgment in an action upon a judgment or upon an award. An order of reparation may be likened to an award in this respect.\n Affirmed on writ of error.\n Writ of certiorari denied.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS:\n When this matter was before the Interstate Commerce Commission, July, 1916, Commissioner McChord, member since 1910, wrote a well-considered dissenting opinion, pointing out that defendant in error had suffered no proximate damage and therefore ought not to recover. Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 40 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 738. I think he was right. \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 241]\n\u00a0\n Apparently for some years the Commission has generally accepted the view that the consignee who pays freight charges under a. f. o. b. destination contract of sale acts as agent for the consignor and the latter may recover when these are found to be excessive. Of course, the decisions deserve attention, but if they support the reparation order here questioned (where the consignee had clear right to demand reasonable rates) they should be disapproved, not followed. Reiteration did not cure the fundamental error. The facts are not in dispute; the function of this court is to declare the law. Nothing heretofore said by us precludes the defense of no damage.\n At Birmingham, Ala., defendant in error accepted a written proposition made by the Chicago Foundary & Machine Company to purchase fifty tons of pig iron at 'fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, delivered at Chicago, Illinois,' which recited:\n'This price is based on present tariff freight rate of $4.35 per ton. In case the tariff rate declines, the buyer is to have the benefit of such decline. In case the tariff freight rate advances, the buyer is to pay the advance. Freight, cash; balance, cash 30 days from average date of monthly deliveries. ... The seller will not be liable for any overcharge in freight when correct rate is expressed in bill of lading.'\n\n From time to time the iron was consigned to the purchaser at Chicago under straight bills of lading issued by plaintiff in error; the weight and rate were stated on each bill. The carrier had no knowledge of the sale agreement; upon receipt of the goods the consignee paid the freight charges. The consignor rendered uniform bills which contained charge items for weights shipped at $14.85 per ton less freight at $4.35 per ton, always with a balance equivalent to $10.50 per ton. Entries on the consignee's books are not disclosed. In substance, as shown by the writing and practice, the consignor agreed to re- \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 242]\n\u00a0\n ceive from the consignee at the end of 30 days $10.50 per ton, and the latter agreed to pay the carrier's lawful charges, whatever they might be. In no event could the consignor receive more than the $10.50; it sold for future delivery at a definite price, payable 30 days thereafter. As intended, the consignee accepted the goods, actually paid the charges and was thus in relation with the carrier. It was peculiarly interested in the amount so paid and certainly had the right to demand reasonable rates. The consignor had no immediate interest therein; whether they were more or less could not affect its receipts or profits under the contract.\n The provision that 'the seller will not be liable for any overcharge in freight when correct rate is expressed in bill of lading' indicates that the parties did not regard the consignee as mere agent of the seller when paying transportation charges. By disavowing its interest in an overcharge the seller at least recognized the consignee's right to seek redress from the carrier.\n Under settled doctrine the right to reparation for violations of the interstate Commerce Act depends upon proximate damage. This was distinctly affirmed in Pennsylvania R. R. v. International Coal Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184\n, 33 S. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315; Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531\n, 38 S. Ct. 186; Davis v. Portland Seed Co., \n264 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S. Ct. 380. In the case last cited respondent sought, without success, 'to secure something for itself without proof of pecuniary loss consequent upon the unlawful act.' Here, no better result should follow like effort. In the same case we said:\n'Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co., \n245 U.S. 531\n (38 S. Ct. 186), presents no conflict with Pennsylvania R. R. v. International Coal Co. There the shipper paid a published rate which the Commission afterwards found to be unreasonable. This court held he could recover, as the proximate damage of the unlawful demand, the excess above the rate which the Commission had declared to be reasonable. The opinion went no further.' \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 243]\n\u00a0\n The following from Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co. Points out plainly enough that there can be no recovery without proximate damage:\n\n'The only question before us is that at which we have hinted: Whether the fact that the plaintiffs were able to pass on the damage that they sustained in the first instance by paying the unreasonable charge, and to collect that amount from the purchasers, prevents their recovering the overpayment from the carriers. The answer is not difficult. The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step. As it does not attribute remote consequences to a defendant so it holds him liable if proximately the plaintiff has suffered a loss. The plaintiffs suffered losses to the amount of the verdict when they paid. Their claim accrued at once in the theory of the law and it does not inquire into later events. ... If it be said that the whole transaction is one from a business point of view, it is enough to reply that the unity in this case is not sufficient to entitle the purchaser to recover, any more than the ultimate consumer who in turn paid an increased price. He has no privity with the carrier. ... The carrier ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum. ... Behind the technical mode of statement is the consideration well emphasized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, of the endlessness and futility of the effort to follow every transaction to its ultimate result. (Burgess v. Transcontinental Freight Bureau) 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 680. Probably in the end the public pays the damages in most cases of compensated torts.'\n\n It affirmatively appears that defendant in error suffered no appreciable damage. The consignee upon its own account, as agreed and obligated by law, paid freight charges upon receipt of the goods. These were too high; it was unlawfully required to pay too much and suffered proximate loss. \n\n[269 U.S. 217, 244]\n\u00a0\n It is vain to speculate whether the seller might have obtained better prices if the freight rate had been lower. It might not have gotten the business at all. Certainly it suffered no more than any competitor who failed to sell because of the exorbitant rate but sustained no proximate loss and therefore had no right to reparation. Every member of the public may be said to be damnified by excessive freight rates; but unless proximate damage exists there can be no recovery from the carrier. Here the consignee paid charges unlawfully demanded of it and is actually out of pocket more than it should be. The consignor paid nothing, lost nothing; but under the ruling below it alone may seek reparation-reparation for money unlawfully exacted of another.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting:\n I dissent from the opinion of the majority of the court on the ground that the consignees who paid the freight to procure goods, the title to which was in them when shipped, were within the protection of the statute prohibiting unreasonable freight rates, and upon payment of the illegally exacted freight from their own funds they were the persons suffering proximate damage and were therefore entitled to recover the excess freight within the meaning of the statute and the reasoning of the opinion in Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531\n, 38 S. Ct. 186. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reparation was awarded also to other furnace companies similarly situated. They joined as plaintiffs in this suit pursuant to section 16 of the act; but by reason of stipulations between the parties, these claims do not require consideration here. The stipulations cover also like claims against other carriers. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The proceedings had were these. After the Commission ordered that, for the future, the rates complained of be reduced because unreasonable, it found that throughout the period beginning two years prior to the filing of the complaint the existing rates had also been unreasonable and excessive to the extent of 35 cents a ton, Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 52 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 576; held that the Sloss-Sheffield Company was entitled to reparation on account of shipments made during that period; directed that the parties prepare statements showing the details of shipments in accordance with rule V of its Rules of Practice; ordered, upon the filing of the Sixth Supplemental Report, Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 60 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 595, the payment therein specified; and ultimately substituted the order of July 12, 1921, for that of March 8, Id ., 62 Interst. Com.

The Commission did not then decide whether the rates had been unreasonable at any time prior to the entry of the order, and the report stated merely: 'Reparation is prayed for, but under the circumstances of this case we do not believe that it may fairly be awarded.' The Sloss-Sheffield Company petitioned for a rehearing in respect to reparation for the period prior to the filing of the original complaint; but it did not do so until July 22, 1915. The application so made was not acted upon until December 9, 1918. The Commission then decided that the Sloss-Sheffield Company was entitled to a finding as to the reasonableness of the rates during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the original complaint and authorized the parties to introduce additional evidence on this issue. Sloss-Sheffields Steel & Iron Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 51 Interst. Com Com'n R. 635. On April 7, 1919, the Commission decided that the rates had been unreasonable during the 2-year period; that reparation should be made, Id., 52 Interst. Com.

ALWORTH-STEPHENS CO(1925)\nNo. 273\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Merrill E. Otis, of Indianapolis, Ind., and the Attorney General, for petitioner.\n Messrs. J. L. Washburn, William D. Bailey, and Oscar Mitchell, all of Duluth, Minn. (Messrs. Horace Andrews and William P. Belden, both of Cleveland, Ohio, of counsel), for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The federal income tax return made by respondent (a corporation organized in the United States) for the year 1917 showed the sum of $10, 253.21 due the government for income and excess war profits taxes for that year, and this amount was paid. Thereafter the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed respondent with an additional tax of $17,128.44, which respondent was forced to pay, and did pay under protest, and to recover which this \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n action was brought against E. J. Lynch, a collector of internal revenue, to whom the payment had been made. Lynch subsequently died, and his executrix was substituted as defendant. The federal District Court for the District of Minnesota, where the action was brought, rendered judgment in favor of respondent for the amount. 278 F. 959. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (294 F. 190), and the case is here upon certiorari (\n264 \nU.S. 577\n, 44 S. Ct. 334).\n The facts from which the controversy arose are not in dispute, and, for present purposes, may be shortly stated. Prior to March 1, 1913, respondent had leases upon two definitely described tracts of land in Minnesota, containing deposits of iron ore, known as the Perkins mine and the Hudson mine. The leases, unless sooner terminated by the lessee in the manner therein provided, ran for a period of 50 years, and obliged respondent to mine and remove at least 50,000 tons of iron ore annually from the Perkins and 25,000 tons annually from the Hudson, and to pay the lessor, owner of the fee, a royalty of 30 cents per ton upon each ton of ore extracted. Respondent subleased the lands upon terms not necessary to be stated, further than that the sublessee of the Perkins was to pay respondent a royalty of 75 cents per ton and the sublessee of the Hudson a royalty of 60 cents per ton, or 45 cents and 30 cents, respectively, per ton more than was made payable by respondent to the lessor owner.\n Before March 1, 1913, both tracts of land had been fully explored and the deposits of ore therein developed to such an extent that the entire amount of tonnage was known with substantial accuracy, and the properties were demonstrated to be of great value. On that date it was known that these ore bodies would be entirely worked out and the mines exhausted within seven years, and this in fact happened. The market value of the ore in the mines \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n during that entire time exceeded 75 cents per ton, and it sufficiently appears that during such time respondent and its sublessees were in possession of the lands, engaged in mining and removing the ore therefrom. Without repeating the formula followed in arriving at the result, it is enough to say that the trial court found that, under the leases, the respondent had a property interest in these ore bodies, the fair market value of which, as of March 1, 1913, was 71.9 per cent. of the total royalties which would be received under the subleases, and such royalties constituted the sole source of respondent's income. Thereupon the lower courts held that respondent was entitled to deduct from its gross income for 1917 a sum equal to 71.9 per cent. thereof for depletion, and that only the balance remaining was subject to income and excess profits taxes. Such taxes, properly computed, amounted to the sum returned and originally paid by respondent, and no more.\n The applicable law is found in sections 2, 10 and 12(a) of the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 757, 758, 765, 767. Section 10 imposes a tax of two per centum upon the total annual net income received from all sources by every corporation, etc., organized in the United States. Section 12(a)1 provides that such net \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of the income, among other things, 'a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion ... of property arising out of its use; ... (b) in the case of mines a reasonable allowance for depletion thereof not to exceed the market value in the mine of the product thereof which has been mined and sold during the year for which the return and computation are made. ...' Section 2 contains the following provision (page 758):\n'(c) For the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, acquired before March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen the fair market price or value of such property as of March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, shall be the basis for determining the amount of such gain derived.'\n\n Upon the foregoing facts and under these statutory provisions, the question presented for consideration is whether the relation of respondent to the mines which were the source of its income, was such that it was entitled to deduct from the gross amount of such income a reasonable amount for exhaustion or depletion. Upon the part of the petitioner the contention is that the leases do not convey to the lessee the ore bodies, but are contracts of rental conferring only the right to use and occupy the premises and mine the ore, which, so long as it remains in the ground, is the property of the fee owner. It is therefore insisted that by the extraction of the ore, only the property of the fee owner is depleted and such owner alone is entitled to an allowance therefor. On the other \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n hand, respondent contends that under the leases the lessee, as well as the lessor, owns a valuable property interest in the mines and by the terms of the statute each is entitled to deduct from gross income a reasonable allowance for depletion, the lessee for exhaustion of the leasehold interest and the lessor for exhaustion of the fee interest as lessened by the interest of the lessee, such deduction to be allowed according to the value of the interest of each in the property, the entire allowance, however, not to exceed the total market value in the mine of the product thereof mined and sold during the taxable year.\n It is, of course, true that the leases here under review did not convey title to the unextracted ore deposits (United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 116, 123\n, 38 S. Ct. 462); but it is equally true that such leases, conferring upon the lessee the exclusive possession of the deposits and the valuable right of removing and reducing the ore to ownership, created a very real and substantial interest therein. See Hyatt v. Vincennes Bank, \n113 \nU.S. 408, 416\n, 5 S. Ct. 573; Ewert v. Robinson, 289 F. 740, 746-750. And there can be no doubt that such an interest is property. Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 421\n, 20 S. Ct. 155; Bryan v. Kennett, \n113 \nU.S. 179, 192\n, 5 S. Ct. 407.\n The general provision in section 12(a), Second, is that the deduction from gross income shall include a reasonable allowance for the 'exhaustion ... of property.' There is nothing to suggest that the word 'property' is used in any restricted sense. In the case of mines, a specific kind of property, the exhaustion is described as depletion, and is limited to an amount not exceeding the market value in the mine of the product mined and sold during the year. The interest of respondent under its leases in the mines being property, its right to deduct a reasonable allowance for exhaustion of such property, if there be any, during the taxable year results from the \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n plain terms of the statute, such deduction, since the property is an interest in mines, to be limited to the amount of the exhaustion of respondent's interest caused by the depletion of the mines during the taxable year. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals (294 F. 194) that:\n'The plain, clear, and reasonable meaning of the statute seems to be that the reasonable allowance for depletion in case of a mine is to be made to every one whose property right and interest therein has been depleted by the extraction and disposition 'of the product thereof which has been mined and sold during the year for which the return and computation are made.' And the plain, obvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intellect would discover.'\n\n It is said that the depletion allowance applies to the physical exhaustion of the ore deposits, and since the title thereto is in the lessor, he alone is entitled to make the deduction. But the fallacy in the syllgism is plain. The deduction for depletion in the case of mines is a special application of the general rule of the statute allowing a deduction for exhaustion of property. While respondent does not own the ore deposits, its right to mine and remove the ore and reduce it to possession and ownership is property within the meaning of the general provision. Obviously, as the process goes on, this property interest of the lessee in the mines is lessened from year to year, as the owner's property interest in the same mines is likewise lessened. There is an exhaustion of property in the one case as in the other; and the extent of it, with the consequent deduction to be made, in each case is to be arrived at in the same way, namely, by determining the aggregate amount of the depletion of the mines in which the several interests inhere, based upon the market \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n value of the product, and allocating that amount in proportion to the interest of each severally considered.\n We are referred to Weiss v. Mohawk Mining Co., 264 F. 502, where the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reached an exactly opposite conclusion to that announced in the present case by the courts below. The opinion in that case was apparently made to rest upon the decision of this court in United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., supra, which, in turn, followed Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503\n, 37 S. Ct. 201. These cases, however, arose under the Corporation Tax Law of 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 111, 112,  38, imposing a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business by a corporation, etc., measured by its net income, in the ascertainment of which, among other things, there was authorized a deduction of 'a reasonable allowance for depreciation of property.' The Sargent Land Co. Case concerned the owner and lessor of mining property, while the Biwabik Mining Co. Case concerned a lessee of mining property. It was held in both cases, as we hold here, that the leases under consideration did not convey title to the ore in place. Whether the lessees had property interests such as we have determined here, was not considered. Both decisions, expressly in one and impliedly in the other, turned, primarily, upon the scope of the word 'depreciation.' In the Sargent Land Co. Case this appears expressly from the following extract (pages 524, 525 [37 S. Ct. 207, 208]):\n'We do not think Congress intended to cover the necessary depreciation of a mine by exhaustion of the ores in determining the income to be assessed under the statute by including such exhaustion within the allowance made for depreciation. It would be a strained use of the term depreciation to say that, where ore is taken from a mine in the operation of the property, depreciation, as generally understood in business circles, follows. True, the value of the mine is lessened from the partial exhaustion of the property, and, \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n owing to its peculiar character, cannot be replaced. But in no accurate sense can such exhaustion of the body of the ore be deemed depreciation. It is equally true that there seems to be a hardship in taxing such receipts as income, without some deduction arising from the fact that the mining property is being continually reduced by the removal of the minerals. But such consideration will not justify this court in attributing to depreciation a sense which we do not believe Congress intended to give to it in the act of 1909.'\n\n And this view is immediately emphasized by putting in contrast with the 'depreciation' of the 1909 act the 'reasonable allowance for the exhaustion ... of property' of the income tax provision of the Tariff Act of 1913 and the exhaustion and depletion provisions of the act of 1916, heretofore quoted. 'These provisions,' the court concluded (page 525 [37 S. Ct. 208]), 'were not in the act of 1909, and, as we have said, we think that Congress, in that act, used the term 'depreciation' in its ordinary and usual significance. We therefore reach the conclusion that no allowance can be made of the character contended for as an item of depreciation.'\n The decision in the later case of the Biwabik Mining Co., it is true, rests upon the predicate that the lessee was not a purchaser of the ore in place, but that was because the decision of the lower court-that the lease as applied to the situation there developed, was 'in every substantial way pro tanto a purchase'-presented that question as the one to be met. The lower court thought that the case of the lessor (Sargent Land Company) was to be distinguished from that of the lessee (Biwabik Mining Company) upon the theory that, while the royalties paid to the former might properly be called income, the receipts of the latter resulted from the sale of capital assets and were not income. But this court rejected the assumed distinction as unsound and decided the case upon that point without referring to the question of deduction on account \n\n[267 U.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n of depreciation. Evidently, it was taken for granted in the lower court that under the decision in the Sargent Land Co. Case, the latter point was no longer open, and it was passed there, as it was here, without comment. Considering the Sargent Land Co. and the Biwabik Mining Co. Cases together, it is apparent that in respect of the matter of depreciation under the act of 1909, in the opinion of this court, lessor and lessee stood upon the same footing, neither being entitled to an allowance; but it was plainly recognized that if the statutory allowance had been for exhaustion or depletion, as in the later acts, an entirely different question might have been presented as to both interests. We find nothing in either case out of harmony with the conclusion reached by the lower courts, in respect of the construction and application of the pertinent provisions of law which are now under review.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 12.

Stern, and Henry Jackson Darby, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn. for the United States.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By bill in equity filed March 5, 1923, the United States asked an injunction restraining the defendants, who are appellants here, from violating section 1 of the Act of Congress of July 2, 1890, entitled, 'An act to protect trade, and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies,' 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820), commonly known as the Sherman Act.\n The defendants are the Maple Flooring Manufacturers' Association, an unincorporated 'trade association'; 22 corporate defendants, members of the association, engaged in the business of selling and shipping maple, beech, and birch flooring in interstate commerce, all but 2 of them having their principal places of business in Michigan, Minnesota, or Wisconsin ( one defendant being located in Illinois and one in New York); the several individual representatives of the corporate members of the association; and George W. Keehn, secretary of the association. Of the corporate defendants, approximately one-half own timber lands and sawmills and are producers of the rough lumber from which they manufacture finished flooring, sold and shipped in interstate commerce. The other defendants purchase rough flooring lumber in the open market and manufacture it into finished flooring which is sold and shipped in interstate commerce. In 1922 there were in the states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, 17 nonmember manufacturers of maple, beech, and birch flooring, and there were 58 nonmember manufacturers of maple, beech, and birch flooring in the United States who reported to the government. In that year 38 nonmember manufacturers reported a manufacturing capacity of 238,610, 000 feet of flooring of the types mentioned, and during the same year the manufacturing capacity of the defendants was 158,400,000 feet. Estimates \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n submitted in behalf of the government indicate that in the year 1922 the defendants produced 70 per cent. of the total production of these types of flooring, the percentage having been gradually diminished during the five years preceding, the average for the five years being 74.2 per cent. It is also in evidence that aside from nonmember manufacturers who reported to the government, there are numerous other nonmember manufacturers of such flooring in the United States and Canada. The defendants own only a small proportion of the total stand, in the United States, of maple, beech, and birch timber from which the various types of flooring produced and sold by defendants is manufactured.\n In March, 1922, the corporate defendants organized the defendant the Maple Flooring Manufacturers' Association, but for many years prior to that time, and certainly since 1913, a substantial number of the corporate defendants have participated actively in maintaining numerous successive trade associations of the same name, which were predecessors of the present association. The oral testimony and documentary evidence have covered a wide range and have reached a great volume which it will be impossible, within the limits of an opinion, to review in detail. The defendants have engaged in many activities to which no exception is taken by the government and which are admittedly beneficial to the industry and to consumers; such as co-operative advertising and the standardization and improvement of its product. The activities, however, of the present association of which the government complains may be summarized as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n The computation and distribution among the members of the association of the average cost to association members of all dimensions and grades of flooring.\n\n\n (2)\n The compilation and distribution among members of a booklet showing freight rates on flooring from Cadillac, \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n Mich., to between 5,000 and 6,000 points of shipment in the United States.\n\n\n (3)\n The gathering of statistics which at frequent intervals are supplied by each member of the association to the secretary of the association given complete information as to the quantity and kind of flooring sold and prices received by the reporting members, and the amount of stock on hand, which information is summarized by the secretary and transmitted to members without, however, revealing the identity of the members in connection with any specific information thus transmitted.\n\n\n (4)\n Meetings at which the representatives of members congregate and discuss the industry and exchange views as to its problems.\n Before considering these phases of the activities of the association, it should be pointed out that it is neither alleged nor proved that there was any agreement among the members of the association either affecting production, fixing prices, or for price maintenance. Both by the articles of association and in actual practice, members have been left free to sell their product at any price they choose and to conduct their business as they please. Although the bill alleges that the activities of the defendants hereinbefore referred to resulted in the maintenance of practical uniformity of net delivered prices as between the several corporate defendants, the evidence fails to establish such uniformity, and it was not seriously urged before this court that any substantial uniformity in price had in fact resulted from the activities of the association, although it was conceded by defendants that the dissemination of information as to cost of the product and as to production and prices would tend to bring about uniformity in prices through the operation of economic law. Nor was there any direct proof that the activities of the association had affected prices adversely to consumers. On the contrary, the defendants offered a great volume of evidence tending to show that the trend of \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n prices of the product of the defendants corresponded to the law of supply and demand and that it evidenced no abnormality when compared with the price of commodities generally. There is undisputed evidence that the prices of members were fair and reasonable and that they were usually lower than the prices of nonmembers, and there is no claim that defendants were guilty of unfair or arbitrary trade practices.\n The contention of the government is that there is a combination among the defendants, which is admitted; that the effect of the activities of the defendants carried on under the plan of the association must necessarily be to bring about a concerted effort on the part of members of the association to maintain prices at levels having a close relation to the average cost of flooring reported to members; and that consequently there is a necessary and inevitable restraint of interstate commerce; and that therefore the plan of the association itself is a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, which should be enjoined regardless of its actual operation and effect so far as price maintenance is concerned. The case must turn, therefore, on the effect of the activity of the defendants in the gathering and dissemination of information as to the cost of flooring, since, without that, the other activities complained of could have no material bearing on price levels in the industry and it was to this phase of the case that the oral argument was mainly directed.\n Having outlined the substantial issues in the case, it will now be convenient to examine more in detail the several activities of the defendants of which the government complains.\n Computation and Distribution, Among the Members, of Information as to the Average Cost of Their Product.\n There are three principal elements which enter into the computation of the cost of finished flooring. They are \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n the cost of raw material, manufacturing cost, and the percentage of waste in converting rough lumber into flooring. The information as to the cost of rough lumber was procured by the secretary from reports of actual sales of lumber by members in the open market. From five to ten ascertained sales were taken as standard and the average was taken as the estimated cost of raw material. Manufacturing costs were ascertained by questionnaires sent out to members by which members were requested to give information as to labor costs, cost of warehousing, insurance and taxes, interest at 6 per cent. on the value of the plant; selling expense, including commissions and cost of advertising and depreciation of plant. From the total thus ascertained there was deducted the net profit from wood and other by-products. The net total cost thus ascertained of all members reporting was then averaged.\n The percentage of waste in converting the rough lumber into flooring was ascertained by test runs made by selected members of the association under the direction of the secretary of the association, in the course of which a given amount of rough lumber was converted into flooring of different sizes and the actual waste in the process ascertained and stated in terms of percentage. By combining the three elements of cost thus arrived at, the total cost per thousand feet of the aggregate of the different types and grades of flooring produced from a given amount of rough lumber was estimated. To this cost there was at one time added an estimated 5 per cent. for contingencies, which practice, however, was discontinued by resolution of the association of July 19, 1923. For the element of manufacturing and marketing cost, the first of these estimates prepared in the manner described was based upon an average of such cost for the first half of 1921. Other successive estimates were prepared on a like basis during the first, third, and fourth quarter of the year 1922. \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n In order to determine the cost of a given type or grade of flooring, it was necessary to distribute the total cost of the aggregate of the different types and grades of finished flooring produced from a given amount of rough lumber among the several types and grades thus produced. This distribution was made by the officials of the association, and the estimated cost thus determined was tabulated and distributed among the members of the association. There is no substantial claim made on the part of the government that the preparation of these estimates of cost were not made with all practicable accuracy, or that they were in any respect not what they purported to be, an estimate of the actual cost of commercial grades of finished flooring fairly ascertained from the actual experience of members of the association, except that the point is made by the government that the distribution of cost among the several types and grades of finished flooring produced from a given amount of rough lumber was necessarily arbitrary and that it might be or become a cover for price fixing. Suffice it to say that neither the government nor the defendants seem to have found it necessary to prove upon what principle of cost accounting this distribution of cost was made, and there are no data from which any inference can be drawn as to whether or not it conformed to accepted practices of cost accounting applied to the manufacture of a diversified product from a single type of raw material.\n The Compilation and Distribution Among Members of Information as to Freight Rates.\n Through the agency of the secretary of the association, a booklet was compiled and distributed to members of the association showing freight rates from Cadillac, Mich., to numerous points throughout the United States to which the finished flooring is shipped by members of the \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n association. It appears from the evidence to have been the usual practice, in the maple flooring trade, to quote flooring at a delivered price and that purchasers of flooring usually will not buy on any other basis. The evidence, however, is undisputed that the defendants quote and sell on an f. o. b. mill basis whenever a purchaser so requests. It also appears that the mills of most of the members of the association are located in small towns in Michigan and Wisconsin and that the average freight rates from these principal producing points in Michigan and Wisconsin, to the principal centers of consumption in the United States, are approximately the same as the freight rate from Cadillac, Mich., to the same centers of consumption. There is abundant evidence that there were delays in securing quotations of freight rates from the local agents of carriers in towns in which the factories of defendants are located, which seriously interfered with prompt quotations of delivered prices to customers; that the actual aggregate difference between local freight rates for most of defendants' mills and the rate appearing in defendants' freight rate book based on rates at Cadillac, Mich., were so small as to be only nominal, and that the freight rate book served a useful and legitimate purpose in enabling members to quote promptly a delivered price on their product by adding to their mill price a previously calculated freight rate which approximated closely to the actual rate from their own mill towns.\n The government bases it criticism of the use of the freight rate book upon the fact that antecedent associations, maintained by defendants, incorporated in the freight rate book a delivered price which was made up by adding the calculated freight rate from Cadillac, Mich., to a minimum price under the so-called 'minimum price plan' of previous associations, whereby the price was fixed at cost plus 10 per cent. of profit. It is conceded \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n that the present association does not include a delivered price in the freight rate book, but it is urged by the government that the circulation of the tables of estimated cost of flooring, together with a freight rate book, enables members of the association to fix a delivered price by adding to the estimated cost circulated among members, the calculated freight rate published in the freight rate book, and that the freight rate book used in conjunction with the published material as to estimated cost is merely a device whereby the defendants have continued the so-called minimum price plan formerly maintained by predecessor associations, which was a plan whereby the members co-operated in the maintenance of a fixed minimum price. Defendants maintain that the minimum price plan was never actually carried out by any predecessor association, and that it was formally abandoned in February or March, 1920, after the failure to secure the approval of the plan by the Federal Trade Commission, and was never revived or continued.\n It cannot, we think, be questioned that data as to the average cost of flooring circulated among the members of the association, when combined with a calculated freight rate which is either exactly or approximately the freight rate from the point of shipment, plus an arbitrary percentage of profit, could be made the basis for fixing prices or for an agreement for price maintenance which, if found to exist, would, under the decisions of this court, constitute a violation of the Sherman Act. But, as we have already said, the record is barren of evidence that the published list of costs and the freight rate book have been so used by the present association. Consequently, the question which this court must decide is whether the use of this material by members of the association will necessarily have that effect so as to produce that unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce which is condemned by the Sherman Act. \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n The Gathering and Distributing Among Members of Trade Statistics.\n It is contended by the government that an analysis of the reporting system adopted by the defendants shows that there is no information withheld by one member from another, and that every member is perfectly familiar not only with the summaries which show the exact market condition generally, but also with the exact condition of the business of each of his fellow members. An examination of the record discloses that this is not an accurate statement of the statistical information distributed among members of the association, certainly not within any recent period of the history of the successive associations. At the time of the filing of the bill, members reported weekly to the secretary of the association on forms showing dates of sales made by the reporting member, the quantity, the thickness and face, the grade, the kind of wood, the delivery, the prices at which sold, the average freight rate to destination, and the rate of commission paid, if any. Members also reported monthly the amount of flooring on hand of each dimension and grade and the amount of unfilled orders. Monthly reports were also required showing the amount of production for each period and the new orders booked for each variety of flooring. The association promptly reported back to the members statistics compiled from the reports of members including the identifying numbers of the mills making the reports, and information as to quantities, grades, prices, freight rates, etc., with respect to each sale. The names of purchasers were not reported, and from and after July 19, 1923, the identifying number of the mill making the report was omitted. All reports of sales and prices dealt exclusively with past and closed transactions. The statistics gathered by the defendant association are given wide publicity. They are published in trade journals \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 574]\n\u00a0\n which are read by from 90 to 95 per cent. of the persons who purchase the products of association members. They are sent to the Department of Commerce, which publishes a monthly survey of current business. They are forwarded to the Federal Reserve and other banks and are available to any one at any time desiring to use them. It is to be noted that the statistics gathered and disseminated do not include current price quotations; information as to employment conditions; geographical distribution of shipments; the names of customers or distribution by classes of purchasers; the details with respect to new orders booked, such as names of customers, geographical origin of orders; or details with respect to unfilled orders, such as names of customers, their geographical location; the names of members having surplus stocks on hand; the amount of rough lumber on hand; or information as to cancellation of orders. Nor do they differ in any essential respect from trade or business statistics which are freely gathered and publicly disseminated in numerous branches of industry producing a standardized product such as grain, cotton, coal oil, and involving interstate commerce whose statistics disclose volume and material elements affecting costs of production, sales price, and stock on hand.\n Association Meetings.\n The articles of the defendant association provide for regular meetings for the transaction of business on the third Wednesday of April, July and October of each year, and that special meetings may be called by the president or a majority of the board of trustees. During the year in which the bill of complaint was filed, meetings appear to have been held monthly. Minutes of meetings were kept, although it is not contended that they constituted a complete record of the proceedings. Trade conditions generally, as reflected by the statistical information disseminated \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 575]\n\u00a0\n among members, were discussed; the market prices of rough maple flooring were also discussed, as were also manufacturing and market conditions. Those members who did not produce rough flooring lumber improved the occasion of the monthly meetings to secure purchases of this commodity from other members. The testimony is explicit and not denied that following the decision in United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S. Ct. 607 (June, 1923), there was no discussion of prices in meetings. There was no occasion to discuss past prices, as those were fully detailed in the statistical reports and the association was advised by counsel that future prices were not a proper subject of discussion. It was admitted by several witnesses, however, that upon occasion the trend of prices and future prices became the subject of discussion outside the meeting among individual representatives of the defendants attending the meeting. The government, however, does not charge, nor is it contended, that there was any understanding or agreement, either express or implied, at the meetings or elsewhere, with respect to prices.\n Upon this state of the record, the District Court, from whose decision this appeal was taken, held that the plan or system operated by the defendant had a direct and necessary tendency to destroy competition; that the methods employed by them had at all times a controlling influence to impeding the economic laws of supply and demand, and tending to increase prices, and to stifle competition; that the plan of the association was therefore inherently illegal; that in consequence the actual results flowing from such a plan and the execution of it are of secondary importance. The court accordingly decreed the dissolution of the defendants' association and enjoined them from engaging in activities complained of by the government. In arriving at this result it was admitted that it was impossible to measure, either accurately or \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 576]\n\u00a0\n even approximately, the effect of the activities of the defendants upon prices, production, and competition in the flooring industry, for the reason that there could be, in the nature of things, no satisfactory standards of comparison. The court found no agreement to fix prices and that in fact lower prices have usually been quoted by members than by nonmembers of the association. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied principally upon the necessary tendency or effect of the plan actually in operation and upon the past history of the association and its predecessors as indicating a probable purpose on the part of the members of the association to use the plan as a medium for effecting actual and undue restraint on interstate commerce, and it is urged here that the history of the successive associations organized by the members of the defendant association, or a majority of them, establishes a systematic purpose on the part of the corporate defendants to restrain interstate commerce.\n It is pointed out that the articles of the association of January 1, 1913, embodied the so-called 'allotment plan,' which provided for an allotted percentage of the aggregate shipments of all members within a given period, to each member, with a provision for payment of a bonus or allowance to each member which did not make its full allotment or percentage of shipments. This plan was abandoned in March, 1920. On July 1, 1916, the articles of association of that date adopted a minimum price plan which it is claimed continued in effect until about January 1, 1921. This plan contemplated the establishment of a minimum price of maple, beech, and birch flooring by members of the association, such prices to consist of the average cost and expense of manufacturing and selling the product, plus an average profit of 10 per cent. The plan provided drastic penalties for the sale of flooring at less than the minimum price so established. It is also charged that on January, 1921, the defendants, by agreement, \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 577]\n\u00a0\n established a minimum price basis for the sale of flooring for the ensuing year. Under this plan the average net profit was reduced from 10 to 5 per cent. and penalties for noncompliance with the minimum price scale were abolished.\n It is conceded, however, that each of these several plans was abandoned and that the present association, both by the terms of its articles of association and in actual practice, has confined itself to the activities which have already been described in some detail.\n We think it might be urged, on the basis of this record, that the defendants, by their course of conduct instead of evidencing the purpose of persistent violators of law, had steadily indicated a purpose to keep within the boundaries of legality as rapidly as those boundaries were marked out by the decisions of courts interpreting the Sherman Act. Whether, however, their general purpose was to become law-abiding members of the community or law breakers, it is not, we think, very material unless the court either can infer from this course of conduct a specific and continuing purpose or agreement or understanding on their part to do acts tending to effect an actual restraint of commerce (United States v. United States Steel Corp'n, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121), or unless, on the other hand, it is established that the combination entered into by the defendants in the organization of the defendant association, and its activities as now carried on must necessarily result in such restraint. As already indicated, the record is barren of evidence tending to establish that there is any agreement or purpose or intention on the part of defendants to produce any effect upon commerce other than which would necessarily flow from the activities of the present association, and in our view the government must stand or fall upon its ability to bring the facts of the present case within the rule as laid down in American Column Co. \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 578]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093, where it was said at page 400, 42 S. Ct. 117:\n'It has been repeatedly held by this court that the purpose of the statute is to maintain free competition in interstate commerce and that any concerted action by any combination of men or corporations to cause, or which in fact does cause, direct and undue restraint of competition in such commerce falls within the condemnation of the act and is unlawful,'-and within the rule laid down by the court in United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 U.S. 371\n, at page 390, 43 S. Ct. 607, at page 611:\n\n'In the absence of a purpose to monopolize or the compulsion that results from contract or agreement, the individual certainly may exercise great freedom; but concerted action through combination presents a wholly different problem and is forbidden when the necessary tendency is to destroy the kind of competition to which the public has long looked for protection.'\n\n It should be noted that the bill of complaint neither charges, nor does the government urge, that there was any purpose on the part of the defendants to monopolize commerce in maple, beech, and birch flooring. It is not contended that there was the compulsion of any agreement fixing prices, restraining production or competition, or otherwise restraining interstate commerce. In our view, therefore, the sole question presented by this record for our consideration is whether the combination of the defendants in their existing association as actually conducted by them has a necessary tendency to cause direct and undue restraint of competition in commerce falling within the condemnation of the act. In urging that such is the necessary effect, the government relies mainly upon the decisions of this court in Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788; American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, supra; and United States v. American Linseed Oil Company, supra. \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 579]\n\u00a0\n It should be said at the outset that in considering the application of the rule of decision in these cases to the situation presented by this record, it should be remembered that this court has often announced that each case arising under the Sherman Act must be determined upon the particular facts disclosed by the record, and that the opinions in those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the essential differences in the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to which the rule of earlier decisions is to be applied.\n In Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, supra, the defendant members of the association had entered into a combination and agreement whereby members were required to report to the association the names of wholesale dealers in lumber who sold their product directly to consumers. The names of the offending wholesalers were placed upon a 'black list' which was circulated among the members of the association. The name of a blacklisted wholesaler could be removed from the list only on application to the secretary of the association and on assurance that the offending wholesaler would no longer sell in competition with retailers. It was conceded by the defendants, and the court below found, that the circulation of this information would have a natural tendency to cause retailers receiving these reports to withhold patronage from listed concerns; that it therefore, necessarily, tended to restrain wholesalers from selling to the retail trade, which in itself was an undue and unreasonable restraint of commerce. Moreover, the court said, at page 612, 34 S. Ct. 956:\n'This record abounds in instances where the offending dealer was thus reported, the hoped for effect, unless he discontinued the offending practice, realized, and his trade directly and appreciably impaired.'\n\n There was thus presented a case in which the court could not only see that the combination would necessarily result \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 580]\n\u00a0\n in a restraint on commerce which was unreasonable, but where in fact such restraints had actually been effected by the concerted action of the defendants.\n In American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, the defendant association adopted a plan for the gathering from its members daily, and disseminating among them weekly, reports of all sales and shipments actually made, giving prices, names and addresses of purchasers, the kind, grade, and quantity of commodity sold and shipped. Its plan provided for a monthly production report giving production of members during the previous month; a monthly stock report showing stock on hand on the first day of the month; current price lists, followed by prompt information as to new price quotations as made. Monthly meetings were held at which the extensive interchange of reports was supplemented by further exchange of information as to production, at which active and concerted efforts were made to suppress competition by the restriction of production. The secretary of the association, in communications to members, actively urged curtailment of production and increase of prices. The record disclosed a systematic effort, participated in by the members of the association and led and directed by the secretary of the association, to cut down production and increase prices. The court not only held that this concerted effort was in itself unlawful, but that it resulted in an actual excessive increase of price to which the court found the 'united action of this large and influential membership of dealers contributed greatly.' The opinion of the court in that case rests squarely on the ground that there was a combination on the part of the members to secure concerted action in curtailment of production and increase of price, which actually resulted in a restraint of commerce, producing increase of price.\n In United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., supra, defendants entered into an agreement, with provisions \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 581]\n\u00a0\n for financial forfeitures in event of its violation, for the organization and maintenance of an exchange or bureau whose function it was to gather and distribute information, among the members, as to all price lists covering the product of members. Members agreed, under heavy penalties for violation, to furnish to the bureau a 'schedule of prices and terms and adhere thereto-unless more onerous ones were obtained-until prepared to give immediate notice of departure therefrom for relay by the bureau to members.' Members were required by the agreement to report by telegraph all variations of prices; the names of prospective buyers; the point of shipment; the exact prices, terms, and discounts; whether sales were made to jobber, or dealer or consumer; in what quantity; and to report also by telegraph all orders received; to report daily all carload sales of product, giving full details; all such information being treated as confidential and concealed from the buyers. All information received was made available to members through the statistical surveys of the bureau. It was provided that any subscriber who had offered his product to a prospective buyer, who did not purchase, should have the right to advise the bureau of the unsuccessful offer and to request the bureau to 'bulletin' all its subscribers, asking specific information regarding any quotations for sale to such prospective buyer, and to make to subscribers a compilation report of the information secured by such 'bulletin.' Members were required to give the desired information. Each subscriber was required to furnish the bureau, upon request, information pertaining to any buyer of the product and might request the bureau to secure like information from all other subscribers 'whenever it shall have an order or account with or inquiry from the buyer.' The plan as organized was actively carried out by the defendants, and the court held that the plan as operated by the defendants was a violation of the Sherman Act in that 'its necessary \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 582]\n\u00a0\n tendency was to suppress competition in interstate commerce.' It was held that the agreement for price maintenance accompanied by free exchange of information between competitors as to current prices of the product offered for sale; full details as to purchasers, actual and prospective; and the exchange of information as to buyers and those to whom offerings were made by sellers and of the terms of such offerings, could necessarily have only one purpose and effect, namely to restrain competition among sellers. The court said, at page 389, 43 S. Ct. 611:\n'If, looking at the entire contract by which they are bound together, in the light of what has been done under it the court can see that its necessary tendency is to suppress competition in trade between the states, the combination must be declared unlawful. That such is its tendency, we think, must be affirmed.'\n\n It is not, we think, open to question that the dissemination of pertinent information concerning any trade or business tends to stabilize that trade or business and to produce uniformity of price and trade practice. Exchange of price quotations of market commodities tends to produce uniformity of prices in the markets of the world. Knowledge of the supplies of available merchandise tends to prevent overproduction and to avoid the economic disturbances produced by business crises resulting from overproduction. But the natural effect of the acquisition of wider and more scientific knowledge of business conditions, on the minds of the individuals engaged in commerce and its consequent effect in stabilizing production and price, can hardly be deemed a restraint of commerce, or, if so, it cannot, we think, be said to be an unreasonable restraint, or in any respect unlawful.\n It is the consensus of opinion of economists and of many of the most important agencies of government that the public interest is served by the gathering and dissemination, in the widest possible manner, of information with \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 583]\n\u00a0\n respect to the production and distribution, cost and prices in actual sales, of market commodities because the making available of such information tends to stabilize trade and industry, to produce fairer price levels and to avoid the waste which inevitably attends the unintelligent conduct of economic enterprise. 'Free competition' means a free and open market among both buyers and sellers for the sale and distribution of commodities. Competition does not become less free merely because the conduct of commercial operations becomes more intelligent through the free distribution of knowledge of all the essential factors entering into the commercial transaction. \n1\n General knowledge that there is an accumulation of surplus of any market commodity would undoubtedly tend to diminish production, but the dissemination of that information cannot in itself be said to be restraint upon commerce in any legal sense. The manufacturer is free to produce, but prudence and business foresight based on that knowledge influences free choice in favor of more limited production. Restraint upon free competition begins when improper use is made of that information through any concerted action which operates to restrain the freedom of action of those who buy and sell.\n It was not the purpose or the intent of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law to inhibit the intelligent conduct of business operations, nor do we conceive that its purpose was to suppress such influences as might affect the operations of interstate commerce through the application to them of the individual intelligence of those engaged in commerce, enlightened by accurate information as to the essential elements of the economics of a trade or business, however \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 584]\n\u00a0\n gathered or disseminated. Persons who unite in gathering and disseminating information in trade journals and statistical reports on industry, who gather and publish statistics as to the amount of production of commodities in interstate commerce, and who report market prices, are not engaged in unlawful conspiracies in restraint of trade merely because the ultimate result of their efforts may be to stabilize prices or limit production through a better understanding of economic laws and a more general ability to conform to them, for the simple reason that the Sherman Law neither repeals economic laws nor prohibits the gathering and dissemination of information. Sellers of any commodity who guide the daily conduct of their business on the basis of market reports would hardly be deemed to be conspirators engaged in restraint of interstate commerce. They would not be any the more so merely because they became stockholders in a corporation or joint owners of a trade journal, engaged in the business of compiling and publishing such reports.\n We do not conceive that the members of trade associations become such conspirators merely because they gather and disseminate information, such as is here complained of, bearing on the business in which they are engaged and make use of it in the management and control of their individual businesses; nor do we think that the proper application of the principles of decision of Eastern States Retail Lumber Association v. United States, or American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, or United States v. American Linseed Oil Company, leads to any such result. The court held that the defendants in those cases were engaged in conspiracies against interstate trade and commerce because it was found that the character of the information which had been gathered and the use which was made of it led irresistibly to the conclusion that they had resulted, or would necessarily result, in a concerted effort of the defendants to curtail production or raise \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 585]\n\u00a0\n prices of commodities shipped in interstate commerce. The unlawfulness of the combination arose, not from the fact that the defendants had effected a combination to gather and disseminate information, but from the fact that the court inferred from the peculiar circumstances of each case that concerted action had resulted or would necessarily result in tending arbitrarily to lessen production or increase prices.\n Viewed in this light, can it be said in the present case that the character of the information gathered by the defendants, or the use which is being made of it, leads to any necessary inference that the defendants either have made or will make any different or other use of it than would normally be made if life statistics were published in a trade journal or were published by the Department of Commerce, to which all the gathered statistics are made available. The cost of production, prompt information as to the cost of transprotation, are legitimate subjects of inquiry and knowledge in any industry. So likewise is the production of the commodity in that industry, the aggregate surplus stock, and the prices at which the commodity has actually been sold in the usual course of business.\n We realize that such information, gathered and disseminated among the members of a trade or business, may be the basis of agreement or concerted action to lessen production arbitrarily or to raise prices beyond the levels of production and price which would prevail if no such agreement or concerted action ensued, and those engaged in commerce were left free to base individual initiative on full information of the essential elements of their business. Such concerted action constitutes a restraint of commerce and is illegal and may be enjoined as may any other combiantion or activity necessarily resulting in such concerted action as was the subject of consideration in American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, and United \n\n[268 U.S. 563, 586]\n\u00a0\n States v. American Linseed Oil Co., supra. But in the absence of proof of such agreement or concerted action having been actually reached or actually attempted, under the present plan of operation of defendants we can find no basis in the gathering and dissemination of such information by them or in their activities under their present organization for the inference that such concerted action will necessarily result within the rule laid down in those cases.\n We decide only that trade associations or combinations of persons or corporations which openly and fairly gather and disseminate information as to the cost of their product, the volume of production, the actual price which the product has brought in past transactions, stocks of merchandise on hand, approximate cost of transportation from the principal point of shipment to the points of consumption as did these defendants and who, as they did, meet and discuss such information and statistics without however reaching or attempting to reach any agreement or any concerted action with respect to prices or production or restraining competition, do not thereby engage in unlawful restraint of commerce.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed.\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, Mr. Justice SANFORD, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See a suggestive analysis of the Competitive System by various economists collected and commented on in Marshall's Readings on Industrial Society, 294, 419, 479, 498, 935.

(42 Stat. 147, c. 57), provided for the establishment of the Veterans' Bureau, with 'the functions, powers, and duties conferred by existing law upon the Bureau of War Risk Insurance.' Section 3 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  967 1\/4 b).\n Petitioner was found guilty under an indictment which charged that he unlawfully received fifteen hundred dollars as a fee and compensation for services in preparing and presenting to the United States Veterans' Bureau an affidavit executed by Yetta Cohen in support of her claim \n\n[269 U.S. 93, 101]\n\u00a0\n for insurance money provided for by the act approved October 6, 1917, and amendments thereto. The trial court imposed a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 3 F.(2d) 602.\n It appears that Yetta Cohen retained petitioner, a member of the bar, to press allowance of her claim as a beneficiary designated in a policy issued to her nephew under the War Risk Insurance Act. He corresponded with the Veterans' Bureau, made one trip from New York to Washington where he examined records and interviewed officials, and prepared the necessary papers. It may be assumed that his services were useful and of some substantial value. For them he demanded two thousand dollars and received fifteen hundred. The exceptions raise the questions whether section 13, Act of May 20, 1918, forbids an attorney from charging more than $3 for any services rendered a beneficiary in respect of a claim under the War Risk Insurance Act when no action in court has been instituted, and whether if so construed that section offends the Fifth Amendment.\n Petitioner claims that the inhibition against receiving any sum greater than $3 relates solely to the clerical work of filling out the form or affidavit of claim and does not apply to useful investigation and preparatory work such as he did. He insists that this view is supported by the reports of the committees of the Senate and House of Representatives which recommend passage of the bill, also by a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury, incorporated therein. See S. R. 429 and H. R. 471, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.\n We find no reason which would justify disregard of the plain language of the section under consideration. It declares that any person who receives a fee or compensation in respect of a claim under the act, except as therein provided, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The \n\n[269 U.S. 93, 102]\n\u00a0\n only compensation which it permits a claim agent or attorney to receive where no legal proceeding has been commenced is $3 for assistance in preparation and execution of necessary papers; and the history of the enactment indicates plainly enough that Congress did not fail to choose apt language to express its purpose.\n The validity of section 13, construed as above indicated, we think, is not open to serious doubt.

C., and James Byrne, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to March 1, 1913, Marr and wife purchased 339 shares of the preferred and 425 shares of the common stock of the General Motors Company of New Jersey for $76,400. In 1916, they received in exchange for this stock 451 shares of the preferred and 2,125 shares of the common stock of the General Motors Corporation of Delaware which (including a small cash payment) had the aggregate market value of $400,866.57. The difference between the cost of their stock in the New Jersey corporation and the value of the stock in the Delaware corporation was $324,466.57. The Treasury Department ruled that this difference was gain or income under the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, title 1,  1 and 2, 39 Stat. 756, 757 (Comp. St.  6336a, 6336b); and assessed, on that account, an additional income tax for 1916 which amounted, with interest, to $24,944. 12. That sum Marr paid under protest. He then appealed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by filing a claim for a refund; and, upon the disallowance of that claim, brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. Judgment was entered for the United States. 58 Ct. Cl. 658. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1219).\n The exchange of securities was effected in this way. The New Jersey corporation had outstanding $15,000,000 of 7 per cent. preferred stock and $ 15,000,000 of the common stock; all shares being of the par value of $100. It had accumulated from profits a large surplus. The actual value of the common stock was then $842.50 a share. Its officers caused to be organized the Delaware corporation, with an authorized capital of $20,000,000 in 6 per cent. nonvoting preferred stock and $82,600,000 in common stock; all shares being of the par value of $100. The Delaware corporation made to stockholders in the New \n\n[268 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n Jersey corporation the following offer for exchange of securities: For every share of common stock of the New Jersey corporation, five shares of common stock of the Delaware corporation. For every share of the preferred stock of the New Jersey corporation, one and one-third shares of preferred stock of the Delaware corporation. In lieu of a certificate for fractional shares of stock in the Delaware corporation, payment was to be made in cash at the rate of $100 a share for its preferred and at the rate of $150 a share for its common stock. On this basis all the common stock of the New Jersey corporation was exchanged and all the preferred stock except a few shares. These few were redeemed in cash. For acquiring the stock of the New Jersey corporation only $75,000,000 of the common stock of the Delaware corporation was needed. The remaining $7,600,000 of the authorized common stock was either sold or held for sale as additional capital should be desired. The Delaware corporation, having thus become the owner of all the outstanding stock of the New Jersey corporation, took a transfer of its assets and assumed its liabilities. The latter was then dissolved.\n It is clear that all new securities issued in excess of an amount equal to the capitalization of the New Jersey corporation represented income earned by it; that the new securities received by the Marrs in excess of the cost of the securities of the New Jersey corporation theretofore held were financially the equivalent of $324,466.51 in cash; and that Congress intended to tax as income of stockholders such gains when so distributed. The serious question for decision is whether it had power to do so. Marr contends that, since the new corporation was organized to take over the assets and continue the business of the old, and his capital remained invested in the same business enterprise, the additional securities distributed were in legal effect a stock dividend; and that under the rule of Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, applied in \n\n[268 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n Weiss v. Stearn, \n265 \nU.S. 242\n, 44 S. Ct. 490, 33 A. L. R. 520, he was not taxable thereon as income, because he still held the whole investment. The government insists that identity of the business enterprise is not conclusive; that gain in value resulting from profits is taxable as income, not only when it is represented by an interest in a different business enterprise or property, but also when it is represented by an essentially different interest in the same business enterprise or property; that, in the case at bar, the gain actually made is represented by securities with essentially different characteristics in an essentially different corporation; and that, consequently, the additional value of the new securities, although they are still held by the Marrs, is income under the rule applied in United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156\n, 42 S. Ct. 63; Rockefeller v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 176\n, 42 S. Ct. 68; and Cullinan v. Walker, \n262 \nU.S. 134\n, 43 S. Ct. 495. In our opinion the government is right.\n In each of the five cases named, as in the case at bar, the business enterprise actually conducted remained exactly the same. In United States v. Phellis, in Rockefeller v. United States, and in Cullinan v. Walker, where the additional value in new securities distributed was held to be taxable as income, there had been changes of corporate identity. That is, the corporate property, or a part thereof, was no longer held and operated by the same corporation; and, after the distribution, the stockholders no longer owned merely the same proportional interest of the same character in the same corporation. In Eisner v. Macomber and in Weiss v. Stearn, where the additional value in new securities was held not to be taxable, the identity was deemed to have been preserved. In Eisner v. Macomber the identity was literally maintained. There was no new corporate entity. The same interest in the same corporation was represented after the distribution by more shares of precisely the same character. It was as if the par value of the stock had been \n\n[268 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n reduced, and three shares of reduced par value stock had been issued in place of every two old shares. That is, there was an exchange of certificates but not of interests. In Weiss v. Stearn a new corporation had, in fact, been organized to take over the assets and business of the old. Technically there was a new entity; but the corporate identity was deemed to have been substantially maintained because the new corporation was organized under the laws of the same state, with presumably the same powers as the old. There was also no change in the character of securities issued. By reason of these facts, the proportional interest of the stockholder after the distribution of the new securities was deemed to be exactly the same as if the par value of the stock in the old corporation had been reduced, and five shares of reduced par value stock had been issued in place of every two shares of the old stock. Thus, in Weiss v. Stearn, as in Eisner v. Macomber, the transaction was considered, in essence, an exchange of certificates representing the same interest, not an exchange of interests.\n In the case at bar, the new corporation is essentially different from the old. A corporation organized under the laws of Delaware does not have the same rights and powers as one organized under the laws of New Jersey. Because of these inherent differences in rights and powers, both the preferred and the common stock of the old corporation is an essentially different thing from stock of the same general kind in the new. But there are also adventitious differences, substantial in character. A 6 per cent. nonvoting preferred stock is an essentially different thing from a 7 per cent. voting preferred stock. A common stock subject to the priority of $ 20,000,000 preferred and a $1,200,000 annual dividend charge is an essentially different thing from a common stock subject only to $15,000, 000 preferred and a $1,050,000 annual dividend charge. The case at bar is not one in which after the \n\n[268 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n distribution the stockholders have the same proportional interest of the same kind in essentially the same corporation.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n We think this cause falls within the doctrine of Weiss v. Stearn, \n265 \nU.S. 242\n, 44 S. Ct. 490, 33 A. L. R. 520, and that the judgment below should be reversed. The practical result of the things done was but the reorganization of a going concern. The business and assets were not materially changed, and the stockholder received nothing actually severed from his original capital interest-nothing differing in substance from what he already had.\n Weiss v. Stearn did not turn upon the relatively unimportant circumstance that the new and old corporations were organized under the laws of the same state, but upon the approved definition of income from capital as something severed therefrom and received by the taxpayer for his separate use and benefit. Here stockholders got nothing from the old business or assets except new statements of their undivided interests, and this, as we carefully pointed out, is not enough to create taxable income. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATTHEWS v. HUWE(1925)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Mortimer Mattews, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Charles S. Bell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Marianna Matthews owns one tract of land, and Mortimer Matthews five others, in Hamilton county, Ohio. They lie within half a mile of section X of the Glendale \n\n[269 U.S. 262, 263]\n\u00a0\n and Milford road. The plaintiffs brought suits under section 12075 of the General Code of Ohio, providing that common pleas courts may enjoin the illegal levy or collection of taxes and assessments, to enjoin the county treasurer, the defendant in error, from collecting assessments made and levied on these lands for the cost of the improvement of section X. Among other grounds for the petitions were allegations that the proceedings to assess were in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution, in that they took away property from the plaintiffs without due process of law. In the common pleas court the injunctions were sustained to the extent of soem interest found to be excessive, but were denied in other respects. Appeals were taken to the Court of Appeals of Hamilton county, which affirmed the decrees of the common pleas court. Appeals as of right were then prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the state, based on the ground that the cases involved constitutional questions. The Supreme Court made the following order in each case:\n'Dec. 27, 1923. ... This cause came on to be heard upon the transcript of the record of the Court of Appeals of Hamilton county, and it appearing to the court that this cause was filed as of right, and that the record presents no debatable constitutional question, it is ordered that the petition in error be, and the same hereby is dismissed.\n\n'It is further ordered that defendant in error recover from the plaintiff in error his costs herein expended, taxed at $_____.'\n\n Thereupon writs of error were applied for and allowed not to the Supreme Court of Ohio, but to the Court of Appeals. Motions are now made to dismiss the writs.\n We think the motions must be granted. In Hetrick v. Village of Lindsey, \n265 \nU.S. 384\n, 44 S. Ct. 486, Hetrick brought suit \n\n[269 U.S. 262, 264]\n\u00a0\n under the same section of the Ohio Code to enjoin the illegal collection of a special assessment. The injunction was denied in the common pleas court and in the Court of Appeals, on appeal. The plaintiff filed a petition in error in the Supreme Court of the state. The defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that no leave to file it had been granted. The plaintiff claimed that no leave was necessary under the Ohio practice, because the case involved a question under the Constitution of the United States, and the appeal was of right. The court sustained the motion to dismiss, on the ground that the statute whose validity was attacked had been so long held constitutional by the courts of the state that it could no longer be questioned. A writ of error to bring the case here was allowed by the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and entertained by this court. That case is exactly like this except as to the court to which the writ of error was directed.\n The plaintiffs in error rely on the case of Norfolk & Suburban Turnpike Co. v. Commonwealth of Virginia, \n225 \nU.S. 264\n, 32 S. Ct. 282, and the rule laid down by Chief Justice White, in which the said (at page 269 (32 S. Ct. 830)):\n'For the purpose of avoiding the complexity and doubt which must continue to recur, and for the guidance of suitors in the future, we now state that, from and after the opening of the next term of this court, where a writ of error is prosecuted to an alleged judgment or a decree of a court of last resort of a state declining to allow a writ of error to or an appeal from a lower state court, unless it plainly appears, on the face of the record, by an affirmance in express terms of the judgment or decree sought to be reviewed, that the refusal of the court to allow an appeal or writ of error was the exercise by it of jurisdiction to review the case upon the merits, we shall consider ourselves selves constrained to apply the rule announced in the Crovo Case (\n220 \nU.S. 364\n, 31 S. Ct. 399), and shall, therefore, by not departing from \n\n[269 U.S. 262, 265]\n\u00a0\n the face of the record, solve against jurisdiction the ambiguity created by the form in which the state court has expressed its action.'\n\n Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Crovo, \n220 \nU.S. 364, 366\n, 31 S. Ct. 399, was a Virginia case, in which a writ of error was denied by the Supreme Court of Appeals under a local practice, because the court thought 'the judgment was plainly right.' The law and equity court, that is the lower court, was held to be the highest court of the state to which the case could be carried, and the writ of error from this court to that court was sustained, a federal question being properly saved.\n We think, however, that in these cases, as in the Hetrick Case, on the face of the record the state Supreme Court did pass on the merits of the case by holding that the questions involving the Constitution of the United States, and being the only ground for a writ of error from this court, were not debatable. It is one of those not infrequent cases in which decision of the merits of the case also determines jurisdiction. The petition was dismissed, not because the court was really without jurisdiction, for it could have taken it, but because the question was regarded as frivolous, which is a different thing from finding that the petition was not in character one which the court could consider.\n Another reason why the motions to dismiss should be granted, even if the foregoing conclusion were wrong, is that the plaintiffs in error did not exhaust all their remedies for review by the Supreme Court of the state. After their petitions for writs of error as of right were denied, they had under the Ohio practice the right to apply to the Supreme Court in its discretion for writs of certiorari to bring the cases to that court for its consideration. No such application was made.\n In Stratton v. Stratton, \n239 \nU.S. 55\n, 36 S. Ct. 26, another Ohio case, a writ of error was directed to the Court of Appeals to \n\n[269 U.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n reverse a judgment of that court. on the ground that it was the highest court in which a decision in the suit could be had. It was held, however, that as the Supreme Court by the Constitution of the state had authority to review the judgments and decrees of the Courts of Appeal by certiorari and no application had been made therefor, the Court of Appeals could not be considered the court of last resort and a writ of error from this court to that would not lie. The same view was taken in Andrews v. Virginian Railway Co., \n248 \nU.S. 272\n, 39 S. Ct. 101. The plaintiffs in error are thus in a dilemma from which they cannot escape. If the Supreme Court by final decree disposed of the constitutional questions on the merits by dismissal of the petition, then the writ of error lay to the Supreme Court. If it did not, then the decree of the Court of Appeals did not become that of the highest court to which a writ of error would lie from this court for lack of application for certiorari.\n Writs of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAY v. HENDERSON(1925)\nNo. 126\nArgued: March 5, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. A. Jacobs and Henry G. W. Dinkelspiel, both of San Franchisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. A. De Ligne, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE DELIVERED THE OPINION of the Court.\n This is a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review its action (reported as Henderson v. May, 289 F. 192) on a petition to revise an order of the District Court confirming the order of a referee in bankruptcy, summarily directing the respondents to pay over a sum of money to the trustee in bankruptcy.\n On September 15, 1920, prior to, but within four months of, the filing of the petition, the bankrupt made to respondents, Henderson and Scannell, a general assignment for the benefit of creditors. At the time of the assignment the assignor was indebted on a promissory note in the sum of $15,000 to the Ft. Sutter National Bank, of which respondent Henderson was president, and in which the assignor carried a deposit account. The referee found, on sufficient evidence, that the respondents accepted the trust under the assignment to them and continued the business of the assignor until the appointment of the receiver in bankruptcy on November 4, 1920; the petition in bankruptcy having been filed on October 9, 1920. In the meantime the deposit account of the assignor with the bank, with the knowledge and assent of the assignees, was changed from the name of the assignor to the names of the assignees, as 'trustees,' and further deposits were from time to time made by them to the \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n credit of the account, in the course of their management of the business of the assignor. The assignor was duly adjudicated a bankrupt, and thereafter the trustee in bankruptcy petitioned the bankruptcy court for an order directing the respondents, as assignees, to account for and pay over all moneys received by them from the date of the assignment to the date of the appointment of the receiver. Proceedings on the petition resulted in the order of the District Court, directing respondents to pay over to the trustee an amount which would have stood to the credit of the assignees in their deposit account with the bank, had the account not been closed in the following manner:\n On September 30, 1920, 10 days before the filing of the petition, the deposit account of the assignees with the bank was debited with the sum of $ 4,516.43, which amount was credited on the note of the bankrupt held by the bank, and on October 13, 1920, subsequent to the filing of the petition and on various dates thereafter to and including October 25, 1920, further debits were made in the account which were credited on the note. These credits, including the first mentioned, amounted to the sum of $12, 883,81, which was the amount directed to be paid over by respondents by order of the District Court. These debits and credits were made by direction of the respondent Henderson, who throughout the period in question acted as one of the assignees and was also president of the bank. Although there was no explicit finding on the subject the debits appear to have been made with the tacit assent of Scannell, the other assignee, who in any event appears to have left the management of the financial operations of the assignees to Henderson, and made no objection or protest with respect to this use of the account standing to his credit as an assignee. We think that the finding of the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n that this application of the bank deposit on the note of the bankrupt constituted a 'partial payment of the note as fully as if the assignees had given their check or withdrawn the money from the bank and paid it over the counter' is correct, and that both the assignees must be held legally responsible for this result. Where one of two cotrustees assents to a breach of trust by the other without objection, he is legally chargeable with liability for the breach. Bermingham v. Wilcox, 120 Cal. 467, 472, 52 P. 822; Adair v. Brimmer, 74 N. Y. 539; Matter of Niles, 113 N. Y. 548, 21 N. E. 687; Hill v. Hill, 79 N. J. Eq. 521, 82 A. 338.\n The referee found that respondent Henderson was at all times from September 24, 1920, until the appointment of the receiver in bankruptcy, in control of the assignee's deposit account, and that he was the only officer of the bank who at any time exercised any control over the account, and that as president of the bank he at all times, and until the filing of the referee's report, had personal control of the funds deposited in the account; that the original ledger sheet of the bank, showing the account standing in the names of the respondents as assignees, was destroyed by officials of the bank some time after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and then an attempt was made to restore this account to the name of the bankrupt by rewriting the ledger sheets. He also found that on and after September 24, 1920, both the respondents and the Ft. Sutter National Bank, which with respondents had on that date executed the creditors' agreement under which the assignment to respondents for the benefit of creditors was made, had actual knowledge of the insolvent condition of the bankrupt.\n On the petition to revise, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that, when the money on deposit with the bank was applied on the note of the bankrupt, 'the money passed into the possession and under the control of the bank, and out of the possession and beyond the control of the respondents; \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n ... that the funds in the bank are not the funds of the president, nor are they subject to his order and control, and an order directing him to pay over the money is not an order against the bank, and is not binding upon the bank.' The court accordingly held that the bank, which was not a party to this proceeding, held the funds received by it in its own right adversely to any claim of the assignees or the trustee in bankruptcy, and could not be reached by a summary proceeding, and it reversed the judgment and order of the District Court.\n It is well settled that property or money held adversely to the bankrupt can only be recovered in a plenary suit and not by a summary proceeding in a bankruptcy court. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18\n, 22 S. Ct. 293; First National Bank of Chicago v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., \n198 \nU.S. 280\n, 25 S. Ct. 693; Galbraith v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46\n, 41 S. Ct. 415. But property held or acquired by others for account of the bankrupt is subject to a summary order of the court which may direct an accounting and a payment over to the trustee or receiver appointed by the bankruptcy court.

Vallely, supra, where, however, the jurisdiction was defeated by the adverse claim of the assignee arising before the filing of the petition. And see Randolph v. Scruggs, \n190 \nU.S. 533\n, 23 S. Ct. 710, as to the nature of the title of the assignee for the benefit of creditors when bankruptcy ensues. See, also, Taubel, etc., Co. v. Fox, \n264 U.S. 426\n, 433 and note, 44 S. Ct. 396. Courts of bankruptcy do not permit themselves to be \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n ousted of jurisdiction by the mere assertion of an adverse claim. The court has jurisdiction to inquire into the claim for the purpose of ascertaining whether the summary remedy is an appropriate one within the principles of decision here stated. Mueller v. Nugent, supra; Schweer v. Brown, 130 F. 328, 64 C. C. A. 574; Id., \n195 \nU.S. 171\n, 25 S. Ct. 15; Hebert v. Crawford, \n228 \nU.S. 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 484; In re Ellis Bros. Printing Co. (D. C.) 156 F. 430. It may disregard the assertion that the claim is adverse, if on the undisputed facts it appears to be merely colorable. In re Weinger, Bergman & Co. (D. C.) 126 F. 875; In re Rudnick & Co. (D. C.) 158 F. 223; In re Ransford, 194 F. 658, 115 C. C. A. 560; In re Michaelis & Lindeman (D. C.) 196 F. 718.\n The petition upon which this proceeding was initiated was in the usual form and prayed that the respondents be required to account for all moneys and properties coming into their hands as assignees or trustees under the assignment for the benefit of creditors. Such was their duty. Having assumed to take possession of the property of the bankrupt for its account, it was their legal duty to turn the property or its proceeds over to the trustee in bankruptcy or to account for their inability to do so by showing either a disposition of it in performance of a legal duty assumed toward the bankrupt or the bankrupt's trustee or by clothing themselves with the protection of a claim adverse to the bankrupt which was not merely colorable. As found by the court, respondents came into the possession of moneys of the bankrupt which were by them placed on deposit to their credit as trustees or assignees for the benefit of creditors. The result of this transaction was that neither the bank nor the assignees held any specific money for account of the bankrupt and his creditors. They were creditors of the bank and the bank was their debtor. Marine Bank v. Fulton Bank, 2 Wall. 262; Phoenix Bank v. Risley, \n111 \nU.S. 125\n, 4 S. Ct. 322. We are not therefore dealing with money in the possession \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n of the assignees or the bank in any literal sense, but the credit as a mere chose in action was held by the assignees for account of the bankrupt and they were bound to account for its property disposition as for any other property coming into their hands.\n The several amounts debited to the account, with the assent or connivance of the assignee subsequent to the filing of the petition, fall clearly within the rule that as to property in the hands of the bankrupt, or held by others for his account, 'the filing of the petition is a caveat to all the world and in effect an attachment and injunction.' Mueller v. Nugent, supra; Lazarus v. Prentice, \n234 \nU.S. 263\n, 34 S. Ct. 851; Knapp & Spencer Co. v. Drew, 160 F. 413, 87 C. C. A. 365; In re Denson (D. C.) 195 F. 854; In re Leigh (D.

A. 233; and see Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lum. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 301\n, 32 S. Ct. 96. See Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 \nU.S. 102\n, 30 S. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969. In consequence, any person acquiring an interest in property of the bankrupt or his assignees for the benefit of creditors adverse to the creditors, after the filing of a petition with notice of it, may be directed to surrender the property thus acquired by summary order of the bankruptcy court. In re Denson, supra; In re Rudnick, supra; and see White v. Schloerb, supra.\n The rule is the same when a creditor secures payment of his debt from the bankrupt's estate after the filing of the petition. A summary order may be made directing repayment of the money to the trustee in bankruptcy. Knapp & Spencer Co. v. Drew; In re Leigh; Matter of R. & W. Skirt Co., supra; In re Columbia Shoe Co. (C. C. A.) 289 F. 465. A like rule has been applied where a bank secures payment of its debt by setting up its lien or right of counterclaim against a deposit account of the bankrupt or the bankrupt's assignee, created subsequent to the filing \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n of the petition. In re Michaelis Lindeman (D. C.) 196 F. 718; Reed v. Barnett Nat. Bank, supra. See Farmers' & Mechanics' Bank v. Wilkinson, Trustee, \n266 \nU.S. 503\n, 45 S. Ct. 144, 69 L. Ed. --. Any other rule would leave the bankruptcy court powerless to deal in an effective way with those holding property for the bankrupt who, pending the bankruptcy proceedings, willfully dispose of it by placing it beyond the reach of the court. Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 \nU.S. 188, 196\n, 21 S. Ct. 557.\n We do not think, however, that respondents stand in any better position with respect to the first debit of $4,516.43 which was made a few days before the filing of the petition. The creditors' agreement, under which respondents were appointed assignees, and which was signed by them and by the Sutter National Bank, provided for only a pro rata distribution among creditors and expressly extended the time of payment of all indebtedness of the bankrupt for one year from the date of the creditors' agreement, which was dated September 15, 1920. The findings of the referee and the supporting evidence leave no doubt that Henderson, who with the assent of the coassignee, Scannell, was in active control of the account both as an assignee for the benefit of creditors and for the bank as its president, directed this and all later debits to be made in the account, in fraud of the rights of creditors whom he assumed to represent.\n There cannot, we think, be any pretense that the bank could assert a lien or counterclaim before the filing of the petition, in the face of its extension of its note by the creditors' agreement (Fifth National Bank v. Lyttle, 250 F. 361, 162 C. C. A. 431; Heyman v. Third National Bank [D. C.] 216 F. 685), or at any time, in view of its transfer of the account to trustees for the benefit of creditors under the agreement signed by it ( Fitzgerald v. Bank, 64 Minn. 469, 67 N. W. v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46\n, 41 S. Ct. 415, 65 L. The findings of the referee and the evidence leave no doubt that the surrender or abandonment of their bank account to the bank by the assignees \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n and its attempted application by the bank to the payment of its note was collusive and without any substantial basis of legal right. At most it was a clumsy, ineffectual, and fraudulent effort to divert the funds of the bankrupt to the payment of a favored creditor. While it is now settled that the claim of an assignee for the benefit of creditors, of the right to charge in his account expenses incurred or expenditures made prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, is an adverse claim which cannot be adjudicated in a summary proceeding (Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18\n, 22 S. Ct. 293; Galbraith v. Valley, \n256 \nU.S. 46\n, 41 S. Ct. 415), we think the rule cannot be extended to a case such as this where the claim is merely colorable and on its face made in bad faith and without any legal justification.\n Nor is it any answer to such a proceeding that the diverted assets are no longer under the control of the assignees. They do not discharge the duty to account by showing that they assented to a cancellation of their bank account as assignees, and its application on an indebtedness of the bankrupt to the bank. The duty of a fiduciary to account for property intrusted to his care is fulfilled by delivery of the property, but, if he has put it out of his power to deliver it, he may nevertheless be compelled to account for its worth. United States v. Dunn et al. (No. 120, October Term, 1924) \n268 \nU.S. 121\n, 45 S. Ct. 451, 69 L. Ed. --, decided April 13, 1925. He is subject to the summary order of the bankruptcy court to restore the property to the bankrupt's estate. If he has sold it or mingled it with his own, he may be compelled by summary order to restore the value of the property thus wrongfully diverted. In re Denson, supra. And see Bryan v. Bernheimer, supra, at page 197 (21 S. Ct. 557).\n For that reason it is not necessary for us to inquire into the legal consequences which to show that the bank account was at all to show that the bank account ws at all times under the control of Henderson, acting in \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n the dual capacity of assignee of the debtor and president of the creditor bank, or to ascertain whether such a situation falls within the rule that one acting in one capacity, subject to a summary order of the court, may not relieve himself from the duty to pay over money on a summary order by setting up, that although the money is still under his control, he holds it in a different capacity. See Smith v. Longbottom & Sons (D. C.) 142 F. 291. We rest our decision rather on the duty of assignees for the benefit of creditors to account in a summary proceeding for the property which they have received within four months of the bankruptcy and to make restitution of the value of the property of the bankrupt which they have dissipated without a colorable claim of right.\n On the argument, respondents relied upon numerous cases in the District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals to the effect that the court will not in a summary proceeding make an order requiring a bankrupt to pay over money to his trustee unless the bankrupt's ability to comply therewith is plainly and affirmatively shown. American Trust Co. v. Wallis, 126 F. 464, 61 C. C. A. 342; In re Berman (D. C.) 165 F. 383; In re Sax (D. C.) 141 F. 223; In re Goldfarb Brothers (D. C.) 131 F. 643; Epstein v. Steinfeld, 210 F. 236, 127 C. C. A. 54; In re Nisenson (D. C.) 182 F. 912; In re Stern (D. C.) 215 F. 979. But we think that a bankrupt who is shown to have turned over generally his assets and property to the receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy, is in a different situation from one not a bankrupt who is under a duty to account in a summary proceeding. A court of bankruptcy should not make useless orders. If the bankrupt has turned over his property generally to the bankruptcy court, and is not shown to possess or control the specific property which is the subject of summary order, there may be a presumption that any order will be groundless. No such presumption obtains with respect to respondents. They have not shown that they are insolvent or in other \n\n[268 U.S. 111, 121]\n\u00a0\n respects are unable to comply with the order of the District Court.\n The judgment of the District Court was proper. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCAUGHN v. LUDINGTON(1925)\nNo. 733\nArgued: January 12, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. D. Guthrie, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises under the income tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918,1 and presents another aspect of the question relating to deductible losses sustained from the sale of property acquired before March 1, 1913, which was involved in United States v. Flannery (No. 527) \n268 \nU.S. 98\n, 45 S. Ct. 420, 69 L. Ed. --, just decided.\n Ludington bought, prior to March 1, 1913, certain corporate stock for $ 32,500. Its market value on March 1, 1913, was $37,050. He sold it in 1919 for $3,866.91, which was $28,633.09 less than its purchase price, and $33, 183.09 \n\n[268 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n less than its market value on March 1, 1913. In his income tax return he deducted the latter sum as the amount of his loss on the sale of the stock. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue reduced the amount of the deduction to the actual loss of $28,633.09, and assessed an additional tax against him. He paid this tax under protest, and, after the usual preliminary procedure, brought this suit against the Collector in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania to recover the amount so paid. Judgment was entered for the defendant. 290 F. 604. This was reversed by the Court of Appeals. 1 F. (2d) 689. And this writ of certiorari was granted. \n266 \nU.S. 599\n, 45 S. Ct. 127, 69 L. Ed. --.\n The case is governed by the decision in United States v. Flannery, supra. It was there held, on the authority of Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S. Ct. 390, and Walsh v. Brewster, \n255 \nU.S. 536\n, 41 S. Ct. 392, that the Act allowed a deduction to the extent only that an actual loss was sustained from the investment, as measured by the difference between the purchase and sale prices of the property. It follows that as the actual loss to Ludington in the entire transaction was the difference between the purchase and selling prices, that is, $28,633.09, he was only entitled to deduct this amount, and not the difference of $33,183.09 between the market value on March 1, 1913, and the selling price. This is in exact correspondence with the decision in Walsh v. Brewster, supra, in reference to the second transaction there involved, in which it was held that the taxable gain derived from the sale of property was only the difference between the purchase and selling prices, and not the difference between the market value on March 1, 1913, and the selling price.\n So under the Income Tax Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 60,  350- 385), which, as pointed out in United States v. Flannery, is a substantial transcript of the Revenue Act of 1918, except that January 1, 1919, is substituted for March 1, 1913, it was \n\n[268 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n specifically held, in a case precisely similar to the present, that the loss deductible by the taxpayer was limited to the difference between the purchase and selling prices, although on January 1, 1919, the property had a higher value than when it was purchased, and the loss if computed from that date would have been greater than when computed from the purchase price.

Spangler, both of Bellefonte, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases involve the same proceedings which were before us at an earlier stage in Meek v. Centre Banking Co., \n264 \nU.S. 499\n, 44 S. Ct. 366. They arose out of a petition in bankruptcy filed by the respondent Shugert in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania for the adjudication as bankrupts (a) of himself, (b) of a partnership styled the Centre County Banking Co., in which he and the present petitioners, Meek, Dale and Breeze, hereinafter called the defendants, were alleged to be members, and (c) of the defendants individually. The defendants resisted the petition in so far as it sought to have the partnership and themselves adjudged bankrupts, and moved to dismiss it to that extent. Orders denying these motions were entered by the District Court; and these, on petitions to revise, were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 292 F. 116. Writs of certiorari were then granted. \n263 \nU.S. 696\n, 44 S. Ct. 39. \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter, but before the hearing in this court, Shugert died. The defendants then moved in this court that the proceeding in bankruptcy be dismissed as to them, both individually and as members of the partnership, on the ground that to that extent it abated by Shugert's death. Finding the petition to be in this aspect an involuntary and antagonistic proceeding, and there being then no adversary party before the court, we granted leave to any persons claiming to be representatives of Shugert's interest to appear within thirty days and apply for leave to be admitted as parties for the purpose of continuing the proceeding in his stead; stating that if this were done the question whether the proceeding should be dismissed as to the partnership and the defendants, or continued as to them by such representatives, would then be determined. Meek v. Centre County Bank, supra, page 504 (44 S. Ct. 366). Thereafter the administrator of Shugert's estate seasonably appeared and applied for leave to be substituted in Shugert's place as the petitioner in the bankruptcy proceeding. The defendants renewed their motions to dismiss; and the cases have been heard both on this preliminary issue and on the merits of the controversy.\n The first question to be determined is whether Shugert's death before an adjudication had been made under the petition, abated the bankruptcy proceeding as against the partnership and the individual defendants, or whether it may be continued against them by the administrator of his estate. When either of the parties in any suit in any court of the United States dies before final judgment, the executor or administrator of such deceased party may, in case the cause of action survives by law, prosecute or defend the suit to final judgment. Rev. Stat.  955 (Comp. St.  1592). In Schreiber v. Sharpless, \n110 \nU.S. 76, 80\n, 3 S. Ct. 423, a suit on a federal penal statute, in which the defendant had died before judgment, it was held that whether an action survives and may be continued under this section 'depends \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n on the substance of the cause of action'; and that, since at common law actions on penal statutes do not survive and Congress had not established any other rule in respect to actions on federal penal statutes, the cause of action died with the person of the defendant and the suit could not be continued against his personal representative. We do not think, however, that the doctrine of this case applies to an involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy.\n Such a proceeding, not being in the nature of a common-law action, is not abated by any rule of the common law. And while there is no express provision in the Bankruptcy Act1 that the cause of action survives the death of a petitioner before adjudication, we think that such survivorship accords with the 'substance of the cause of action' and the nature and purpose of a proceeding in bankruptcy, which is not a mere personal action, but is essentially in the nature of a proceeding in rem for the benefit of all the defendant's creditors. And the filing of the petition brings his property into custodia legis, with a view to a determination of his status and the settlement and distribution of his estate. Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 32 S. Ct. 96; Lazarus v. Prentice, \n234 \nU.S. 263, 266\n, 34 S. Ct. 851. We conclude that an administrative proceeding of this character, in which the property of the defendant is impounded for the benefit of all of his creditors, does not abate because of the death of the petitioner before adjudication and that its prosecution may be continued by his personal representative. The motions of the defendants to dismiss the proceeding by reason of Shugert's death are accordingly denied; and the administrator is granted leave to be substituted as the petitioner in the proceeding and to prosecute it in his stead.\n\n 2. \nThis brings us to the consideration, on the merits, of the motions made by the defendants in the District \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n Court to dismiss Shugert's petition in so far as it sought the adjudication of the partnership and of themselves as bankrupts. The petition combined, in an anomalous and modified fashion, a 'debtor's petition' and a 'partnership petition' (Bankruptcy Forms, Nos. 1 and 2), with other averments. In it Shugert alleged that the partnership was insolvent and owed debts in excess of $1,000; that each of the partners was insolvent and they were unable, jointly or severally, to pay the partnership debts; that he and the partnership were willing to surrender their property for the benefit of their creditors and desired to obtain the benefits of the bankruptcy law; and that the defendants had not offered to join in the petition and he was not informed of their intention in the matter. It did not allege that either the partnership or the defendants had committed any act of bankruptcy. The prayer was that Shugert, the partnership, and the defendants individually, be adjudged bankrupt; that process be served upon the defendants; and that proceedings be had as provided by the bankruptcy law and General Order No. 8.\n The defendants, who appeared specially, moved to dismiss the petition as against the partnership and themselves on the grounds, among others, that it was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Act and that the court had no authority under it to adjudge either the partnership or non-consenting partners bankrupt. \n2\n The orders of the District Court denying these motions were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the petition was maintainable under section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St .  9589) and General Order No. 8.\n Section 5a of the Bankruptcy Act specifically provides that--\n'A partnership, during the continuation of the partnership business, or after its dissolution and before the \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n final settlement thereof, may be adjudged a bankrupt.'\n\n There hence can be no doubt that a partnership may be adjudged a bankrupt as a distinct legal entity. But since the Act does not specify when it may be adjudged a bank rupt, to determine this question reference must be had to the general provisions of the Act, in which, in accordance with section 1(19), being Comp. St.  9585, the word 'persons' is to be construed as including 'partnerships.' The Act makes provision for only two kinds of petitions upon which a person may be adjudged bankrupt; one, a voluntary petition filed by him; the other, an involuntary petition filed against him by creditors. As to the first, it is provided that any qualified person, except certain specified corporations, may file a petition to be adjudged a voluntary bankrupt, sections 4, 59a (sections 9588, 9643); and as to the second, that creditors having provable claims of a specified amount against an insolvent debtor who has committed an act of bankruptcy within the preceding four months, may file a petition to have him adjudged a bankrupt, sections 3b, 59b (sections 9587, 9643).3 As there is no other provision authorizing the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, it necessarily results that there is no authority under the Act to adjudge a partnership bankrupt except upon its own voluntary petition or upon an involuntary petition filed against it by creditors; and none to make such an adjudication upon a petition filed against it by one of its members.\n There is nothing in section 5c of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9589), upon which the administrator relies, that has any application to this question. It merely provides that the court of bankruptcy which has jurisdiction of one of the partners may have jurisdiction of all the partners and of the administration of the partnership and individual property; \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n that is, it goes solely to the question of venue or jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court with reference to its territorial limits. See section 2 ( section 9586). And the decision in Francis v. McNeal, \n228 \nU.S. 695\n, 33 S. Ct. 701, L. R. A. 1915E, 706, only involved the question whether in a bankruptcy proceeding in which a partnership had been adjudged bankrupt under an involuntary petition filed against it by creditors, the court might administer the separate estate of a partner who had not been adjudged bankrupt individually.\n It is clear that the present petition cannot be sustained as the voluntary petition of the partnership for its own adjudication in bankruptcy. It was filed and signed by Shugert alone, as the sole petitioner. It did not purport to be filed by the partnership, and was not signed by it or in its behalf. And while there was an incidental averment that the partnership desired to obtain the benefit of the bankruptcy law, there was no allegation that this statement was authorized by the partnership. On the contrary it was shown that the other partners had not joined in the petition and that their intention in reference to the matter was not known. In short, the petition was framed as an involuntary petition against the partnership and its non-consenting members, and its sufficiency must be tested as such. We are therefore not called upon to determine whether a voluntary petition filed in the name of the partnership by one member of the firm purporting to act in its behalf, could be sustained without an affirmative showing that it was filed at the instance or with the consent of the other partners.\n It is also clear that the petition cannot be sustained as an involuntary petition filed against the partnership under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, since it was not filed by creditors, the only persons authorized to file such a petition, and furthermore did not allege that the partnership had committed an act of bankruptcy.\n It is earnestly insisted, however, that the right of a partner to file such a petition against the partnership is \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n recognized by General Order in Bankruptcy No. 8. This General Order provides that any member of a partnership who refuses to join in a petition to have the partnership declared bankrupt shall be entitled to resist the petition in the same manner as if it had been filed by a creditor of the partnership; that notice shall be given to him as in the case of a debtor petitioned against; that he shall have the right to appear at the hearings and make proof that the partnership is not insolvent and has not committed an act of bankruptcy, and make all defences which any debtor proceeded against might make; and that if an adjudication of bankruptcy is made upon the petition, such partner shall file a schedule of his debts and inventory of his property as required in cases of debtors against whom an adjudication is made. 172 U. S., Appendix, p. 656. It is supplemented by Bankruptcy Form No. 2, providing for a petition by less than all the members of a firm, alleging that they and the other partners owe debts which they are unable to pay in full, and that the petitioners desire to obtain the benefit of the Bankruptcy Act; and praying that the firm be adjudged bankrupt. 172 U. S., Appendix, p. 679.\n It is clear that this General Order and Form contemplate that less than all the members of a partnership may file a petition for its adjudication as a bankrupt, without alleging either that it is insolvent or that it has committed an act of bankruptcy, and that any member of the partnership who refuses to join in the petition may resist it in the same manner as if the petition had been filed by a creditor. In seeking to have the partnership adjudged bankrupt as against the non-consenting partners resisting such an adjudication, it is manifestly an involuntary proceeding. Meek v. Centre County Bank, supra, page 502 (44 S. Ct. 366).\n The question of the effect of this General Order and Form are now for the first time presented to this court for determination. \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n The authority conferred upon this court by section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9614) to prescribe all necessary rules, forms and orders as to procedure and for carrying the Act into effect, is plainly limited to provisions for the execution of the Act itself, and does not authorize additions to its substantive provisions. West Co. v. Lea, \n174 \nU.S. 590, 599\n, 19 S. Ct. 836. And see Orcutt Co. v. Green, \n204 \nU.S. 96, 102\n, 27 S. Ct. 195.\n General Order No. 8 was evidently taken from a like general order under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517), of which it is in the main transcript; and Form No. 2 is largely a copy of a corresponding form prescribed under said earlier Act. \n4\n The Act of 1867, however, while not providing that a partnership could be adjudged a bankrupt as a separate entity, expressly provided that its property should be taken and administered in cases 'where two or more persons who are partners in trade shall be adjudged bankrupt, either on the petition of such partners, or any one of them, or on the petition of any creditor of the partners.' 14 Stat. 517, c. 176,  36. The former general order and form were, therefore, appropriate methods of procedure for carrying into effect the provision as to petitions by one of the partners. In the present Act, however, there is no corresponding provision for adjudging a partnership bankrupt or administering its property upon the petition of one of the partners. General Order No. 8 and Form No. 2, in purporting to authorize one or less than all of the partners to file a petition against the partnership without the consent of the others, do not relate to the execution of any of the provisions of the Act itself; and therefore are without statutory warrant and of no effect.\n We conclude that Shugert's petition was not maintainable against the partnership. And, a fortiori, it was not \n\n[268 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n maintainable as an involuntary petition against the non-consenting partners individually.\n The motions made by the defendants in the District Court to dismiss the petition as against the partnership and themselves individually should have been granted. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544 (Comp.

Bramhall, of Washington, D.

It issued a policy November 16, 1919, to Frank Coron, thus to indemnify him in the operation of his automobile truck to the extent of $5,000, together with interest and costs. The policy contained a provision, inserted pursuant to the requirement of section 109 of the Insurance Law of New York. Laws 1919, c. 182. The section reads as follows:\n'On and after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and eighteen, no policy of insurance against loss \n\n[267 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n or damage resulting from accident to or injury suffered by an employee or other person and for which the person insured is liable, or, against loss or damage to property caused by horses or by any vehicle drawn, propelled or operated by any motive power, and for which loss or damage the person insured is liable, shall be issued or delivered to any person in this state by any corporation, ... authorized to do business in this state, unless there shall be contained within such policy a provision that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the person insured shall not release the insurance carrier from the payment of damages for injury sustained or loss occasioned during the life of such policy, and stating that in case execution against the insured is returned unsatisfied in an action brought by the injured, or his or her personal representative in case death results from the accident, because of such insolvency or bankruptcy, that then an action may be maintained by the injured person, or his or her personal representative, against such corporation under the terms of the policy for the amount of the judgment in the said action not exceeding the amount of the policy.'\n\n Smart was injured by the truck of Coron. He brought suit against Coron for damages and recovered a judgment for $11,000. He issued execution against Coron upon the judgment, which was returned unsatisfied, and supplemental proceedings were undertaken against him without success.\n The Supreme Court of the state held that on the record Coron was insolvent, that under the clause of the policy embodying the provision of section 109 the action lay, and because of a failure to set up any good defense a summary judgment was entered for $5,000 and interest and costs in favor of Smart against the company.\n The case has been brought here by the company under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214), upon the claim that section 109 is invalid, first, in that it deprives the insurance \n\n[267 U.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n company of its property without due process of law; and, second, because it is in conflict with the bankruptcy laws of the United States. It is well settled that the business of insurance is of such a peculiar character, affects so many people, and is so intimately connected with the common good, that the state creating insurance corporations and giving them authority to engage in that business may, without transcending the limits of legislative power, regulate their affairs, so far, at least, as to prevent them from committing wrongs or injustice in the exercise of their corporate functions. Northwestern Life Insurance Co. v. Riggs, \n203 \nU.S. 243, 254\n, 27 S. Ct. 126, 51 L Ed. 168, 7 Ann. Cas. 1104; Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., \n205 \nU.S. 489\n, 27 S.

Ct. 160; National Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71, 73\n, 43 S. Ct. 32. Such regulation would seem to be peculiarly applicable to that form of insurance which has come into very wide use of late years, that of indemnifying the owners of vehicles against losses due to the negligence of themselves or their servants in their operation and use. The agencies for the promotion of comfort and speed in the streets are so many and present such possibility of accident and injury to members of the public that the owners have recourse to insurance to relieve them from the risk of heavy recoveries they run in intrusting these more or less dangerous instruments to the care of their agents. Having in mind the sense of immunity of the owner protected by the insurance and the possible danger of a less degree of care due to that immunity, it would seem to be a reasonable provision by the state in the interest of the public, whose lives and limbs are exposed, to require that the owner in the contract indemnifying him against any recovery from him should stipulate with the insurance company that the indemnity by which he \n\n[267 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n saves himself should certainly inure to the benefit of the person who thereafter is injured. Section 109 does not go quite so far. It provides that the subrogation shall take place only when the insured proves insolvent or bankrupt, and leaves the injured person to pursue his judgment against the insured if solvent without reliance on the policy.\n Another reason for the legislation is suggested in the opinion of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York (Roth v. National Automobile Mutual Casualty Co., 202 App. Div. 667, 674, 195 N. Y. S. 865), to wit, that it was enacted on the recommendation of state superintendent of insurance to make impossible a practice of some companies to collude with the insured after an injury foreshadowing heavy damages had occurred, and to secure an adjudication of the insured in bankruptcy, whereby recovery on the policy could be defeated, because the bankrupt had sustained no loss.\n Whatever the especial occasion for the enactment, it is clear that the exercise of the police power in passing it was reasonable and cannot be said to deprive the insurance company of property without due process of law. It is to be remembered that the assumption of liability by the insurance company under section 109 is entirely voluntary. It need not engage in such insurance if it chooses not to do so.\n The second objection is that the policy in this clause makes provision for an unlawful preference under the National Bankruptcy Act ( Comp. St.  9585-9656), when the owner who is indemnified is a bankrupt at the time of the injury.\n Passing by the difficulty that suggests itself that the insurance company is not one of the creditors of the insolvent insured, and so is hardly in position to question the validity of law for a defect of this kind (Heald v. District of Columbia, \n259 \nU.S. 114, 123\n, 42 S. Ct. 434, and cases cited), we prefer to deal with the objection on its merits. It has \n\n[267 U.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n no substance. As we have already suggested, the Legislature might have required that policies of this kind should subrogate one injured and recovering judgment against the assured to the right of the latter to sue the company on the policy. It simply would create a secured interest in the recovery on the policy for the benefit of the injured person when ascertained. It would not be an unlawful preference any more than security given for any lawful claim against the assured while solvent would be unlawful in the event of subsequent bankruptcy. The clause we have before us is just the same save in one respect. It secures to the injured person the indemnity which his injurer has provided for himself in advance to avoid payment for the injury. But the clause becomes operative only in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the assured when he can no longer use the indemnity to pay the injured person as he should. The title to the indemnity passes out of the bankrupt or insolvent person and vests in him in whom the contract and the state law declare it should vest. The assured is divested by the terms of the instrument under which the interest of the assured and the interest of the injured then contingent, and now absolute, were created. The general creditors have lost nothing because by the fact of bankruptcy the interest of the assured in the policy passed to the injured person and did not become assets of the assured. The provision for the divesting of the interest on bankruptcy was not made to defraud creditors or in expectation of bankruptcy, but was made so far as we can know when the assured was solvent and merely to provide against a future contingency.\n We think that there is in this state legislation complained of, no conflict with the policy or the letter of the bankrupt law.\n A third objection is made that there was no sufficient evidence that the insured was insolvent. This was a \n\n[267 U.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n question of fact under the proceedings which were instituted by execution and what followed. The state courts have found it to exist and it is not for us to question their findings.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERRITT v. U S(1925)\nNo. 159\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 338, 339]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis B. Perkins, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In July, 1918, or earlier, the United States contracted with the Panama Knitting Mills for a quantity of khaki at $3.20 a yard. In June, 1919, this contract was canceled by a new agreement between the government and the mills, made pursuant to the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e). Under the cancellation agreement the government adjusted its liability by accepting delivery of half of the khaki originally contracted for, paying the contract rate together with the carrying charges. The mills had a subcontract with the plaintiff for the supply of the khaki. By falsely representing that the government compelled settlement on the basis of $2. 50 a yard plus the carrying charges, the mills induced the plaintiff to release it, on that basis, from the subcontract. When the government learned of the fraud thus perpetrated, it exacted from the mills a repayment of $5,210.02-the difference between the amount actually paid by the government and what would have been paid if settlement had been made on the basis of $2.50 a yard. \n\n[267 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n This suit was brought in March, 1923, to recover from the United States the sum so repaid. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219).\n Plaintiff cannot recover under the Dent Act. There are three obstacles. It does not appear, as required by section 1 (Comp. St.  3115 14\/15 a), that, prior to November 12, 1918, an agreement with the plaintiff, express or implied, was entered into by the Secretary of War, or 'by any officer or agent acting under his authority, direction, or instruction, or that of the President.' Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 385\n, 43 S. Ct. 384; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 592\n, 43 S. Ct. 425. It does not appear, as required by section 1, that any such agreement had been 'performed, ... or expenditures ... made or obligations incurred upon the faith of the same ... prior to' November 12, 1918. Price Fire & Water Proofing Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 179, 183\n, 43 S. Ct. 299. It does not appear, as required by section 1, that the claim sued on was presented before June 30, 1919. The Dent Act affords relief, although there is no agreement 'executed in the manner prescribed by law,' but only under the conditions stated. The plaintiff is not helped by section 4 (Comp. St.  3115 14\/15 d), which deals with subcontracts; among other reasons, because it does not appear, as therein prescribed, that, before the payment made by the government to the prime contractor, the plaintiff had 'made expenditures, incurred obligations, rendered service, or furnished material, equipment, or supplies to such prime contractor, with the knowledge and approval of any agent of the Secretary of War duly authorized thereunto.'\n Plaintiff cannot recover under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code,  145, 24 Stat. 505 [Comp. St.  1136]). The petition does not allege any contract, express or implied in fact, by the government with the plaintiff to pay the latter for the khaki on \n\n[267 U.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n any basis. Nor does it set forth facts from which such a contract will be implied. The pleader may have intended to sue for money had and received. But no facts are alleged which afford any basis for a claim that the repayment made by the mills was exacted by the government for the benefit of the plaintiff. The Tucker Act does not give a right of action against the United States in those cases where, if the transaction were between private parties, recovery could be had upon a contract implied in law. Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121\n, 39 S. Ct. 56; Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 41 S. Ct. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403. For aught that appears repayment was compelled solely for the benefit of the government, under the proviso in section 1 of the Dent Act, which authorizes recovery of money paid under a settlement, if it has been defrauded.\n The practice of the Court of Claims, while liberal, does not allow a general statement of claim in analogy to the common counts. It requires a plain, concise statement of the facts relied upon. See rule 15, Court of Claims. The petition may not be so general as to leave the defendant in doubt as to what must be met.

Hal H. Smith and Percy J. Donovan, both of Detroit, Mich., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 266, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243), from an order granting an interlocutory injunction restraining appellants from enforcing against appellee, plaintiff below, Act No. 209, Public Acts of 1923 of Michigan. The act provides that no person shall engage or continue \n\n[266 U.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n in the business of transporting persons or property by motor vehicle for hire upon the public highways of the state over fixed routes or between fixed termini, unless he shall have obtained from the Michigan Public Utilities Commission a permit so to do. The permit shall be issued in accordance with the public convenience and necessity, and may be withheld when it appears that the applicant is not able to furnish adequate, safe or convenient service to the public. Sections 1, 2. Section 3 provides that:\n'Any and all persons ... engaged ... in the transportation of persons or property for hire by motor vehicle, upon or over the public highways of this state ... shall be common carriers, and, so far as applicable, all laws of this state now in force or hereafter enacted, regulating ... transportation ... by other common carriers, including regulation of rates, shall apply with equal force and effect to such common carriers ... by motor vehicle. ...'\n\n Section 7 provides that:\n'Any and all common carriers under this act shall carry insurance for the protection of the ... property carried by them in such amount as shall be ordered by said commission ... or shall furnish an indemnity bond ... conditioned upon the payment of all just claims and liabilities resulting from injury to ... property carried by such carrier, and in a company authorized to do business in this state, in an amount to be fixed and approved by said commission.'\n\n A rule adopted by the commission requires all common carriers, defined by the act, to take out such an indemnity bond; and the commission has announced that no permit will be given until there has been filed with it a certificate of the bonding company showing that such bond had been issued. The act imposed upon every such carrier a fee for the privilege of engaging in the business defined in section 1, and appropriates all fees to the general highway fund. And it prescribes punishment \n\n[266 U.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n by fine or imprisonment or both for violations of the act or of any lawful order, rule or regulation of the commission.\n At the time of the passage of the act, plaintiff had three contracts to transport from Detroit, Mich., to Toledo, Ohio, automobile bodies made at the plants of three manufacturers in Detroit and intended for the use of an automobile manufacturer at Toledo. He had been doing such hauling for some years, and had a large investment in property used exclusively for that purpose. He employed 75 men and operated 47 motor trucks and trailers upon the public highways of Michigan, which formed a part of the route between Detroit and Toledo. He had no other business and did not hold himself out as a carrier for the public. It was shown that defendants intended to enforce the act against him, and that, unless he obtained the permits required, they would cause his vehicles to be stopped on the highways by state police and local officers, and the prescribed penalties to be imposed upon him. Plaintiff alleged that the enforcement of the act would cause him irreparable injury, the loss of his contracts, the destruction of his business, and the loss of a substantial part of his capital investment. He assailed the act as invalid; and, among other things, averred that it contravenes the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, that it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it violates the Constitution of Michigan, because it contains a plurality of objects, and its real object is not expressed in the title. The lower court held that section 7, providing for indemnity bonds imposes a direct burden on interstate commerce, and that the provisions of section 3 applicable to private carriers are foreign to the title of the act and fall under the condemnation of the state Constitution. See opinion of the same judges in Liberty \n\n[266 U.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n Highway Co. v. Michigan Public Utilities Commission (D. C.) 294 F. 703, 706, 708, decided the same day that the injunction was granted in this case.\n Plaintiff is a private carrier. His sole business is interstate commerce, and it is limited to the transportation covered by his three contracts. He has no power of eminent domain or franchise under the state, and no greater right to use the highways than any other member of the body public. He does not undertake to carry for the public and does not devote his property to any public use. He has done nothing to give rise to a duty to carry for others. The public is not dependent on him or the use of his property for service, and has no right to call on him for transportation. The act leaves it to the commission to require plaintiff, if he is to use the highways, to be prepared to furnish adequate service to the public. It would make him a common carrier and subject him to all the duties and burdens of that calling and would require him to furnish bond for the protection of those for whom he hauls.\n This court has held that, in the absence of national legislation covering the subject, a state may rightfully prescribe uniform regulations necessary for public safety and order in respect to the operation upon its highways of all motor vehicles-those moving in interstate commerce as well as others-that a reasonable, graduated license fee imposed by a state on motor vehicles used in interstate commerce does not constitute a direct burden on interstate commerce, and that a state which, at its own expense, furnishes special facilities for the use of those engaged in intrastate and interstate commerce may exact compensation therefor, and if the charges are reasonable and uniform, they constitute no burden on interstate commerce. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30. Such regulations are deemed to be reasonable and to affect \n\n[266 U.S. 570, 577]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce only incidentally and indirectly. But it is well settled that a state has no power to fetter the right to carry on interstate commerce within its borders by the imposition of conditions or regulations which are unnecessary and pass beyond the bounds of what is reasonable and suitable for the proper exercise of its powers in the field that belongs to it. Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 201\n, 35 S. Ct. 57. One bound to furnish transportation to the public as a common carrier must serve all, up to the capacity of his facilities, without discrimination and for reasonable pay. The act would put on plaintiff the duty to use his trucks and other equipment as a common carrier in Michigan, and would prevent him from using them exclusively to perform his contracts. This is to take from him use of instrumentalities by means of which he carries on the interstate commerce in which he is engaged as a private carrier and so directly to burden and interfere with it. See Kansas Southern Ry. v. Kaw Valley District, \n233 \nU.S. 75, 78\n, 79 S., 34 S. Ct. 564; Atlantic Coast Line v. Wharton, \n207 \nU.S. 328, 334\n, 28 S. Ct. 121; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois, \n163 \nU.S. 142, 153\n, 16 S. Ct. 1096. And it is a burden upon interstate commerce to impose on plaintiff the onerous duties and strict liability of common carrier, and the obligation of furnishing such indemnity bond to cover the automobile bodies hauled under his contracts as conditions precedent to his right to continue to carry them in interstate commerce. See Barrett v. New York, \n232 \nU.S. 14, 33\n, 34 S. Ct. 203. Clearly, these requirements have no relation to public safety or order in the use of motor vehicles upon the highways, or to the collection of compensation for the use of the highways. The police power does not extend so far. It must be held that, if applied to plaintiff and his business, the act would violate the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n Moreover, it is beyond the power of the state by legislative fiat to convert property used exclusively in the \n\n[266 U.S. 570, 578]\n\u00a0\n business of a private carrier into a public utility, or to make the owner a public carrier, for that would be taking private property for public use without just compensation, which no state can do consistently with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Producers Transportation Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 40 S. Ct. 131; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 42 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. On the facts above referred to, it is clear that, if enforced against him, the act would deprive plaintiff of his property in violation of that clause of the Constitution.\n The Supreme Court of Michigan has not decided whether the act contravenes the state Constitution; and as we hold that the enforcement of the act against plaintiff would deprive him of his rights under the federal Constitution, and that therefore the decree must be affirmed, we do not pass on state questions.

Thomas, both of Denver, Colo., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. E. Pew, of Helena, Mont., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the Oil Company to enjoin the enforcement of an annual license tax imposed by a state statute (Rev. Codes Mont. 1921,  2397-2408)1 upon persons producing petroleum, etc., equal to 1 per centum of the gross value of the oil produced during the year. The statute, as applied to the company, is assailed as invalid, upon the ground that the company, by assignment of the original leases, is a lessee of the United States of certain public lands entered as homesteads, but not yet granted by patent, upon which it \n\n[268 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n is engaged in prospecting for and producing crude petroleum, under the provisions of the Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4640 1\/4-4640 1\/4ss), and, therefore, 'is a governmental agency, means or instrumentality whose operations cannot be taxed by the state.' The state Supreme Court held otherwise. 65 Mont. 414, 211 P. 353; 68 Mont. 550, 219 P. 1119\n\n\n Whether the company under its leases is an agency, means or instrumentality of the United States, or in the absence of congressional consent would be outside the reach of state taxation, we need not stop to consider, since we are of opinion that the authority of the state exists in virtue of such consent. Section 32 (41 Stat. 450) of the act contains the following proviso:\n'Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed or held to affect the rights of the states or other local authority to exercise any rights which they may have, including the right to levy and collect taxes upon improvements, output of mines, or other rights, property, or assets of any lessee of the United States.' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  4640 1\/4pp.\n\n The contention on behalf of the company is that this proviso, which saves from the effect of any possible adverse construction of the act, rights of the states 'which they may have,' relates to, and is confirmatory of, existing rights only-that is to say, rights existing when the act was passed. But we find nothing in the body of the act which, by any stretch of meaning, purports to detract from or render less certain any such pre-existing rights, and in that view, the theory advanced fails for want of material upon which to operate. It fairly cannot be supposed that Congress would indulge in the altogether idle ceremony of enacting a law to save rights which, being in no way challenged or affected, stood in no need of being saved. The more natural view, and the one we adopt, is that Congress, having provided for leasing the public lands to private corporations and persons whose \n\n[268 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n property, income, business and occupations ordinarily were subject to state taxation, meant by the proviso to say in effect that, although the act deals with the letting of public lands and the relations of the government to the lessee thereof, nothing in it shall be so construed as to affect the right of the states, in respect of such private persons and corporations, to levy and collect taxes as though the government were not concerned. In other words, the purpose of Congress was to remove altogether from the field of controversy, among other questions, the very question which is here presented, and to put beyond doubt the authority of the states to impose taxes upon lessees in respect of their property, although arising from, and in respect of their taxable rights, although exercised under, the act, without regard to the origin thereof or to the interest of the United States in the lands or leases.\n Further, it is said that the enumeration of particular objects of taxation causes it to be necessary to limit the general words, 'or other rights,' to things of the same nature in accordance with the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and that, thus limited, the right or privilege of carrying on a business or following an occupation is not included. These general words follow the more particular words, 'improvements [and] output of mines,' and are followed by the equally general words, 'property or assets,' the entire clause being 'improvements, output of mines, or other rights [other] property, or [other] assets.' The doctrine invoked is a rule of construction, to be used as an aid in the ascertainment of the intention of the lawmakers, and not for the purpose of subverting such intention when ascertained. Here, the enumeration of taxable things, including the general classes, property and assets, is so comprehensive that nothing remains to which the phrase in question can apply, unless to rights like the one here taxed; and to construe it as contended, would, \n\n[268 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n in effect therefore, nullify it altogether. Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 553\n, 554 S., 43 S. Ct. 200. No doubt what Congress immediately had in mind was the necessity of making it clear that, notwithstanding the interest of the government in the leased lands, the right of the states to tax improvements thereon and the output thereof should not be in doubt; but the intention likewise to save the authority of the states in respect of all other taxable things is made evident by the addition of the three general categories, 'other rights, property or assets.' We think the proviso plainly discloses the intention of Congress that persons and corporations contracting with the United States under the act, should not, for that reason, be exempt from any form of state taxation otherwise lawful.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 2398.

He assumed the duties of that office September 1, 1919, when the statute (Act Feb. 25, 1919, c. 29, 40 Stat. 1156 1157) declared that judges of that court should be entitled to receive 'an annual salary of $7,500, payable monthly from the treasury.' He was required to pay to plaintiff in error, Collector of Internal Revenue, the income taxes for 1919 and 1920 prescribed by 'An act to provide revenue, and for other purposes,' approved February 24, 1919 [ the Revenue Act of 1918] c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. In computing these his judicial salary was treated as part of his 'gross income.'\n'Sec. 213. That for the purposes of this title (except as otherwise provided in section 233) the term 'gross income'--\n\n'(a) Includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service (including in the case of the President of the United States, the judges of the Supreme and inferior courts of the United States, and all other officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, the compensation received as such), of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; \n\n[268 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. ...' Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 ff.\n\n After payment and the necessary preliminary steps, he instituted this proceeding to recover, upon the ground that the exactions on account of his salary were without authority of law. Judgment went for him in the trial court. It was there said:\n'Unless he was taxable under the [Revenue] Act of 1918 [approved February 24, 1919] he was not taxable at all. If he is taxable under the statute, he is so by virtue of a clause which applies to all the federal judges, irrespective of the time they came upon the bench. That clause as written has been held invalid. ... When the clause which has been declared invalid is out of the act, no other imposes the tax. What the court here is asked to do is to rewrite the pertinent portion of the statute in question so that it will read as did the provisions of the Acts of 1913 and 1916 relative to this general subject. But that would be for the court to do what Congress expressly decided not to do. With its eyes wide open to the possible consequences, it made up its mind to seek uniformity by imposing the tax upon all judges. Whether it would or would not have been willing to tax the minority, if the majority were immune, nobody knows, perhaps not even the members of that Congress itself, for upon that question they never were called upon to make up their minds.'\n\n Plaintiff in error now insists that, although the challenged provision of the Act of February 24, 1919, has been adjudged invalid as to all judges who took office prior to that date, it is obligatory upon those thereafter appointed.\n Section 1, art. 3, of the Constitution provides:\n'The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts \n\n[268 U.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.'\n\n Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245\n, 40 S. Ct. 550, 11 A. L. R. 519, arose out of the claim that Judge Evans was liable for the tax upon his salary as prescribed by the act now under consideration, although appointed before its enactment. We there gave much consideration to the purpose, history, and meaning of the above-quoted section of the Constitution and, among other things, said:\n'These considerations make it very plain, as we think, that the primary purpose of the prohibition against diminution was not to benefit the judges, but like the clause in respect of tenure, to attract good and competent men to the bench and to promote that independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of the guaranties, limitations, and pervading principles of the Constitution and to the administration of justice without respect to persons and with equal concern for the poor and the rich. Such being its purpose, it is to be construed, not as a private grant, but as a limitation imposed in the public interest; in other words, not restrictively, but in accord with its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds.\n\n'Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and others indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition. ...\n\n'The prohibition is general, contains no excepting words, and appears to be directed against all diminution, \n\n[268 U.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n whether for one purpose or another; and the reasons for its adoption, as publicly assigned at the time and commonly accepted ever since, make with impelling force for the conclusion that the fathers of the Constitution intended to prohibit diminution by taxation as well as otherwise-that they regarded the independence of the judges as of far greater importance than any revenue that could come from taxing their salaries. ...\n\n'For the common good-to render him [the judge], in the words of John Marshall, 'perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience'-his compensation is protected from diminution in any form, whether by a tax or otherwise, and is assured to him in its entirety for his support. ...\n\n'Here the Constitution expressly forbids diminution of the judge's compensation, meaning, as we have shown, diminution by taxation as well as otherwise. The taxing act directs that the compensation-the full sum, with no deduction for expenses-be included in computing the net income, on which the tax is laid. If the compensation be the only income, the tax falls on it alone; and, if there be other income, the inclusion of the compensation augments the tax accordingly. In either event the compensation suffers a diminution to the extent that it is taxed.\n\n'We conclude that the tax was imposed contrary to the constitutional prohibition, and so must be adjudged invalid.'\n\n Does the circumstance that defendant in error's appointment came after the taxing act require a different view concerning his right to exemption? The answer depends upon the import of the word 'compensation' in the constitutional provision.\n The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out \n\n[268 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n of the public funds and the times for payment. When this duty has been complied with, the amount specified become the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.\n On September 1, 1919, the applicable statute declared:\n'The Chief Justice [of the Court of Claims] shall be entitled to receive an annual salary of $8,000, and each of the other judges an annual salary of $7,500, payable monthly.'

Supp. 1919 ,  1127\n\n\n\n The compensation fixed by law when defendant in error assumed his official duties was $7,500 per annum, and to exact a tax in respect of this would diminish it within the plain rule of Evans v. Gore.\n The taxing act became a law prior to the statute prescribing salaries for judges of the Court of Claims, but if the dates were reversed it would be impossible to construe the former as an amendment which reduced salaries by the amount of the tax imposed. No judge is required to pay a definite percentage of his salary, but all are commanded to return, as a part of 'gross income,' 'the compensation received as such' from the United States. From the 'gross income' various deductions and credits are allowed, as for interest paid, contributions or gifts made, personal exemptions varying with family relations, etc., and upon the net result assessment is made. The plain purpose was to require all judges to return their compensation as an item of 'gross income,' and to tax this as other salaries. This is forbidden by the Constitution.\n The power of Congress definitely to fix the compensation to be received at stated intervals by judges thereafter appointed is clear. It is equally clear, we think, that there is no power to tax a judge of a court of the United States on account of the salary prescribed for him by law.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC R.

Daily, all of Fort Smith, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in a state court of Arkansas by Reynolds- Davis Grocery Company against the Missouri Pacific Railroad to recover for the loss of part of a carload of sugar shipped from Raceland, La., to Fort Smith, Ark., on a through bill of lading. The loss occurred within the city of Fort Smith while the car was in the possession of the St. Louis- San Francisco Railroad. This carrier had been employed by the Missouri Pacific to switch the car from a point on its lines within the city to the consignee's warehouse, which lay within the city on the lines of the switching carrier. The Missouri Pacific, relying upon Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. v. McGinn, \n258 \nU.S. 409\n, 42 S. Ct. 332, requested the trial court to rule that, as the bill of lading provided that no connecting carrier should be liable for any damage which did not occur on its own lines, and delivery at the consignee's warehouse was part of an interstate shipment, the defendant was not liable, because it was neither the initial nor the delivering carrier. The court refused to rule as requested; the jury found for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 161 Ark. 579, 257 S. W. 70. This court granted a writ of certiorari, \n265 \nU.S. 577\n, 44 S. Ct. 636\n\n\n The joint through rate covered delivery at the warehouse of the consignee. The bill of lading named Morgan's Louisiana & Texas Railroad & Steamship Company as the initial carrier and the route designated therein named the Missouri Pacific as the last of the connecting carriers. Its lines enter Fort Smith but do not extend to the consignee's warehouse. It employed the \n\n[268 U.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis-San Francisco to perform the necessary switching service. And it paid therefor $6.30, the charge fixed by the tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The switching carrier was not named in the bill of lading and did not receive any part of the joint through rate. It was simply the agent of the Missouri Pacific for the purpose of delivery. The Missouri Pacific was the delivering carrier and is liable as such.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC R. CO. v.

Green, all of St. Louis, Mo., and J. C. Sheppard, of Poplar Bluff, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. George H. Moore, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the respondent against the petitioner in the circuit court of Ripley county, Mo., to recover treble damages under sections 9985, 9990, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1919. The petitioner is a common carrier of freight and passengers for hire by railroad in Missouri and other states. Section 9985 contains the following:\n'It shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person ... in the transportation of goods ... or to subject any particular person ... to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to such transportation. ...'\n\n Section 9990, among other things, makes the carrier liable to any person injured by a violation of the above-quoted provision for three times the amount of damages sustained.\n June 12, 1920, respondent, who was engaged in the lumber business, had 20,000 feet of hardwood lumber \n\n[267 U.S. 404, 406]\n\u00a0\n ready for shipment at Oxly, Mo., a station on petitioner's railroad, and applied for two cars on which to ship the lumber to St. Louis, Mo. The petitioner failed to furnish him any cars until August 19, 1920. After he had ordered the cars, and before they were delivered, other shippers at Oxly applied to the petitioner for and were furnished cars for the transportation of lumber. Respondent alleged that by section 9985, petitioner was prohibited from so discriminating against him, and that as a result of such unlawful discrimination he was damaged in the sum of $1, 000. The complaint alleged the foregoing facts, but contained no allegation that respondent attempted to designate any route, intrastate or interstate, for the transportation of his lumber. The answer denied the discrimination and alleged that petitioner moves its cars from Oxly to St. Louis over two routes, one wholly within the state of Missouri; the other by way of Thebes, crossing the Mississippi river at that point and running through the state of Illinois into St. Louis; that the usual and regular way of routing cars loaded with lumber at Oxly and consigned to St. Louis would be over the latter route through the state of Illinois and would be interstate commerce, and that section 9985 has no application to the facts stated in respondent's complaint.\n The first trial resulted in a judgment for respondent which was reversed on appeal. 210 Mo. App. 311, 236 S. W. 891. However, the Court of Appeals held that, under these sections, an action lies for damages for discrimination in furnishing cars for the shipment of lumber which could have gone over either an intrastate or interstate route. At the second trial, petitioner's superintendent of transportation testified that, under the routing circular then in force, respondent's lumber would have been hauled over the interstate route; that the line on the Missouri side of the river passes over Iron Mountain and other Ozark \n\n[267 U.S. 404, 407]\n\u00a0\n Hills, and that the routing through Illinois over the more level line is made as a matter of operating convenience and economy. There was no other evidence on the point. Cf. 210 Mo. App. 316, 236 S. W. 891. Respondent did not attempt to designate any route, intrastate or interstate, and there is nothing to show that he expressed or had any preference in respect of the route. At the close of all the evidence in the case, the petitioner requested the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict for petitioner. The court refused to do so, and, notwithstanding the fact that respondent's lumber would have moved over the interstate route, submitted the case to the jury. There was a verdict of $1,000 for respondent, and judgment was entered for three times that amount. Petitioner appealed. 212 Mo. App. 512, 254 S. W. 111. The Court of Appeals held that respondent was not entitled to a verdict in excess of $502.50, and ordered that, if respondent file remittitur, judgment for $1,507.50 would be affirmed. The remittur was filed and judgment entered accordingly. The case is here on certiorari. Section 237, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n Congress, in the exertion of its power over commerce among the states, has enacted laws for the regulation of the furnishing of cars to shippers. Interstate Commerce Act,  1, (3), (4), (6), (10), (11), (12), (14); section 3(1); section 15(1) being Comp. St.  8563, 8565, 8583. See United States v. New River Company, \n265 \nU.S. 533, 541\n, 44 S. Ct. 610. Section 3, c. 104, 24 Stat. 380 (as amended February 28, 1920 ,  405, c. 91, 41 Stat. 479, being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8565), is very similar to section 9985, and contains the following:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage \n\n[267 U.S. 404, 408]\n\u00a0\n in any respect whatsoever.'\n\n It is elementary and well settled that there can be no divided authority over interstate commerce, and that the acts of Congress on that subject are supreme and exclusive. Transportation from Oxly to St. Louis over the route partly within and partly outside of Missouri is interstate commerce. Hanley v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., \n187 \nU.S. 617, 620\n, 23 S. Ct. 214; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Speight, \n254 \nU.S. 17\n, 41 S. Ct. 11. It was shown that the shipment would have moved by that route.

U S(1925)\nNo. 176\nArgued: January 15, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Horace S. Whitman and Wm. L. Marbury, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pursuant to the Act of October 6, 1917, c. 79, 40 Stat. 345, 352, the President declared that the large track of \n\n[267 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n land in Maryland now known as the Aberdeen Proving Ground was needed for that military purpose. Proclamations, October 16, 1917, and December 14, 1917, 40 Stat. 1707, 1731. The land was thereafter acquired under that act from the several owners either by purchase or by eminent domain. Among the parcels acquired by eminent domain was one of 440 acres belonging to the plaintiffs and used by them in the business of growing and canning corn of a special grade and quality. The establishment of the proving ground resulted in withdrawing from such use the available lands especially adapted to the growing of this particular quality of corn. Plaintiffs were consequently unable to re-establish themselves elsewhere in their former business. For their land, appurtenances, and improvements the President fixed $76,000 as just compensation. For the business he made no allowance. The sum awarded was accepted without protest. In 1921 this suit was brought to recover $100,000 as compensation for the loss of their business. The Court of Claims, after a hearing upon the evidence, entered judgment for the defendant. 58 Ct. Cl. 443. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219).\n The act appropriated $7,000,000 for 'increasing facilities for the proof and test of ordance material, including necessary buildings, construction, equipment, land, and damages and losses to persons, firms, and corporations, resulting from the procurement of the land for this purpose.' It then provided that, if the land, appurtenances, and improvements could not be procured by purchase, the President was authorized to take over the immediate possession and title for the United States; that just compensation to be determined by the President should be made therefor; and that, if the compensation so determined should prove unsatisfactory to the person entitled to receive it, he was to be paid 75 per cent. of that amount, and was to be entitled to sue for whatever \n\n[267 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n further sum was required for just compensation. Plaintiffs make two contentions. The first is that, because the business was destroyed, they can recover, under the Fifth Amendment, as for a taking of the business upon a promise implied in fact, under the doctrine of United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645\n, 5 S. Ct. 306. The second contention is that, under the terms of the act, they can recover damages for loss of the business although it may not have been taken. In support of each contention, they rely, among other things, upon the findings of fact that, before the passage of the act, a representative of the War Department had given assurance publicly that compensation would be paid, not only for the land taken by the government, but also for all injuries and losses sustained by any person as a result of the establishment of the proving ground, and that, both before and shortly after the passage of the act, the Secretary of War had given somewhat similar assurances.\n The mere fact that compensation for the taking of the land was fixed by the President and was accepted does not bar recovery on the present claim, whether the suit be deemed to be upon a promise implied in fact for a taking or for the recovery of statutory damages. The claim now asserted is on account of property other than that for which the act provided that compensation should be made upon the President's determination. Acceptance of the award did not operate, under the doctrine of United States v. Childs & Co., 12 Wall. 232, as a voluntary settlement of this claim. There are, however, other obstacles to a recovery. The act authorized the taking only of 'land and appurtenances and improvements attached thereto,' and it did not declare that compensation should be made for losses resulting from the establishment of the proving ground.\n The special value of land due to its adaptability for use in a particular business is an element which the owner \n\n[267 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n of land is entitled, under the Fifth Amendment, to have considered in determining the amount to be paid as the just compensation upon a taking by eminent domain. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 408, New York v. Sage, \n239 \nU.S. 57, 61\n, 36 S. Ct. 25. Doubtless such special value of the plaintiffs' land was duly considered by the President in fixing the amount to be paid therefor. The settled rules of law however, precluded his considering in that determination consequential damages for losses to their business, or for its destruction. Joslin Manufacturing Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668, 675\n, 43 S. Ct. 684. Compare Sharp v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 341\n, 24 S. Ct. 114; Campbell v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 368\n, 45 S. Ct. 115, 69 L. Ed. --. No recovery therefor can be had now as for a taking of the business. There is no finding as a fact that the government took the business, or that what it did was intended as a taking. If the business was destroyed, the destruction was an unintended incident of the taking of land. There can be no recovery under the Tucker Act (21 Stat. 505), if the intention to take is lacking. Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121\n, 39 S. Ct. 56. Moreover, the act did not confer authority to take a business. In the absence of authority, even an intentional taking cannot support an action for compensation under the Tucker Act. United States v. North American Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330\n, 40 S. Ct. 518.\n By including in the appropriation clause the words 'losses to persons, firms, and corporations, resulting from the procurement of the land for this purpose,' Congress doubtless authorized the Secretary of War to take into consideration losses due to the destruction of the business, where he purchased land upon agreement with the owners. But it does not follow that, in the absence of an agreement, the plaintiffs can compel payment for such losses. To recover, they must show some statutory right conferred. States have not infrequently directed the payment of compensation in similar situations. The constitutions of some require that compensation be made for con \n\n[267 U.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n sequential damages to private property resulting from public improvements. Chicago v. Taylor, \n125 \nU.S. 161\n, 8 S. Ct. 820; Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., \n233 \nU.S. 546, 554\n, 34 S. Ct. 654, L. R. A. 1915A, 887. Others have, in authorizing specific public improvements, conferred the right to such compensation. \n1\n Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148\n, 32 S. Ct. 428; Joslin Manufacturing Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668\n, 43 S. Ct. 684. Congress had, of course, the power to make like provision here. Compare United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427\n, 16 S. Ct. 1120. But the mere reference in the appropriation clause to losses 'resulting from the procurement of the land for this purpose' does not confer such a right. The settled policy of Congress, in authorizing the taking of land and appurtenances, has been to limit the right to compensation to interests in the land taken. The only act called to our attention in which was conferred a right to compensation for injury to property other than an interest in the land taken is the statute involved in United States v. Alexander, \n148 \nU.S. 186\n, 13 S. Ct. 529, which was passed more than 40 years ago, and in which the injury provided for was a direct result of the taking. We need not consider other objections to a recovery.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, for example, Earle v. Commonwealth, 180 Mass. 579, 63 N. E. 10, 57 L. R. A. 292, 91 Am.

The member to whom the certificate was issued was the plaintiff's husband and the ground of recovery is that the husband had disappeared and had not been heard of for ten years before this suit was brought. His expectancy of life according to the tables had not expired and the defense is a by-law of the Corporation to the effect that:\n'Long continued absence of any member unheard of shall not ... give any right to recover on any benefit certificate ... until the full term of the member's expectancy of life, according to the National Fraternal Congress Table of Mortality, has expired, ... and this law shall be in full force and effect any statute of any state or country or rule of common law of any state or country to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n The only facts that need be mentioned are that the certificate seems to have been issued in South Dakota, although there was no allegation or proof concerning the law of that State, and that it was issued in 1901, while the by-law relied upon was not adopted until 1908. But the by-law has been held valid and binding upon the members of the Corporation by the Supreme Court of Illinois, although they had become members before the change. Steen v. Modern Woodmen of America, 296 Ill. 104, 129 N. E. 546, 17 A. L. R. 406. The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed a judgment for the plaintiff, seemingly, from the cases cited, on the ground either that the rule of evidence must be determined by the lex fori, or, more probably, that the by-law was unreasonable. Mixer v. Modern Woodmen of America, 197 N. W. 129. The result is that if the validity of the by-law ought to be determined by the laws of Illinois, the plaintiff is allowed to recover upon a state of facts which the contract expressly stipulates \n\n[267 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n shall not give her that right. A writ of certiorari was issued by this Court. \n265 \nU.S. 576\n, 44 S.

Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 35 S. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771. The act of becoming a member is something more than a contract, it is entering into a complex and abiding relation, and as marriage looks to domicil, membership looks to and must be governed by the law of the State granting the incorporation. We need not consider what other States may refuse to do, but we deem it established that they cannot attach to membership rights against the Company that are refused by the law of the domicil. It does not matter that the member joined in another State. In the above cited case Green became a member of a Massachusetts corporation in New York, and the State Court held on ordinary principles of contract that his rights were governed by New York law. Green v Royal Arcanum, 206 N. Y. 591, 597, 100 N. E. 411. But the decision was reversed and it was held a failure to give full faith and credit to the Massachusetts charter as construed by the Massachusetts Court that Green was relieved by decree from paying assessments increased by the corporation after his contract was made. We are of opinion that the decision in that case governs this, and that the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORRISON v.

C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Harry L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the Act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642, and agreements made pursuant thereto approved by the President March 4, 1890, the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota ceded to the United States their title to all lands constituting their reservations in that state, except a \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n small portion of the White Earth and Red Lake reservations. \n1\n The ceded lands were to be surveyed and classified into pine and agricultural lands, and were to be sold at a price not less than that fixed by the act; the proceeds were to be deposited in the treasury of the United States to the credit of the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, and interest thereon was to be paid by the government at the rate of 5 per cent. Part of this interest was to be distributed annually in cash to heads of families and guardians of minor orphans, part thereof to other classes of Indians, and the remainder was to be applied, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, for the establishment and maintenance of free schools for the Indians. At the end of 50 years the so-called permanent fund was to be divided in equal shares and paid to the Indians then entitled thereto. The United States has exercised and is now exercising, in respect to the property dealt with in said act and agreement, the powers of a guardian for these Indians and of a trustee in possession.\n This suit was brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by Morrison, who alleges that he is a member of the class of persons described as 'all the Chippewa Indians in the state of Minnesota,' and sues on behalf of himself and others similarly situated. The defendants are the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Secretary of the Treasury. Relief is sought on eight distinct grounds. Four of the \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n rest upon charges that by six later acts2 Congress undertook to modify or to ignore rights of the Chippewas which had become fixed by the agreements approved March 4, 1890; that by carrying out the provisions of these later acts the defendants, in their official capacities, have subjected these Chippewas to great loss, and threaten further injury; and that each of the six acts is void, because it deprives them of property in violation of the Constitution. Three grounds of complaint rest upon charges that the defendants, acting officially, have, through mistaken and hence unauthorized exercise of powers granted by the act of 1889, inflicted, and threaten, further injury. \n3\n The eighth ground of complaint is that loss has been inflicted and is threatened through failure to perform duties imposed by that act. The specific prayers are for an injunction to restrain each of the threatened wrongs. There is also a prayer for general relief. The defendants moved to dismiss the bill. The motions were sustained, and leave was granted to amend. An amended bill was filed, defendants again moved to dismiss, a final decree of dismissal was entered by the trial court, and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District. 290 F. 306. The case is here on appeal under section 250 of the Judicial Code.\n The objections presented by the motions to dismiss include lack of jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter, lack of necessary parties plaintiff and defendant, \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n and lack of merits. Every objection made involves the determination of the nature of the title of the Indians to the property in suit and the nature of the interest of Morrison therein. The differences in character of the three classes of complaint included in the bill require that each class be considered separately. But it is no necessary either to state in detail the facts concerning each of the eight grounds of complaint, or to pass upon their merits.\n First. The four grounds of complaint which rest upon the charge that the defendants are depriving these Chippewas of their property by carrying out the provisions of the six later acts of Congress, have this in common. Each complaint relates to some change made either in the method of managing and disposing of the ceded lands or in the disposition of the proceeds thereof. As to each, it is claimed that the defendants' acts are unlawful because Congress was powerless to make the change without the consent of the Chippewas. It is admitted that, as regards tribal property subject to the control of the United States as guardian of Indians, Congress may make such changes in the management and disposition as it deems necessary to promote their welfare. The United States is now exercising, under the claim that the property is tribal, the powers of a guardian and of a trustee in possession. Morrison's contention is that, by virtue of the act of 1889 and the agreements made thereunder, the ceded lands ceased to be tribal property and the rights of the Indians in the lands and in the fund to be formed became fixed as individual property. The Court of Appeals held this contention to be unfounded. We have no occasion to determine whether it erred in so ruling. The claim of the United States is at least a substantial one. To interfere with its management and disposition of the lands or the funds by enjoinion its officials, would interfere with the performance of governmental functions \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 486]\n\u00a0\n and vitally affect interests of the United States. It is therefore an indispensable party to this suit. \n4\n It was not joined as defendant. Nor could it have been, as Congress has not consented that it be sued. \n5\n The bill so far as it complains of acts done pursuant to the later legislation, was properly dismissed for this reason, among others.\n Second. The three grounds of complaint which rest upon charges that the defendants, acting under color of authority granted by the act of 1889, have inflicted and threaten injury by the exercise of powers not conferred, have this in common. Each complaint involves the charge that the officials have erred either in construing or in applying that act and the agreements approved March 4, 1890. The Court of Appeals held all of these charges to be unfounded. We need not consider the correctness of the rulings. Nor need we consider whether the errors complained of were decisions by a head of an executive department of the Government of the character not subject to judicial review. \n6\n The bill was properly dismissed, so far as concerns these three charges, because the plaintiff is not in a position to litigate in this proceeding the legality of the acts complained of.\n The case at bar is unlike those in which relief by injunction has been granted against the head of an executive department, or other officer, of the government to enjoin an official act on the ground that it was not within the authority conferred, or that it was an improper exercise of such authority, or that Congress lacked the power to confer the authority exercised. In those cases the act \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 487]\n\u00a0\n complained of either involved an invasion or denial of a definite right of the plaintiff,7 or it operated to cast a cloud upon his property. \n8\n In some of those cases the defendant would have been liable individually in trespass unless he could justify under authority conferred. \n9\n Morrison and the other Chippewas have no right of that character. The lands ceded are the property of the United States. It has, confessedly, power to dispose of them. It assumed the obligation of doing this properly, of accounting for the principal of the trust fund to be created thereby, and of disbursing properly the interest accruing. Each of these three grounds of complaint involves, in essence, either the charge of faliure to pay into the treasury to the credit of the Chippewas money which should be credited to them or the making of a payment from the accruing interest for the purpose not authorized. If through officials of the United States these lands, or the proceeds \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 488]\n\u00a0\n thereof, or the accruing interest, are improperly disposed of, it is the United States, not the officials, which is under obligation to account to the Indians therefor. In other words, the right of the Indians is merely to have the United States administer properly the trust assumed. It resembles the general right of every citizen to have the government administered according to law and the public moneys properly applied. \n10\n Courts have no power, under the circumstances here presented, to interfere with the performance of the functions committed to an executive department of the government by a suit to which the United States is not, and cannot be made, a party. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Third. A mandatory injunction is sought to compel the Secretary of the Interior to permit the Red Lake Indians to receive allotments from the Red Lake Reservation, under section 2 of the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388 (Comp. St.  4196). The plaintiff does not claim to be entitled to an allotment of any of this land. He is not a Red Lake Indian. He is not seeking to enforce the right of any Red Lake Indian to an allotment. Morrison's interest is an indirect one. His complaint appears to be this:\n Approximately 700,000 acres of land were reserved to satisfy claims for allotment to the Red Lake Indians. Under the agreements approved by the President these allotments were to be made as soon as practicable after \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 489]\n\u00a0\n the taking of a census. The amount of land which will actually be required to satisfy these claims for allotment is far less than the 700,000 acres reserved. The surplus land, when ascertained, will pass to the United States as a part of the ceded lands. This surplus, like the other lands, must be sold; and, when sold, the proceeds must be paid into the trust fund for the benefit of all the Chippewas in Minnesota. If, and as soon as, the trust fund is augmented by the sale of the surplus lands, a part of the interest accruing on the addition so made to the trust fund will be payable to all the Chippewas in Minnesota, including the plaintiff. The prescribed census was completed 32 years before the filing of the bill. No allotments have been made. The delay in making the allotments has postponed the determination of what are surplus lands, and consequently the sale of the same. The delay in making sales has postponed the payment into the trust fund of the expected proceeds from sales. The delay in making this payment has deferred the accruing of interest. Thus the plaintiff and others are deprived of part of their expected annual income. The delay in making the allotment has likewise deferred the commencement of the running of the 50-year period upon the expiration of which the trust fund is to be distributed. The postponement of the period of distribution results in unnecessary and illegal expenditure out of the income of the fund. It is to avert such indirect losses that a mandatory injunction is sought to compel the Secretary to make the allotments.\n Morrison urges that he is seeking to enforce the performance of a merely ministerial duty. Relief was denied by the Court of Appeals on the ground that he is not a member of the Red Lake Band and has shown no authority to speak for them. Whether that ruling was correct, whether the duty of the Secretary of the Interior is merely ministerial, and whether the indirect or remote \n\n[266 U.S. 481, 490]\n\u00a0\n INTEREST OF THE PLAINTIFF IN THE PERFORMAnce of the particular duty is of a nature which could, in any event, entitle him to compel its specific performance by judicial process-these are questions which we have no occasion to consider. A mandatory injunction, like a mandamus, is an extraordinary remedial process, which is granted, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion. \n12\n It issues to remedy a wrong, not to promote one. No facts are shown which justify its issue in this case. It is alleged that the Secretary of the Interior has 'refused and still refuses to allot a single Indian on the Red Lake reservation lands, or to permit any Indian to select or receive an allotment thereon.' If any Indian who is entitled to an allotment has vainly requested that it be made to him, it is not necessary to seek redress indirectly by this proceeding. Under the Act of February 6, 1901, c. 217, 31 Stat. 760 (Comp. St.  4214, 4215), any Indian who claims to be entitled to an allotment under any act of Congress, may bring suit therefor against the United States in the appropriate district court. \n13\n Moreover, the course pursued by the Secretary of the Interior has been long acquiesced in by the Red Lake Indians and for aught that appears it is in accord with the desires and interest not only of that band, but also of all the other Chippewas in Minnesota except the plaintiff.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provisions of this act and later legislation were considered in Minnesota v.

U S(1925)\nNo. 597\nArgued: January 9, 1925Decided: February 2, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Nash Rockwood, of New York City, for appellants. \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 81]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants, under indictment in the District of Columbia, while passing through New York on February 6, 1923, on their way to Washington for trial, were arrested and taken from the train by a United States marshal upon bench warrants issued on federal indictments found in New York charging them with fraudulent uses of the mails. Previously, their removal to New York from Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, for trial under these indictments had been sought under section 1014, Rev. Stats. (Comp. St.  1674). The removal of Harry F. Morse from Connecticut had been granted by the commissioner, but, upon habeas corpus proceedings, he had been discharged from custody by the Connecticut federal District Court for want of probable cause, principally on the ground that the New York indictment was insufficient to charge a criminal offense (287 F. 906), although the New York court had previously held it good. The proceedings for the removal of Benjamin W. Morse from Massachusetts were still pending before the commissioner at the time of the arrest. Both appellants were on bail to answer the District of Columbia indictment. Their case had been peremptorily set for trial on the morning following the arrest, and the effect of it was to prevent their appearance at the time set. Upon these facts, writs of habeas corpus were granted by the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. After a hearing, the writs were dismissed and these appeals followed.\n First. It is contended that the arrest of appellants in New York, while en route to Washington for trial, under the circumstances stated, was arbitrary, unauthorized and \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n illegal, and constituted a violation of the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. The contention is plainly without merit. The principle that when the jurisdiction of a court has attached, it must be respected as exclusive until exhausted, is a rule of comity, having a wide application in civil cases but a limited one in criminal cases. Peckham v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 483, 486\n, 30 S. Ct. 255. The mutual forbearance which two federal courts having coordinate jurisdiction should exercise to prevent conflicts by avoiding interferences with the process of each other, has 'perhaps no higher sanction than the utility which comes from concord.' Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 182\n, 4 S. Ct. 355, 358 (28 L. Ed. 390). But this aside, if there be a violation of the rule of comity here, it primarily concerns only the courts or the sovereignty which is their common superior, and cannot avail the appellants indicted for crimes in the different jurisdictions. Moreover, their constitutional rights are not affected; and if there was error in any respect, it is not reviewable on habeas corpus. Peckham v. Henkel, supra, p. 487; Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 25 S. Ct. 573. And see In re Fox ( D. C.) 51 F. 427, 430; United States v. Marrin (D. C.) 170 F. 476, 479-480.\n Second. It is urged that the decision of the federal District Court in Connecticut discharging Harry F. Morse was res judicata and conclusively determined (1) that the New York bench warrant was illegally issued and therefore could not be made the basis for the subsequent arrest in New York; and (2) that the indictment was fatally defective. In respect of the first contention, it is enough to say that the warrant upon which the Connecticut arrest was made was that issued by the commissioner and not the New York bench warrant upon which the present arrest was made. The discharge of the prisoner determined that he could not be held upon the process issued by the commissioner. It had nothing to do with the question whether he could be arrested and held in New York \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 83]\n\u00a0\n upon the process issued by the trial court. See Ex parte Milburn, 9 Pet. 704, 710; Barbee v. Weatherspoon, 88 N. C. 19, 20-22; In re Begerow, 136 Cal. 293, 299, 68 P. 773, 56 L. R. A. 528.\n The second contention proceeds upon a complete misconception of the purpose for which the indictment is produced and considered in removal proceedings, and the authoritative effect of the ruling of the commissioner and the court on habeas corpus in respect thereof. The inquiry in such proceedings is whether there is probable cause to believe the prisoner guilty and justify his removal for trial. That inquiry may be made and the prisoner removed to the trial district in advance of indictment or without the production of the indictment if one has been found. Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 260\n, 22 S. Ct. 218; Pierce v. Creecy, \n210 \nU.S. 387, 403\n, 28 S. Ct. 714; United States v. Greene (D. C.) 100 F. 941, 943. The indictment was before the commissioner as evidence for the purpose of establishing or tending to establish the commission of an offense; and the commissioner had authority to pass upon its effect in that aspect only. The court reviewing the action of the commissioner under section 1014 upon habeas corpus was governed by the same rules and its decision was subject to the same limitation. Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 230\n, 35 S. Ct. 54; Benson v. Palmer, 31 App. D. C. 561, 564, 565, 17 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1247. Neither had authority to determine the sufficiency of the indictment as a pleading. 'The only safe rule is to abandon entirely the standard to which the indictment must conform, judged as a criminal pleading, and consider only whether it shows satisfactorily that the fugitive has been in fact, however inartificially, charged with crime in the State from which he has fled.' Pierce v. Creecy, supra, pp. 401, 402 (28 S. Ct. 718). In Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 25 S. Ct. 569, 571 (49 L. Ed. 919) this court said:\n'While we have no desire to minimize what we have already said with regard to the indictment setting out the substance of the offense in language sufficient to apprise \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n the accused of the nature of the charge against him, still it must be borne in mind that the indictment is merely offered as proof of the charge originally contained in the complaint, and not as a complaint in itself or foundation of the charge, which may be supported by oral testimony as well as by the indictment. When the accused is arraigned in the trial court he may take advantage of every insufficiency in the indictment, since it is there the very foundation of the charge, but to hold it to be the duty of the commissioner to determine the validity of every indictment as a pleading, when offered only as evidence, is to put in his hands a dangerous power, which might be subject to serious abuse. If, for instance, he were moved by personal considerations, popular clamor or insufficient knowledge of the law to discharge the accused by reason of the insufficiency of the indictment, it might turn out that the indictment was perfectly valid and that the accused should have been held. But the evil once done is, or may be, irremediable, and the commissioner, in setting himself up as a court of last resort to determine the validity of the indictment, is liable to do a gross injustice.'\n\n See, also, Benson v. Palmer, supra; United States v. Reddin (D. C.) 193 F. 798, 802; In re Hacker (D. C.) 73 F. 464; In re Dana (D. C.) 68 F. 886, 890; Ex parte Mitchell, 1 La. Ann. 413, 414.\n Benson v. Palmer, supra, contains a very full review of the precise question here under consideration. In the course of the opinion, the court, after pointing out that the discharge of the accused from the process under which he was held in the removal proceedings had nothing to do with the process upon which he was subsequently arrested and held by the trial court, that the indictment could be considered in such proceedings only as evidence, and that a finding thereon 'concludes the proceedings for removal, but not for trial,' said (page 568):\n'It is not the policy of our criminal jurisprudence that an accused shall be permitted to escape trial on the merits of the \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n charge against him, through a mere defect in the preliminary proceedings leading up to the trial. No discharge by writ of habeas corpus will operate as a bar to further proceedings in the same cause, unless the inquiry on the petition for the writ involves a full investigation into the merits of the case-the guilt or innocence of the accused.'\n\n It is unnecessary to refer to other authorities. While they are not entirely harmonious the rule to be deduced therefrom is that the judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding can be regarded as conclusive upon the merits only where the case presented is one which calls for a final determination of the ultimate facts and of the law; and not where the proceeding is preliminary and ancillary to a trial upon the merits. See, for example, United States v. Chung Shee (D. C.) 71 F. 277, 280; Kurtz v. State, 22 Fla. 36, 45, 1 Am. St. Rep. 173. Thus it is held that a judgment in a preliminary examination discharging an accused person for want of probable cause is not conclusive upon the question of his guilt or innocence and constitutes no bar to a subsequent trial in the court to which the indictment is returned. Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 129 Mass. 479, 481. Likewise, in extradition proceedings, a discharge for insufficient evidence will not preclude a second inquiry. In re Kelly (C. C.) 26 F. 852. And see Collins v. Loisel, \n262 \nU.S. 426, 429\n, 43 S. Ct. 618; In re Begerow, supra, p. 298. The functions of the commissioner and the court in removal proceedings under section 1014 are of like character and exercised with like effect. The judgment rendered therein, whatever may be its effect in subsequent proceedings of the same character involving the same question-Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 U.S. 224\n, 230-232, 44 S. Ct. 519; Collins v. Loisel, supra, p. 430; United States v. Haas (D. C.) 167 F. 211, 212-does not abridge the power of the trial court to deal independently with the main cause if the accused be subsequently arrested and brought before that court to answer to the indictment. In other words, the commissioner, or the court in review on habeas corpus, for \n\n[267 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n lack of power cannot conclusively adjudge the indictment, qua indictment, to be either good or bad or pass finally upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. A decision discharging the prisoner neither annuls the indictment nor blots out the offense. Upon the case here presented, the trial court alone had plenary jurisdiction over the cause and consequently alone had plenary power to pass upon the sufficiency of the indictment as to the pleading which initiated and was the foundation of the prosecution.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mandate to issue forthwith. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAHMEH v.

One of his legs had to be amputated. To recover for this injury, he filed a libel on March 20, 1922, against the United States as owner of the Quinnipiac, under the Suits in Admiralty Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 St. 525 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1251 1\/4-1251 1\/4 l), in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York where he lived. The steamship Quinnipiac was then in the Southern district of New York. The United States appeared specially and excepted, on the ground that the libel did not show that the steamship was at the date of the filing of the libel within the Eastern district of New York, and there was no jurisdiction. December 20, 1922, the appellant made a motion before the District Court for the Eastern District for an order removing the cause to the Southern district. The District Court denied the motion to transfer the cause, and under a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in The Isonomia, 285 F. 516, that the only district in which such a suit \n\n[267 U.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n could be brought was where the vessel was, dismissed it for want of jurisdiction.\n The Suits in Admiralty Act was passed to provide a suit in personam in lieu of the previous unlimited right of suitors to libel merchant vessels belonging to the United States government in rem in the ports of the United States and in its possessions-a right which had proved objectionable. Section 2 and section 3 of the act indicate the District Courts in which suits under the act were thereafter to be brought. The relevant parts of those sections are as follows:\n Section 2: That 'in cases where if such vessel were privately owned or operated, or if such cargo were privately owned and possessed, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained at the time of the commencement of the action herein provided for, a libel in personam may be brought against the United States or against such corporation, as the case may be, provided that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel or is a tug boat operated by such corporation. Such suits shall be brought in the District Court of the United States for the district in which the parties so suing, or any of them, reside or have their principal place of business in the United States, or in which the vessel or cargo charged with liability is found, ... upon application of either party the cause may, in the discretion of the court, be transferred to any other District Court of the United States.'\n Section 3: 'If the libellant so elects in his libel the suit may proceed in accordance with the principles of libels in rem wherever it shall appear that had the vessel or cargo been privately owned and possessed a libel in rem might have been maintained. Election so to proceed shall not preclude the libellant in any proper case from seeking relief in personam in the same suit.'\n We held in the case of Blamberg Bros. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 452\n, 43 S. Ct. 179, that the act did not authorize a \n\n[267 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n suit in personam against the United States as a substitute for a libel in rem, when a United States vessel was not in a port of the United States or in one of her possessions at the time of filing the libel; that Congress had no power to grant immunity from seizure in respect to such vessels when in foreign ports, and did not intend to do so. There has been a difference of opinion, however, with reference to the meaning of the provisions as to jurisdiction in section 2, relating to vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in the Isonomia Case construed section 2 strictly so far as it provides for jurisdiction, because it depends on the statutory consent of the United States. The court, therefore, came to the conclusion that the language fixing three places of jurisdiction under the act, should not be held to be cumulative but should be applied distributively, and that the provision by which the suits might be brought in the district where the vessel charged with the liability was found should be held to give the only place for jurisdiction in a suit in personam against the United States which was substituted by the act for a suit against the vessel in rem. This same view was held by the District Court in Galban Lobo & Co. v. United States, 285 F. 665, and in Axtell v. United States, 286 F. 165. A different view was taken in a District Court of South Carolina in Middleton & Co. v. United States, 273 F. 199, and in Alsberg v. United States, 285 F. 573, in the Southern District of New York.\n The opinion in the Isonomia Case was carefully prepared, but we think that the rule as to a strict construction of the language of statutes providing for suits against the United States was there carried too far. In taking away what was then the law, namely the right of claimants to sue merchant vessels of the United States as if they were private vessels, Congress was evidently anxious \n\n[267 U.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n to consult the convenience of intending libelants as far as it could, and as the United States was present everywhere in the United States, it named as the proper place for suit either the place of the residence of the parties suing, or of any one of them, or their principal place of business, or where the vessel or cargo charged with liability was found. It further expressly provided that those which would have been under the prior act causes of action in rem might be united with those in personam. To avoid any difficulty in bringing needed parties into the same suit, it directed that the cause might be transferred in the discretion of the court to any other District Court in the United States. These liberal provisions indicate that the language used in the section should have its broad and ordinary meaning, and should not be interpreted in a restricted and distributive sense. We think, therefore, that the suit brought in the district where the libelant resided was a suit brought in accordance with section 2, even though it would have been an action in rem between private parties, and that it made no difference where the vessel then was, provided only, that it was within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n The decree of the court below must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAMPA & MERIDIAN IRR DIST v. BOND(1925)\nNo. 135\nArgued: March 6, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. E. McElroy, of Boise, Idaho, Will R. King, of Portland, Or ., and Fremont Wood, of Boise, Idaho, for appellant.\n Mr. W. W. Dyar, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Bond.\n Mr. J. B. Eldridge, of Boise, Idaho, for appellee Payette-Boise Water Users' Ass'n, Limited.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is an irrigation district organized as a public corporation under the laws of Idaho. In 1915, its supply of water being insufficient to irrigate the lands of all its members, it entered into a contract with the United States, at that time engaged in the construction of the Boise irrigation project, for water to irrigate the unsupplied lands and for the construction of a drainage system \n\n[268 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n within the district. The district undertook to represent these lands in their relations to the government and collect from their owners and pay over to the government construction installments and operation and maintenance charges. The drainage system was constructed in accordance with the contract and the cost thereof, after deducting the amount chargeable to the old water right non-project lands within the district, was paid by the United States as a construction expense and, with other costs of construction, was charged ratably against all the project lands, being 40,000 acres within and 100,000 acres outside the district. After the construction cost, including this drainage, had been fixed by the government, it became necessary to drain project lands outside the district because they were being ruined for agricultural uses by the steadily rising ground level of seepage water due directly to the operation of the irrigation system. Thereupon the Secretary of the Interior authorized the construction of a drainage system for these lands, the cost to be charged to operation and maintenance, and to be borne ratably by all the water users upon project lands both within and without the district.\n Appellant contended that this expenditure was not properly chargeable to operation and maintenance, but was an additional charge for construction, which appellant could not be required to collect and pay over under section 4 of the Reclamation Extension Act of August 13, 1914, c. 247, 38 Stat. 686, 687 (Comp. St.  4713d), which provides that no increase in construction charges shall be made after the same have been fixed, except by agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and a majority of the water right applicants and entrymen to be affected thereby. It was insisted, further, that appellant would be precluded by state law from collecting the charges from owners of non-project lands, because they were not benefited. The government having threatened that, unless the charges were paid, it would shut off the supply \n\n[268 U.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n of water from the project lands within the district, appellant brought this suit to enjoin such action. The federal District Court dismissed the bill (283 F. 569), and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (288 F. 541). Both courts held that the cost was a proper charge as an operating expense, and that the project lands in the district were liable for their proportionate part.\n The contract with the district, among other things, provides:\n'The project lands in the district shall pay the same operation and maintenance charge per acre as announced by the Secretary of the Interior for similar lands of the Boise Project. ...'\n\n We agree with the courts below that the charge in question fairly comes within this provision.\n Section 4 of the Reclamation Extension Act, supra, prevents an increase in the construction charges to be imposed upon the water users without the consent of a majority of them after the amount thereof has been fixed. But this is far from saying that, after the completion of the irrigation system in accordance with the original plan in respect of which the construction charges were fixed, should the need arise to remedy conditions brought about by the use of the system, the government must bear the expense if a majority of the water users whthhold their consent. Expenditures necessary to construct an irrigation system and put it in condition to furnish and properly to distribute a supply of water are chargeable to construction: but, when the irrigation system is completed, expenditures made to maintain it as an efficient going concern, and to operate it effectively to the end for which it was designed are, at least generally, maintenance and operating expenses. The expenditure in question was not for extensions to new lands, or for changes in or additional to the system made necessary by faulty original construction in violation of contractual or statutory obligations (Twin Falls Co. v. Caldwell [C. C. A.] 272 F. 356, 369; Id., \n\n[268 U.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n \n266 \nU.S. 85\n, 45 S. Ct. 22, 69 L. Ed. --), but was for the purpose of overcoming injurious consequences arising from the normal and ordinary operation of the completed plant which, so far as appears, was itself well constructed. The fact that the need of drainage for the district lands, already existing or foreseen, had been supplied, and the cost thereof charged to all the water users as a part of the original construction, by no means compels the conclusion that an expenditure of the same character, the necessity for which subsequently developed as an incident of operation, is not a proper operating charge. The same kind of work under one set of facts may be chargeable to construction and under a different set of facts may be chargeable to maintenance and operation. See Schmidt v. Louisville, C. & L. Ry. Co., 119 Ky. 287, 301, 302, 84 S. W. 314. For example, headgates originally placed are charged properly to construction; but it does not follow that, if an original headgate be swept away, its replacement, though requiring exactly the same kind of materials and work, may not be charged to operation and maintenance.\n Appellant says the lands within the district are not benefited by the drainage in question, and if a direct and immediate benefit be meant, that is quite true. But it is be meant, that is quite true. But it is maintenance or operation considered by itself shall directly benefit every water user, in order that he may be called upon to pay his proportionate part of the cost. If the expenditure of to-day does not especially benefit him, that of yesterday has done so, or that of to-morrow will do so. The irrigation system is a unit, to be, and intended to be, operated and maintained by the use of a common fund, to which all the lands under the system are required to contribute ratably, without regard to benefits specifically and directly received from each detail to which the fund is from time to time devoted.\n This conclusion, we think, fairly accords with the principle established by the Supreme Court of the state in \n\n[268 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n Colburn v. Wilson, 24 Idaho, 94, 104, 132 P. 579, and we see no merit in the contention that under the state law a ratable part of the cost of this drainage cannot be assessed by the district upon the project lands within its limits because they are not benefited thereby. The cost of draining the district project lands was met by a charge imposed in part and proportionately upon the lands in the project outside the district. If now, when the latter need like protection, the district lands are called upon to assume an equivalent obligation, it requires no stretch of the realities to see, following from such an equitable adjustment, a benefit on the whole shared by both classes of lands alike. But in any event, since we find that the expenditure in question properly is chargeable to operation and maintenance, appellant is liable under the express terms of its contract.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT. R. CO. v. CHISHOLM(1925)\nNo. 306\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Lowell A. Mayberry, of Boston, Mass., for New York Cent. R. co.\n Mr. Wm. H. Lewis, of Boston, Mass., for administrator. \n\n[268 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On November 9, 1920, McTier, a citizen of the United States, while employed on a passenger train operated by the New York Central Railroad Company between Malone, N. Y., and Montreal, Canada, suffered fatal injuries at a point 30 miles north of the international line. His administrator, also a citizen of the United States, claiming damages under the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908 (chapter 149, 35 Stat. 65), as amended April 5, 1910 (chapter 143, 36 Stat. 291 [Comp. St .  8657-8665]), brought an action in the United States District Court for Massachusetts and recovered a judgment for $3,000. This went for review to the court below, and it has asked instruction on the question which follows (Judicial Code,  239 [Comp. St.  1216]):\n'Has the administrator of an employee of a common carrier, who receives an injury in a foreign country resulting in his death-the employee and the common carrier being at the time engaged in foreign commerce and both citizens of the United States-a right of action under the federal Employers' Liability Act, or must he rely on the law or statute of the foreign country where the alleged act of negligence occurred or the cause of action arose?'\n\n The Liability Act declares that every common carrier by railroad, while engaging in interstate or foreign commerce, shall be liable to any of its employees, or, in the case of his death, to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and children, if any, if none, then for his parents, if none, then for his next of kin dependent upon him, for all damages which may result from the negligence of any of its officers, agents, or employees, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due to its negligence in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, ways or works. \n\n[268 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n And section 6 provides:\n'Under this act an action may be brought in a Circuit Court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action. The jurisdiction of the courts of the Unites States under this act shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states, and no case arising under this act and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.'\n\n It is unnecessary for us to consider the power of Congress to impose civil liability upon citizens of the United States for torts committed within the territory of another nation. The present case presents nothing beyond a question of construction.\n The statute under consideration lacks the essential characteristics of those, now very common, which provide for compensation to employees injured in the line of duty irrespective of the master's fault. It only undertakes to impose liability for negligence which must be shown by proof ( Southern Ry. Co. v. Gray, \n241 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 36 S. Ct. 558; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147, 150\n, 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139), and demands under it are based wholly upon tort.\n It contains no words which definitely disclose an intention to give it extraterritorial effect, nor do the circumstances require an inference of such purpose. United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 43 S. Ct. 39.\n'Legislation is presumptively territorial and confined to limits over which the law-making power has jurisdiction.' Sandberg v. McDonald, \n248 \nU.S. 185, 195\n, 39 S. Ct. 84, 86 (63 L. Ed. 200).\n\n'The general and almost universal rule is that the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the country where the act is done. ... For another jurisdiction, if it should happen to lay hold of the actor, to treat him according to its \n\n[268 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n own notions rather than those of the place where he did the acts, not only would be unjust, but would be an interference with the authority of another sovereign, contrary to the comity of nations, which the other state concerned justly might resent. ... The foregoing considerations would lead in case of doubt to a construction of any statute as intended to be confined in its operation and effect to the territorial limits over which the lawmaker has general and legitimate power. 'All legislation is prima facie territorial.\" American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 357 S., 20 S. Ct. 511, 512, 513 (53 L. Ed. 826, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047).\n\n In an action brought in a court of the United States to enforce the liability of a Colorado corporation for injuries wrongfully inflicted upon a citizen of Texas while within the territory of Mexico, this court said:\n'But when such a liability is enforced in a jurisdiction foreign to the place of the wrongful act, obviously that does not mean that the act in any degree is subject to the lex fori, with regard to either its quality or its consequences. On the other hand, it equally little means that the law of the place of the act is operative outside its own territory. The theory of the foreign suit is that although the act complained of was subject to no law having force in the forum it gave rise to an obligation, an obligatio, which, like other obligations, follows the person, and may be enforced wherever the person may be found. ... But as the only source of this obligation is the law of the place of the act, it follows that that law determines not merely the existence of the obligation (Smith v. Condry, 1 How. 28), but equally determines its extent.' Slater v. Mexican National R. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 120, 126\n, 24 S. Ct. 581, 582 (48 L. Ed. 900).\n\n Under the circumstances disclosed the administrator had no right of action based upon the federal Employers' Liability Act. The carrier was subject only to such obligations as were imposed by the laws and statutes of the country where the alleged act of negligence occurred, and the administrator could not rely upon any others. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.

STORY(1925)\nNo. 322\nArgued: April 14, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 288, 289]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. R. Prince, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Chapin Brown, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions in this case are two. One is of our jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and turns on its finality. The second is whether a judgment of that court against the North Carolina Railroad Company for injuries caused by the operation of the road by the United States will bar a suit by the company to enjoin the execution of such judgment against its property under section 206 (g) of the Transportation Act of 1920 (chapter 91, 41 Stat. 456, 462 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc]). The relevant part of the section reads as follows:\n'No execution or process ... shall be levied upon the property of any carrier where the cause of action on account of which the judgment was obtained grew out of the possession, use, control, or operation of any railroad or system of transportation by the President under federal control.'\n\n Maggie Barber was killed in North Carolina by a collision between a locomotive of the Southern Railway \n\n[268 U.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n Company and an automobile in which she was riding. It was on the line of the North Carolina Railroad Company, then under a long lease to the Southern Railway Company. King, the administrator of the deceased, sued the North Carolina Company, in the superior court of Guilford county, charging negligence by defendant's lessee. The defendant by answer denied that the death was caused by the negligence of its lessee or its employees, because the railroad was then being operated by the Director General of Railroads. The jury returned a verdict for $2,500 and judgment was entered. An appeal was attempted but was not perfected, due, it is said, to the illness of counsel. Without seeking execution, the administrator instituted a second suit, based on the first judgment, averring that it was unpaid. The company by answer set up section 206 (g), above quoted, as a defense, and averred that the second suit was brought to evade the section. The plaintiff demurred, on the ground that the first judgment had become res judicata. The court rendered judgment with interest and further costs. The company appealed, and the judgment was affirmed. 184 N. C. 442, 115 S. E. 172. The company opposed execution in the lower court, and excepted to the order directing it to Story, the sheriff of Alamance county, to be levied upon certain real estate of the company in that county.\n The company then brought the present action based on section 206 (g) in the superior court of Guilford county against Story and the administrator, seeking to enjoin permanently the execution. The defendants answering admitted the execution but pleaded the second judgment as res judicata. The company secured a temporary restraining order and a rule on the defendants to show cause why the temporary order should not be continued and made permanent. On hearing, the motion to continue the order and make it permanent was denied. The court, pending plaintiff's appeal, stayed the execution \n\n[268 U.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n upon the giving of bond, while the plaintiff was taxed with the costs of the case. On appeal, the action of the lower court was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 187 N. C. 184, 121 S. E. 433. This court then granted a certiorari and brought the case here. \n264 \nU.S. 579\n, 44 S. Ct. 404.\n Section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214), provides that final judgments of the highest court of a state are subject to review by certiorari. Is this judgment a final judgment? We think it is. In its terms it affirms the refusal of the lower court to continue the temporary order and to grant a permanent injunction. The Supreme Court based its decision on the facts admitted in the petition and answer. Its judgment was that the previous judgment as between the parties was res judicata, estopped the company from resisting execution and thereby deprived it of any right to either a temporary or permanent injunction. Injunction was the only relief which the company sought or could seek under its petition and prayer. The affirmance of the judgment of the lower court upon the certified opinion of the Supreme Court left nothing for the Guilford county court to do but to dismiss the petition. Something is said about other issues raised by the administrator in his answer; but the ruling of the Supreme Court ignored them and disposed of the case in his favor. Such a decree is a final decree. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238\n, 22 S. Ct. 881; Mower v. Fletcher, \n114 \nU.S. 127\n, 5 S. Ct. 799; Commissioners v.

Buchanan, 23 Wall. 420; Thomson v. Dean, 7 Wall. 342; Compare Headman v. Commissioners, 177 N. C. 261, 98 S. E. 776.\n It is said that the judge of the lower court, to whom the application for the continuance of the temporary injunction \n\n[268 U.S. 288, 292]\n\u00a0\n and the granting of a permanent injunction in this case had been referred by the regular judge of Guilford county, was a judge of a court of another county, and had by the practice of the state no power to grant a permanent injunction, and so that the appeal from his order denying the application to continue the temporary injunction did not bring to the Supreme Court for its decision the question of the issue of a permanent injunction. The report of the case in the Supreme Court shows it as one presenting the question of an application to continue the temporary injunction and to make it permanent, and whatever the power of a judge of a court in another county in North Carolina to allow a permanent injunction in his court, we must assume from the action of the Supreme Court, and the recital of what was before it, that it intended the Guilford county court on the coming down of its mandate to terminate the case by following its opinion. By the ordinary prectice in equity as administered in England and this country, an appellate court has the power on appeal from a temporary or interlocutory order or decree to examine the merits of the case if sufficiently shown by the pleadings and the record and upon deciding them in favor of the defendant to dismiss the bill and save both parties the needless expense of further prosecution of the suit. Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 \nU.S. 518, 523\n, 524 S., 17 S. Ct. 407, and cases cited; Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 136\n, 33 S. Ct. 657; Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S. Ct. 463. We think we have jurisdiction.\n Coming now to the merits, it may be conceded that the first judgment against the company in favor of the administrator, however erroneous it was in view of the cases of Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554\n, 41 S. Ct. 593, and North Carolina Railroad Company v. Lee, Administrator, \n260 \nU.S. 16\n, 43 S. Ct. 2, not having been appealed from, was res judicata. Nor could section 206 (g) prevent the second judgment. It was not directed against judgments. It was intended to protect \n\n[268 U.S. 288, 293]\n\u00a0\n the property of the company, not by preventing a judgment, but by preventing an execution to satisfy a judgment for injury by government operation of its road, whether that judgment was rendered against the carrier which leased the road, against the carrier which owned the road, or against the government itself. The language of the statute assumes the existence of judgments against carriers for fault of the government management before the section comes into play. There had been so much diversity of practice as to the person against whom the judgment should be rendered in seeking to establish and collect claims for injuries caused in government operation that Congress adopted this unusually broad method of rendering the property of the carriers immune. By virtue of a law of Congress plainly within its power, a distinction was thus made between the judgment and the execution. The state Supreme Court decided that the right to a judgment as between the plaintiff and the railroad company in the second case was established by the first judgment, not that a right to execution thereon was established. 184 N. C. 442, 115 S. E. 172.\n After considering the contention made by the company against the right to a judgment because of section 206 (g), the court said (page 448 [ 115 S. E. 175]):\n'It might suffice to say in answer to this position that plaintiff thus far has not undertaken to levy any process or execution against the property of the defendant road, and his proceeding, therefore, does not come within the literal terms of the provision on which he here relies, but inasmuch as the answer contains averment that plaintiff is wrongfully seeking in this present suit to avoid the force and effect of the statutory provision just quoted, we consider it pertinent to say that in our opinion the judgment sued on does not come within the inhibition as stated.'\n\n The court then proceeded to consider section 10 of the Federal Control Act, 40 Stat. 456 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4j), and paragraphs A, B, C, \n\n[268 U.S. 288, 294]\n\u00a0\n D, E, and G, of section 206 of the Transportation Act of 1920, and to hold that the former was a prohibition against physical interference by third persons, creditors or others, while the road was in the possession of the government, and that the latter was a protection of the carriers in possession from physical interference by actions or judgments provided and allowed for by the government. 'But,' said the court, 'this legislation in our view was never intended to protect the carriers from judgments in independent suits by claimants when they have failed to plead or properly insist on the immunity from liability which had been provided for their protection.' In effect, the court gave two reasons for its conclusion, the first of which was that it was not dealing with an execution and the second that section 206 (g) did not apply to either a judgment or an execution in a case like the one before it. But the point adjudged was not the effect of section 206 (g) on an execution, whatever the inference from the court's reasoning. The estoppel of the court's conclusion reached only the judgment.\n It is well settled that the principle of res judicata is only applicable to the point adjudged and not to points only collaterally under consideration, or incidentally under cognizance or only to be inferred by arguing from the decree.

HOFFMAN(1925)\nNo. 323\nArgued: April 14, 1925Decided: May 11, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, brought action in the district court of Platt county, Wyoming, against the board of county commissioners of that county, asserting the illegality of the establishment of a certain road running through and appropriating for that purpose part of plaintiff's land. The petition prayed that the defendants 'be perpetually restrained from taking any further proceedings or doing acts with respect to locating said proposed road.' The defendants appeared and answered and after hearing upon the issues of law and fact, judgment of the district court was entered denying relief to the plaintiff. Plaintiff thereupon removed the cause by petition in error to the Su- \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n preme Court of the State of Wyoming, which affirmed the decree of the lower court. 30 Wyo. 238, 219 P. 561.\n The case comes here upon assignments of error calling in question both the constitutionality of the public road law of the State of Wyoming and the proceedings had under it resulting in opening the road across the plaintiff's land, on the ground that such statutes and procedure amounted to a denial of due process of law and a taking of property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The particular grounds of attack are that the notice of the proceedings was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the constitutional provision; that there was, under the provisions of the statute, a denial of an opportunity to plaintiff in error to be heard and that the entire proceedings were void for want of the sufficient statutory petition for initiating them.\n The applicable statutory provisions, so far as material to the present inquiry, may be summarily stated as follows:\n The statute of the State of Wyoming, known as the 'Road Act,' Wyoming Compiled Statutes of 1910 as amended by Laws of 1913, chapter 73, prescribes the following procedure for the location and establishment of public roads:\n\n\n (a)\n A petition for the establishment of a road signed by ten or more electors of the county residing within fifteen miles of the proposed road, may be filed in the office or the county clerk (section 2516).\n\n\n (b)\n Upon the filing of the petition, the board of county commissioners, or its chairman, is required to appoint a disinterested elector, who may be a member of the board, as a viewer to determine whether the proposed road is required (section 2518).\n\n\n (c)\n The viewer is required to report whether the proposed road is practicable and ought to be established, stat- \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n ing probable cost and such other matters as shall enable the board to act understandingly (section 2521).\n\n\n (d)\n If the board shall determine to establish the road, it is required to appoint a day, not less than thirty days after such determination on or before which date all objections and claims for damages are required to be filed with the county clerk (section 2524).\n\n\n (e)\n By Laws of Wyoming 1913, chapter 73 (section 2525), it is provided that notice of the proposed establishing of the road shall be published 'for three successive weeks in three successive issues of some official newspaper published in the county, if any such there be, and if no newspaper be published therein, such notice shall be posted in at least three public places along the line of said proposed or altered road,' and the statute provides that 'publication and posting of such notice shall be a legal and sufficient notice to all persons owning lands or claiming any interest in lands over which the proposed road is to be located or altered.' The statute does not require that the notice shall state the time within which objections and claims may be filed and there is no direct statutory requirement that the board shall hear objections to the establishment of a road or claims for damages, although it is given power 'to continue all such claims for a further hearing' until the matter can be disposed of ( section 2527).\n\n\n (f)\n When claims for damages are filed, the board, 'at its next regular or special meeting, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable or convenient,' is required to appoint three suitable and disinterested electors of the county as appraisers to view the road, on a day to be fixed by the board and to report in writing within thirty days fixing the amount of damage sustained by the claimants (section 2528).\n\n\n (g)\n The appraisers are required to view the ground and fix the amount of damages sustained by each claimant \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n after allowing for benefits which may accrue by reason of the location of the road. They may notify claimants of the time and place of their meeting; and may hear evidence (section 2530).\n\n\n (h)\n At the next meeting of the board of county commissioners after the report of the appraisers has been filed, the board may hear testimony and consider petitions and may fix damages increasing or diminishing them and establish the road (section 2531).\n\n\n (i)\n There are no statutory provisions requiring notice of the meeting of appraisers to be given to claimants or giving to them a right to be heard, either by the board of appraisers or the board of county commissioners to whom the appraisers are required to report. But from the final decision of the board establishing the road and fixing the amount of damages, any applicant for damages may appeal to the district court of the county which has jurisdiction to determine the amount of the damages in the same manner as in a court action. Notice of appeal is required to be filed with the clerk of the court within thirty days after the decision of the board (section 2536).\n A written instrument purporting to be a petition for location of the road in question was filed with the board of county commissioners and the chairman of the board thereupon appointed himself a viewer pursuant to section 2524 of the Road Law. Acting in that capacity, he reported to the board recommending the establishment of the road. Public notice dated May 8, 1917, of the proposed establishing of the road was given by publication, in accordance with the statute for four successive weeks, in a local newspaper, the first publication being dated May 9th and the last being dated May 30, 1917. In the form provided by the statute and in accordance with a permissive provision of the statute (section 2525 as amended), the notice as published contained the informa- \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n tion that all objections to the proposed road and all claims for damages 'must be' filed not later than June 7, 1917. By stipulation entered into by plaintiff with the board, the time to file claims for damages was extended until July 7, 1917. On June 30, 1917, which was after the date fixed by the published notice for filing objections and claims, and more than thirty days after the decision of the board to locate the road and more than days after publication of the notice, plaintiffs filed objections to the establishment of the road as unauthorized under the laws and Constitution of the State of Wyoming and of the United States and made claim of damages, without specifying any amount, for the opening of the road.\n In the meantime and on June 8, 1917, the board appointed appraisers to determine the damages occasioned by the establishment of the proposed road, directing them to view the said proposed road for the purpose of determining damages. On the 16th day of June, 1917, they reported that the benefits to be derived from the road exceeded the damages to land owners. The proceedings had by the appraisers were ex parte and without notice to the plaintiff. Thereafter, on August 10, 1917, the board of county commissioners of Platt county took final action establishing the road in accordance with the petition and took no action fixing or determining the damages of any claimant. Plaintiff took no appeal from the determination of the county commissioners authorizing the location of the road as provided by section 2536, and on November 30, 1917, brought its action for an injunction.\n Messrs. George G. King and Max Pam, both of Chicago, Ill., and Roderick N. Matson, of Cheyenne, Wyo., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the Supreme Court of Wyoming, on error to the district court of Platt county, plaintiff urged various technical objections to the procedure had under the road law of Wyoming for the establishment of the proposed road, particularly that the petition for the establishment of the road was insufficient within the provisions of the statute and also duly presented to the court for its consideration, the constitutional objections which are urged here.\n The Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the procedure followed complied with the statutory requirements. By that determination we are bound. American Land Co. v. Zeiss, \n219 \nU.S. 47\n, 31 S. Ct. 200; Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n255 \nU.S. 445\n, 41 S. Ct. 373. That court also held that under the terms of the Statute, section 2524, the time for filing objections to the establishment of the road and claims for damages could not be extended by the board of county commissioners and that the plaintiff having failed to file its objection and claim within the statutory period, was thereby foreclosed from further proceedings under it . By this interpretation of the meaning and effect of the statute of Wyoming we are likewise bound, but we are nevertheless free to inquire whether the statute as interpreted and applied by the state court denies rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to consider the contention of plaintiff in error that the statute itself is unconstitutional because of the insufficiency of the required notice of the proceedings had under it, and because by it plaintiff was denied a hearing within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Under the requirements of that Amendment property may not be taken for public use without reasonable notice of the proceedings authorized for its taking and \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n without reasonable opportunity to be heard as to substantial matters of right affected by the taking. But a state statute does not contravene the provisions of that Amendment unless, in some substantial way, it infringes the fundamental rights of citizens and in passing on the constitutionality of a state law, its effect must be judged in the light of its practical application to the affairs of men as they are ordinarily conducted.\n All persons are charged with knowledge of the provisions of statutes and must take note of the procedure adopted by them and when that procedure is not unreasonable or arbitrary there are no constitutional limitations relieving them from conforming to it. This is especially the case with respect to those statutes relating to the taxation or condemnation of land. Such statutes are universally in force and are general in their application, facts of which the land owner must take account in providing for the management of his property and safeguarding his interest in it. Owners of real estate may so order their affairs that they may be informed of tax or condemnation proceedings of which there is published notice, and the law may be framed in recognition of that fact. In consequence, it has been uniformly held that statutes providing for taxation or condemnation of land may adopt a procedure, summary in character, and that notice of such proceedings may be indirect, provided only that the period of notice of the initiation of proceedings and the method of giving it are reasonably adapted to the nature of the proceedings and their subject matter and afford to the property owner reasonable opportunity at some stage of the proceedings to protect his property from an arbitrary or unjust appropriation. Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway & Improvement Co., \n130 \nU.S. 559\n, 9 S. Ct. 603; Ballard v. Hunter, \n204 U.S. 241\n, at page 262, 27 S. Ct. 261.\n The limitation of time provided by the Wyoming Statute for filing notice of objection and claim for \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n damages to thirty days after the determination of the board of county commissioners to establish a public road does not, on its face, appear to be unreasonable and no foundation is laid either in the record or briefs of counsel for the contention that it is, in its practical operation, unreasonable for that purpose, or that by it there was a denial of due process of law. A like or less period of notice by publication has been repeatedly held by this court to satisfy the constitutional requirements for the initiation of proceedings to enforce assessment or tax liens. Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526\n, 16 S. Ct. 83; Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 680\n, 18 S. Ct. 229; Ballard v. Hunter, supra.\n So also with respect to judicial proceedings affecting title to land, Arndt v. Griggs, \n134 \nU.S. 316\n, 10 S. Ct. 557; Hamilton v. Brown, \n161 \nU.S. 256\n, 16 S. Ct. 585, and with respect to the condemnation or appropriation of land for public use, Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway & Improvement Co., supra; Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57\n, 40 S. Ct. 62.\n There remains for consideration the plaintiff's objection that the statutory method of giving notice of the proposed location of the road under section 2525 of the Statute was insufficient and that plaintiff was afforded no opportunity for a hearing before either the appraisers or the board of county commissioners with respect either to the location of the road or the damage suffered by plaintiff by the opening of the road. The taking of property provided for by the statute is a taking of land under the direction of public officers for a public use. As was held in Bragg v. Weaver, supra, the necessity and expediency of the taking of property for public use 'are legislative questions, no matter who may be charged with their decision, and a hearing thereon is not essential to due process in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment.' Joslin Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668, 678\n, 43 S. Ct. 684; Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 \nU.S. 472, 483\n, 44 S. Ct. 369. With respect to the compensation \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 285]\n\u00a0\n for the taking, however, due process requires that the owner be given opportunity to be heard, upon reasonable notice of the pending proceedings. See Bragg v. Weaver, supra.\n There being a newspaper published within Platt county, notice of the initiation of the proceedings for the establishment of the road by publication for three successive weeks in three successive issues of some official paper published in the county, is made mandatory by section 2525 of the Public Road Law of Wyoming, as amended by chapter 73 of the Laws of Wyoming of 1913 and the requirements of this statute were fully complied with. These requirements in all material respects are identical with those passed upon by this court in Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway & Improvement Co ., supra, in which it was held that a statute of Kansas providing for the condemnation of land for use for railroad purposes might be effected on thirty days' notice by publication in a newspaper, satisfied all the requirements of due process of law.\n And see also Bragg v. Weaver, supra, holding that in proceedings for the condemnation of property for public use, notice by publication is constitutionally sufficient. See, also, Castillo v. McConnico, Ballard v. Hunter, Arndt v. Griggs, and Hamilton v. Brown. supra, upholding a like procedure for the foreclosure of assessment or tax liens.\n But the plaintiff in error objects to the procedure established by the statute because under it, plaintiff was afforded no opportunity for a hearing either before the appraisers or the board of county commissioners, and in consequence, assuming the sufficiency of the notice, there was a denial of due process of law in determining the amount of damage or compensation to be awarded for the taking of plaintiff's property. When there is a constitutional right to a hearing, as was held in Bragg v. Weaver, supra, one constitutional method of fixing \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 286]\n\u00a0\n damages 'among several admissible modes is that of causing the amount to be assessed by viewers, subject to an appeal to a court carrying with it a right to have the matter determined upon a full trial.' This is the rule adopted in numerous other cases. See Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway & Improvement Co., supra; Lent v. Tillson, \n140 \nU.S. 316\n, 11 S. Ct. 825, and Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, supra. It is the mode of procedure adopted by the Wyoming Statute. Section 2536 provides for an appeal to the district court of the county within thirty days after the decision of the board of county commissioners establishing the road.\n Plaintiff in error does not deny the soundness of the rule, but questions its applicability to the present case on the ground that the procedure established by the statute affords no means of ascertaining at what time the final decision of the board of county commissioners establishing the road is made, and consequently when the time to appeal to the district court, as provided by section 2536, begins to run. It is urged that notwithstanding the fact that the board of county commissioners may lawfully meet and reach a final decision, and notwithstanding the fact that the board in the present case kept minutes and recorded its action in making final decision to establish the road in question, nevertheless the law provides for no public record from which the decision of the board may be ascertained and claimants are denied any legal means of ascertaining whether in fact such action has been taken.\n In making this contention, plaintiff in error overlooks the plain effect of sections 1413 and 1424 of the Compiled Statutes of Wyoming of 1920 which were in force at the time of the proceedings in question. By section 1413 it is provided that all meetings of the board of county commissioners are public meetings and section 1424 requires that all proceedings of the board of county \n\n[268 U.S. 276, 287]\n\u00a0\n commissioners shall be published in a newspaper of the county and the county clerk is required to furnish such paper with a copy of the proceedings of each meeting for that purpose, within forty-eight hours after adjournment. No contention was made in the courts below or here that the requirements of these sections of the law were not complied with, and there is no basis for such contention in the assignments of error.\n Having in mind the character of the procedure in condemnation proceedings and the numerous decisions of this court, to which reference has been made, establishing what is a due procedure in this class of cases, we have no hesitancy in holding that the method provided by section 1424 of giving notice of the final decision of the board of county commissioners establishing the road is reasonably adapted to the other procedure laid down in the statute, that it affords reasonable opportunity to claimants to ascertain the fact and that it satisfies all constitutional requirements. A landowner who had notice of the initiation of the proceedings for the opening of the road published in accordance with the statute, which notice as we have seen under the decisions of this court is constitutionally sufficient, would have experienced no practical difficulty in ascertaining when the board of county commissioners took final action and by filing notice of appeal to the district court within thirty days thereafter, he could have secured the full hearing to which he is constitutionally entitled. Having failed to adopt such procedure, the plaintiff cannot complain of a denial of due process of law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wyoming is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC. RY. CO. v. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS OF WASHINGTON(1925)\nNo. 371\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 39, 40]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. W. Bunn, of St. Paul, Minn., F. M. Dudley, of Seattle, Wash., and John H. Carroll, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Raymond W. Clifford, of Olympia, Wash., Scott Z. Henderson, of Tacoma, Wash., and John H. Dunbar, of Olympia, Wash., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The intrastate transportation of sawlogs in carload lots constitutes a large part of all of the intrastate freight traffic in Washington on each of the four transcontinental railroad systems by which much of that service is performed. \n1\n Prior to federal control the rates had, with \n\n[268 U.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n few exceptions, been initiated from time to time by individual tariffs of the several carriers. In 1918 the Director General of Railroads made a horizontal increase of 25 per cent. In 1920, after the decision in Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220, a further increase of 25 per cent. was authorized by the Public Service Commission of the state. Complaint was made that some of the rates as so raised were excessive and discriminatory, and that the rate structure lacked uniformity.\n On December 28, 1920, the Public Service Commission instituted a proceeding before itself for the purpose of investigating the log rates and making such order thereon as the facts found should warrant. Hearings were duly had in which shippers and the four transcontinental carriers participated. Much evidence was introduced. The carriers insisted that the existing rates were unremunerative. They also filed, during the hearings, a joint tariff embodying the higher rates which they deemed reasonable. A suspension order issued, and the two proceedings were consolidated. On February 1, 1922, the Department of Public Works (by which the functions of the commission had come to be exercised) made a report in which it found that the existing rates were highly remunerative. Thereupon it entered an order which, among other things, abrogated all the intrastate log tariffs then in force, canceled the suspended joint tariff filed by the carriers, and established a uniform distance tariff applicable to these railroads, to remain in effect during an experimental period of 12 months, or until further order of the department. The tariff so prescribed reduced greatly the rates theretofore prevailing. It was estimated that the revenues of the several carriers from this traffic would be lessened from 15 to 37 per cent. and that additional losses in revenue would result from changes prescribed concerning minimum loadings.\n This suit was brought by the carriers against the department, in the superior court of Thurston county, to \n\n[268 U.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n set aside the order on the ground, among others, that it deprived them of property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The findings of fact upon which the order proceeded were attacked as arbitrary and unsupported by the evidence. The prescribed rates were assailed as confiscatory. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585\n, 30 S. Ct. 423. Upon the giving of bonds the court superseded and suspended the order, except in so far as it canceled the joint tariff of higher rates filed by the carriers. \n2\n After full hearing the court entered a final decree denying the relief sought. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, three judges dissenting. 125 Wash. 584, 217 P. 507. The case is here under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended (Comp. St.  1214). A motion to dismiss on the ground that the judgment is not reviewable on writ of error was postponed to the hearing on merits. The motion is denied. Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 683\n, 43 S. Ct. 675. As to the merits, many errors are assigned. It will be sufficient to consider one. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The log traffic is limited substantially to the section of the state lying west of the Cascade Mountains. The average length of its haul on each of these roads is not more than 32 miles. The three principal carriers presented \n\n[268 U.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n evidence tending to show that their existing rates were so low as not to yield any return upon the property employed in the business, and that the rates did not defray fully the operating costs of the traffic and its proportion of the taxes payable. This evidence was in character persuasive. It was fairly specific, direct, and comprehensive. If the facts warranted, the shippers and the public officials might, of course, have shown by evidence of similar character that the carriers' evidence was inherently untrustworthy, or it might have been overcome by more persuasive evidence to the contrary. Little attempt was made to show that any testimony introduced by the carriers was inherently untrustworthy. Little conflict with the evidence of the carriers was developed by the evidence as to specific facts introduced for the shippers and the public. Apparently necessary inferences from specific facts established by the carriers were not explained away. The department's findings concerning operating costs rested largely upon deductions from data found in published reports of the carriers and in their exhibits filed in this case. Instead of attempting to show by evidence, reasonably specific and direct, what the actual operating cost of this traffic was to the several carriers, the department created a composite figure representing the weighted average operating cost per 1,000 gross ton miles of all revenue freight carried on the four systems and made that figure a basis for estimating the operating cost of the log traffic in Washington. \n4\n This was clearly erroneous.\n A precise issue was the cost on each railroad of transporting logs in carload lots in Western Washington, the average haul on each system being not more than 32 \n\n[268 U.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n miles. In using the above composite figure in the determination of this issue the department necessarily ignored, in the first place, the differences in the average unit cost on the several systems, and then the differences on each in the cost incident to the different classes of traffic and articles of merchandise, and to the widely varying conditions under which the transportation is conducted. In this unit cost figure no account is taken of the differences in unit cost dependent, among other things, upon differences in the length of haul,5 in the character of the commodity, in the configuration of the country, in the density of the traffic, in the daily loaded car movement, in the extent of the empty car movement, in the nature of the equipment employed, in the extent to which the equipment is used, and in the expenditures required for its maintenance. Main line and branch line freight, interstate and intrastate, carload and less than carload, are counted alike. The department's error was fundamental in its nature. The use of this factor in computing the operating costs of the log traffic vitiated the whole process of reasoning by which the department reached its conclusion.\n The mere admission by an administrative tribunal of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent (United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 565, 68 L, Ed. 1016), or mere error in reasoning upon evidence introduced, does not invalidate an order. But where rates found by a regulatory body to be compensatory are attacked as being confiscatory, courts may inquire into the method by which its conclusion was reached. An order based \n\n[268 U.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n upon a finding made without evidence (The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317), or upon a finding made upon evidence which clearly does not support it (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Ct. 108), is an arbitrary act against which courts afford relief. The error under discussion was of this character. It was a denial of due process. Compare New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 \nU.S. 345, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 122. The invalidity was not avoided by making the order, in terms, for an experimental period. The rates as to which the evidence was primarily directed were those in force before and during the hearings. If even the existing rates were confiscatory, as the carriers' evidence embodying the results of ample experience tended to show, there could be no reason for awaiting the test of the much lower rates which were prescribed. The cases which applied the principle of awaiting the result of an experimental period for untried rates have no application here. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19\n, 26 S.

LARNEY(1925)\nNo. 146\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nathan A. Gibson and Joseph L. Hull, both of Muskogee, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Elias J. Van Court, of Eufaula, Okl., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to quiet title to a tract of land in Oklahoma, alleged to have been allotted to Larney, a Creek Indian, as a distributive share of the lands of the Creek Nation. The District Court rendered a decree for appellees, which upon appeal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 289 F. 395. In the trial court the jurisdiction was in no way called in question; but it was challenged, for the first time, in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and is challenged here. It is alleged that all the parties are citizens and residents of Oklahoma, and the question of jurisdiction depends upon whether the suit arises under a law of the United States. The bill avers that Larney went into possession of the allotment by authority of treaties between the Creek Nation and the United States and the laws of Congress dealing with the land and individuals of that Nation. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that while this allegation is insufficient to establish jurisdiction (Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 \nU.S. 74\n, 34 S. Ct. 724; Hull v. Burr, \n234 \nU.S. 712, 720\n, 34 S. Ct. 892), it sufficiently appears elsewhere in the record that the suit arose under an act of Congress and its solution depended on the construction and effect of that act. On this the circuit court of appeals held the district court had jurisdiction and disposed of the case upon the merits. The Act of March 3, 1905, c. 1479, 33 Stat. 1048, 1071, provides:\n'That the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes is authorized for sixty days after the date of the approval of this act to receive and consider applications for enrollments of children born subsequent to May 25, 1901, and prior to March 4, 1905, and living on said latter date, to citizens of the Creek Tribe of Indians whose enrollment has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior prior to the date of the approval of this act; and to enroll and make allotments to such children.'\n\n In pursuance of that act the \n\n[266 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner (successor of the Commission, Martin v. United States, 168 F. 200, 93 C. C. A. 484) enrolled a child under the name of Cheparney Larney. The decision of the Commissioner recites that, in 1905, a Creek field party went to the home of this child, then about a year old, to obtain information in respect of his right of enrollment, that the parents refused to give any information, and that the child was thereupon called by the name of Cheparney Larney, 'Cheparney' being a Creek word signifying 'little boy.' The important words of the decision are:\n'The evidence and the records of this office show that said Cheparney Larney is the child of Jacob Larney and Bettie Larney, whose names appear as 'Big Jack' and 'Bettie' on a schedule of citizens by blood of the Creek Nation, approved by the Secretary of the Interior March 28, 1902, opposite Nos. 8291 and 8292 respectively.'\n\n Thereupon the Commissioner held that Cheparney Larney was entitled to be enrolled under the foregoing act of Congress, and the application for his enrollment was accordingly granted. The appellee, Larney, is the son of Jacob and Bettie Larney, and the evidence shows that the allotment deed was delivered to Jacob, the father, and that appellee went into possession of the land under the deed some time prior to the commencement of this suit. It appears from the evidence that Jacob and Bettie Larney are not the same persons as 'Big Jack' and 'Bettie,' but that they are citizens of the Creek Tribe and actually enrolled, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, at the right time, under the numbers 7968 and 8631\n\n\n On behalf of appellants it was contended that 'Big Jack' and 'Bettie,' his wife, had three children, the youngest of whom was known as Cheparney Larney, and that it is to this child the decision of the Commissioner relates. In support of this contention appellants insisted, and still insists, that the requirement of the statute-that children born to citizens of the Creek Tribe 'whose enroll ment \n\n[266 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior prior to the date of the approval of this act' should be enrolled and receive allotments- necessitated an identification of the parents of the child and a finding that they were enrolled with the approval of the Secretary together with the names and numbers under which they appeared on the tribal roll. Thus construing the statute, it was and is insisted that the recital in the decision of the Commissioner, that the names of the parents of Cheparney Larney appear as 'Big Jack' and 'Bettie' opposite Nos. 8291 and 8292, conclusively establishes that the individual enrolled was the child of the persons identified by these aliases and numbers. On the other hand, the contention of appellees is that no finding of this character is required by the statute and that the recital is, therefore, not conclusive, but open to explanation and contradiction. It thus appears that the right set up by appellees would be defeated by the construction of the act, as appellants contend, but would be supported by the opposite construction. The case, therefore, in fact is one arising under a law of the United States within the meaning of section 24, subdivision 1, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991). See Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 822; Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic C. L. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 501, 506\n, 30 S. Ct. 184.\n Upon this state of facts appearing of record, we are of opinion that the circuit court of appeals was right in sustaining the jurisdiction of the trial court. Denny v. Pironi, \n141 U.S. 121\n, 124-125, 11 S. Ct. 966; Robertson v. Cease, \n97 U.S. 646\n, 648; Sun Printing & Publishing Assn. v. Edwards, \n194 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 24 S. Ct. 696. It is quite true that the jurisdiction of a federal court must affirmatively and distinctly appear and cannot be helped by presumptions or by argumentative inferences drawn from the pleadings. If it does not thus appear by the allegations of the bill or complaint, the trial court, upon having its attention called to the defect or upon discovering it, must dismiss \n\n[266 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n the case, unless the jurisdictional facts be supplied by amendment. But here no action was taken by that court and none was asked by appellant. Both court and parties proceeded as though the necessary allegations had been made, as they undoubtedly could have been made either originally or, under leave of the trial court, by amendment at any stage of the proceedings, while the record remained under the control of that court. Mexican Central Railway v. Duthie, \n189 \nU.S. 76, 77\n, 78 S., 23 S. Ct. 610. And if this court should now reverse the decree and remand the cause, that amendment could still be allowed by the trial court. Continental Ins. Co. v. Rhoads, \n119 \nU.S. 237, 240\n, 7 S. Ct. 193; Menard v. Goggan, \n121 \nU.S. 253\n, 7 S. Ct. 874; Robertson v. Cease, supra, pages 650, 651; Horne v. George H. Hammond Co., \n155 \nU.S. 393\n, 15 S. Ct. 167; Stuart v. Easton, \n156 \nU.S. 46\n, 15 S. Ct. 268. True, the practice of this court has been to remit the question of amendment to the lower court unless the parties consented to an amendment here. Udall v. Steamship Ohio, 17 How. 17, 18, 19; Kennedy et al. v. Georgia State Bank et al., 8 How. 586, 610, 611. But under section 954, Rev. Stats. ( Comp. St.  1591) the power of this court, in its discretion, to allow such amendments (see Kennedy et al. v. Georgia State Bank et al., supra; Anon., 1 Fed. Cas. 996, No. 444), and its duty to do so in appropriate cases, cannot be doubted. And where, as here, the jurisdictional facts appear upon the face of the record; where the very contention of the party interposing the challenge to the jurisdiction is such as to plainly establish it, beyond the possibility of successful dispute, thus eliminating any element of surprise; and where the amendment must necessarily be allowed by the trial court, it would be mere ceremony to reverse the decree and remit the purely formal making of the amendment to the lower court. We shall, therefore, consider the bill as amended to conform to the facts of record and sustain the jurisdiction of the district court. See Shaw v. Railroad Co., \n101 \nU.S. 557, 566\n, 567 S.; Thayer v. Manley, 73 N. Y. 305, 309, 310. \n\n[266 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n We come then to the merits. The issues to be determined by the Commissioner are found in the act of Congress already quoted. A reading of that act demonstrates that the material facts to be found and, consequently, those alone which the findings of the Commissioner conclusively establish, are that the child was born between May 25, 1901, and March 4, 1905; that he was living on the latter date; and that his parents were citizens of the Creek Tribe of Indians whose enrollment had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior prior to the date of the approval of the act. Inquiry as to whether the parents of the child were known by other names, and, if so, what those names were, as well as the precise numbers under which they were enrolled, was incidental or collateral to the direct issue presented by the statute, which was, Were they enrolled with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior at the proper tim? Recitals in respect of such matters or of other merely identifying circumstances such as the exact age of the child, its sex, etc . (Hegler v. Faulkner, \n153 \nU.S. 109, 117\n, 118 S., 14 S. Ct. 779; Malone v. Alderdice, 212 F. 668, 129 C. C. A. 204; United States v. Lena (C. C. A.) 261 F. 144, 149, 150; Porter v. United States, 260 F. 1, 4, 171 C. C. A. 37) are not conclusive in subsequent proceedings about the same subject-matter. The principle of res judicata does not apply to points which come under consideration only collaterally or incidentally. Duchess of Kingston's Case, 2 Smith's Leading Cases (7th Am. Ed., Hare & Wallace) 609, 610 (*573); Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat, 109, 114; Campbell v. Consalus, 25 N. Y. 613, 616, 617; People v. Johnson, 38 N. Y. 63, 64-66, 97 Am. Dec. 770. But apart from these considerations, parol evidence was admissible to resolve the latent ambiguity, disclosed by the record, arising from the use of names and aliases as though belonging to the same persons but, in fact, belonging to different persons.\n The evidence in respect of the identity of the child to whom the allotment was made is conflicting. Upon this \n\n[266 U.S. 511, 518]\n\u00a0\n evidence both courts below found the fact to be that appellee, Larney, was the person to whom the Commission's decision related and to whom the allotment was made. The well-settled rule of this court is that where two courts have reached the same conclusion upon a question of fact it will be accepted here unless clearly erroneous. Bodkin v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 221, 223\n, 41 S. Ct. 268; Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S. Ct. 333. An examination of the evidence not only fails to disclose such clear error but, on the contrary, establishes the conclusion of the lower courts by a clear preponderance.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO UTILITIES CO. v. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO(1925)\nNo. 210\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Timothy S. Hogan and J. C. Martin, both of Columbus, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. J. W. Bricker, of Columbus, Ohio, and B. D. Huggins, of Hillsboro, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Ohio Utilities Company is engaged in supplying gas and electricity for light, heat, and power to various communities in Ohio. In 1920 it filed with the Utilities Commission rate schedules for gas and electrical service in the village of Hillsboro. The rates were protested and the commission ordered a hearing. Pending a decision, the company was allowed to collect the rates in accordance with its schedule upon condition that it would return to its customers any excess over the rates finally fixed, for the due performance of which it furnished a bond. After a hearing and rehearing, the commission reduced the electrical service rates set forth in the company's schedule, and fixed the same for residence and commercial lighting at 12 cents per kilowatt hour for the first 200 hours per month and 10 cents per kilowatt hour for all over 200 hours, and for private garage automobile charging a minimum of $1 per month net. As a basis for these rates, the commission found that the fair value of the physical property of the company, used and useful in the furnishing of electrical service to consumers in Hillsboro, was $138,521, to which allowances were added as follows: Taxes during construction, $1, 081; interest during construction, $1,500; to maintain an adequate stock of materials and supplies, $1,071; working capital for carrying on the electrical service in Hillsboro, $2,882-bringing the value of the property, as of August 30, 1920, for rate-making purposes, to the total sum of \n\n[267 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n $145,055. The commission further found that the reasonable operating expenses (including an allowance of $3,000 for taxes) in furnishing such electrical service for a period of one year should be $37,608, and a reasonable annual allowance for depreciation should be $7,252 (being 5 per centum of the value), making a total of $44,860. The commission then found that a reasonable return to the company for the period of one year would be $8,703, and estimated that the rates fixed would produce the aggregate of these two sums, namely, $53,563. Upon error to the state Supreme Court the order of the commission was affirmed. 108 Ohio St. 143, 140 N. E. 497.\n The order of the commission is assailed as confiscatory, and therefore in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The specific grounds of complaint in respect of the order, so far as necessary to be stated and considered, are as follows: (1) The value of the property should have been fixed at $154,655.93; (2) under the evidence, the allowance for operating expenses, including taxes, should have been at least $38,744.85; (3) the return to the company should have been on the basis of 8 per cent. upon the value stated in (1), or $12,372 annually.\n Property Valuation. An examination of the record shows that the engineers of the commission made an itemized inventory and valuation of the company's property, based on reproduction value less depreciation, from which it appears that the aggregate fair value of the property for rate-making purposes was $154,655.93. This valuation was confirmed by the oral testimony of the engineers; it was acquiesced in by the company, and we find no substantial evidence in the record to the contrary. The commission accepted the valuation of its engineers in all respects except that it rejected or reduced the amount of the following items: Preliminary organization expenses, $5,000, rejected outright; interest for one year's construction period, reduced from $4,507.98, as estimated and \n\n[267 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n recommended, to $1,500, a reduction of $3,007.98; working capital, being one-twelfth of the annual operating expenses and cost of coal for one month, reduced from $4,198.42 to $2,882, a reduction of $1,316.42. It also appears that the engineers' valuation of the buildings and plant equipment , $122,276.15, was carried into the commission's computation at the round sum of $122,000. The aggregate, therefore, of the rejections and reductions is $9,600.55.\n The item of $5,000 seems to have been rejected upon the ground that there was no proof of actual expenditure. Reproduction value, however, is not a matter of outlay, but of estimate, and should include a reasonable allowance for organization and other overhead charges that necessarily would be incurred in reproducing the utility. In estimating what reasonably would be required for such purposes, proof of actual expenditures originally made, while it would be helpful, is not indispensable. The commission's chief engineer, explaining the appearance of the item in his report, called attention to the account system prescribed by the commission, which, among other things, provided that under the head of 'organization' was included incorporation fees paid to the government and other fees and expenses incident to organizing the utility and placing it in readiness to do business, attorney's fees, cost of preparing and issuing certificates of stock, etc., and testified that the item was an estimate made as the result of an investigation by the commission's engineer on the spot. There was no testimony to the contrary; and the company, in view of the concession, evidently deemed it unnecessary to produce evidence upon the point. That such expenditures in a substantial amount would necessarily be made in reproducing the utility is clear; it is not suggested that the estimate of the engineers is excessive or unfairly made and the rejection of the entire amount cannot be regarded as otherwise than arbitrary. \n\n[267 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n The reduction of the item for interest seems to be of like character. The engineers' estimate was based upon their conclusion that it would require one year for the construction of the plant, and interest at 6 per cent. was allowed on the estimated cost for half of that period. There is no justification in the record, so far as we can see, for a reduction of the item to an amount which is less than one-third of the engineers' estimate.\n The item for working capital was carefully worked out by the commission's own engineers, there was no evidence to the contrary, and the reduction seems to have been equally capricious.\n The curtailment of the estimated value of the buildings and plant equipment by the sum of $276.15 finds no explanation in the record, and probably was a sacrifice to the easy convenience of round numbers.\n Operating Expenses. The commission's engineers reported and testified that the actual operating expenses for the year ending February 28, 1921, were $38,744.85, to which should be added the amount of a reasonable depreciation allowance, fixed by the commission itself at $7,252. We are unable to find any evidence in the record which impeaches the accuracy of the sum of these expenses, or which casts doubt upon their fairness as a measure of the necessary annual operating expenses. Yet the commission reduced the amount to $37,608, a difference of $1,136.85. The commission found, it is true, that the plant had been inefficiently operated. But we find no evidence to this effect in the record and none has been called to our attention. To the contrary, the commission's engineer who examined the property and accounts of the company testified that he considered the expenditures of the company were reasonable and that the plant was efficiently and economically managed.\n Return. As bearing upon the amount of return to which the company is entitled, a summary of the foregoing \n\n[267 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n may now be considered: Value of property for rate-making purposes, $154, 655.93; annual amount of income based upon rates fixed by commission, $53, 563; operating expenses, together with amount of annual depreciation allowed by commission, $45,996.85-leaving a balance as return to the company of $7,566.15, or less than 5 per cent. upon the value of the property. That this is so plainly inadequate as to result in depriving the company of its property without due process of law may not be doubted. See Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 U.S. 679\n, 692-695, 43 S. Ct. 675, and cases cited; S. W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807.\n From the foregoing, it is evident that the state Supreme Court did not accord to the plaintiff in error that sort of judicial inquiry to which under the decisions of this court it was entitled.

Act of August 1, 1888, c. 728, 25 Stat. 357 (Comp. St.  6909, 6910). It has resulted in a condemnation fixing the sum to be paid, subject to questions of law reserved by the plaintiff in error, the Old Dominion Land Company, at the trial and decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 296 F. 20. During the late war the Government took leases of the land from the Old Dominion Land Company for military purposes and put structures upon it costing more than a million and a half dollars. The leases were for short terms and were renewed, until in 1922 the lessor refused to renew them again. By the terms of the agreements the United States had a right to remove the structures but not beyond thirty days from the termination. An offer to purchase the land was made by the United States but was refused and this proceeding was instituted on July 29, 1922, just before the thirty days allowed by the leases had run out. The main contentions of the plaintiff in error are that the Acts of Congress relied upon do not authorize the taking attempted here; that one of those acts is unconstitutional, and that the taking although it might be for the benefit of the United States, to save its buildings, was not a taking for public use. We are of opinion that these contentions so far as material to the case cannot be sustained and that the decision below was right.\n The statute authorizes this proceeding. The Appropriation Act of July 11, 1919, c. 8, 41 Stat. 104, 128, and its amendments of the same year ( chapter 44, 41 Stat. 278, and chapter 90, 41 Stat. 453), had stopped the purchase of land in connection with military purposes generally, except in certain cases when it was more economical to buy than to pay rent or damages. This act was further amended how- \n\n[269 U.S. 55, 64]\n\u00a0\n ever by the Act of March 8, 1922, c. 100,  1, 42 Stat. 418, so as to 'authorize completion of the acquisition of the real estate hereinafter specified in respect whereof requisition notices had been served or given before July 11, 1919, ... or in respect whereof agreements had been made for purchase thereof, or proceedings begun for condemnation thereof.' 'For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section the following amounts are hereby authorized to be appropriated, to wit: ... For quartermaster warehouses, Newport News, Virginia, $223,670.' This is the land in question. By section 3 of the same Act the Secretary of War was authorized to renew leases in order to enable the Government to remove its buildings and other property, and to approve awards and to have new awards made for the purchase or condemnation of land necessary in his judgment for the operation of water plants now located thereon, etc., provided 'that any addition to the value of the premises resulting from the improvements thereto or in the vicinity thereof made by or at the expense of the United States shall be excluded from the sum paid to or recovered by the owners.' The later Deficiencies Appropriation Act of July 1, 1922, c. 258, 42 Stat. 767, 777, supplies deficiencies: 'Sites for military purposes: For completion of acquisition of real estate as authorized by' the last mentioned Act: 'For quartermaster warehouses, Newport News, Virginia, $223,670.'\n It is argued that the general purpose of this exception to the stopping of expenditures was only to carry out agreements by which the Government already was bound; and that the specific appropriations were made only in case the property mentioned was the object of such previous agreement. No doubt the general purpose was that suggested, but the rest of the Act showed that the appropriation was not confined to that alone, and the specific unqualified mention of the land in question as land of \n\n[269 U.S. 55, 65]\n\u00a0\n which the acquisition was to be completed overrides the general statement, however much confirmed by citations from the congressional debates.\n Then it is said that the Act of March 8, 1922, was unconstitutional by reason of the proviso that we have stated, excluding from the compensation improvements upon the land or in the vicinity thereof made by the United States. There might be cases in which this provision could not be sustained, but there is no trouble here. For supposing that the proviso were extended beyond the taking in aid of a water plant to which it immediately referred, it could have no bearing except upon the issue agreed to by counsel, 'whether the value of the warehouses constructed by the United States Government on the lands sought to be condemned should be included in the valuation of said lands.' But upon this issue the statute was superfiuous. When these proceedings were begun the buildings belonged to the United States. It would not be just to allow the delay necessary in legal proceedings to deprive the United States of rights that it had and endeavored by this suit to assert. Consolidated Turnpike Co. v. Norfolk & Ocean View Ry. Co., \n228 \nU.S. 596, 602\n, 33 S. Ct. 570. In the often quoted language of Chief Justice Shaw:\n'If a pie-powder court could be called on the instant and on the spot, the true rule of justice for the public would be, to pay the compensation with one hand, while they apply the axe with the other.' Parks v. Boston, 15 Pick. 198, 208.\n\n It in no way appeared that the value of the land was increased by other improvements in the vicinity, or otherwise than by the structures upon the land so that the most indefensible aspects of the statute are not before us here. Furthermore the instructions to the jury were that they were to determine the fair market value of the land as well for its present purposes as for those for which it might be reasonably \n\n[269 U.S. 55, 66]\n\u00a0\n adapted at the time or in the immediate future, and to take into consideration the facts and circumstances of its location, etc., with no language that excluded consideration of improvements in the vicinity, if any there were.\n But it is said that the taking was not for a public use, because it is said that the Secretary of War at least was thinking not of a future use of the land by the public or the Government but of saving the country from the loss of the buildings. We shall not inquire whether this purpose was or was not so reasonably incidental to the necessarily hurried transactions during the war as to warrant the taking, upon the principle illustrated by Brown v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 78\n, 44 S. Ct. 92. Congress has declared the purpose to be a public use, by implication if not by express words. If we disregard the heading quoted from the latest Act, 'Sites for Military Purposes,' which we see no reason for doing, and treat 'For quartermaster warehouses' as descriptive rather than prospective, still there is nothing shown in the intentions or transactions of subordinates that is sufficient to overcome the declaration by Congress of what it had in mind. Its decision is entitled to deference until it is shown to involve an impossibility. But the military purposes mentioned at least may have been entertained and they clearly were for a public use.\n Some question is made as to whether a letter from the Secretary of War to the Attorney General sufficiently authorized the present proceedings by showing that in his opinion it was necessary or advantageous to the Government to take them. The Act of August 1, 1888, c. 728, 25 Stat. 357, allows the Secretary to acquire by condemnation lands which he is authorized to procure for public purposes, 'whenever in his opinion it is necessary or advantageous to the Government to do so'; gives jurisdiction to the courts of the United States, and makes it the duty of the Attorney General upon every application of such officer to cause proceedings to be commenced. We \n\n[269 U.S. 55, 67]\n\u00a0\n perceive no requirement that the Secretary should go further than to apply to the Attorney General. Moreover, the Secretary's letter certainly showed that he thought the suit would be advantageous to the Government, and we should be slow to suppose that the precise shade of his opinion upon the point affected the jurisdiction of the Court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLIVER v. U S(1925)\nNo. 180\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Louis V. Crowley, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Messrs. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Merrill E. Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bankrupt's estate consisted of personal property only, and there is no suggestion of a lien thereon to secure \n\n[268 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n any of the claims now under consideration. The fund derived from conversion of all the property is insufficient fully to satisfy taxes due the United States and the city and county of San Francisco, and the allowed claims for preferred wages. Which of these must be paid first is the question for decision. The referee ruled in favor of the wages, and the District Court approved; but the Circuit Court of Appeals held to the contrary, and directed that priority should be given the taxes.\n The Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 544, 563, c. 541 (Comp. St.  9648), provides:\n'Sec. 64. Debts Which Have Priority.-a. The court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States, state, county, district, or municipality in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and upon filing the receipts of the proper public officers for such payment he shall be credited with the amount thereof, and in case any question arises as to the amount or legality of any such tax the same shall be heard and determined by the court.\n\n'b. The debts to have priority, except as herein provided, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment shall be (1) the actual and necessary cost of preserving the estate subsequent to filing the petition; (2) the filing fees paid by creditors in involuntary cases; (3) the cost of administration, including the fees and mileage payable to witnesses as now or hereafter provided by the laws of the United States, and one reasonable attorney's fee, for the professional services actually rendered, irrespective of the number of attorneys employed, to the petitioning creditors in involuntary cases, to the bankrupt in involuntary cases while performing the duties herein prescribed, and to the bankrupt in voluntary cases, as the court may allow; (4) wages due to workmen, clerks, or servants which have been earned within three months before the date of the commencement \n\n[268 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n of proceedings, not to exceed three hundred dollars to each claimant; and (5) debts owing to any person who by the laws of the states or the United States is entitled to priority.'\n\n Guarantee Co. v. Title Guarnaty Co., \n224 \nU.S. 152, 159\n, 160 S., 32 S. Ct. 457, 459 (56 L. Ed. 706), held that under section 64 wages were entitled to priority over the claim of the United States for damages occasioned by the bankrupt's failure to comply with a construction contract. It was there said:\n'By the statute of 1797 (now section 3466), and section 5101 of the Revised Statutes, all debts due to the United States were expressly given priority to the wages due any operative, clerk or house servant. A different order is prescribed by the act of 1898, and something more. Labor claims are given priority, and it is provided that debts having priority shall be paid in full. The only exception is 'taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States, state, county, district or municipality.' These were civil obligations, not personal conventions, and preference was given to them, but as to debts we must assume a change of purpose in the change of order And we cannot say that it was inadvertent. The act takes into consideration, we think, the whole range of indebtedness of the bankrupt, national, state and individual, and assigns the order of payment. The policy which dictated it was beneficent and well might induce a postponement of the claims, even of the sovereign in favor of those who necessarily depended upon their daily labor. And to give such claims priority could in no case seriously affect the sovereign. To deny them priority would in all cases seriously affect the claimants.'\n\n In City of Richmond v. Bird, \n249 \nU.S. 174, 177\n, 39 S. Ct. 186, past-due taxes were denied priority of payment over a debt secured by a lien which the state law recognized as superior to the city's claim for such taxes. We said:\n'Respondents therefore must prevail unless priority over their lien is given by section 64a to claim for taxes \n\n[268 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n which, under state law, occupied no better position than one held by a general creditor. Section 67d, Bankruptcy Act, quoted supra, declares that liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act, shall not be affected by it. Other provisions must, of course, be construed in view of this positive one. Section 64a directs that taxes be paid in advance of dividends to creditors; and 'dividend.' as commonly used throughout the act, means partial payment to general creditors. In section 65b, for example, the word occurs in contrast to payment of debts which have priority. And as the local laws gave no superior right to the city's unsecured claim for taxes we are unable to conclude that Congress intended by section 64a to place it ahead of valid lienholders.'\n\n iOf course, this opinion must be read in the light of the question under consideration: Does section 64 require that taxes shall be paid in advance of debts secured by liens which under the local law are superior to claims for such taxes? We pointed out that section 67d (Comp. St.  9651) preserves valid liens and is not qualified by the direction of section 64a to discharge taxes 'in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors,' since \"dividend,' as commonly used throughout the act, means partial payment to general creditors.' We did not undertake to decide in what order, as among themselves, taxes and the debts specified by section 64 should be satisfied; that point was not presented.\n The language of section 64 has caused much uncertainty, and widely different views of its true meaning may be found in the opinions of District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n Paragraph 'a' directs that 'the court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing ... in advance of [not next preceding] the payment of dividends to creditors'-that is, partial payments to general creditors. City of Richmond v. Bird, supra. It does not undertake \n\n[268 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n otherwise to fix the precise position which shall be accorded to them. This, we think, must be determined upon consideration of the circumstances of each case and the provisions of relevant federal and local laws-e. g., those which prescribe liens to secure or special priority for tax claims. It also appears, plainly enough, that all debts mentioned in paragraph 'b' must be satisfied before any payment to general creditors.\n Guarantee Co. v. Title Guaranty Co., supra, declares that the taxes of paragraph 'a' are 'civil obligations, not personal conventions, and preference was given to them' over the wages specified by clause (4), paragraph 'b.' We adhere to this as a correct statement of the general rule to be followed whenever it does not clearly appear that the particular tax has been subordinated to claims for wages by some relevant law.\n We find no error in the action of the court below. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLSON v.

Kerr, both of Portland, Or., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[267 U.S. 462, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here directly from the District Court by a writ of error and a certificate that the action was dismissed upon the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction.\n The suit was begun in a Court of the State of Oregon and removed. It was brought against the corporation described in Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S. Ct. 121, to recover for work done, materials furnished or destroyed, and profits lost, during the year 1918, in consequence of a requisition by the Government that the plaintiffs should devote their logging camp to the production of airplane timber alone. The declaration is long and suggests throughout an effort to state a case under the Dent Act of March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e) and to account for this suit by the fact that the plaintiffs' claim under that Act was disallowed. The assurances and promises relied upon seem to have been the assurances and promises of successive agents of the United States that the United States would pay for what the plaintiffs were asked to do.\n The Court below seems to have regarded the Dent Act as giving the only remedy in cases like this, although the supposed cause of action arose before that Act was passed; and according to the certificate treated the statute as excluding jurisdiction elsewhere. If the suit were against the United States, as no Court has jurisdiction over the \n\n[267 U.S. 462, 467]\n\u00a0\n United States except when it is granted, the ruling might have been correct. But this suit is against a corporation of the State of Washington, brought originally in a Court of Oregon to enforce a supposed liability in contract. Even if a statute of the United States created a bar it would be unusual if the act went to the jurisdiction rather than to the merits, Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 28 S. Ct. 641; and if the statute went further it would be more likely to exclude jurisdiction in all other Courts rather than merely in Courts of the United States as such. If the statute excluded jurisdiction in State as well as United States Courts the case could not be certified under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, \n219 \nU.S. 175, 178\n, 31 S. Ct. 185. But the Dent Act does not contemplate suits against corporations in the Court of Claims, and we perceive no ground for the ruling as certified. It well may be that the Court was right in deciding that the allegations were not sufficient to justify a suit against the corporation, and our judgment is without prejudice to a judgment dismissing the case upon the merits. But it was error to decide that there was a want of jurisdiction and therefore the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOZARK PIPE LINE CORPORATION v. MONIER(1925)\nNo. 181\nArgued: November 26, 1924Decided: January 12, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 555, 556]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Truman Post Young and John H. Carroll, both of St. Louis, Mo., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 555, 558]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jesse W. Barrett and J. Henry Caruthers, both of Jefferson City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 555, 560]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is a Maryland corporation. It owns and operates a pipe line, extending from within Oklahoma, through Missouri, to a point in Illinois, together with certain gathering lines in Oklahoma. Through this line crude petroleum is conducted to Illinois and there delivered. Oil is neither received nor delivered in the state of Missouri. Since it began operations appellant has been assessed and has paid general property taxes upon that portion of its line, and upon its other assets, in Missouri. It maintains its principal office in Missouri, where it keeps its books and bank accounts, and from which it pays its employees within and without the state, purchases supplies, employs labor, maintains telephone and telegraph lines, enters into contracts for transportation of crude oil, and carries on various other activities connected with and in furtherance of its pipe line operations. Along the pipe line in Missouri there are three pumping stations, the sole use of which is to accelerate the passage of the oil through the line. It owns and operates passenger and truck automobiles, but these as well as its other property in Missouri are used exclusively in the \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 561]\n\u00a0\n prosecution of its interstate business. In compliance with the laws of Missouri applicable to corporations formed in other states desirous of transacting business in Missouri, appellant filed with the secretary of state its articles of incorporation, and amended articles showing an increase in its capital stock, paid license taxes aggregating $6,401.50, and obtained a license and authority to engage 'exclusively in the business of transporting crude petroleum by pipe line.' It thereby acquired the right of eminent domain under the laws of the state.\n The controversy arises over an attempt on the part of the state authorities to collect from appellant an annual franchise tax under sections 9836-9848, pp. 3015-3020, Rev. Stats. Mo. 1919. The statute requires every corporation not organized under the laws of Missouri, but engaged in business therein, to pay an annual franchise tax equal to one- tenth of 1 per cent. of the par value of its capital stock and surplus employed in business in the state. For the purpose of the tax the corporation is deemed to have employed in the state 'that proportion of its entire capital stock and surplus that its property and assets in this state bears to all its property and assets wherever located.' The corporation is required to make an annual report in writing to the state tax commission in such form as may be prescribed, giving the amount of its authorized and subscribed capital stock, the par value and market value thereof, and other specified information, as a basis, with other things, for the computation of the tax. Appellant, having failed to furnish this report, was threatened by appellees with an action in the name of the state to revoke its license, and with such proceedings as would cause the amount of the tax, together with penalties, damages, and interest, to become a lien upon its property and thereby create a serious cloud upon the title thereto. Upon these facts suit was brought to enjoin appellees from going forward \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 562]\n\u00a0\n with such action and proceedings, upon the ground that the statute as applied to appellant, contravenes the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. After a hearing the court below rendered a final decree against appellant dismissing its bill.\n The tax is one upon the privilege or right to do business (State ex rel. v. State Tax Commission, 282 Mo. 213, 234, 221 S. W. 721), and if appellant is engaged only in interstate commerce it is conceded, as it must be, that the tax, so far as appellant is concerned, constitutionally cannot be imposed. It long has been settled that a state cannot lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form, whether on the transportation of subjects of commerce, the receipts derived therefrom, or the occupation or business of carrying it on. Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 648\n, 8 S. Ct. 1380; Kansas City Ry. v. Kansas, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 231\n, 36 S. Ct. 261, and cases cited. Plainly, the operation of appellant's pipe line is interstate commerce and beyond the power of state taxation. Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 265, 272\n, 42 S. Ct. 101; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 277\n, 42 S. Ct. 105. But the contention in justification of the tax is that appellant is also engaged in doing local business, the basis of such contention being the facts concerning its ownership and use of property, other than the pipe line, and its various acts and activities within the state hereinbefore recited, and, further, that the purposes for which it is incorporated, as declared in its articles, comprehend other activities than that of transporting petroleum, namely, the acquisition and operation of telegraph and telephone lines, dealing in and transporting merchandise, etc.\n An extended review of the decisions of this court dealing with this phase of the subject is not necessary. All proceed from the same principles, but range themselves on one side or the other of the line as the facts do or do not demonstrate that the tax as a practical matter constitutes \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 563]\n\u00a0\n a burden upon interstate commerce. The facts upon which these former decisions rest, therefore. must be borne in mind in applying them to other and alleged similar cases. If the business taxed is in fact separate local business, not so connected with interstate commerce as to render the tax a burden upon such commerce, the tax is good. An illustration of such a tax is found in New York ex rel. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Knight, \n192 \nU.S. 21\n, 24 S. Ct. 202, where this court upheld a state franchise tax upon a cab service maintained wholly within the state of New York by the railroad company to convey passengers to and from its terminus in New York City, for which service the charges were separate from other transportation charges. The principle announced (page 27 [24 S. Ct. 203]) was:\n'Wherever a separation in fact exists between transportation service wholly within the state and that between the states, a like separation may be recognized between the control of the state and that of the nation. Osborne v. Florida, \n164 U.S. 650\n; Pullman Co. v. Adams, \n189 U.S. 420\n.'\n\n On the other hand, in Norfolk, etc., Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 \nU.S. 114, 120\n, 10 S. Ct. 958, 960 (34 L. Ed. 394), a Pennsylvania tax of similar character sought to be imposed upon a Virginia railroad corporation was held bad. The railroad company maintained an office in Pennsylvania for the use of its officers, stockholders, agents and employees, and expended large sums of money in that state in the purchase of materials and supplies for its railroad. It owned a small amount of property in this state. In holding that the tax contravened the commerce clause the court said:\n'Was the tax assessed against the company for keeping an office in Philadelphia, for the use of its officers, stockholders, agents and employes, a tax upon the business of the company? In other words, was such tax a tax upon any of the means or instruments by which the company was enabled to carry on its business of interstate commerce? We have no hesitancy in answering \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 564]\n\u00a0\n that question in the affirmative. What was the purpose of the company in establishing an office in the city of Philadelphia? Manifestly for the furtherance of its business interests in the matter of its commercial relations. ... Again, the plaintiff in error does not exercise, or seek to exercise, in Pennsylvania any privilege or franchise not immediately connected with interstate commerce and required for the purposes thereof. Before establishing its office in Philadelphia it obtained from the secretary of the Commonwealth the certificate required by the act of the state Legislature of 1874 enabling it to maintain an office in the state. That office was maintained because of the necessities of the interstate business of the company, and for no other purpose. A tax upon it was, therefore, a tax upon one of the means or instrumentalities of the company's interstate commerce, and as such was in violation of the commercial clause of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n Heyman v. Hays, \n236 \nU.S. 178, 185\n, 186 S., 35 S. Ct. 403, involved a county privilege tax for carrying on a liquor business. The complainant was a liquor merchant who sold no liquor directly or indirectly within the state but conducted a mail order business with persons in other states exclusively. The effort to sustain the tax was upon the grounds that complainant had a stock of goods within the state susceptible of being sold therein, that care and attention for the purpose of packing and otherwise must necessarily be given these goods, that orders for shipment were received in the state, and that a clerical force or other assistance was maintained within the state to keep accounts, supervise the business, receive the price resulting from shipments, and so on. This court said that assuming these facts they did not take the business out of the protection of the commerce clause (page 186 [35 S. Ct. 404]):\n'We reach this conclusion because we are of opinion that giving the fullest effect to the conditions stated they \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 565]\n\u00a0\n were but the performance of acts accessory to and inhering in the right to make the interstate commerce shipments and therefore to admit the power because of their existence to burden the right to ship in interstate commerce would necessarily be to recognize the authority to directly burden such right.'\n\n The present case comes within the reasoning of the two decisions last cited. The business actually carried on by appellant was exclusively in interstate commerce. The maintenance of an office, the purchase of supplies, employment of labor, maintenance and operation of telephone and telegraph lines and automobiles, and appellant's other acts within the state, were all exclusively in furtherance of its interstate business, and the property itself, however extensive or of whatever character, was likewise devoted only to that end. They were the means and instrumentalities by which that business was done and in no proper sense constituted, or contributed to, the doing of a local business. The protection against imposition of burdens upon interstate commerce is practical and substantial and extends to whatever is necessary to the complete enjoyment of the right protected. Heyman v. Hays, supra, page 186 ( 35 S. Ct. 403).\n The court below grounded its decision chiefly upon Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147\n, 38 S. Ct. 295, but a review of that case will clearly demonstrate that it cannot be given the effect thus ascribed to it. Seven foreign corporations sought to avoid a Massachusetts excise tax on the ground, among others, that, as imposed, it contravened the commerce clause of the Constitution. This court held the tax invalid as to one of the corporations and sustained it as to the other six. The first of the six kept a stock of machine parts in the state, which were sold both within and without the state, and the court simply held that the portion of the business which was purely local was subject to local taxation. The \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 566]\n\u00a0\n second did an extensive local business in repairing cars of its own make and in selling secondhand cars. The third employed salesmen who took orders for its product from local retailers and turned them over to be filled by the nearest wholesaler, and this amounted, as the court said, simply to one local merchant buying from another. The fourth and fifth were mining companies operating mines in Michigan, with offices in Boston, where their directors met, declared and paid dividends, etc. Interstate commerce was not affected. Indeed, it does not affirmatively appear that there was any such commerce to be affected. In the case of the sixth the commerce clause was not involved. The remaining case (Cheney Bros. Co.), in which tex tax was held bad, was that of a Connecticut corporation engaged in manufacturing and selling silk fabrics. It maintained in Boston a selling office with an office salesman and four traveling salesmen who solicited and took orders subject to approval by the home office from which shipments were made directly to the purchasers. The court held that this did not constitute doing a local business, and said (page 153 [38 S. Ct. 296]):\n'The maintenance of the Boston office and the display therein of a supply of samples are in furtherance of the company's interstate business and have no other purpose. Like the employment of the salesmen, they are among the means by which that business is carried on and share its immunity from state taxation.'\n\n It will thus be seen that there is nothing in this decision upon which the decree under review can properly rest. Its effect is entirely the other way.\n Some stress is laid upon the fact that the objects and purposes specified in appellant's articles of incorporation are not confined to the transportation of petroleum but include the doing of other business local in character. As to this, it is enough to say that none of these powers were in fact exercised in the state of Missouri; and so \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 567]\n\u00a0\n far as this case is concerned the power to tax depends upon what was done and not upon what might have been done. Moreover, the license issued by the state authorized appellant to engage 'exclusively in the business of transporting crude petroleum by pipe line.'\n Nor is it material that appellant applied for and received a Missouri license or that it had the power thereunder to exercise the right of eminent domain. These facts could not have the effect of conferring upon the state an authority, denied by the federal Constitution, to regulate interstate commerce. The state has no such power even in the case of domestic corporations. See Phila. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 342\n, 7 S. Ct. 1118. The statute as applied to appellant is unconstitutional.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The court assumes, without discussion, that if, in Missouri, the company is engaged exclusively in interstate commerce, the tax assessed upon the Ozark Company is bad. It concludes, upon discussion, that the business actually done by the company within that state is exclusively interstate commerce, because the article with which it deals in not produced within Missouri and the physical operations of the company within the state relate directly or indirectly to transporting the article through it. Under the rule applied, every tax laid by any state upon the corporate franchise (properly so called) of every corporation, domestic or foreign, must be void, in the absence of congressional authorization, where the corporation is actually engaged exclusively in what is deemed interstate commerce. I find in the Constitution no warrant for the assumption which leads to such a result.\n The tax assailed is not laid upon the occupation, as was that in Texas Transport & Terminal Co. v. New \n\n[266 U.S. 555, 568]\n\u00a0\n Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S. Ct. 242. Nor is the tax laid upon the privilege of doing business. It is laid upon the privilege of carrying on business in corporate form; of doing so with a usual place of business within the state, and with power to exercise for that purpose the right to eminent domain. The office within the state is the corporation's main office. The property physically located within the state constitutes more than half of all its property. The operations actually performed within the state include, among others, mechanical operations indispensable to the conduct of the business, and extensive auxiliary activities. The business which the company sought and obtained leave to do in corporate form is intrastate or interstate or both. The broad powers sought and granted, it still possesses and seeks to retain.\n The immunity from state taxation accorded is not that enjoyed by federal instrumentalities in the absence of legislation by Congress authorizing such taxation. See Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579. It is not the immunity of a federal corporate franchise, as in California v. Central Pacific R. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 8 S. Ct. 1073. It has not the support of congressional action. The tax is held void solely on the ground that it is obnoxious to the commerce clause. A state tax is obnoxious to that provision of the federal Constitution only if the directly burdens interstate commerce, or (where the burden is indirect) if it obstructs or discriminates against such commerce. Here there is no contention that, in fact, the tax assessed either obstructs, or appreciably burdens, interstate commerce. The tax is trifling in amount. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[266 U.S. 555, 569]\n\u00a0\n There is no contention that, in fact, the tax discriminates against interstate commerce. The tax is applied alike, whether the business done is interstate, or intrastate, or both. \n2\n There is no contention that the statute discriminates against corporations organized under the laws of other states. The tax is the same for domestic corporations as it is for foreign corporations. The citizenship of the corporation is confessedly not of legal significance in this connection. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Can it be said that this tax directly burdens interstate commerce? A tax is a direct burden, if laid upon the operation or act of interstate commerce. Thus a tax is a direct burden where it is upon property moving in interstate commerce, Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S. Ct. 146, 25 A. L. R. 1195; Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 265\n, 42 S. Ct. 101; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 277\n, 42 S. Ct. 105; or where, like a gross receipts tax, it lays a burden upon every transaction in such commerce, Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S. Ct. 126. But a tax is not a direct burden merely because it is laid upon an indispensable instrumentality of such commerce, or because it arises exclusively from transactions in interstate commerce. Thus, a tax is valid although imposed upon property used exclusively in interstate commerce, Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, \n99 U.S. 273\n, 284; Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, \n198 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 25 S. Ct. 686, 3 Ann. Cas. 1100; or although laid upon net income derived exclusively from interstate commerce, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; Compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S.

These taxes were held valid because, unlike a gross receipts tax, they do not withhold, 'for the use of a state, a part of every dollar received in such transactions.' See Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S. Ct. 126. Surely the tax upon the corporate franchise is as indirect as the tax upon the pipe line.\n I find in the commerce clause no warrant for thus putting a state to the choice of either abandoning the corporate franchise tax or discriminating against intrastate commerce,4 nor for denying to a state the right to encourage the conduct of business by natural persons through imposing, for the enjoyment of the corporate privilege, an annual tax so small that it cannot conceivably be deemed an obstruction of interstate commerce. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is now one-twentieth of 1 per cent. of that fraction of the whole capital stock and surplus which is proportionate to the fraction in value of the total assets of the corporation which are located within the state.

Robertson, of Juneau, Alaska, for petitioner.[ Pacific American Fisheries v. Territory of Alaska \n269 U.S. 269\n (1925) ]\n\n\n[269 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Rustgard, of Juneau, Alaska, for the Territory of alaska.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Territory of Alaska to recover from the petitioner, Pacific American Fisheries, license taxes alleged to be due upon cases of salmon packed by the defendant at four canneries named. The defendant in its answer set up that the territorial taxing act was contrary to the Act of Congress of August 24, 1912, c. 387,  3, 37 Stat. 512 (Comp. St.  3530), creating a legislative assembly in the Territory of Alaska, and to the Constitution of the United \n\n[269 U.S. 269, 276]\n\u00a0\n States. The Territory demurred; there was a judgment for the plaintiff and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 F.(2d) 9. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n267 \nU.S. 589\n, 45 S. Ct. 353.\n The taxes in question were imposed by chapter 101,  1, Laws of Alaska, 1923, amending chapter 31,  1, subsec. 2, subd. 8, of the Laws of 1921. By (c) of that subdivision salmon canneries, after a tax by (b) of ten cents per case, are charged an additional tax on a pack of kings, reds, and sockeyes, counted together, at any one cannery, as follows: On all cases in excess of ten thousand and not more than twenty-five thousand, five cents per case; in excess of twenty-five thousand and not more than forty thousand, ten cents per case; in excess of forty thousand and not more than fifty thousand, fifteen cents per case; and on all in excess of fifty thousand, twenty cents per case. Similarly in (d) and (e) a tax of four and one-half cents per case is imposed on medium reds, cohoes, and pinks; with additional taxes for each increase of numbers as in the previous subdivision. By (f) chums are taxed three cents per case. The petitioner says that this graduated tax is inconsistent with the Act of Congress mentioned, which provides that the authority therein granted to alter, amend, modify and repeal laws in force in Alaska should not extend to the game, fish, and fur seal laws, and presses this contention notwithstanding the further proviso that this provision shall not operate to prevent the legislature from imposing other and additional taxes or licenses. The petitioner also says that the classification upon which the surtax is based is unreasonable and a denial of due process of law, contrary to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. No question is raised about the uniform tax of ten cents per case imposed by (b). That has been paid.\n The petitioner offers various reasons to show that this tax is not what it purports to be but is an attempt to regu- \n\n[269 U.S. 269, 277]\n\u00a0\n late fisheries, which, the petitioner believes, Congress has not given the Territory power to regulate. The answer alleges that it was known that the revenue from these taxes would exceed the appropriations and needs of the Territory, and from this and other things the conclusion is drawn that the taxes were levied with the intent of driving the defendant out of its business. But the premise could not be known, it only could be prophesied. If known the conclusion as to legislative intent would not follow; and if the intent were entertained, in the only sense in which it rationally could be imputed, that is, to discourage canning the larger amounts, the legislature lawfully might act with that intent. Fisheries were not the direct object of attack, but canneries. It would require a strong case in any event to invalidate a tax on things that the legislature had power to regulate because of its collateral reaction on something else. But here even as to fisheries the legislature is given power to tax. Any tax is a discouragement and therefore a regulation so far as it goes, and the most plausible reconciliation of this power with the restrictions upon amending or modifying the laws in force in that the only purpose of the restrictions was to prevent the Territory from doing away with all protection, in a shortsighted rush for fish. At least we must take it to be clear that the unlimited power expressly given may be exercised with consideration of collateral advantages and disadvantages. Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S. Ct. 219. It could not be exercised intelligently otherwise. The extent of the power is a question of specific interpretation not of general principle; and therefore we leave the many familiar cases that were cited, on one side.\n It is not unworthy of notice that in section 9 of the Act of August 24, 1912 (Comp. St.  3536), an earlier statute of July 30, 1886, c. 818,  1, 24 Stat. 170 (Comp. St.  3479), is taken up, in which the power of the territorial legislatures to pass laws for the protection of \n\n[269 U.S. 269, 278]\n\u00a0\n game and fish is recognized, and also that the latest revision of the fish law by Congress was passed after the present tax law had been enacted and had been upheld by the District Court; that it provided that nothing therein contained should curtail the powers of the Territorial Legislature of Alaska, and that it showed no sign of dissatisfaction with the way in which those powers had been used. Act of June 6, 1924, c. 272,  8, 43 Stat. 464, 467 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  3622 1\/4 e).\n It is much pressed that the tax discriminates against large canneries in favor of small ones-this especially as contravening the Fifth Amendment and denying due process of law. Classification of taxes by the amount of the corpus taxed has been sustained in various connections heretofore. By way of specific answer it is pointed out by the Attorney General of Alaska that the size of the run of salmon cannot be foreseen; that a cannery must be prepared to its full capacity; that there always will be an irreducible minimum of expense to be borne whatever the size of the pack; that therefore a small pack may mean a loss and a larger one a profit, and that on these considerations the law justly may attempt to proportion the tax to the probable gains. The inequalities of the tax are based upon intelligible grounds of policy and cannot be said to deny the petitioner its constitutional rights.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATTERSON v.

St.  8566)), provides, among other things:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act ... to charge any greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this act.'\n\n This suit was brought in the federal court for northern Georgia, under section 16, par. 2, of the act (Comp. St.  8584), to enforce an order of reparation for $30,000 which had been entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission on April 9, 1923, pursuant to sections 8 and 9 (Comp. St.  8572, 8573). The shipments having been made from time to time between January 1, 1916, and December \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n 1, 1918, both the railroad companies and James C. Davis, as Agent designated by the President under section 206 of Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc), were joined as defendants before the Commission and in the courts. The rates under which these shipments were made were first established in 1892, and were proportionately increased under the terms of General Order No. 28 of the Director General of Railroads on June 25, 1918. The case was heard upon demurrer to the declaration, to which were annexed as exhibits the several complaints before the Commission and the order of the Commission with incorporated reports. The demurrers were sustained by the District Court; judgment was entered for the defendants, and this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 F.(2d) 592. The case is here on writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n The complaint before the Commission as amended charged that the through rates were 'unreasonable, excessive, and unjustly discriminatory, contrary to the first, third, and fourth sections,' and also charged specifically that they violated the aggregate of intermediates clause above quoted. The report shows that relief was not granted on the ground of unjust discrimination under section 3 (Comp. St.  8565), nor on the ground of departure from the long and short haul clause of section 4 (Comp. St.  8566). As to the remaining grounds of relief asserted in the complaint, the report states:\n'... We find that, while the rates assailed appear not unduly high, they were unreasonable in and to the extent that they respectively exceeded the aggregates of the intermediate rates subject to the act; that complainants made shipments and paid and bore the charges thereon, upon the basis of the through rates and were damaged thereby; and that they are entitled to reparation on the basis of the difference between the respective through rates and the sums of the lowest intermediate rates subject to the act, applicable on all shipments which moved since the dates above stated for the several complainants.' \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Whether the Constitution intended to base its order of reparation upon section 1 (Comp. St.  8563), or upon the aggregate of intermediates clause of section 4, or upon both, is left uncertain by the language used. The District Court apparently assumed that the report awarded, and the declaration sought, such relief on both grounds. It held that there was no liability under section 4, because the Commission had found that the through rates which exceeded the local had been protected by proper application for relief from the operation of that clause of the section. It held that there was no liability under section 1, because the Commission found that the through rates, although higher than the aggregate of the intermediates, were 'not unduly high.' The Circuit Court of Appeals construed the declaration as seeking recovery only on the ground that the quoted clause of section 4 had been violated and it affirmed the judgment because the shippers had failed to show that this violation had caused them special pecuniary damage. The declaration, and the brief and argument submitted for the shippers in this court, make it clear that the only cause of action sued on is the violation of the aggregate of intermediates clause of section 4. We have, therefore, no occasion to pass upon the effect of the finding that the through rates were 'not unduly high,' or on other questions discussed by counsel bearing upon liability under section 1.\n\n The shippers insist that, since the declaration set forth an order of reparation for violation of the aggregate of intermediates clause duly made upon complaint and hearing the demurrer should have been overruled. The argument is that the Commission is without power to suspend the aggregate of intermediates clause; that, if it has any such power, it is only to the extent of relieving the carrier from criminal liability under section 10 of the act (Comp. St.  8574), so that in no event can a suspension relieve the carrier from civil liability to shippers; that the Commission thus retains the power under sections 8 and 9 to award reparation for damage \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n suffered; that, whatever the power of the Commission to suspend the clause in question, that power does not appear to have been invoked in this case by an adequate and timely application to the Commission; that since, on any one of the above grounds, that Commission was free to award reparation upon finding damage, suffered as a result of the higher through rate, and found such damage, its report stated a prima facie liability; and that, as the declaration embodied the report, it was good on demurrer. The argument is, in our opinion, unsound.\n The aggregate of intermediates clause was inserted in section 4 by the Act of June 18, 1910. Since that amendment, as before, the section empowers the Commission, upon special application, to 'prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section.' The question whether, after the amendment, the power so conferred was still limited to the long and short haul clause, or extended also to the aggregate of intermediates clause received careful consideration immediately after the passage of the 1910 act. The Commission concluded that its power to grant the relief applied to both of these clauses. In its annual report for 1911 the reasons for this conclusion were set forth. Pages 19, 20. The construction then adopted has been acted upon consistently ever since. \n1\n So far as appears, no court, federal or state, has taken a different view. And Congress has acquiesced.\n In support of the contention that the power to relieve from the operation of the section does not cover this case, the shippers point to the fact that, while the charge of the \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n higher through rate did not become unlawful per se until the provision to that effect was inserted in section 4 by the 1910 act, the Commission had repeatedly held that a through rate higher than the aggregate of the intermediates was prima facie unreasonable. \n2\n From this they argue that the construction given to the amended act by the defendant carriers would result in abridging, instead of enlarging, the rights of shippers in this respect, and therefore should not be adopted. We think such a conclusion erroneous. The construction given the section by the carriers does not result in abridging the rights of shippers. As a result of the amendment such through rates, unless protected by proper application, are not merely prima facie unreasonable, but unlawful by express statutory provision. The Commission, while claiming the power to suspend the operation of the clause in question, has continued to hold that, as before the amendment, such through rates are prima facie unreasonable when attacked under section 1 of the act. 3 \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n No good reason is shown for denying to the words used their clear and natural meaning. Compare Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. United States, \n249 U.S. 557\n, 564-658, 39 S. Ct. 375. On the other hand, there is good reason why the two prohibitions of section 4 should be treated similarly. Apart from statutory enactment, it is prima facie unreasonable to charge more for a shorter than for a longer haul. To charge more for a through haul than the aggregate of the intermediate rates is likewise prima facie unreasonable. In each case conditions may exist which, if shown, would establish the reasonableness of the rate in question. Under the Act to Regulate Commerce as originally enacted the carriers were, in each class of cases, at liberty to introduce the rate without first securing the consent of the Commission. If its invalidity were later asserted, they could escape liability by establishing then its justification. By amendatory legislation, Congress provided, in each class of cases, that the rate should not be charged unless, prior to its introduction, the Commission had, upon special application, granted authority therefor. Intermountain Rate Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S. Ct. 986\n\n\n The shippers' contention that relief from the operation of the aggregate of intermediates clause was not invoked by an adequate and timely application is also unsound. Under the second proviso of section 4 the rates complained of, if in effect on June 18, 1910, and then lawful, remained so, provided an application to suspend the operation of the section was duly made, and was either allowed or remained undetermined. The District Court construed the report of the Commission as finding that the then existing rates here in question were so protected. We also construe the report as finding, in effect, that application for relief was made, and was both adequate and timely.\n It is true that the due filing of such an application for relief from the aggregate of intermediates clause, or even an order granting relief thereon, would not render legal a \n\n[269 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n rate which violated some other section of the act. See United States v. Merchants', etc., Ass'n., \n242 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 24. A through rate would be unlawful, despite such an order, if it violated section 3 because unjustly discriminatory, or if it violated section 1 because unreasonably high. The Commission is correct in holding, as before stated, that if a through rate higher than the aggregate of the intermediates is attacked under section 1, the prima facie presumption that such higher through rate is unreasonable, and hence unlawful, obtains now as it did before the 1910 amendment. But no such question could arise in a proceeding limited to section 4. In a proceeding for violation of either clause of section 4, there is no occasion to consider either the presumption of unreasonableness or the existence of a justification for making the through rate higher. Neither is relevant; for if there has been an adequate and timely application within the six months, which application remains undetermined, or an application filed later and granted, there can be no violation of that section. If there was no such application filed, the section is violated by the higher through rate, even if conditions are shown which would have justified the rate as against a charge of unreasonableness under section 1.\n Since there can be no recovery under section 4 because of the pendency of an application for relief, we have no occasion to consider whether the rule of Davis v. Portland Seed Co., \n264 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S. Ct. 380, as to damages applies to violations of the aggregate of intermediates clause, nor whether it applies alike to suits based on reparation orders and to those instituted in the courts without such prior order.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Humphreys Godwin v.

C., for appellants.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Alfred A. Wheat, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by Margaret W. Pearson and her husband under the Tucker Act1 to recover the value of buildings and improvements erected by the War Department on leased premises and removed after the expiration of the lease. The United States demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not state a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court. The demurrer was sustained, and the petition dismissed. 58 Ct. Cl. 485.\n The petition shows the following facts: On September 11, 1917, the claimants leased to the Chamber of Commerce of Jacksonville, Florida, a tract of land, to be used solely for Federal Camp purposes, for the maximum term of three years. The lease provided that all buildings and improvements placed upon the land during said term by the lessee, its successors or assigns, should remain \n\n[267 U.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n 'the exclusive property of the lessee, its successors or assigns,' and might be removed within the period of three months after the expiration of the lease. Shortly after the execution of the lease the Chamber of Commerce agreed 'verbally' with the War Department that the land might be used and occupied as a portion of a training camp for United States troops; and the claimants acquiesced in and consented to its use and occupancy by the United States under and subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of the lease. The land was thereafter included in Camp Joseph E. Johnston. The War Department erected thereon a base hospital, homes for nurses and other buildings, and placed extensive improvements thereon. By a general provision in an act of March 3, 1919,2 this and other Camp hospitals were 'permanently transferred to the Treasury Department for the use of the Public Health Service,' with so much of their equipment, sites and leases, and such other buildings and land as might be required. The lease to the Chamber of Commerce expired on September 11, 1920. On December 9, 1920, the plaintiff's attorney wrote the Commanding Officer at Camp Johnston that by the terms of the lease all right of occupation and of entry and removal of buildings would cease on December 11, and that on that date the property should be finally surrendered to the plaintiffs without further removal or molestation of any of the property remaining thereon; and suggesting a conference in reference to the matter. The Commanding Officer replied to him that the hospital had been transferred to the Public Health Service, to which his letter had been referred, and with which the matter should be taken up. After some further correspondence, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, on March 28, 1921, wrote the claimants' \n\n[267 U.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n attorney, describing the land as the Pearson Tract 'occupied by the United States,' and stating that:\n'Owing to the necessity of salvaging certain materials placed upon the property by the Government and now needed elsewhere for hospital purposes, the use of the premises will be required until about May 1, 1921.'\n\n On April 6 the claimants' attorney replied reiterating the claim that under the terms of the lease all buildings, etc., were then part of the property and legally were no longer subject to removal; and suggesting a conference and proper adjustment of the matter. Without replying to this letter the Public Health Service continued to tear down and remove all the buildings and improvements that had been placed upon the land, and completed such removal by the end of June, 1921\n\n\n The petition alleges that the value of the buildings and improvements thus removed exceeds $100,000, and prays judgment against the United States for the full value of the property 'removed as aforesaid from said lands in violation of the rights of petitioners.'\n\n 1. \nThe petition does not allege any contract by the United States, either express or implied in fact, to pay the claimants the value of the buildings and improvements removed by it. Nor does it set forth facts on which such a contract will be implied. It does not appear from the petition that the United States stood in any contractual relation with the claimants, as an assignee, of the lease or otherwise. On the contrary it appears that it merely used the land under the oral permission of the Chamber of Commerce. And while the claimants allege, in general terms, that they acquiesced in and consented to such use and occupancy subject to the terms of the lease, it is not shown that the War Department either knew this fact or had any knowledge of the terms of the lease. Therefore, whatever may be the construction and effect of the lease as to the right of \n\n[267 U.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n removing buildings and improvements, or the implied obligation of the lessee or its assigns in regard thereto, the petition fails to show that as between the claimants and the United States there existed any relationship of landlord and tenant under the lease from which an agreement to pay for the property can be implied.\n\n 2. \nThe petition shows no ground of recovery on an implied agreement upon the part of the Government to pay the claimants for property taken for public use. No recognition of the plaintiffs' title is alleged in the petition. On the contrary the facts shown plainly indicate that the buildings and improvements were removed by the Government as its own property under the claim of right. Under these circumstances no agreement to pay for them can be implied. Whether the Government's claim was well or ill founded, is immaterial. It is was unfounded, and the claimants' property rights violated, the cause of action therefor would be one sounding in tort, for which the Tucker Act affords no remedy. Klebe v.

It is a bill in equity by a trade union called the Pennsylvania System Board of Adjustment of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees, made up of several classes of employees, clerical and otherwise, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, seeking to enjoin the company from maintaining the same kind of alleged conspiracy as that described and complained of by Federation No. 90 in the previous case. There is no prayer in the bill in this case for damages as there was in the other, but the circumstances and the law sought to be applied to them are in every respect similar. As in the previous case, elaborate briefs were filed to justify the contention that title 3 of the Transportation Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 ee-10071 1\/4 jj) vested the employees of the Pennsylvania Road with definite rights, the violation of which constituted a \n\n[267 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n legal wrong and that on these a charge of conspiracy could be predicated, and a remedy by injunction might be had in behalf of the complainants.

Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278. The company filed an answer, and the case was heard in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on exhibits and evidence. The District Court dismissed the bill (296 F. 220), and the decree was affirmed in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (1 F. [2d] 171). The issues involve the construction and application of title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 469, c. 91 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4ee-10071 1\/4jj). The title provides a method for the settlement of disputes over wages, rules, and working conditions between railroad companies engaged in interstate commerce and their employees, and as a means of securing it, creates the Railroad Labor Board and defines its functions and powers.\n The Pennsylvania Railroad System and Allied Lines Federation No. 90 is a trades union of 50,000 employees or more affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and embracing those crafts which have to do with the mechanical part of railroad service. It contains as members only workers, or those who have been workers, in the employ of the Pennsylvania Company or its Allied Lines. Our statement of the case and the opinion in what we shall call the Labor Board Case show the dealings between the company and Federation No. 90 down to and beyond the time when the Transportation Act was passed and the railroad property was turned back by the government to the company. The Railroad Labor Board, April 14, 1921, decided that the modus vivendi under which rules and working conditions under the Railroad Administration had continued should end July 1, 1921, and called upon each carrier and its respective employees to designate representatives to confer and decide, so far as possible, respecting their future rules and working conditions, and to keep the board advised of the progress toward agreement. The board accompanied their announcement, \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n known as Decision 119, with a statement of rules of decision which it intended to follow in consideration of the settlement of disputes under title 3. The two which are relevant here, as they were in the case cited, are as follows:\n'5. The right of such lawful organization (i. e., trade unions) to act toward lawful objects through representatives of its own choice, whether employees of a particular carrier or otherwise, shall be agreed to by management.'\n\n'15. The majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine what organization shall represent members of such craft or class. Such organization shall have the right to make an agreement which shall apply to all employees in such craft or class. No such agreement shall infringe, however upon the right of employees not members of the organization representing the majority to present grievances either in person or by representatives of their own choice.'\n\n Officials of Federation No. 90 met the representatives of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, in compliance with the request of the board, in May, 1921. The Pennsylvania representatives refused to confer, on the ground that the Federation did not represent a majority of the employees of the system, and proposed to send out a form of ballot to their employees, asking them to designate their representatives. The Federation officers objected, because the ballot made no provision, in accordance with principles 5 and 15, for the representation of employees by a trade union, but specified that they must be natural persons and such only as were employees of the Pennsylvania Company, and further because the company required that the representatives of the employees should be selected regionally rather than from the craft in the whole system, in compliance with principle No. 15. The result was that two ballots were sent out, one by the company and the other by the Federation. These forms were both \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 207]\n\u00a0\n found objectionable by the board, which by its decision No. 218 ordered a new election, for which rules were prescribed and a form of ballot specified, on which labor organizations, as well as individuals, could be voted for as his representatives at the option of the employee. The Pennsylvania Company applied to the board to vacate this decision, on the ground that there was no dispute before the board of which by title 3 of the Transportation Act the board was given jurisdiction. After a rehearing the board confirmed its original decision. The action of the company in refusing to comply with the decision of the board as to the manner of holding the elections led to a vote among the members of the Federation No. 90 as to whether they should strike against the company because of such vote. There was an affirmative vote, and some 20,000 struck. A bill was brought by the Pennsylvania Company to enjoin the Labor Board from hearing the controversy instituted by Federation No. 90 over the election of representatives who should act for the employees in the conferences proposed with the company. It was first objected that the Federation No. 90 had no standing or capacity to invoke the hearing of the dispute because a labor union; second, that the controversy did not involve the kind of dispute of which the board could take cognizance under the act, because the question who should represent the employees as to grievances, rules, and working conditions was not within in the jurisdiction of the Labor Board to decide; and, third, the board had no right to publish its opinion condemning the action of the company as it proposed to do, because that only applied to final decisions of a dispute over wages or working conditions. The position of the company was not sustained by this court. It was held that a labor union could invoke the board's action; that the question who should be recognized as representatives of the employees was not only before the board, but involved one of the most important \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 208]\n\u00a0\n of the rules and working conditions in the operation of a railroad; and that such a decision could therefore be made public if the board deemed it wise and proper. The District Court in which the suit was brought had enjoined the Labor Board from hearing the dispute and from publishing its opinion. Notwithstanding the opinion of the board, the Pennsylvania Company proceeded to carry out its original method of selecting employees' representatives and their regional distribution. It refused to allow its employees to vote for the Federation No. 90 as their representative, and where ballots were cast, as happened in some of the voting places, for the Federation No. 90 in a great majority, individuals, though they had but a small minority of votes, were declared elected as representatives by the company. The company's plan brought together in the organizations an equal number of officers and of employees' representatives, with the restriction that no action should be taken indicating agreement unless two-thirds of the body acting should concur. The company paid the expenses of the organizations and such permanent officers as they had were put upon the pay roll of the company. It instituted a trade organization with which the company proposed to deal and has dealt, although the evidence conclusively showed that it did not, at the time of the election certainly, represent a majority of the employees. The company and the employees whom it recognized as the representatives of their employees came to an agreement in respect to wages and working conditions and have induced many employees to sign such agreement. This agreement took effect as of July 1, 1921\n\n\n The bill in this case was filed to enjoin what was charged to be a conspiracy by the Pennsylvania Company and its officers to defeat the provisions of the act and deprive the employees of their rights with which the provisions of title 3 of the act intended to vest them in their dealings \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 209]\n\u00a0\n with the company, averring that, in the effort to deprive them of their proper representation and to maintain the plan of the company, the company resorted to coercion, with threats of discharge, and further violated their rights by preventing a large number of employees who were furloughed from casting their vote in the elections.\n The complainants further contend, first that all furloughed employees, who in July 1921, were refused re-employment in accordance with their seniority rights, should recover wages for the time the company has denied them re-employment at former wages; that employees who, having worked a year from July, 1921, to July, 1922, were discharged by the company for refusing to waive their rights under the Transportation Act, were entitled to recover the difference between the rate paid and what they were entitled to under a wage decision of the board in June, 1921; and, finally, that a large number of the company's employees, members of Federation No. 90, who were not furloughed in 1921 and did not strike in the summer of 1922, but continued at work under the wages, rules, and conditions established by the company's alleged unlawful agreement, are entitled to be paid by the company the difference between the amounts actually received by them and the amount they should have received at the rate of wages in force before the 1st of July, 1921. The contention is that complainants, in this their representative suit and as incident to the main relief sought by injunction, may have an accounting of damages sustained by the members of the Federation No. 90 in the premises.\n The prayer of the bill is for a decree enjoining the defendant the Pennsylvania Company from enforcing the provisions of the agreement with respect to wages and working conditions made as of July 1, 1921, between it and its employees under its plan on the vote taken, from enforcing \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 210]\n\u00a0\n any change in rules and working conditions as they existed on June 30, 1921-that is, as they existed under a previous national agreement, entered into while the property was under federal control; from continuing to deal with persons chosen on the company's ballots as the representatives of the employees engaged in mechanical work; from financing, interfering with, directing, and controlling the organizations of the company's employees for the purposes set forth in the Transportation Act; and from refusing to confer and deal with Federation No. 90 as the organization representing the great majority of the company's employees engaged in such work.\n The whole case for Federation No. 90 rests upon the contention that the conduct of the company and its officers is a statutory offense in the nature of a conspiracy under the provisions of section 19 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10183), which provides that, if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the laws of the United States, they shall be punished, and further that injunction will lie to restrain the means for promoting such conspiracy. Moreover, it is claimed that this is a conspiracy at common law, because it is a combination to accomplish an unlawful result by unlawful means, and actionable-citing Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197\n, 13 S. Ct. 542, and Duplex v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196. The whole issue, therefore, is whether the provisions of title 3 in pointing out what Congress wished the parties to the dispute to do, was intended by Congress to be a positive, obligatory law, creating an enforceable duty, such that a combination by the company and its officials to violate it is a conspiracy. Title 3 we have already construed in the Labor Board Case in \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278. We quote from the statement in that case:\n'Title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920 bears the heading 'Disputes between Carriers and Their Employees and Subordinate Officials.'- \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Section 301 makes it the duty of carriers, their officers, employees and subordinate officials, to exert every reasonable effort to avoid interruption to the operation of an interstate commerce carrier due to a dispute between the carrier and its employees, and further provides that such disputes shall be considered and if possible decided 'in conference between representatives designated and authorized so to confer by the carriers, or the employees or subordinate officials thereof, directly interested in the dispute.'\n'The section concludes:\n\n\"If any dispute is not decided in such conference, it shall be referred by the parties thereto to the board which under the provisions this title is authorized to hear and decide such dispute.'\n\n'Section 302 provides for the establishment of railroad boards of adjustment by agreement between any carrier, group of carriers, or the carriers as a whole, and any employees or subordinate officials of carriers, or organization or group of organizations thereof. No such boards of adjustment were established when this controversy arose.\n\n'Section 303 provides for hearing and decision by such boards of adjustment upon petition of any dispute involving only grievances, rules or working conditions not decided as provided in section 301.\n\n'Sections 304, 305 and 306 provide for the appointment and organization of the 'Railroad Labor Board' composed of nine members, three from the labor group, three from the carrier group, and three from the public group.\n\n'Section 307(a) provides that, when a labor adjustment board under section 303 has not reached a decision of a dispute involving grievances, rules, or working conditions in a reasonable time, or when the appropriate adjustment board has not been organized under section 302, the Railroad Labor Board '(1) upon the application of the chief executive \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 212]\n\u00a0\n of any carrier or organization of employees or subordinate officials whose members are directly interested in the dispute, (2) upon a written petition signed by not less than 100 unorganized employees or subordinate officials directly interested in the dispute, or (3) upon the Labor Board's own motion if it is of the opinion that the dispute is likely substantially to interrupt commerce, shall receive for hearing, and as soon as practicable and with due diligence decide, any dispute involving grievances, rules, or working conditions which is not decided as provided in section 301.'\n\n'Paragraph (b) of the same section provides for a hearing and decision of disputes over wages.\n\n'Paragraph (c) makes necessary to a decision of the board the concurrence of five members, of whom, in the case of wage disputes, a member of the public group must be one. The paragraph further provides that\n\n\"All decisions of the Labor Board shall be entered upon the records of the board and copies thereof, together with such statement of facts bearing thereon as the board may deem proper, shall be immediately communicated to the parties to the dispute, the President, each adjustment board, and the (Interstate Commerce) Commission, and shall be given further publicity in such manner as the Labor Board may determine.'\n\n'Paragraph (d) requires that decisions of the board shall establish standards of working conditions which in the opinion of the board are just and reasonable.\n\n'Section 308 prescribes other duties and powers of the Labor Board, among which is that of making 'regulations necessary for the efficient execution of the functions vested in it by this title.'\n\n'Section 309 prescribes that\n\n\"Any party to any dispute to be considered by an Adjustment Board or by the Labor Board shall be entitled to a hearing either in person or by counsel.'- \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'Section 313 is as follows:\n\n\"The Labor Board, in case it has reason to believe that any decision of the Labor Board or of an adjustment board is violated by any carrier, or employee or subordinate official, or organization thereof, may upon its own motion after due notice and hearing to all persons directly interested in such violation, determine whether in its opinion such violation has occurred and make public its decision in such manner as it may determine.\"\n\n This court's construction of the effect of these provisions is shown in the opening language of the opinion, as follows:\n Page 79 (43 S. Ct. 281): 'It is evident, from a review of title III of the Transportation Act of 1920, that Congress deems it of the highest public interest to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce by labor disputes and strikes, and that its plan is to encourage settlement without strikes, first, by conference between the parties; failing that, by reference to adjustment boards of the parties' own choosing, and if this is ineffective, by a full hearing before a national board appointed by the President, upon which are an equal number of representatives of the carrier group, the labor group, and the public. The decisions of the Labor Board are not to be enforced by process. The only sanction of its decision is to be the force of public opinion invoked by the fairness of a full hearing, the intrinsic justice of the conclusion, strengthened by the official prestige of the board, and the full publication of the violation of such decision by any party to the proceeding. The evident thought of Congress in these provisions is that the economic interest of every member of the public in the undisturbed flow of interstate commerce and the acute inconvenience to which all must be subjected by an interruption caused by a serious and widespread labor dispute, fastens public attention closely on all the circumstances of the controversy and arouses \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 214]\n\u00a0\n public criticism of the side thought to be at fault. The function of the Labor Board is to direct that public criticism against the party who, it thinks, justly deserves it.'\n Another passage is as follows:\n Page 83 (43 S. Ct. 283): 'The second objection is that the Labor Board in decision 119 and principles 5 and 15, and in decision 218, compels the railroad company to recognize labor unions as factors in the conduct of its business. The counsel for the company insist that the right to deal with individual representatives of its employees as to rules and working conditions is an inherent right which can not be constitutionally taken from it. The employees, or at least those who are members of the labor unions, contend that they have a lawful right to select their own representatives, and that it is not within the right of the company to restrict them in their selection to employees of the company or to forbid selection of officers of their labor unions qualified to deal with and protect their interests. This statute certainly does not deprive either side of the rights claimed.\n'But title 3 was not enacted to provide a tribunal to determine what were the legal rights and obligations of railway employers and employees or to enforce or protect them. Courts can do that. The Labor Board was created to decide how the parties ought to exercise their legal rights so as to enable them to co-operate in running the railroad. It was to reach a fair compromise between the parties without regard to the legal rights upon which each side might insist in a court of law. The board is to act as a board of arbitration. It is to give expression to its view of the moral obligation of each side as members of society to agree upon a basis for co-operation in the work of running the railroad in the public interest. The only limitation upon the board's decisions is that they should establish a standard of conditions, which, \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 215]\n\u00a0\n in its opinion, is just and reasonable. The jurisdiction of the board to direct the parties to do what it deems they should do is not to be limited by their constitutional or legal right to refuse to do it. Under the act there is no constraint upon them to do what the board decides they should do except the moral constraint, already mentioned, of publication of its decision.'\n\n A third passage is as follows:\n Page 85 (43 S. Ct. 283): 'It is not for this or any other court to pass upon the correctness of the conclusion of the Labor Board if it keeps within the jurisdiction thus assigned to it by the statute. The statute does not require the railway company to recognize or to deal with, or confer with labor unions. It does not require employees to deal with their employers through their fellow employees. But we think it does vest the Labor Board with power to decide how such representatives ought to be chosen with a view to securing a satisfactory co-operation and leaves it to the two sides to accept or reject the decision. The statute provides the machinery for conferences, the hearings, the decisions and the moral sanction. The Albor Board must comply with the requirements of the statute; but, having thus complied, it is not in its reasonings and conclusions limited as a court is limited to a consideration of the legal rights of the parties.'\n It is clear from this language that in the Labor Board Case this court has decided that there is nothing compulsory in the provisions of the statute as against either the company or the employees upon the basis of which either acquired additional rights against the other which can be enforced in a court of law. The language of the title is a legal definition of the jurisdiction and duty of the Railroad Labor Board in attempting to settle the controversies between the railroad employer and its employees, and where the Labor Board exceeds its jurisdiction and violates the provisions describing its functions, it \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 216]\n\u00a0\n may be subject to judicial restraint at the complaint of any properly interested party. The so-called mandatory language of section 301 might, if that section were accompanied by a penalty for its violation or some other means of compulsion and there were not the other provisions of the title to help its construction, be given the force of a statutory obligation of the parties to a dispute. There are two sections, sections 310 and 311, in this title, which do furnish instances of judicial compulsion in the matter of securing evidence and the production of records to promote the efficient administration of the functions vested in the Labor Board by the title. And there is section 312, which required that carriers until September 1, 1920, should continue to pay wages not less than those paid March 1, 1920, and fixed a penalty for each violation of this obligation and gave a right to the United States to a civil suit to recover the penalty. But, when the other sections of the title are taken as a whole, they may be searched through in vain to find any indication in the mind of Congress or any intimation that the disputants in the controversies to be anticipated were in any way to be forced into compliance with the statute or with the judgments pronounced by the Labor Board, except through the effect of adverse public opinion.\n What the complainants here are seeking to do is to enforce by mandatory injunction a compliance with a decision of the board, not based on the legal rights of the parties, but on its judgment as to what legal rights the disputants should surrender or abate in the public interest and in the interest of each other, to maintain harmonious relations between them necessary to the continuance of interstate commerce, and to avoid severing those relations as they would have the strict legal right to do. Such a remedy by injunction in a court it was not the intention of Congress to provide.\n The ultimate decision of the board, it is conceded, is not compulsory, and no process is furnished to enforce it; \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 217]\n\u00a0\n but it is urged that the preliminary steps are not the final decision, and it will make the act meaningless and wholly ineffective if under the act the parties may not be forced to a conference and to a contest before the Labor Board. This very point was considered by us in the Labor Board Case, and we held that the questions how the representatives of each side should be selected and whom the board should recognize as accredited representatives were of primary importance, affecting the working conditions of the railroad, and such decisions, therefore, must be regarded, although preliminary, as of the same class of decisions as those with respect to wages and ultimate working conditions. The same sanction, therefore, of publication and public opinion, exists for them and nothing else.\n The Pennsylvania Company is using every endeavor to avoid compliance with the judgment and principles of the Labor Board as to the proper method of securing representatives of the whole body of its employees, it is seeking to control its employees by agreements free from the influence of an independent trade union, it is, so far as its dealings with its employees go, refusing to comply with the decisions of the Labor Board and is thus defeating the purpose of Congress. Appellants charge that the company is attempting by threats to discharge its employees to secure their consent to the agreement of July 1, 1921, as to wages and working conditions agreed to by the representatives of its employees it declared elected. This is denied, though there is some evidence tending to support the charge. All these things it might do and remain within its strict legal rights after it came fully into control of its railroad property subsequent to September 1, 1920. We do not think Congress, while it would deprecate such action, intended to make it criminal or legally actionable. Therefore the bill of complaint does not aver a conspiracy, and without that equitable relief cannot be granted. \n\n[267 U.S. 203, 218]\n\u00a0\n We come now to the prayer for an allowance of damages to Federation No. 90, suing on behalf of its members. The claims are: First, for certain employees who, being on furlough when they were notified to return to work on a scale of wages made effective by the company July 1, 1921, refused to return, except on old scale prevailing September 1, 1920. They seek wages on the old scale, though they did not work. Second, for certain employees who worked under this company scale for a year and then struck. They seek a recovery for the difference between the old and the new scale established by the company. Third, for certain employees who did not strike at all, and accepted wages at the new scale till the filing of the bill. They seek recovery for the difference between the old scale and the new scale, which they accepted.\n It is argued that the new scale was illegal, because not fixed by the Labor Board under title 3 after a hearing, and therefore the only legal scale was that which prevailed before. We do not find it necessary to consider these claims on their merits. Even if the Federation No. 90 and its members as representatives in a class suit in equity could recover such claims as damages incidental to granting the main equitable relief prayed for, the denial of the prayer for the equitable relief and the dismissal of the main part of the bill carries with it such incidental claims without prejudice to their prosecution at law by individual claimants as they may be advised. Our conclusions on the merits of the main issue and the damage claims have made it unnecessary for us to consider objections made to the representative capacity of the complainants to maintain the bill.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF NEW YORK v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION(1925)\nNo. 33\nArgued: October 12, 1925Decided: November 23, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jackson A. Dykman and William N. Dykman, both of Brooklyn, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Edward M. Deegan, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The gas company challenges the validity of an order of the Public Service Commission on the ground that it \n\n[269 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n confiscates the company's property, is arbitrary and capricious, and therefore repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The order was made April 20, 1920, and directed the company to extend its mains to furnish gas to the residents of five communities-Locust Manor, Locust Lawn, South Jamaica Place, Springfield, and Laurelton-in the borough of Queens, New York City, and that the extensions be completed and put in service by November 1, 1920. On the petition of the company the proceedings were taken on writ of certiorari to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the state, and were there confirmed. 203 App. Div. 369, 196 N. Y. S. 623. The order of that court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 236 N. Y. 530, 142 N. E. 271. The case is here under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214).\n At the argument in this court, October 12, 1925, the commission suggested that no real controversy exists, and, upon leave granted, filed a motion to dismiss. The grounds asserted are that, since the writ of error issued June 5, 1923, the company has laid mains to serve two of the communities, and, as a part of its present plan to furnish gas to the other places named in the order, has laid mains in adjacent territory. Affidavits were filed by the commission in support of the motion, and by the company in opposition. Taken together, they show that the order has not been complied with; that a part of the extensions ordered has been laid, but that the company has not planned, and does not intend, presently to lay the mains necessary to furnish gas to all the communities directed to be served. The company is unwilling fully to comply with the order, and maintains that it is invalid. If the judgment of the state court is not reversed, summary proceedings to compel the company to obey the order may be brought by the commission in the state court. Section 74, Public Service Commissions Law (chapter 48, Consolidated Laws, New York). And this court cannot say \n\n[269 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n that the facts shown would constitute a defense. The case is not moot. The motion to dismiss will be denied. Cf. Brownlow v. Schwartz, \n261 \nU.S. 216, 217\n, 43 S. Ct. 263; Levinson v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 198, 202\n, 42 S. Ct. 275.\n The company has long had the privilege of laying gas mains in the streets and other public ways of the town of Jamaica (now the Fourth ward of the borough of Queens) to distribute gas for street lighting and other purposes. It does not appear that any other utility is authorized to furnish gas there, and it is to be assumed that these communities are dependent upon this company for service. When reasonably required, the company is in duty bound to furnish gas to inhabitants of the territory covered by its franchise. People ex rel. Woodhaven Gas Co. v. Deehan, 153 N. Y. 528, 533, 47 N. E. 787. And the commission is empowered by statute to require reasonable extensions of the mains and service. Section 66(2), Public Service Commissions Law, supra. In the territory already served by the company there are 150 consumers per mile of main. The sections for which service is ordered are residential communities. They have had water and electric service for many years. The houses already there, and those being built, are of a kind to indicate that, if brought within reach, gas will be used by the larger part of the inhabitants. There are good prospects of growth in the immediate future. The facts justify reasonable anticipation of a substantial and increasing demand for gas in the territory to be reached by the extensions.\n Compliance with the order requires the addition of about 16 miles of main. The affidavits filed on the motion to dismiss show that, in two of the communities directed to be served, and in the adjacent territory, the company has laid about 30 miles of mains since June 5, 1923. The state law fixes $1 per 1,000 cubic feet as the maximum rate (Laws 1906, c. 125,  1( 2)), and that rate was in force when the order was made. The \n\n[269 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n commission is without power to fix a higher rate. Section 72, Public Service Commissions Law, supra. The company's income applicable as a return on property was only $1,799.93 for the year in which the order was made. Without an increase of rate the service ordered will further decrease net earnings. It is stated in the company's brief that, in a suit brought by it in the United States District Court it was found that the cost to the company per 1000 cubic feet for 1919 was $.9992; for 1920 was $ 1.095; and for three months of 1921 was $1.3042, and that, September 25, 1922, the court decreed the maximum rate to be confiscatory.\n The court will not substitute its own judgment as to what extensions are reasonable for the determination of the commission. New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 \nU.S. 345, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 122. But it will consider the advantages to result to the public from the extensions ordered; it will also consider the investment required to make the necessary additions to property, the cost of furnishing gas in the added territory, the effect of the new service upon the company's income as a whole, and, if it appears that the power to regulate was so used as to pass beyond the exercise of reasonable judgment and to amount to an infringement of the right of ownership the order will be held invalid as repugnant to the due process clause. Under the guise of regulation, the state may not require the company to make large expenditures for the extension of its mains and service into new territory, when the necessary result will be to compel the company to use its property for the public convenience without just compensation. Atlantic Coast Line v. North Carolina Corp. Com'n, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 23 S. et seq., 27 S. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 276\n, 30 S. Ct. 330; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Ochs, \n249 \nU.S. 416, 421\n, 39 S. Ct. 343; Norfolk Ry. v. Public Service Commission, \n265 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 44 S. Ct. 439.\n It reasonably may be held that the location, present development, and prospects of growth of the communities \n\n[269 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n ordered to be served justify the estension to them of gas service, if a nonconfiscatory rate can be obtained.\n But the company construes the order to require it to sell gas in the added communities at the existing rate, and it insists that, as the rate is so low that present consumers must be served at a loss, the addition of new territory will increase the loss. Even assuming that $1, fixed as the maximum rate, is noncompensatory, it does not follow that the order in question is unreasonable or invalid. This case is to be distinguished from a suit to restrain the enforcement of legislation prescribing a confiscatory rate. Here the rate is not involved. The order directs the extension; it does not deal with compensation. The commission reasonably might assume that the company will take appropriate steps to save its property from confiscation. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 177 S., 42 S. Ct. 264. Indeed, it is said that the prescribed maximum already has been adjudged too low and confiscatory. The company's voluntary extension of mains to increase sales greatly impairs the weight of the contention that, because the cost of service exceeds the rate, the order is arbitrary. There is nothing to show that just compensation for the service ordered may not be had, or that compliance with the order will necessarily so reduce the company's income from its operations as a whole as to be in effect a confiscation of its property, or that, at rates not unreasonable or prohibitive, consumption of gas in the communities directed to be served will not be sufficient to yield a just return on the necessary additions. The company's contention cannot be sustained.\n Motion to dismiss denied.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL ROSEVALE REALTY CO. v.

On final hearing the Supreme Court entered an order denying this petition. This was affirmed by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals. 206 App. Div. 712, 200 N. Y. S. 942; 207 App. Div. 828, 201 N. Y. S. 935; 237 N. Y. 580, 143 N. E. 750. The record was remitted to the Supreme Court, to which this writ of error was directed. Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 \nU.S. 600, 601\n, 43 S. Ct. 435.\n By an Act amending the charter of Greater New York the Board of Estimate and Apportionment was given power to regulate the height and bulk of buildings thereafter erected, the area of courts and other open spaces, and the location of buildings designed for specific uses; to divide the city into districts for such purposes; and to change such districts from time to time, after public notice and hearing. New York Laws, 1916, c. 497, p. 1320. In July, 1916, the Board adopted a 'Building Zone Resolution,' or ordinance, dividing the city into various classes of use, height, and area districts. \n1\n In the several classes of area districts, which were designated A, B, C, etc., the required open spaces on each lot were progressively increased and the available building space correspondingly decreased. This Resolution also provided that the Board might from time to time change the districts, either on its own motion or on petition.\n In the Spring of 1922 the relator acquired a plot of ground in the Borough of Brooklyn, then in a C area district. It was also in a residential section known as Midwood Manor, in which, under private restrictive covenants contained in the deeds, no buildings except detached dwelling houses could be erected before January 1, 1923. Disregarding these restrictive covenants, the relator procured plans for a 40-family apartment house, conforming as to open spaces, etc., to the requirements of a C area \n\n[268 U.S. 646, 649]\n\u00a0\n district. It filed these plans with the Superintendent of the Bureau of Buildings on September 1, 1922, for the purpose of having them approved and obtaining a building permit. \n2\n The Superintendent on the same day issued a temporary permit for the necessary installation of footings and foundations; but on the next day revoked this temporary permit, because of a petition that had been forwarded by other owners of property in Midwood Manor to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, to place this locality within an E area district. On October 20, 1922, the Board, after a public hearing, amended the Zoning Resolution of 1916 by changing this locality, including the relator's plot, from a C to an E area district. On the following day the Superintendent refused approval of the relator's plans because the proposed building was contrary to the regulations of the Zoning Resolution applicable to an E area district.\n On January 25, 1923, the relator filed the present petition for peremptory mandamus against the Superintendent. \n3\n In this petition the relator did not challenge in any way the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution, either in reference to E area districts or otherwise, but did allege, in general terms, that the amendment of October 20, 1922, deprived it of its property in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In other \n\n[268 U.S. 646, 650]\n\u00a0\n words, it merely challenged the constitutionality of the transfer of its property from a C to an E area district, but did not challenge the constitutionality of the provisions in reference to E area districts in and of themselves.\n The petition was denied by the Supreme Court on the ground that the building for which the relator desired a permit would, if constructed, be in violation of the Zoning Resolution as amended, and would be unlawful. There was no reference in the opinion to any constitutional question; and the order of the Supreme Court was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals, without opinions.\n\n 1. \nThe relator by its assignments of error challenges the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution, especially as to the restrictions in an E area district made applicable to its plot by the amendment of October, 1922, and earnestly contends, in an elaborate argument, that such restrictions are not regulatory, but confiscatory, and have no such relation to the public welfare as justifies the exercise of the police power of the State. This, broadly outlined, is the contention made both in the oral argument and the relator's brief.\n It is clear, however, that no question as to alleged unconstitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution or of the particular provisions relating to E. area districts, was presented by the petition for mandamus; and no such question appears to have been presented to any of the State courts, or to have been considered or determined by them. It is well settled that this Court is without jurisdiction to review the judgment of a State court on a writ of error, by reason of a federal question which was not raised below or called to the attention of or decided by the State court. Cincinnati, etc., Ry. v. Slade, \n216 \nU.S. 78, 83\n, 30 S. Ct. 230; El Paso & Southwestern R. R. v. Eichel, \n226 \nU.S. 590, 597\n, 33 S. Ct. 179. The writ of error in the present case, therefore, does not bring up for our determination \n\n[268 U.S. 646, 651]\n\u00a0\n the question as to the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution as to which it is sought to invoke our decision.\n\n 2. \nWhile there is an incidental statement in the relator's brief that the amendment of the Zoning Resolution has resulted in restricting the principal use to which relator's property may be put, and also in the illegal confiscation of the plans prepared to conform to a C area district, no argument is made as to this question. And we find that the assignments of error do not, in any tangible or specific way, present any question as to the constitutionality of such amendment, but that, reasonably construed, they relate merely to the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution made applicable to the relator's property by the amendment. In short, the assignments challenge the constitutionality of the restrictive provisions themselves, and not the transfer from one area district to another. Nor is there in the relator's brief any specification of the errors relied upon, as required by Rule 21 of this Court, par, 2, cl. 2, setting up separately and particularly any error asserted in reference to the constitutionality of the amendment itself. This question is therefore not properly before us, even if its presentation was in fact intended.\n As the only federal question properly presented by the assignments of error, namely, the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of the Zoning Resolution, is one which, for the reasons already stated, is not brought within our jurisdiction by the writ of error, we conclude that, without consideration of the merits, the writ must be dismissed, and it is so ordered.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Each parcel of ground was placed within one of each of these three classes of districts. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By the Building Code of the city the Superintendent was required to approve or reject any application or plan 'within a reasonable time,' and, if approved, to promptly issue a permit therefor. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Meanwhile, in a suit by an owner of other property in Midwood Manor, the relator had been enjoined from constructing the apartment house, in violation of the restrictive covenants, prior to January 1, 1923. And an earlier petition filed by the relator for a peremptory mandamus against the Superintendent had been denied because of the pendency of this injunction, but without prejudice to an application to be made after its vacation or termination. 204 App. Div. 883, 197 N.

SOCIETY OF THE SISTERS OF THE HOLY NAMES OF JESUS AND(1925)\nNo. 583\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 510, 511]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Willis S.

Veatch, of Portland, Or., for appellee Hill Military Academy.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 510, 529]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These appeals are from decrees, based upon undenied allegations, which granted preliminary orders restraining \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 530]\n\u00a0\n appellants from threatening or attempting to enforce the Compulsory Education Act1 adopted November 7, 1922 (Laws Or. 1923, p. 9), under the initiative provision of her Constitution by the voters of Oregon. Judicial Code,  266 (Comp. St.  1243). They present the same points of law; there are no controverted questions of fact. Rights said to be guaranteed by the federal Constitution were specially set up, and appropriate prayers asked for their protection.\n The challenged act, effective September 1, 1926, requires every parent, guardian, or other person having control or charge or custody of a child between 8 and 16 years to send him 'to a public school for the period of time a public school shall be held during the current year' in the district where the child resides; and failure so to do is declared a misdemeanor. There are \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 531]\n\u00a0\n exemptions-not specially important here-for children who are not normal, or who have completed the eighth grade, or whose parents or private teachers reside at considerable distances from any public school, or who hold special permits from the county superintendent. The manifest purpose is to compel general attendance at public schools by normal children, between 8 and 16, who have not completed the eight grade. And without doubt enforcement of the statute would seriously impair, perhaps destroy, the profitable features of appellees' business and greatly diminish the value of their property.\n Appellee the Society of Sisters is an Oregon corporation, organized in 1880, with power to care for orphans, educate and instruct the youth, establish and maintain academies or schools, and acquire necessary real and personal \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 532]\n\u00a0\n property. It has long devoted its property and effort to the secular and religious education and care of children, and has acquired the valuable good will of many parents and guardians. It conducts interdependent primary and high schools and junior colleges, and maintains orphanages for the custody and control of children between 8 and 16. In its primary schools many children between those ages are taught the subjects usually pursued in Oregon public schools during the first eight years. Systematic religious instruction and moral training according to the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church are also regularly provided. All courses of study, both temporal and religious, contemplate continuity of training under appellee's charge; the primary schools are essential to the system and the most profitable. It owns valuable buildings, especially constructed and equipped for school purposes. The business is remunerative-the annual income from primary schools exceeds $30,000-and the successful conduct of this requires long time contracts with teachers and parents. The Compulsory Education Act of 1922 has already caused the withdrawal from its schools of children who would otherwise continue, and their income has steadily declined. The appellants, public officers, have proclaimed their purpose strictly to enforce the statute.\n After setting out the above facts, the Society's bill alleges that the enactment conflicts with the right of parents to choose schools where their children will receive appropriate mental and religious training, the right of the child to influence the parents' choice of a school, the right of schools and teachers therein to engage in a useful business or profession, and is accordingly repugnant to the Constitution and void. And, further, that unless enforcement of lthe measure is enjoined the corporation's business and property will suffer irreparable injury.\n Appellee Hill Military Academy is a private corporation organized in 1908 under the laws of Oregon, engaged \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 533]\n\u00a0\n in owning, operating, and conducting for profit an elementary, college preparatory, and military training school for boys between the ages of 5 and 21 years. The average attendance is 100, and the annual fees received for each student amount to some $800. The elementary department is divided into eight grades, as in the public schools; the college preparatory department has four grades, similar to those of the public high schools; the courses of study conform to the requirements of the state board of education. Military instruction and training are also given, under the supervision of an army officer. It owns considerable real and personal property, some useful only for school purposes. The business and incident good will are very valuable. In order to conduct its affairs, long time contracts must be made for supplies, equipment, teachers, and pupils. Appellants, law officers of the state and county, have publicly announced that the Act of November 7, 1922, is valid and have declared their intention to enforce it. By reason of the statute and threat of enforcement appellee's business is being destroyed and its property depreciated; parents and guardians are refusing to make contracts for the future instruction of their sons, and some are being withdrawn.\n The Academy's bill states the foregoing facts and then alleges that the challenged act contravenes the corporation's rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and that unless appellants are restrained from proclaiming its validity and threatening to enforce it irreparable injury will result. The prayer is for an appropriate injunction.\n No answer was interposed in either cause, and after proper notices they were heard by three judges (Judicial Code,  266 [Comp. St.  1243]) on motions for preliminary injunctions upon the specifically alleged facts. The court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed appellees against the \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 534]\n\u00a0\n deprivation of their property without due process of law consequent upon the unlawful interference by appellants with the free choice of patrons, present and prospective. It declared the right to conduct schools was property and that parents and guardians, as a part of their liberty, might direct the education of children by selecting reputable teachers and places. Also, that appellees' schools were not unfit or harmful to the public, and that enforcement of the challenged statute would unlawfully deprive them of patronage and thereby destroy appellees' business and property. Finally, that the threats to enforce the act would continue to cause irreparable injury; and the suits were not premature.\n No question is raised concerning the power of the state reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their teachers and pupils; to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that teachers shall be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship must be taught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public welfare.\n The inevitable practical result of enforcing the act under consideration would be destruction of appellees' primary schools, and perhaps all other private primary schools for normal children within the state of Oregon. Appellees are engaged in a kind of undertaking not inherently harmful, but long regarded as useful and meritorious. Certainly there is nothing in the present records to indicate that they have failed to discharge their obligations to patrons, students, or the state. And there are no peculiar circumstances or present emergencies which demand extraordinary measures relative to primary education.\n Under the doctrine of Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A. L. R. 1146, we think it entirely plain that the Act of 1922 unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 535]\n\u00a0\n under their control. As often heretofore pointed out, rights guaranteed by the Constitution may not be abridged by legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state. The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\n Appellees are corporations, and therefore, it is said, they cannot claim for themselves the liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. Accepted in the proper sense, this is true. Northwestern Life Ins. Co. v. Riggs, \n203 \nU.S. 243, 255\n, 27 S. Ct. 126, 7 Ann. Cas. 1104; Western Turf Association v. Greenberg, \n204 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 27 S. Ct. 384. But they have business and property for which they claim protection. These are threatened with destruction through the unwarranted compulsion which appellants are exercising over present and prospective patrons of their schools. And this court has gone very far to protect against loss threatened by such action. Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 543, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S. Ct. 15.\n The courts of the state have not construed the act, and we must determine its meaning for ourselves. Evidently it was expected to have general application and cannot be construed as though merely intended to amend the charters of certain private corporations, as in Berea College v. Kentucky, \n211 \nU.S. 45\n, 29 S. Ct. 33. No argument in favor of such view has been advanced.\n Generally, it is entirely true, as urged by counsel, that no person in any business has such an interest in possible customers as to enable him to restrain exercise of proper power of the state upon the ground that he will be de prived \n\n[268 U.S. 510, 536]\n\u00a0\n of patronage. But the injunctions here sought are not against the exercise of any proper power. Appellees asked protection against arbitrary, unreasonable, and unlawful interference with their patrons and the consequent destruction of their business and property. Their interest is clear and immediate, within the rule approved in Truax v. Raich, Truax v. Corrigan, and Terrace v. Thompson, supra, and many other cases where injunctions have issued to protect business enterprises against interference with the freedom of patrons or customers. Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 \nU.S. 229\n, 38 S. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461; Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L.

Ct. 628; Truax v. Corrigan, supra, and cases there cited.\n The suits were not premature. The injury to appellees was present and very real, not a mere possibility in the remote future. If no relief had been possible prior to the effective date of the act, the injury would have become irreparable. Prevention of impending injury by unlawful action is a well-recognized function of courts of equity.\n The decrees below are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Be it enacted by the people of the state of Oregon:\n Section 1.

Price; the second an oil and gas lease to the Magnolia Petroleum Co. The Magnolia Company brought a suit in equity in a district court of the State to enjoin Price and wife from interfering with its operations under the oil and gas lease. They made defense, alleging that the oil and gas lease was invalid and impaired their preference right under the agricultural lease to purchase the entire tract, including the oil and gas therein. The state, as intervener, asserted its ownership of the land and the validity of the oil and gas lease. The district court, on final hearing, entered a decree in favor of Price and wife. This was reversed by the Supreme \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n Court of Oklahoma, which adjudged and decreed that the oil and gas lease to the Magnolia Company was valid, and that Price and wife be perpetually enjoined from interfering with its operations. 86 Okl. 105, 206 P. 1033\n\n\n The federal questions presented rest, in substance, upon the contention that as applied in this case the Oklahoma Acts under which the gas and oil lease to the Magnolia Company was executed, deprived Price, as the agricultural lessee, of a preference right to purchase the land in its entirety, vested in him by the Oklahoma Enabling Act of 1906.\n The tract in controversy is a quarter of a section numbered 33 lying within the lands formerly included in the Territory of Oklahoma that were opened to settlement by an Act of June 6, 1900.1 This Act provided that sections 13 and 33 in each township should not be subject to entry, but should be 'reserved' for 'university, agricultural colleges, normal schools and public buildings of the Territory and future State of Oklahoma.'\n Prior to statehood the Territorial Leasing Board made short term agricultural leases on these reserved lands, with preference rights of re- leasing. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Enabling Act of June 16, 1906,3 by section 7 and section 8, granted to the State, upon its admission, sections 13, 16 and 36 in the several townships of the Territory of Oklahoma, for the use and benefit of universities, colleges and schools as therein specified.\n By section 8 it was provided that sections 33 therefore reserved for charitable and penal institutions and public buildings, should 'be apportioned and disposed of as the legislature of said State may prescribe'; and, further, that 'where any ... of the lands granted by this Act to the State ... are valuable for minerals,' \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n including gas and oil, they should not be sold by the State before January 1, 1915, but might be leased for periods not exceeding five years, at a fixed royalty in addition to any bonus offered, 'Provided, however, that agricultural lessees in possession of such lands shall be reimbursed by the mining lessees for all damage done to said agricultural lessees' interest therein by reason of such mining operations.'\n By section 10 it was provided that 'said sections thirteen and thirty- three, aforesaid, if sold, may be appraised and sold at public sale ... under such rules and regulations as the legislature of said State may prescribe, preference right to purchase at the highest bid being given to the lessee at the time of such sale, but such lands may be leased for periods of not more than five years ...: Provided, that before any of the said lands shall be sold ... the said lands and the improvements thereon shall be appraised by three disinterested appraisers ... and in case the leaseholder does not become the purchaser, the purchaser at said sale shall ... pay to ... the leaseholder the appraised value of said improvements, and to the State the amount bid for the said lands, exclusive of the appraised value of improvements.'\n The terms and conditions of the Enabling Act were accepted by the State of Oklahoma by an 'irrevocable' ordinance. Coyle v. Oklahoma, \n221 \nU.S. 559, 564\n, 31 S. Ct. 688; Sperry Oil Co. v. Chisholm, \n264 \nU.S. 488, 493\n, 44 S. Ct. 372. And the State by its constitution accepted all grants of land made by the United States under the Act, 'for the uses and purposes and upon the conditions, and under the limitations for which the same are granted.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The State constitution placed the sale and rental of the public lands in charge of Commissioners of the Land Office. \n5\n By subsequent Acts of the legislature it was provided: \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n That the Commissioners should have an appraisal made of all lands granted the State for educational and public building purposes, showing the value of the lands and of the improvements thereon, and the names of the lessees occupying them;6 that when any tract of the public lands was known or deemed by the Commissioners to contain oil or gas or to be valuable for such purposes, they should segregate the oil and gas deposits from the surface use and interest, thereby withdrawing the land from sale until they terminated such segregation, and might separately lease the oil and gas interest therein;7 that the Commissioners should sell certain of the public lands, including section 33 granted to the State for charitable institutions and penal buildings, at public auction, at which any lessee holding a lease thereon should 'have the preference right to purchase' at the highest bid;8 and that the reserved lands whose proceeds were to be used for penal, charitable and public buildings, should be leased until sold as provided by law. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Oklahoma was admitted as a State in November, 1907.10 The quarter section in controversy was not known then or for many years thereafter as oil and gas land. It was then held by one Click under an agricultural lease from the Territorial Leasing Board to January 1, 1908, with 'a preference right' of re-leasing. This right of re-leasing was not questioned by the State. The lease was extended for two successive years, first under a general statute,11 and then under rules of the \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n Commissioners. In January, 1909, the land and the improvements thereon were appraised. In October, Price purchased the interest of the lessee. After January 1, 1910, he continued to occupy the land and pay rentals thereon to the Commissioners, and was recognized by them as the lessee. In 1911, the Commissioners, after advertisement, sold at public sale the three other quarters of the same section 33, and other public lands in the vicinity. There is evidence that Price appeared at this sale and requested the officers in charge to sell his quarter section also, and that this was refused, the reason given being that it had not been advertised. There is no evidence that he thereafter requested, at any time, that a sale be made of this quarter section.\n In 1913, the Commissioners leased Price this quarter section, for agricultural and grazing purposes, until December 31, 1914. The lease recited that it was subject to the right of the State to sell the land at any time, and that upon such sale, Price, as lessee of the land, should be entitled to purchase the same at the highest bid, subject to the conditions provided by law; and also provided that he should have 'the preference right' to re-lease the land as provided by the laws of the State. This lease was subsequently extended for one year; and thereafter Price, without any formal extension or renewals of the lease, continued in possession of the premises and paid rentals to the Commissioners, and was in such possession, holding over as the agricultural lessee recognized by the Commissioners at the time this suit was commenced. His status as a lessee has not been questioned in any way, and the case has been tried by all parties on the theory that he has the full rights of an agricultural lessee of the land.\n In 1915 the Commissioners declared this quarter section valuable for mineral purposes, and adopted a motion segregating the same, and withholding it from sale. And \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n in 1919 they executed the oil and gas lease to the Magnolia Company that is now in controversy. The lease contained a provision that the Company should be liable to the surface lessee for all damage accruing to the surface interest. This liability the Company has never disputed.\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held, in substance, that Price had no right either under the Enabling Act or the Oklahoma statutes to require the State to sell the land at any time; and that the action of the Commissioners in withholding the land from sale, segregating the oil and gas, and leasing the same to the Magnolia Company, was in accordance with the provisions of the State statutes, and not in violation of any right vested in Price as an agricultural lessee either under those statutes or under the Enabling Act.\n The underlying federal question presented is based upon the contention that under the provisions of the Enabling Act, constituting a trust upon which the public lands were granted to the State, Price, as an agricultural lessee, was vested with the preference right to purchase the land as an entirety and to require the State to sell the entire interest in the same, and that the Oklahoma statutes authorizing the segregation of the oil and gas and the execution of a separate lease thereto, as applied in this case, impaired the value of the fee in the land and deprived Price of his preference right to purchase the land as an entirety, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We cannot sustain this contention. By section 8 of the Enabling Act it was provided that section 33 should be apportioned and disposed of 'as the legislature ... may prescribe;' and, further, that where any of the lands granted to the State 'are valuable for minerals' they should not be sold before January 1, 1915, but might be leased upon royalty, provided that the mining lessee \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n should reimburse the agricultural lessee for damage done by the mining operation. This authority to make mining leases clearly applied not merely to the land then known to be valuable for minerals but to such as might thereafter be found to be valuable for such purposes; and it did not require the State to sell such lands at any time, but merely prohibited their sale before the date specified. It impliedly authorized the making of mining and agricultural leases upon the same land. Furthermore section 10, by its specific terms, did not require the State to sell section 33 at any time, but merely provided that 'if sold' they might be appraised and sold at public sale, under such rules and regulations as the State might prescribe, the preference right to purchase at the highest bid being given to the lessee 'at the time of such sale.'\n We think it clear that these provisions of the Enabling Act, read together, gave the State entire discretion as to the time of selling these lands and the extent to which they should be sold. They did not require that all or any part of them should be sold, but merely provided that 'if' the State sold them they must be sold in the manner prescribed, and the preference right of purchase be given the lessee in possession at the time of sale.\n The State was not bound to sell them at any time, or at all, but might retain them as long as it deemed proper, and make meanwhile such leases as it desired not in conflict with the provisions of the Act. There was no provision in the Act, and none is implied, that the agricultural lessee might require the State to sell the land in its entirety whenever he desired to purchase the same; and nothing that gave him any right to purchase the land in its entirety or that prevented the State from executing oil and gas leases, as well as agricultural leases, whenever it deemed this the most advantageous method of realizing the full value of the lands for the public purposes for which they were granted to it. Plainly it was not intended \n\n[267 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n that the mere making of an agricultural lease should put the State at the merecy of the lessee, and require a sale of the land before its value had been ascertained or the available revenue derived from it. In short, the preference right of purchase given the lessee by the Act was merely the preference of purchasing the land in the condition in which it might be when and if the State chose to sell it; and not a right to compel the State to sell it, either in its entirety or otherwise, whenever he wished to buy.\n It results that the Oklahoma statutes under which, as held by the Supreme Court of the State, the Commissioners were authorized to withhold this quarter section from sale and to execute the oil and gas lease to the Magnolia Company, did not impair any right vested in Price as an agricultural lessee by the provisions of the Enabling Act, or deprive him of any right as such lessee in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In so far as the other federal questions presented were in issue under the pleadings or raised in the court below, they are necessarily answered by what we have already said, and need not be considered in detail. They show no error in respect to any federal question. And the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 31 Stat. 672, c. 813,  6. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of May 4, 1894, c. 68, 28 Stat. 71. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 34 Stat. 267, c. 3335. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Article 11,  1. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Article 6,  32. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Laws 1907-08, c. 49, art. 2, p. 484. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Laws 1907-08, c. 49, art. 4, p. 490, modified in immaterial respects, by Laws 1917, c. 253, p. 462. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Laws 1909, c. 28, art. 2, p. 448. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Laws 1909, c. 28, art. 1, p. 440. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Proclamation of the President, Nov. 16, 1907, 35 Stat. pt. 2, p. 2160. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Laws 1907-08, c. 49, art. 2, p. 484. \n\n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAY CONSOL COPPER CO. v.

Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, title 10,  1000a( 1), 40 Stat. 1057, 1126 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  5980n), provides:\n'Every domestic corporation shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to carrying on or doing business, equivalent to $1 for each $1,000 of so much of the fair average value of its capital stock for the preceding year ending June 30 as is in excess of $5,000. In estimating the value of the capital stock the surplus and undivided \n\n[268 U.S. 373, 375]\n\u00a0\n profits shall be included.'\n\n How the value shall be determined is the main question for decision.\n Ray Consolidated Copper Company, a domestic corporation engaged in the business of mining and smelting, has a capital stock of $15,771,790, divided into 1,577,179 shares of common stock of the par value of $10 each. Under the above provision, the company filed, on July 30, 1920, with the appropriate collector of internal revenue a return for the special tax for the year ending June 30, 1921, in which it reported that the fair average value of its capital stock for the preceding year was $34,803,608.99. The value so reported was arrived at by finding the average selling price of the stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the calendar year 1919 and multiplying the price so found-about $22 a share-by the number of shares outstanding. The stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was traded in almost daily, and the aggregate number of shares so sold during the year equalled nearly one-third of the total stock outstanding. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to accept the company's valuation; took into consideration for the purpose of estimating the value of the capital stock, among other things, the value of the mining property theretofore established in connection with other federal taxes; concluded that the fair value of the capital stock considered as a whole was not materially less than the net fair value of the assets; fixed the value of the capital stock higher than the company had reported; and exacted an additional tax. Refund being denied, this suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the additional amount paid. Before the trial the Commissioner refunded a part of the additional tax. As to the balance, that court upheld the assessment. 59 Ct. Cl. 686. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219).\n The company insists that the term 'fair average value of its capital stock' means fair average value of the aggregate \n\n[268 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n shares of its stock and not the value of the corporate assets; that the fair average value of the shares, based upon bona fide sales of the stock in reasonable volume, was correctly stated in its return; that the aggregate value of the shares so determined by the fair average selling price of the individual shares must be adopted as the single standard for determining the value of the capital stock; that such determination cannot lawfully be modified by any consideration of the value of the corporation's assets; that the Commissioner based his determination upon the net fair value of the assets; and that the additional tax was therefore illegally assessed.\n The tax is a special excise imposed on the privilege of carrying on business in the form of a corporation. Congress might have measured the value of the privilege by the net income of the year, as in the corporation tax, Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 108, 174\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; by the annual gross receipts, as in the sugar refiners' tax, Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397\n, 24 S. Ct. 376; by the amount of capital employed, as in the bankers' tax, Fidelity Title & Trust Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 304, 308\n, 42 S. Ct. 514; or by the fixed capitalization, as in the taxing acts of many states. It might have taken, as the measure, the aggregate value of all of the outstanding shares of stock and have directed that their value be computed by multiplying the average selling price, during the year, of a single share by the total number of shares outstanding. Compare The Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 209, 231. But Congress did none of these things. It declared that the tax should be measured by the 'fair average value of its [ the corporation's] capital stock.' In so doing, it used a term which has no fixed meaning in taxing statutes and it gave no directions for ascertaining such value, except that in 'estimating' value 'the surplus and undivided profits shall be included.'\n As the term 'capital stock' has no fixed significance, it must be construed in a particular statute by reference to \n\n[268 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n the context, the nature and purpose of the statute, its history, and other aids to construction. We think that, as here used, it means the entire potentiality of the corporation to profit by the exercise of its corporate franchise. Central Union Trust Co. v. Edwards (C. C. A.) 287 F. 324, 328. As the method to be pursued in ascertaining the value is not prescribed, we think that it was left to the sound judgment and discretion of the Commissioner, subject only to the obligation to take into consideration every relevant fact. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522, 540\n, 37 S. Ct. 683, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 97.\n The capital stock of a corporation, its net assets, and its shares of stock are entirely different things. Compare Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 686; Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 137 S., 6 S. Ct. 645; Wright v. Georgia R. R. & Banking Co., \n216 \nU.S. 420, 425\n, 30 S. Ct. 242; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 44 S. Ct. 23. The value of one bears no fixed or necessary relation to the value of the other. The net fair value of the assets was clearly a relevant fact bearing upon the value of the capital stock. It does not appear that the Commissioner refused to consider the selling price of the shares or other factors. He may have given much consideration to the selling price of the shares, and have concluded that, under the conditions prevailing in the year 1920, the average price at which relatively small lots were sold on the Stock Exchange was not a fair indication of the value of the capital stock. We cannot say that he acted arbitrarily or abused his discretion in concluding that 'the fair value of the capital stock considered as a whole is not materially less than the net fair value of the assets.' Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 555, 562\n, 37 S. Ct. 697. In Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 162\n, 163 S., 44 S. Ct. 462, where the provision here in question was upheld as applied to a voluntary association without a fixed or designated share capital, the collector had assessed the tax by 'taking the \n\n[268 U.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n fair value of the assets of the Association over its liabilities, and calling the difference its capital stock.'\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissents. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREADING STEEL CASTING CO. v.

Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought under section 24, par. 20, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), to recover $7,581.95, alleged to be due upon \n\n[268 U.S. 186, 187]\n\u00a0\n a contract between plaintiff and defendant. The court gave judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error, but it should have been brought to this court. J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 458\n, 39 S. Ct. 158; Campbell v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 368\n, 45 S. Ct. 115. The case was transferred to this court under section 238a, Judicial Code (Act Sept. 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a]) (C. C. A. Pa.) 293 F. 386.\n The facts admitted include the following: September 4, 1918, plaintiff made a contract with the post quartermaster, United States Marine Corps, Quantico, Va., acting under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy for and in behalf of the United States. By it, plaintiff agreed to furnish two flywheels according to certain drawings, each to be cast in halves 'in the rough.' Delivery was to be made by September 28, 1918, at Reading, Pa., for shipment to the De La Vergne Machine Company, New York City. The contract contained a provision that upon delivery, and as a condition precedent to their acceptance, the castings should be inspected and approved by defendant, and that any article not so approved would be rejected, and should be removed by plaintiff immediately after receipt of notification of such rejection. The court found facts as follows:\n'The plaintiff failed to perform its contract in that the castings were defective because of the presence of checks. These defects could have been remedied by welding, and the castings thus made to conform to contract. The extent of the cracks and the consequent required welding could not be determined until after the castings had been machined. Plaintiff sent the castings to the company which was to do the machining, and plaintiff was given the privilege of welding the cracks when disclosed by the machining. This welding was, however, not done, nor the castings made as required by the contract. The smaller casting which was the first casting supplied was inspected \n\n[268 U.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n and rejected within a reasonable time. After partial welding it was again inspected and rejected within a reasonable time. The large casting was not inspected until after a reasonable time. This wheel was shipped December 27, 1918, and reached its destination before February 7, 1919. It had not been inspected on December 6, 1919, and notice of inspection and rejection was not given until October 26, 1920, after suit brought.'\n\n In its brief, defendant contends that the plaintiff was bound by the contract to weld checks disclosed by machining, and the plaintiff so construes the contract. The facts admitted and the concessions made by the parties may be considered with the findings of fact made by the district court. This is not inconsistent with the rule stated in Crocker v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 36 S. Ct. 245, restricting our inquiry to a consideration of the case on the findings. See Ackerlind v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 531, 535\n, 36 S. Ct. 438. The contract is to be construed and the rights of the parties are to be determined by the application of the same principles as if the contract were between individuals. Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 47; Amoskeag Manufacturing Company v. United States, 17 Wall. 592, 595; United States v. Smith, \n91 U.S. 214\n, 217.\n As the castings for the smaller wheel were not made to conform to the contract by the welding of the checks for which it was rejected within a reasonable time, plaintiff is not entitled to recover on account of it.\n The defendant failed within a reasonable time to inspect the castings for the larger wheel or to give notice of rejection. Plaintiff was not in default. It made delivery as agreed by shipping the castings to the company which was to do the machining. Plaintiff was not bound to have the machining done, and, as between it and defendant, that burden was on the latter. The extent of the checks could not be determined before the castings were machined. Defendant was bound by the contract to accept \n\n[268 U.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n or reject the castings within a reasonable time. It is well settled in the law of sales that receipt of goods will become an acceptance of them if the right of rejection is not exercised within a reasonable time. Foss- Schneider Brewing Co. v. Bullock, 59 F. 83, 89, 8 C. C. A. 14.

It employs duly accredited representatives in many states who go from house to house soliciting and accepting orders. When a willing purchaser is found, the solicitor fills out and signs in duplicate a so-called 'order blank.' This obligates appellant to make delivery of the specified goods and, among other things, states:\n'The mills require a deposit of $1.00 [or other specified sum] on each box listed below. Your hosiery will be mailed you by parcel post c. o. d., direct from the post office branch in our mills. Pay the balance to the postman. As the entire business of the Real Silk Hosiery Mills is conducted on the parcel post c. o. d. basis, our representative cannot accept your order unless the deposit is made. We do not accept full payment in advance. Do not pay more than printed deposit.'\n\n One of the copies is left with the purchaser; the other is first sent to the local sales manager and then forwarded to the mills at Indianapolis. In response thereto the goods are packed and shipped by parcel post c. o. d. direct to the purchaser. The solicitor retains the cash deposit, and this constitutes his entire compensation.\n The appelland employs 2,000 representatives who solicit in most of the important cities and towns \n\n[268 U.S. 325, 335]\n\u00a0\n throughout the Union, and has built up a very large business-$10,000,000 per annum. Twenty operate in Portland, Or.\n May 16, 1923, that city passed an ordinance which requires that every person who goes from place to place taking orders for goods for future delivery and receives payment or any deposit of money in advance shall secure a license and file a bond. The license fee is $12.50 quarterly for each person on foot and $25 if he uses a vehicle. The bond must be in the penal sum of $500 and conditioned to make final delivery of ordered goods, etc.\n By a bill filed in the United States District Court for Oregon, appellant challenged the ordinance and asked that its enforcement be restrained upon the ground, among others, that it interferes with and burdens interstate commerce and is repugnant to article 1,  8, federal Constitution. The trial court upheld the enactment and sustained a motion to dismiss the bill. This was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 297 F. 897.\n Considering former opinions of this court, we cannot doubt that the ordinance materially burdens interstate commerce and conflicts with the commerce clause.

And we are unable to see that the burden on interstate \n\n[268 U.S. 325, 336]\n\u00a0\n commerce is different or less because they are paid through retention of advance partial payments made under definite contracts negotiated by them. Nor can we accept the theory that an expressed purpose to prevent possible frauds is enough to justify legislation which really interferes with the free flow of legitimate interstate commerce.

DONALDSON(1925)\nNo. 348\nArgued: April 28, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John R. Rood, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n Mr. John C. Spaulding, of Detroit, Mich., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The jurisdiction of the court below was invoked upon the ground of diverse citizenship, Judicial Code,  24, subd. 1 (Comp. St.  991); and the court dismissed the bill under the limiting clause contained in that subdivision:\n'No District Court shall have cognizance of any suit (except upon foreign bills of exchange) to recover upon any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee, or of any subsequent holder if such instrument be payable to bearer and be not made by any corporation, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover upon said note or other chose in action if no assignment had been made.' 294 F. 541.\n\n The bill alleges that appellant is a Delaware corporation and appellee a 'resident' of Michigan. This is not a sufficient allegation of appellee's Michigan citizenship. Robertson v. Cease, \n97 U.S. 646\n, 648; Wolfe v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., \n148 \nU.S. 389\n, 13 S.

It was, however, conceded by appellee in the court below, as well as here, that she was in fact a citizen of Michigan; and the court below assumed the point. Since the defect may be cured by amendment and nothing is to be gained by sending the case back for that purpose, we shall consider the amendment made and dispose of the case. Norton v. Larney, \n266 U.S. 511\n, 515-516, 45 S. Ct. 145; Howard v. De Cordova, \n177 \nU.S. 609, 614\n, 20 S. Ct. 817.\n Shortly stated, the bill alleges that appellee was the owner of certain real property in Michigan which she had leased to the Clifford Land Company, a Michigan corporation; that the Clifford Land Company had undertaken to finance for appellee the erection of a building upon such property. That appellant had executed and delivered to appellee two conveyances of other real property in Michigan as security for the erection of such building in accordance with the promises of the land company; that appellee had violated the terms of the lease in certain particulars set forth; and that appellant, 'in order to protect its rights and property in the premises,' etc., procured an assignment to it from the land company of the said lease. The specific relief prayed is a decree for 'specific performance by the said defendant of her said several undertakings' and for an injunction against interferences with appellant under the lease.\n The assignor, being a Michigan corporation, could not have prosecuted the suit in a federal court if no assignment had been made. The phrase 'to recover upon any ... chose in action,' under the decisions of this court, includes a suit to compel the specific performance of a contract or otherwise to enforce its stipulations. Corbin v. County of Black Hawk, \n105 U.S. 659\n, 665; Shoecraft v. Bloxham, \n124 \nU.S. 730\n, 8 S. Ct. 686; Plant Investment Co. v. Key West Railway, \n152 \nU.S. 71, 76\n, 14 S. Ct. 483; New Orleans v. Benjamin, \n153 \nU.S. 411, 432\n, 14 S. Ct. 905. An examination \n\n[268 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n of the bill of complaint discloses that the suit is primarily for a specific performance of the covenants of the lease. Additional relief sought is purely incidental to this main object. The case, therefore, falls within the doctrine of the foregoing decisions, and the court below was right in adjudging a dismissal. Kolze v. Hoadley, \n200 U.S. 76\n, 83 et seq., 26 S. Ct. 220; Citizens' Savings Bank v. Sexton, \n264 \nU.S. 310, 314\n, 44 S. Ct. 338.\n The cases relied upon by appellant are not in point. Brown v. Fletcher, \n235 \nU.S. 589\n, 35 S. Ct. 154, was a suit against a trustee by an assignee to recover an interest in an estate under an assignment by the cestui que trust. This court held that the relation between trustee and cestui que trust was not contractual; that the rights of the beneficiary depended upon the terms of the will creating the trust; and that a suit by the beneficiary or his assignee against the trustee for the enforcement of rights in and to the property held for the benefit of the beneficiary could not be treated as a suit on a contract or a chose in action. The court then said (page 599 [35 S. Ct. 157]):\n'The beneficiary here had an interest in and to the property that was more than a bare right and much more than a chose in action. For he had an admitted and recognized fixed right to the present enjoyment of the estate with a right to the corpus itself when he reached the age of fifty-five. His estate in the property thus in the possession of the trustee, for his benefit, though defeasible, was alienable to the same extent as though in his own possession and passed by deed. [ Citing cases.] The instrument by virtue of which that alienation was evidenced-whether called a deed, a bill of sale, or an assignment-was not a chose in action payable to the assignee, but an evidence of the assignee's right, title, and estate in and to property. Assuming that the transfer was not colorable or fraudulent, the federal statutes have always permitted the vendee or assignee to sue in the United States courts to \n\n[268 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n recover property or an interest in property when the requisite value and diversity of citizenship existed.'\n\n Crown Orchard Co. v. Dennis, 229 F. 652, 144 C. C. A. 62, was a suit by the grantee of standing timber to enjoin the cutting and conversion of the timber-in effect, a suit to prevent waste. There was no attempt to enforce any contractual obligation; and the court very naturally held that the case did not fall within the exception in section 24 of the Judicial Code. It was expressly assumed by the court that if the suit had been to enforce a contract or for specific performance, the rule would have been otherwise.\n The distinction is between a cause of action arising out of the ownership or possession of property transferred by the assignment of a contract-in which case the remedy accrues to the person who has the right of property or of possession at the time-and a suit to enforce the obligations of the assigned contract. Deshler v. Dodge, 16 How. 622, 631; Ambler v. Eppinger, \n137 \nU.S. 480\n, 11 S. Ct. 173. The present suit falls within the latter class. It is brought, not to recover property or to redress an injury to property which appellant had acquired through an assignment of a lease, but to enforce contractual obligations of the lease. No direct relief is sought in respect of appellant's lands conveyed as security, and they are affected only collaterally and incidentally. See Kolze v. Hoadley, supra.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROBERTSON v. RAILROAD LABOR BOARD(1925)\nNo. 739\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 619, 620]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Donald R. Richberg, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert W. Golding, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  310, par. a, 41 Stat. 456, 472 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 hhh), authorizes the Railroad Labor Board, 'for the efficient administration of the functions vested in' it, to require by subpoena 'the attendance of any witness ... from any place in the United States at any designated place of hearing, and the taking of a deposition before any designated person having power to administer oaths.' Paragraph b provides: 'In case of failure to comply with any subpoena [to testify] or in case of the contumacy of any witness appearing before the Labor Board, the Board may invoke the aid of any United States District Court. Such court may thereupon order the witness to comply with the requirements of such subpoena, or to give evidence touching the matter in question, as the case may be.'\n Pursuant to paragraph a, the Board issued a subpoena to Robertson, a citizen and inhabitant of Cleveland, Ohio, commanding him to appear at its offices in Chicago, Ill., on a day named, to testify concerning a dispute then being inquired into. The subpoena was served upon \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 621]\n\u00a0\n Robertson at Cleveland by the United States marshal for the Northern district of Ohio. Robertson did not personally attend as commanded. But on the day named he appeared specially by his attorney, and challenging the jurisdiction of the Board over him, declined to appear and testify. Thereupon this suit was begun by the Board in the federal court for Northern Illinois, Eastern division, pursuant to paragraph b.\n The bill prayed that Robertson, the sole defendant, be ordered to appear before the Labor Board 'at a time and place to be fixed by' it and make 'full answer to any and all pertinent questions relating' to the matter under investigation, and for any other proper relief. The court issued, in the form customary in equity, a summons, directing the defendant to appear and answer. This summons was likewise served upon Robertson personally at Cleveland by the United States marshal for the Northern district of Ohio. By his attorney he again appeared specially and moved to quash the service on the ground that, being an inhabitant of Ohio and served there, he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal court for Illinois. The motion was overruled; Robertson then moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit; this motion was also overruled; Robertson declined to plead further; and a final decree was entered directing him 'to appear before the Railroad Labor Board, upon due notice by said Board, at a time and place to be designated therein, there to testify, to give evidence, and to give full, true, and complete answer and response to any and all pertinent and relevant questions then and there propounded to him' concerning the subject-matter of the inquiry. 3 F.(2d). 488. The case is here on appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), the questions of jurisdiction having been duly certified. Whether the court acquired jurisdiction over Robertson is the only question requiring decision. \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 622]\n\u00a0\n Robertson contends that by the term 'any United States District Court' Congress meant any such court 'of competent jurisdiction'; and that, under the applicable law, no District Court is of competent jurisdiction to compel a defendant to obey its decree except that of the district of which he is an inhabitant or of one in which he is found. The Board contends that Congress intended by the phrase to confer not only liberty to invoke the aid of the court for any district, but power to compel the person named as defendant to litigate in the district selected by the Board, although he is not a citizen or inhabitant of it and is not found therein. The question presented is one of statutory construction. Congress clearly has the power to authorize a suit under a federal law to be brought in any inferior federal court. Congress has power, likewise, to provide that the process of every District Court shall run into every part of the United States. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 328; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n98 U.S. 569\n, 604. But it has not done so either by any general law or in terms by section 310 of Transportation Act 1920. The precise question is whether it has impliedly done so by that provision.\n In a civil suit in personam, jurisdiction over the defendant, as distinguished from venue, implies, among other things, either voluntary appearance by him or service of process upon him at a place where the officer serving it has authority to execute a writ of summons. Under the general provisions of law, a United States District Court cannot issue process beyond the limits of the district. Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n; Ex part Graham, 3 Wash. 456. And a defendant in a civil suit can be subjected to its jurisdiction in personam only by service within the district. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 330. Such was the general rule established by Judiciary Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20,  11, 1 Stat. 73, 79, in accordance with the practice at the common law. Piquet v. Swan, \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n 5 Mason, 35, 39 et seq., Fed Cas. No. 11,134. And such has been the general rule ever since. Munter v. Weil Corset Co., \n261 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 43 S. Ct. 347. No distinction has been drawn between the case where the plaintiff is the Government and where he is a private citizen. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Section 51 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1033) is a general provision regulating venue. The part pertinent here is that, with certain inapplicable exceptions, 'no civil suit shall be brought in any District Court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant.' \n2\n It is obvious that jurisdiction, in the sense of personal service within a district where suit has been brought, does not dispense with the necessity of proper venue. It is equally obvious that proper venue does not eliminate the requisite of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The general provision as to venue contained in Judicial Code,  51, has been departed from in various specific provisions which allow the plaintiff, in actions not local in their nature, some liberty in the selection of venue. \n3\n Unrestricted choice was conferred upon the Labor Board by the section of Transportation \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 624]\n\u00a0\n Act 1920, here involved (section 310). So far as venue is concerned, there is no ambiguity in the words 'any United States District Court.'\n Congress has also made a few clearly expressed and carefully guarded exceptions to the general rule of jurisdiction in personam stated above. In one instance, the Credit Mobilier Act March 3, 1873, c. 226,  4, 17 Stat. 485, 509, it was provided that writs of subpoena to bring in parties defendant should run into any district. This broad power was to be exercised at the instance of the Attorney Gengeral in a single case in which, in order to give complete relief, it was necessary to join in one suit defendants living in different States. United States v. Union Pacific Railroad, \n98 U.S. 569\n. Under similar circumstances, but only for the period of three years, authority was granted generally by Act Sept. 19, 1922, c. 345, 42 Stat. 849 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1035), to institute a civil suit by or on behalf of the United States, either in the district of the residence of one of the necessary defendants or in that in which the cause of action arose; and to serve the process upon a defendant in any district. The Sherman Act (Act July 2, 1890, c. 647,  5, 26 Stat. 209, 210 [Comp. St.  8827]), provides that when 'it shall appear to the court' in which a proceeding to restrain violations of the act is pending 'that the ends of justice require that other parties should be brought before the court,' it may cause them to be summoned although they reside in some other district. The Clayton Act (Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323 ,  15, 38 Stat. 730, 737 [Comp. St.  8835n]), contains a like provision. But no act has come to our attention in which such power has been conferred in a proceeding in a Circuit or District Court4 where a private citizen is \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n the sole defendant and where the plaintiff is at liberty to commence the suit in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or in which he can be found. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n As the Railroad Labor Board is charged generally with the adjustment of disputes between carriers and their employees, it may prove desirable to hold hearings at any place within the United States; and power to do so was expressly conferred. The Board may demand answers or the production of documentary evidence from one who attends such a hearing. The contumacy of a witness \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n appearing before the Board in any designated place of hearng was thus one contingency for which it was necessary to make provision. Congress also granted to the Labor Board in explicit language the broad power of compelling a person to come from any place in the United States to any designated place of hearing to furnish evidence. \n6\n The refusal to such person, who might be in any district in the United States, to comply with such a subpoena was obviously a second contingency to be provided for. Unrestricted liberty of venue in invoking the aid of a District Court, referred to before, was clearly essential to the complete exercise of the Board's powers and the effective performance of its functions. Moreover, this unrestricted choice cannot subject to undue hardship any defendant actually found within the district in which the suit is brought. But no reason is suggested why Congress should have wished to compel every person summoned either to obey the Board's administrative order without question, or to litigate his right to refuse to do so in such district, however remote from his home or temporary residence, as the Board might select. The Interstate Commerce Commission which, throughout 38 years, has dealt in many different ways with most of the railroads of the United States, has never exercised, or asserted, or sought to secure for itself, such broad powers. \n\n[268 U.S. 619, 627]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that by the phrase 'any District Court of the United States' Congress meant any such court 'of competent jurisdiction.' The phrase 'any court' is frequently used in the federal statutes and has been interpreted under similar circumstances as meaning 'any court of competent jurisdiction.' \n7\n By the general rule the jurisdiction of a District Court in personam has been limited to the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or in which he can be found. It would be an extraordinary thing if, while guarding so carefully all departure from the general rule, Congress had conferred the exceptional power here invoked upon a board whose functions are purely advisory (Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278; Pennsylvania R. R. System Federation No. 90 v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n267 \nU.S. 203\n, 45 S. Ct. 307, March 2, 1925), and which enters the District Court, not to enforce a substantive right, but in an auxiliary proceeding to secure evidence from one who may be a stranger to the matter with which the Board is dealing. We think it has made no such extension by section 310 of Transportation Act 1920. It is not lightly to be assumed that Congress intended to depart from a long-established policy. Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; In re East River Towing Co., \n266 \nU.S. 355, 367\n, 45 S.

DAHL(1925)\nNo. 316\nArgued: December 4, 1924Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. G. Maul, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph G. Barclay, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[266 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error Dahl brought an action against the Robins Company- plaintiff in error-a New York corporation, in the Supreme Court, Kings County, New York, to recover damages for personal injuries. He alleged: That on February 2, 1920, while employed by the Robins Company and doing repair work on the steamer El Occident, then lying in navigable waters at Brooklyn, a plank scaffold on which he was walking or standing broke and caused him to fall into the hold. That he sustained serious injuries caused solely by and through negligence in that the company did not furnish a safe place to work and failed to provide a safe scaffold as required by the labor laws of the state of New York, but negligently and carelessly furnished an unsafe, inadequate and unsuitable scaffold and plank. \n\n[266 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n The trial court instructed the jury:\n'This is what we call a maritime tort, an action in negligence that is governed by the maritime laws, the admiralty laws, the laws that pertain to navigable waters in this country. ... The law permits even a maritime case, such as should ordinarily be brought in the United States court, to be tried in a state court. But the maritime law is applied, and those maritime laws are known by lawyers as the common law. ...\n\n'Under the common law the same rule applies in this case as the rules that I have laid down to you, that the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was negligent, and that he himself was free from any contributory negligence. In this case, however, comes a provision known as section 18 of the Labor Law, and section 18 of the Labor Law [Consol. Laws, c. 31] reads as follows: 'A person employing or directing another to perform labor of any kind in the erection, repairing, altering or painting of a house, building or structure shall not furnish or erect, or cause to be furnished or erected for the performance of such labor, scaffolding, hoists, stays, ladders or other mechanical contrivances which are unsafe, unsuitable or improper, and which are not so constructed, placed and operated as to give proper protection to the life and limb of a person so employed or engaged.'\n\n'The decisions hold that section 18 of the Labor Law does not make an employer, as we term him, the 'master,' in this case the defendant, an insurer of the scaffold-and this plank within the meaning of the law is a scaffold-it does not make the master an insurer of the safety of the scaffold under all conditions; it requires the scaffold to be so safe as to give proper protection to the workmen engaged in their duty. However careful the master, he is responsible unless the scaffold is in fact a proper one, proper to protect the workman in the performance of his work. No law of the state can modify or affect the rights \n\n[266 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n of workmen who are operating under the maritime law. And it has been held that this section 18 of the Labor Law does not modify or affect the law, but may be read in conjunction with the law.\n\n'And as I understand the law to be, in determining in this case whether the defendant was negligent-for the plaintiff must still prove that the defendant was negligent-you must have in mind that there was in existence in the state a law which imposed upon the defendant the burden and the necessity of providing a scaffold that was proper for the workman to work upon. And in this case, in the light of that law, you must determine whether the defendant knowing the law, as it was called upon to know it, acted negligently, and whether or not the plaintiff has proved, by a fair preponderance of evidence, that it acted negligently.\n\n'If you find that in view of section 18 of the Labor Law the defendant did act negligently, then you go to the next proposition. If you find that it did not act negligently, that ends this case, and you must render a verdict in favor of the defendant. Assuming, for the purpose of bringing to your attention all of the law in the case, that you find under these circumstances the defendant was negligent then you come to the next proposition, was the plaintiff free from negligence that contributed to the injury. If he was free, then he is entitled to a verdict. If he did something that contributed to the injury, then he is not entitled to a verdict.'\n\n Proper exceptions were noted. Judgment went for plaintiff Dahl and this was approved upon appeal. The plaintiff in error maintains that the trial court committed material error by instructing the jury as above stated. On the other side the claim is that the challenged instruction only permitted the jury to consider violation of the state law as evidence of negligence and did not therefore materially affect the question of responsibility. \n\n[266 U.S. 449, 457]\n\u00a0\n The alleged tort was maritime, suffered by one doing repair work on board a completed vessel. The matter was not of mere local concern, as in Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469, 476\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008, but had direct relation to navigation and commerce, as in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479\n, 43 S. Ct. 418. The rights and liabilities of the parties arose out of and depended upon the general maritime law and could not be enlarged or impaired by the state statute. Chelentis v. Luchenbach Steamship Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 382\n, 38 S. Ct. 501; Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 \nU.S. 308\n, 39 S. Ct. 112; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S.

They would not have been different if the accident had occurred at San Francisco.\n The jury were distinctly told that they might consider the provisions of the local law in deciding whether or not the employer was negligent. No such instruction would have been permissible in an admiralty court, and it was no less objectionable when given by the state court. The error is manifest and material.

MCCURDY(1925)\nNo. 225\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error.[ Samuels v. McCurdy \n267 U.S. 188\n (1925) ]\n\n\n[267 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sig Samuels, a resident of De Kalb county, Ga., filed his petition in the superior court of that county against its sheriff, J. A. McCurdy, in which he prayed for the specific recovery of certain intoxicating liquors belonging to him which he averred had been seized on search warrant by the defendant. He asked an injunction to prevent their destruction. A rule to show cause issued and a restraining order. A general demurrer to the petition was sustained and the case dismissed. On error to the Supreme Court of the state, the judgment was affirmed. This is a writ of error to that judgment. \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n The petition averred that Phillips, a deputy sheriff of the defendant, went to Samuels' residence and acting under a search warrant seized and carried away a large quantity of whiskys, wines, beer, cordials and liquors, that he stored this in the jail of the county, that it was the purpose of the defendant to destroy them, without any hearing of the petitioner; that the value of the liquors at the scale of prices current before the prohibition laws was approximately $400, but at the prices paid thereafter if illegally sold, would be very much more; that the greater part of the liquors was bought by the petitioner and kept at his home prior to the year 1907; that the balance thereof was legally purchased by him in the state of Florida and legally shipped to him in interstate commerce prior to the year 1915; that although a citizen of the United States and the state of Georgia, the petitioner was born in Europe where the use of such liquors had been common, that he had been accustomed to their use all his life, that he purchased them lawfully for the use of his family and friends at his own home, and not for any unlawful purpose.\n The Session Laws of Georgia for 1907, p. 81, now embodied in section 426 of the Georgia Penal Code, declares that:\n'It shall not be lawful for any person within the limits of this state to sell or barter for valuable consideration, either directly or indirectly, or give away to induce trade at any place of business, or keep or furnish at any other ... places, or manufacture, or keep on hand at their place of business any alcoholic, spirituous, malt, or intoxicating liquors, or intoxicating bitters, or other drinks which, if drunk to excess, will produce intoxication; and any person so offending shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.'\n\n By Act of November 17, 1915 (Laws Ga. Ex. Sess. 1915, p. 77)  2, it is provided:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person ... to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, ... keep on hand at a place \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n of business or at or in any social, fraternal or locker club, or otherwise dispose of any of the prohibited liquors and beverages described in section 1 of this act, or any of them, in any quantity; but this inhibition does not include, and nothing in this act shall affect, the social serving of such liquors and beverages in private residences in ordinary social intercourse.'\n\n Section 20 of same act reads as follows:\n'Sec. 20. Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no property rights of any kind shall exist in said prohibited liquors and beverages, or in the vessels kept or used for the purpose of violating any provision of this act or any law for the promotion of temperance or for the suppression of the evils of intemperance; nor in any such liquors when received, possessed or stored at any forbidden place or anywhere in a quantity forbidden by law, or when kept, stored or deposited in any place in this state for the purpose of sale or unlawful disposition or unlawful furnishing or distribution; and in all such cases the liquors and beverages, and the vessels and receptacles in which such liquors are contained, and the property herein named, kept or used for the purpose of violating the law as aforesaid, are hereby declared to be contraband and are to be forfeited to the state when seized, and may be ordered and condemned to be destroyed after seizure by order of the court that has acquired jurisdiction over the same, or by order of the judge or court after conviction when such liquors and such property named have been seized for use as evidence.'\n\n By Act of March 28, 1917 (Laws Ga. Ex. Sess. 1917, p. 7), it is declared that:\n'It shall be unlawful for any corporation, firm, person or individual to receive from any common carrier, corporation, firm, person or individual, or to have, control or possess, in this state, any of said enumerated liquors or beverages whether intended for personal use or otherwise, save as is hereinafter excepted.' \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n The provision of 1915 which permitted the social serving of liquors and beverages in private residences and in ordinary social intercourse was expressly repealed by the act of 1917. Under other provisions liquor and wine may be held for medicinal, mechanical and sacramental purposes on special permits. There are not claimed to be any circumstances in this case excepting the liquors here seized from the condemnation of the act of 1917\n\n\n\n Three grounds are urged for reversal: First, the 1917 law under which liquor lawfully acquired can be seized and destroyed is an ex post facto law. Second, the law in punishing the owner for possessing liquor he had lawfully acquired before its enactment, deprives him of his property without due process. Third, it violates the due process requirement by the seizure and destruction of the liquor without giving the possessor his day in court.\n First. This law is not an ex post facto law. It does not provide a punishment for a past offense. It does not fix a penalty for the owner for having become possessed of the liquor. The penalty it imposes is for continuing to possess the liquor after the enactment of the law. It is quite the same question as that presented in Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67\n, 35 S. Ct. 678. There a Missouri statute required railroads to construct water outlets across their rights of way. The railroad company had constructed a solid embankment twelve years before the passage of the act. The railroad was penalized for noncompliance with the statute. This court said:\n'The argument that in respect to its penalty feature the statute is invalid as an ex post facto law is sufficiently answered by pointing out that plaintiff in error is subjected to a penalty not because of the manner in which it originally constructed its railroad embankment, nor for anything else done or omitted before the passage of the act of 1917, but because after that time it maintained the embankment in a manner prohibited by that act.' \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n Second. Does the seizure of this liquor and its destruction deprive the plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\n In Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304\n, 38 S. Ct. 98, Crane was arrested for having in his possession a bottle of whisky for his own use, and not for the purpose of giving away or selling the same to any person. This was under a provision of the statute of Idaho that it should be unlawful for any person to import, ship, sell, transport, deliver, receive or have in his possession any intoxicating liquors. It was held that the law was within the police power of the state. The court said:\n'It must now be regarded as settled that, on account of their well- known noxious qualities and the extraordinary evils shown by experience commonly to be consequent upon their use, a state has power absolutely to prohibit manufacture, gift, purchase, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within its borders without violating the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment'-citing Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, \n97 U.S. 25\n, 33; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 662\n, 8 S. Ct. 273; Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 11 S. Ct. 13; Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n, 33 S. Ct. 44; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 330\n, 331 S., 37 S. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845.\n\n The court pointed out that as the state had the power to prohibit, it might adopt such measures as were reasonably appropriate or needful to render exercise of that power effective; and that considering the notorious difficulties always attendant upon efforts to suppress traffic in liquors, the court was unable to say that the challenged inhibition of their possession was arbitrary and unreasonable or without proper relation to the legitimate legislative purpose, that the right to hold intoxicating liquor for personal use was not one of those fundamental privileges \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n of a citizen of the United States which no state could abridge, and that a contrary view would be incompatible with the undoubted power to prevent manufacture, gift, sale, purchase or transportation of such articles-the only feasible way of getting them. It did not appear in that case when the liquor seized had been acquired but presumably after the prohibitory act.\n In Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454\n, 39 S. Ct. 316, it was held that the Georgia prohibitory law, approved November 18, 1915, but which did not become effective until May 1, 1916, was not invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment when applied to the possession of liquor by one who had acquired it after the approval of the law and before it became effective.\n These cases it is said do not apply because the liquor here was lawfully acquired by Samuels before the act of 1917 making it unlawful for one to be possessed of liquor in his residence for use of his family and his guests.\n In Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S. Ct. 273, it appeared that the breweries, the use of which as such was enjoined as a nuisance, and the beer the sale of which was also enjoined, were owned by Mugler before the Prohibition Act, making both unlawful. In answering the argument that even if the state might prohibit the use and sale, compensation should be made for them before putting it into effect to accord with the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, said:\n'As already stated, the present case must be governed by principles that do not involve the power of eminent domain, in the exercise of which property may not be taken for public use without compensation. A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for the public benefit. Such legislation does not \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n disturb the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by the state that its use by any one, for certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests. Nor can legislation of that character come within the Fourteenth Amendment, in any case, unless it is apparent that its real object is not to protect the community, or to promote the general well-being, but, under the guise of police regulation, to deprive the owner of his liberty and property, without due process of law. The power which the states have of prohibiting such use by individuals of their property as will be prejudicial to the health, the morals, or the safety of the public, is not-and, consistently with the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be-burdened with the condition that the state must compensate such individual owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community. The exercise of the police power by the destruction of property which is itself a public nuisance, or the prohibition of its use in a particular way, whereby its value becomes depreciated, is very different from taking property for public use, or from depriving a person of his property without due process of law. In the one case, a nuisance only is abated; in the other, unoffending property is taken away from an innocent owner.\n\n'It is true, that, when the defendants in these cases purchased or erected their breweries, the laws of the state did not forbid the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. But the state did not thereby give any assurance, or come under an obligation, that its legislation upon that subject would remain unchanged. Indeed, as was said in Stone v. Mississippi, above cited, the supervision of the public health and the public morals is a governmental power, 'continuing in its nature,' and 'to be dealt with as the \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n special exigencies of the moment may require'; and that, 'for this purpose, the larges legislative discretion is allowed, and the discretion cannot be parted with any more than the power itself.\"\n\n In view of this language and the agreed statement of facts the decision necessarily was that the sale of beer made and owned before the Prohibition Law could be punished by that law as a nuisance and that no compensation was necessary, if the Legislature deemed this course necessary for the health and morals of the community.\n It is true that a remark in the opinion in Eberle v. Michigan, \n232 \nU.S. 700, 706\n, 34 S. Ct. 464, refers to the question as still an open one, and the same reference is made in Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 39 S. Ct. 316. In Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 157\n, 40 S. Ct. 106, there is a similar reference, though with a suggestive citation to Mugler v. Kansas. And in Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264\n, 40 S. Ct. 141, after calling attention to this reservation, this court said:\n'It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments affirmed in the Mugler Case, was one for violation of the act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see pages 625, 627); and that it was assumed without discussion that the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (page 669).'\n\n But it was not found necessary to consider the question in the Jacob Ruppert Case, because there was no appropriation of property but merely a lessening of value due to permissible restriction imposed upon its use.\n The ultimate legislative object of prohibition is to prevent the drinking of intoxicating liquor by any one because of the demoralizing effect of drunkenness upon society. The state has the power to subject those members of society who might indulge in the use of such liquor without injury to themselves to a deprivation of access to liquor in order to remove temptation from those whom \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 198]\n\u00a0\n its use would demoralize and to avoid the abuses which follow in its train. Accordingly laws have been enacted by the states, and sustained by this court by which it has been made illegal to manufacture liquor for one's own use or for another's, to transport it or to sell it or to give it away to others. The Legislature has this power whether it affects liquor lawfully acquired before the prohibition or not. Without compensation it may thus seek to reduce the drinking of liquor. It is obvious that if men are permitted to maintain liquor in their possession, though only for their own consumption, there is danger of its becoming accessible to others. Legislation making possession unlawful is therefore within the police power of the states as reasonable mode of reducing the evils of drunkenness, as we have seen in the Crane and Barbour Cases. The only question which arises is whether for the shrunken opportunity of the possessor of liquor who acquired it before the law, to use it only for his own consumption, the state must make compensation. By valid laws, his property rights have been so far reduced that it would be difficult to measure their value. That which had the qualities of property has, by successive provisions of law in the interest of all, been losing its qualities as property. For many years, every one who has made or stored liquor has known that it was a kind of property which because of its possible vicious uses might be denied by the state the character and attributes as such, that legislation calculated to suppress its use in the interest of public health and morality was lawful and possible, and this without compensation. Why should compensation be made now for the mere remant of the original right if nothing was paid for the loss of the right to sell it, give it away or transport it? The necessity for its destruction is claimed under the same police power to be for the public betterment as that which authorized its previous restrictions. It seems to us that this conclusion finds support \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 199]\n\u00a0\n in the passage quoted above from the opinion in the Mugler Case and its application to the agreed facts, and in Gardner v. Michigan, \n199 \nU.S. 325\n, 26 S. Ct. 106, and Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Works, \n199 \nU.S. 306\n, 26 S. Ct. 100. See, also, North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 \nU.S. 306\n, 29 S. Ct. 101, 15 Ann. Cas. 276, and Adams v. Milwaukee, \n228 \nU.S. 572, 584\n, 33 S. Ct. 610; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 136\n, 14 S. Ct. 499; United States v. Pacific Railroad, \n120 \nU.S. 227, 239\n, 7 S. Ct. 490. In Gardner v. Michigan, a municipal ordinance was held valid which required the owner to deliver to the agent of the city all garbage with vegetable and animal refuse although it was shown that it was property of value because it could be advantageously used for the manufacture of commercial fat. It was decided that the police power justified the Legislature or its subordinate, the city council, in the interest of the public in removing and destroying the garbage as a health measure without compensation.\n Finally it is said that the petitioner here has no day in court provided by the law, and therefore that in this respect the liquors have been taken from him without due process. The Supreme Court of Georgia has held in Delaney v. Plunkett, 146 Ga. 547, 565, 91 S. E. 561, L. R. A. 1917D, 926, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 685, that under the twentieth section of the Act of November 17, 1915 (Georgia Laws, Extra Session 1915, p. 77), quoted above, which declares that no property rights of any kind shall exist in prohibited liquors and beverages, no hearing need be given the possessor of unlawfully held liquors but that they may be destroyed by order of the court. In the Plunkett Case the seizure was of liquor held in excess of an amount permitted by the law of 1915. By the amendment of 1917, as already pointed out, possession even for home use is now forbidden. As in the Plunkett Case, the petitioner does not deny that the liquor seized was within the condemnation of the law and that he has no defense to his possession of it except as he asserts a property right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment which we have \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 200]\n\u00a0\n found he does not have. As a search warrant issued the seizure was presumably valid. The law provides for an order of destruction by a court, but it does not provide for notice to the previous possessor of the liquor and a hearing before the order is made. Under the circumstances prima facie the liquor existed contrary to law and it was for the possessor to prove the very narrow exceptions under which he could retain it as lawful. It he desired to try the validity of the seizure or the existence of the exception by which his possession could be made to appear legal, he could resort to suit to obtain possession and to enjoin the destruction under the Georgia law, as he has done in this case. This under the circumstances, it seems to us, constitutes sufficient process of law under the federal Constitution as respects one in his situation. Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 142\n, 14 S. Ct. 499. What might be necessary, if he were claiming to hold the liquor lawfully for medicinal or some other specially excepted purpose we need not consider.\n The averment in the petition was that the sheriff intended to destroy the liquor. There is no averment in the petition that he did not intend to do this by order of court upon his application. We must take it for granted on the demurrer, therefore, as against the pleader that the sheriff did not intend to depart from section 20 of the act of 1915, and that the question made here is on the validity of that section.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissenting.\n I cannot agree with the opinion of the court in this case. Plaintiff in error is a man of temperate habits, long accustomed to use alcoholic liquor as a beverage. He never sold or in any way illegally dealt with intoxicating liquors and has never been accused of so doing. His supply was lawfully acquired years before the passage of the \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 201]\n\u00a0\n enactment in question (the act of March 28, 1917) for the use of himself, his family and friends in his own home, and not for any unlawful purpose. It consisted of spirituous, vinous and malt liquors and, before the passage of the act, was worth about $400. September 21, 1922, a deputy sheriff or constable, in company with a number of other persons, went to the house of plaintiff in error and searched it and seized and carried away his stock of liquor and delivered it to the sheriff. It was his purpose summarily to destroy it. This suit was brought to restrain him.\n Plaintiff in error insists that the seizure deprived him of his property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decisions of this court in Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304\n, 38 S. Ct. 98, and Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454\n, 39 S. Ct. 316, are not controlling. In the Crane Case, the Idaho statute under consideration (chapter 11, Session Laws 1915) made it unlawful to have in possession or to transport any intoxicating liquor within a prohibition district in that state. Crane was accused of having in his possession a bottle of whisky for his own use and benefit, and not for the purpose of giving away or selling the same. The state Supreme Court said:\n'The only means provided by the act for procuring intoxicating liquors in a prohibition district for any purpose relates to wine to be used for sacramental purposes and pure alcohol to be used for scientific or mechanical purposes, or for compounding or preparing medicine, so that the possession of whisky, or of any intoxicating liquor, other than wine and pure alcohol for the uses above-mentioned is prohibited.' In re Crane, 27 Idaho 671, 679, 151 P. 1006, 1008 (L. R. A. 1918A, 942).\n\n The point was not made that the liquor was lawfully acquired or that it had never been unlawfully sold, transported or held. Presumably, the whisky was acquired after the act took effect, and it could not be claimed that it had not been sold or transported in violation of law. In the Barbour Case, the prosecution was \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 202]\n\u00a0\n under Georgia legislation approved November 18, 1915, which did not take effect until May 1, 1916. Barbour was convicted of having more than a gallon of vinous liquor in his possession on June 10, 1916. This court, following the Supreme Court of Georgia, assumed that the liquor was acquired after the act was passed and before it took effect, and held that Barbour took the the liquor with notice that after a day certain its possession, by mere lapse of time, would become a crime. The act of 1907, now section 426 of the Georgia Penal Code, was in force and made it unlawful for any person to sell or barter intoxicating liquors. It did not appear and was not claimed that the liquor had been lawfully acquired by the accused or that it had not been sold, transported or held in violation of law. The precise question here raised was not decided in either of these cases. Each presented facts materially different from those in the present case.\n The seizure and destruction cannot be sustained on the ground that the act in question destroyed the value of the liquor. The question of compensation is not involved. That alcoholic liquors are capable of valuable uses is recognized by the whole mass of state and national regulatory and prohibitory laws, as well as by the state legislation in question. The liquors seized were valuable for such private use as was intended by plaintiff in error. The insistence is that the state is without power to seize and destroy a private supply of intoxicating liquor lawfully acquired before the prohibitory legislation and kept in one's house for his own use. Such seizure and destruction can be supported only on the ground that the private possession and use would injure the public. See Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 663\n, 8 S. Ct. 273; Gardner v. Michigan, \n199 \nU.S. 325, 333\n, 26 S. Ct. 106.\n The enactment does not directly forbid the drinking of intoxicating liquors. The state Supreme Court has not construed it to prevent such private use of intoxicants. \n\n[267 U.S. 188, 203]\n\u00a0\n It is aimed at the liquor traffic. See Delaney v. Plunkett, 146 Ga. 547, 91 S. E. 561, L. R. A. 1917D, 926, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 685, Barbour v. State, 146 Ga. 667, 92 S. E. 70, 2 A. L. R. 1095, Bunger v. State, 146 Ga. 672, 92 S. E. 72, cited by that court as authority for its decision in this case. Attention has not been called to any legislation which attempts directly to forbid the mere drinking or other private use of such liquors. As against the objection that it would infringe constitutional provisions safeguarding liberty and property, the power of the state to enact and enforce such legislation has not been established. That question is not involved in this case.\n Any suggestion that the destruction of such private supply lawfully acquired and held for the use of the owner in his own home is necessary for or has any relation to the suppression of sales or to the regulation of the liquor traffic or to the protection of the public from injury would be fanciful and without foundation. The facts in the case do not permit the application of the doctrine applied in Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 44.\n To me it seems very plain that, as applied, the law is oppressive and arbitrary, and that the seizure deprived plaintiff in error of his property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I would reverse the judgment of the state court. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANFORD & BROOKS CO. v. U S(1925)\nNo. 175\nArgued: January 15, 1925Decided: March 9, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. William L. Marbury, of Washington, D. C. (Messrs. Horace S. Whitman and Charles Clagett, both of Washington, D. C.), for appellant. \n\n[267 U.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Merrill E. Otis, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen. and Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City (Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., on the brief), for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sanford & Brooks Company agreed with the United States to dredge a channel at a fixed rate per cubic yard of material dredged. Payment for the number of yards dredged was made at the contract rate. Later, this suit was brought to recover additional sums, as upon a quantum meruit. One claim was that the material to be removed within the contract lines had been misdescribed in the specifications; and the rule applied in United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 423, and United States v. Spearin, \n248 \nU.S. 132\n, 39 S. Ct. 59, was invoked. Another claim was that, through a mistake of the government's representative, work had been done outside the limits prescribed by the contract, and that this was more burdensome. The Court of Claims, after a hearing upon the evidence, entered judgment for the defendant. 58 Ct. Cl. 158. The case is here on appeal under section 242 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1219). The appeal was filed in this court on September 20, 1923. It was not reached for argument until January 15, 1925. On January 9, 1925, the plaintiff filed, with its brief on the merits, a motion to remand. The document, including appendices, contained 65 printed pages.\n The reliance in this court was wholly upon the motion to remand. The claim on account of work inside the contract lines was not insisted upon here. The claim for work outside the contract lines was urged in the brief on the merits, but at the argument plaintiff conceded that, upon the findings of fact made, there could be no recovery. The contention then presented was that this court could not come to a proper decision on \n\n[267 U.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n this claim without having findings as to the existence or nonexistence of eight additional alleged facts; and that to this end the cause should be remanded to the lower court. The government objected to the allowance of the motion to remand on the grounds that the findings already made were definite; that they included all material facts; and that, if the additional facts asserted were found, these would not change the legal result. The objections are, in our opinion, sound.\n Plaintiff asserts that the additional findings would show that, when the erroneous location of the work was discovered, it made oral protest to the contracting officer of the government against continuance of the work outside the contract lines; that it protested orally against payment for such work at the contract price; that, during the progress of the work, it made claim for payment upon a quantum meruit basis; that, seven months after the completion of the work in question, the Judge Advocate General gave an opinion on this claim favorable to the plaintiff; that the Assistant Secretary of War approved of the opinion; that he directed that negotiations be had with plaintiff concerning the amount of additional compensation to be paid; but that no agreement was reached These, with other minor additions to the facts as found, are relied upon by plaintiff to show that, as to this work, the express provisions in the written contract which required prompt written protest against any order for work outside of the specifications, written modification of the contract if it was altered materially, and written orders for extra work, were all inapplicable or waived; and that a new oral agreement providing for compensation quantum meruit was substituted by implication. We are of opinion that the findings sought, if made, would be of no avail to plaintiff. Oral protests, a claim for additional compensation and a favorable \n\n[267 U.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n advisory opinion thereon, would be facts clearly insufficient to establish plaintiff's contentions.\n Moreover, if those facts could conceivably affect the result, the motion should, as a matter of discretion, be denied because of the delay in filing it. A motion to remand for further findings, even if based wholly upon matter included in the original record on appeal, should be submitted at the first term of the entry of the case so that this court may determine whether the motion shall be passed upon in advance of the hearing on the merits to be postponed until such hearing. Compare United States v. Adams, 9 Wall. 554, 559. Where, as in this case, the motion is based largely upon matter not appearing in the record on appeal, the reasons for insisting upon promptness in making an application to remand are particularly persuasive. Diligence in this respect is essential to the orderly and expeditious administration of justice. Compare rule 14 of this court governing petitions for certiorari for diminution of the record.

Goulder, of Cleveland, Ohio, for Great Lakes Carriers' Ass'n, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the Sanitary District of Chicago, a corporation of Illinois, from diverting water from Lake Michigan in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute; the withdrawal of that amount having been authorized by the Secretary of War. It is alleged that the withdrawal of more, viz., from 400,000 to 600,000 cubic feet per minute, has lowered and will lower the level of the water of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Sault Ste Marie, St. Mary's River, St. Clair River, Detroit River, Niagara River, St. Lawrence River, and all the harbors, etc., connected therewith, all of which are alleged to be navigable waters of the United States, and will thus create an obstruction to the navigable capacity of said waters; and that it will alter and modify the condition and capacity of the above named and their ports, etc., connected with them. The prohibition of such alterations and obstructions in the Act of March 3, \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 424]\n\u00a0\n 1899, c. 425,  10, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151 (Comp. St.  9910), is set out at length and relied upon but the frame of the bill does not exclude a reliance upon more general principles if they were needed in order to maintain it.\n The withdrawal practised and threatened is through an artificial channel that takes the place of the Chicago River, formerly a little stream flowing into Lake Michigan, and of a part of its branches. The channel instead of adding water to the Lake has been given an opposite incline, takes its water from the Lake, flows into the Desplaines River, which empties into the Illinois River, which in its turn empties into the Mississippi. The channel is at least twenty-five feet deep and at least one hundred and sixty-two feet wide; and while its interest to the defendant is primarily as a means to dispose of the sewage of Chicago, Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S. Ct. 268, it has been an object of attention to the United States as opening water communication between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi and the Gulf.\n The answer shows that the defendant is proceeding under a state act of May 29, 1889 (Laws 1889, p. 125), by which it was provided that a channel should be made of size sufficient to take care of the sewage and drainage of Chicago as the increase of population might require, with a capacity to maintain an ultimate flow of not less than 600,000 cubic feet of water per minute, and a continuous flow of not less than 20,000 cubic feet for each 100,000 of the population within the sanitary district. It denies that the defendant has abstracted from 400,000 to 600,000 feet per minute, but as it alleges the great evils that would ensue if the flow were limited to the amount fixed by the Secretary of War or to any amount materially less than that required by the state act of May 29, 1889, and as it admits present conditions to be good, the denial cannot be taken very seriously. The act sufficiently indicates what the State threatens and intends to do unless \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 425]\n\u00a0\n stopped. The answer also denies that the abstraction of water substantially in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute will lower the levels of the Lakes and Rivers concerned or create an obstruction to the navigable capacity of those waters. It goes into the details of the construction of the channel; the expenses incurred; and the importance of it to the health of the inhabitants of Chicago, both for the removal of their sewage and avoiding the infection of their source of drinking water in Lake Michigan which had been a serious evil before. It shows the value of the channel for the great scheme of navigation that we have mentioned; recites acts of Congress and of officers of the United States alleged to authorize what has been done, and to estop the United States from its present course, and finally the bull by the horns and denies the right of the United States to determine the amount of water that should flow through the channel or the manner of the flow.\n This brief summary of the pleadings is enough to show the gravity and importance of the case. It concerns the expenditure of great sums and the welfare of millions of men. But cost and importance, while they add to the solemnity of our duty, do not increase the difficulty of decision except as they induce argument upon matters that with less mighty interests no one would venture to dispute. The law is clear, and when it is known the material facts are few.\n This is not a controversy between equals. The United States is asserting its sovereigh power to regulate commerce and to control the navigable waters within its jurisdiction. It has a standing in this suit not only to remove obstruction to interstate and foreign commerce, the main ground, which we will deal with last, but also to carry out treaty obligations to a foreign power bordering upon some of the Lakes concerned, and, it may be, also on the footing of an ultimate sovereign interest in the Lakes. \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 426]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General by virtue of his office may bring this proceeding and no statute is necessary to authorize the suit. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., \n125 \nU.S. 273\n, 8 S. Ct. 850. With regard to the second ground, the Treaty of January 11, 1909, with Great Britain, expressly provides against uses 'affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters' without the authority of the United States or the Dominion of Canada within their respective jurisdictions and the approval of the International Joint Commission agreed upon therein. As to its ultimate interest in the Lakes the reasons seem to be stronger than those that have established a similar standing for a state, as the interests of the nation are more important than those of any state. In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 584\n, 585 S., 599, 15 S. Ct. 900; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230\n, 27 S. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488; Hudson County Water Co. v.

Ct. 168.\n The main ground is the authority of the United States to remove obstructions to interstate and foreign commerce. There is no question that this power is superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants. In matters where the States may act the action of Congress overrides what they have done. Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177\n, 30 S. Ct. 356; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 53\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. But in matters where the national importance is imminent and direct even where Congress has been silent the States may not act at all. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District, \n233 \nU.S. 75, 79\n, 34 S. Ct. 564. Evidence is sufficient, if evidence is necessary, to show that a withdrawal of water on the scale directed by the statute of Illinois threatens and will affect the level of the Lakes, and that is a matter which cannot be done without the consent of the United States, even were there no international covenant in the case. \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 427]\n\u00a0\n But the defendant says that the United States has given its assent to all that has been done and that it is estopped to take the position that it now takes. A state cannot estop itself by grant or contract from the exercise of the police power. Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Miller, \n221 \nU.S. 408, 414\n, 31 S. Ct. 534; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v.

It would seem a strong thing to say that the United States is subject to narrower restrictions in matters of national and international concern. At least it is true that no such result would be reached if a strict construction of the Government's act would avoid it. This statement was made and illustrated in a case where it was held that an order of the Secretary of War under the Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425, the same act in question here, directing an alteration in a bridge must be obeyed, and obeyed without compensation, although the bridge had been built in strict accord with an Act of Congress declaring that if so built it should be a lawful structure. Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 409, 417\n, 37 S. Ct. 158; Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison, \n237 \nU.S. 251\n, 35 S. Ct. 551. It only remains to consider what the United States has done. And it will be as well to bear in mind when considering it that this suit is not for the purpose of doing away with the channel, which the United States, we have no doubt, would be most unwilling to see closed, but solely for the purpose of limiting the amount of water to be taken through it from Lake Michigan.\n The defendant in the first place refers to two acts of Congress: One of March 30, 1822, 3 Stat. 659, which became ineffectual because its conditions were not complied with, and another of March 2, 1827, c. 51, 4 Stat. 234, referred to, whether hastily or not, in Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 526\n, 26 S. Ct. 268, as an act in pursuance of which Illinois brought Chicago into the Mississippi watershed. The \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 428]\n\u00a0\n act granted land to Illinois in aid of a canal to be opened by the State for the purpose of uniting the waters of the Illinois River with those of Lake Michigan, but if it has any bearing on the present case it certainly vested no irrevocable discretion in the State with regard to the amount of water to be withdrawn from the Lake. It said nothing on that subject. We repeat that we assume that the United States desires to see the canal maintained and therefore pass by as immaterial all evidence of its having fostered the work. Even if it had approved the very size and shape of the channel by act of Congress it would not have compromised its right to control the amount of water to be drawn from Lake Michigan. It seems that a less amount than now passes through the cannal would suffice for the connection which the United States has wished to establish and maintain.\n In an appropriation Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425,  10, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151, Congress provided:\n'That the creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States is hereby prohibited; ... and it shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake, harbor of refuge, or inclosure within the limits of any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States, unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War prior to beginning the same.'\n\n By section 12 (Comp. St.  9917) violation of the law is made a misdemeanor and punished, and the removal of prohibited structures may be enforced by injunction of the proper Court of the United States in a suit under the direction of the Attorney General. This statute repeatedly has been held to be constitutional in respect of the power given to the Secretary of War. Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S. \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 429]\n\u00a0\n 409, 424, 37 S. Ct. 158. It is a broad expression of policy in unmistakable terms, advancing upon an earlier Act of September 19, 1890, c. 907,  10, 26 Stat. 426, 454 (Comp. St.  9910a), which forbade obstruction to navigable capacity 'not affirmatively authorized by law,' and which had been held satisfied with regard to a boom across a river by authority from a state. United States v. Bellingham Bay Boom Co., \n176 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S. Ct. 343. There is neither reason nor opportunity for a construction that would not cover the present case. As now applied it concerns a change in the condition of the Lakes and the Chicago River, admitted to be navigable, and, if that be necessary, an obstruction to their navigable capacity, United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690\n, 19 S. Ct. 770, without regard to remote questions of policy. It is applied prospectively to the water henceforth to be withdrawn. This withdrawal is prohibited by Congress, except so far as it may be authorized by the Secretary of War.\n After this statute was passed the Secretary of War granted various permits, which are relied on by the appellant although in their nature they all were revocable licenses. On May 8, 1899, the Secretary, on application of the appellant, granted permission to open the channel, assumed in the recitals to have a flowage capacity of 300,000 cubic feet per minute with a velocity of one and one-quarter miles an hour, on the conditions that the permit should be subject to the action of Congress ( which was superfluous except as a warning); that if at any time the current created proved to be unreasonably obstructive to navigation or injurious to property he reserved the right to close or modify the discharge; and that the Sanitary District must assume all responsibility for damages to property and navigation interests by reason of the introduction of a current in Chicago River. On July 11, 1900, improvements of the Chicago River were permitted with the statement that the permission did not affect the \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 430]\n\u00a0\n right of the Secretary to revoke the permit of May 8, 1899. On April 9, 1901, the Secretary, Mr. Root, directed the Sanitary District to cut down the discharge to 200,000 cubic feet per minute. On July 23, 1901, at the appellant's request, he amended the order to permit a flow of 300,000 feet between 4 p. m. and 12, midnight, subject to revocation. On December 5, 1901, again on the application of the appellant, leave was given to discharge not exceeding 250,000 feet per minute during the whole twenty- four hours, but subject to such modification as the Secretary might think that the public interests required. On January 17, 1903, the allowance was increased to 350,000 feet until March 31, 1903, after which date it was to be reduced again to 250,000 feet, all subject to modification as before. On September 11, 1907, and on June 30, 1910, permissions were granted to make another connection with Lake Michigan and to open a channel through Calumet River (this last refused by Mr. Secretary Taft on March 14, 1907) on the understanding that the total quantity of water withdrawn from the Lake should not exceed that already authorized by the Secretary of War. Finally on February 5, 1912, the appellant, setting forth that the population of the Sanitary District exceeded 2,500,000 and was increasing rapidly, and that the only method then available for disposing of the sewage of this population was by diluting it with water flowing from Lake Michigan through the canal, asked permission to withdraw not exceeding 10, 000 cubic feet per second, subject to such restrictions and supervision as might seem proper to the Secretary and to revocation by him. On January 8, 1913, Mr. Secretary Stimson carefully reviewed the situation, including the obvious fact that so large a withdrawal would lower the levels of the Lakes and the overwhelming evidence that it would affect navigation, and held that he was not warranted in excepting the appellant from the prohibition of \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 431]\n\u00a0\n Congress on the ground of even pressing sanitary needs. It appears to us that the attempt to found a defence upon the foregoing licenses is too futile to need reply.\n States bordering on the Mississippi allowed to file briefs as amici curiae suggest that they were not heard and that rights have not been represented before the Secretary of War. The City of Chicago makes a similar complaint and argues that it is threatened with the loss of a hundred million dollars. The interest that the River States have in increasing the artificial flow from Lake Michigan is not a right, but merely a consideration that they may address to Congress, if they see fit, to induce a modification of the law that now forbids that increase unless approved as prescribed. The investment of property in the canla and the accompanying works took the risk that Congress might render it valueless by the exercise of paramount powers. It took the risk without even taking the precaution of making it as sure as possible what Congress might do. But we repeat that the Secretary by his action took no rights of any kind. He simply refused an application of the Sanitary Board to remove a prohibition that Congress imposed. It is doubtful at least whether the Secretary was authorized to consider the remote interests of the Mississippi States or the sanitary needs of Chicago. All interests seem in fact to have been copiously represented but he certainly was not bound to give them a hearing upon the application upon which he was requested to pass.\n After the refusal, in January, 1913, to allow an increase of flow, the appellant was notified by direction of the War Department that it was drawing more water than was allowed and was violating  10 of the Act of March 3, 1899. In reply it intimated that it was bound by the state law to which we have referred and in obedience to it had been flowing 20,000 cubic feet per minute for each \n\n[266 U.S. 405, 432]\n\u00a0\n 100,000 of population and could not reduce that flow. It suggested that its rights should be determined by a suit, and accordingly this bill was filed on October 6, 1913. An earlier suit had been brought on March 23, 1908, to prevent the construction of a second channel from Lake Michigan through the Calumet River to the appellant's main channel, leave to do which had been refused as we have seen by Mr. Secretary Taft. (The permit subsequently granted on June 30, 1910, was with the understanding that it should not affect or be used in the 'friendly suit' then pending to determine rights.) The earlier suit was consolidated with the later present one, and it was agreed that the evidence taken in that should be used in this, so far as applicable. There was some delay in concluding the case, which the defendant naturally would desire, but after it was submitted to the Judge according to his own statement he kept it about six years before delivering an oral opinion in favor of the Government on June 19, 1920. No valid excuse was offered for the delay. There was a motion for reconsideration, but the Judge took no further action of any kind until he resigned in 1922. On June 18, 1923, another Judge entered a decree for an injunction as prayed, with a stay of six months to enable the defendant to present the record to this Court.\n The parties have come to this Court for the law, and we have no doubt that as the law stands the injunction prayed for must be granted. As we have indicated a large part of the evidence is irrelevant and immaterial to the issues that we have to decide. Probably the dangers to which the City of Chicago will be subjected if the decree is carried out are exaggerated, but in any event we are not at liberty to consider them here as against the edict of a paramount power. The decree for an injunction as prayed is affirmed, to go into effect in sixty days-without prejudice to any permit that may be issued by the Secretary of War according to law. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANTA FE PAC R. CO. v. WORK(1925)\nNo. 302\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis W. Clements and Alex Britton, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bill in this case was filed by the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, incorporated under an act of Congress, against the Secretary of the Interior, to enjoin him from canceling a certain selection of lieu lands, and to command him to recall the order for such cancellation, and to refrain from any further action except to issue a patent therefor in accordance with the rights of the plaintiff. \n\n[267 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n By Act of Congress of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 292, Congress made a grant of lands in New Mexico and Arizona to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company in aid of the construction of a railroad of that name. The company defaulted on its bonds, the mortgage was foreclosed, and a sale effected to the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, the complainant, which became possessed of all the rights granted by the Act of July 27, 1866, to the mortgagor company. The grant of 1866 covered every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, to the amount of 20 alternate sections per mile, on each side of the railroad line, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, at the time that the line of the road was designated by the filing of a plat in the General Land Office. The granting act provided further that the word 'mineral,' when it occurred in the act, should not be held to include iron or coal.\n The Act of June 22, 1874, c. 400, 18 Stat. 194 (Comp. St.  4889), provided:\n'That in the adjustment of all railroad land grants, whether made directly to any railroad company or to any state for railroad purposes, if any of the lands granted be found in the possession of an actual settler whose entry or filing has been allowed under the pre-emption or homestead laws of the United States subsequent to the time at which, by the decision of the land office, the right of said road was declared to have attached to such lands, the grantees, upon a proper relinquishment of the lands so entered or filed for, shall be entitled to select an equal quantity of other lands in lieu thereof from any of the public lands not mineral and within the limits of the grant not otherwise appropriated at the date of selection, to which they shall receive title the same as though originally granted. And any such entries or filings thus relieved from conflict may be perfected into complete title as if such lands had not been granted: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall in any manner be so \n\n[267 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n construed as to enlarge or extend any grant to any such railroad or to extend to lands reserved in any land grant made for railroad purposes.'\n\n Pursuant to this legislation, the railroad company, on December 1, 1921, filed in the proper local land office an application to select the subject of the controversy here, being a 40-acre tract, the quarter of a quarter section within the primary or place limits of the grant in Arizona, in lieu of a tract of the same area in the same limits which it had relinquished because of a homestead claim coming within the terms of the act of 1874. The filing was accepted by the local land office, but was rejected by the Secretary of the interior, because the land applied for was embraced in a coal withdrawal. The view of the Secretary was that the Act of June 22, 1874, did not authorize the selection of coal land in lieu of the land relinquished. The argument of the railroad company is that, as the granting act of 1866 declared that 'mineral' in that act should not include coal or iron, the same construction should be given to the same word in the Act of June 22, 1874, in so far as selections made by the appellant are concerned.\n The Supreme Court of the District sustained a motion to dismiss the bill for want of equity, and this action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n The question whether this court has jurisdiction of the appeal is raised on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. We think it has under the 6th paragraph of section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227), which permits an appeal from the Court of Appeals of the District in cases 'in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant.' Certainly the Secretary of the Interior, as the defendant herein, by his contention that the act of 1874 does not permit the railroad company to select lieu lands which are coal lands, draws in question the construction of a law of the United States. \n\n[267 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n The act of 1874 was passed to help homestead and other settlers who were in hard case because they had established their settlement after the grant to the railroad company was held to have attached. The question when it did attach was for a long time doubtful and the subject of litigation. This act of 1874 was intended to induce the railroad companies to relinquish such lands thus illegally occupied as against them by promising in lieu thereof other lands of equal area in both odd and even sections within the prescribed limits. The act applied not only to railroad grants in which the term 'lands not mineral' did not exclude iron or coal lands as in this case, but also to similar grants of which there were several in which the phrase 'not mineral' was used in its usual sense and excluded iron and coal; e. g., see Grants to Union Pacific R. R. and Central Pacific, 12 Stat. 489, 492, c. 120,  3; Joint Resolution Jan. 30, 1865, 13 Stat. 567. It would seem to be impossible, therefore, to give a meaning to the phrase 'not mineral' in the act of 1874 which should mean including coal in some cases and excluding coal in others.\n More than this, the settlers who were to be aided by the act of 1874 were those who made homestead or pre-emption filings. Coal lands were not subject to such entry or disposition. As the lands which the railroad companies were invited to relinquish could not be known coal lands, it is not to be inferred that Congress intended that the railroad companies should in compensation acquire coal lands by their lieu selections.\n This construction of the act of 1874 accords with the action of the Department of the Interior since its passage. Not until this case had the precise question been mooted, so as to invoke a formal decision of the Secretary; but the record discloses that it has been the uniform practice of the General Land Office, in its printed forms furnished under the act, to confine such lieu selections to lands not \n\n[267 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n known to contain coal, iron, or other minerals, and that railroad companies generally have acquiesced therein by furnishing proofs of the non-coal and iron character of the land selected.\n It has also been insisted on behalf of the Secretary that the discretion vested in him by Congress in supervising the selection of lieu lands and in executing the laws of 1866 and 1874 is quasi judicial, and that it may not be controlled through mandamus or injunction by the courts, unless his conclusion can be said to be capricious or arbitrary, or so unreasonable as not to be debatable. To sustain this claim, the cases of Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 \nU.S. 316, 324\n, 23 S. Ct. 698, Ness v. Fisher, \n223 \nU.S. 683, 692\n, 32 S. Ct. 356, Alaska Smokeless Coal Co. v. Lane, \n250 \nU.S. 549, 555\n, 40 S. Ct. 33, and Hall v. Payne, \n254 \nU.S. 343\n, 41 S. Ct. 131, and a number of earlier cases are cited. See Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 19 S. Ct. 485. It may be that the authority of these cases would require us to yield to the contention made on behalf of the Secretary in this regard. We are not, however, required to decide this point. The case against the construction of the act of 1874 urged by the railroad company is so clear that we prefer to put our decision directly on the merits of that issue.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECOND RUSSIAN INS. CO. v. MILLER(1925)\nNo. 362\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 552, 553]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Albert Massey, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Hartwell Cabell, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from a judgment of the United States Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit affirming a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing a bill in equity brought by the appellant, complainant below, under section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act (Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 419 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 e]), to recover money seized and held by the Alien Property Custodian. 297 F. 404.\n The appellant, a Russian corporation, in 1913 established an office in the state of New York for the conduct of an American reinsurance business in that state. In order to comply with the law of the state and to qualify it to do business there, appellant deposited with the New York Life Insurance & Trust Company, as trustee under a trust \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n deed, money and securities subject to the provisions of the New York Insurance Law and appointed Meinel & Wemple, Inc., a New York corporation ( referred to as Meinel in this opinion), its statutory agent and attorney in fact in New York. In January, 1919, the Alien Property Custodian served upon the New York Life Insurance & Trust Company and Meinel a demand that they pay over to him money in a specified amount held by them for the account and benefit of H. Mutzenbecher, Jr., a copartnership of Hamburg, Germany, alien enemies not holding a license granted by the President under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The money was paid to the Alien Property Custodian pursuant to the demand and now constitutes the subject- matter of this suit. The Mutzenbecher firm filed an answer making claim to the money seized as commissions earned by them under an agency contract with appellant and praying that it be decreed to be their property and be retained by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act.\n The firm of Mutzenbecher was engaged in business as managers of a reinsurance 'pool' in Hamburg, Germany, and as such managers represented a number of fire insurance companies, including the appellant, as members of the pool which was formed for the purpose of sharing and redistributing reinsurance business contributed to the pool by its various members. They were in complete control of the pool and received as compensation for their services a fixed commission based on the annual net premium upon reinsurance or retrocession contracts (that is, contracts reinsuring reinsurers) plus a stipulated percentage of the annual net profit of the total business conducted by the pool.\n For a considerable period before the outbreak of the World War, Meinel acted as subagent for the Mutzenbechers in the negotiation of the reinsurance business of \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n the appellant and of several other insurance companies for whom they acted in effecting the distribution and allotment of reinsurance risks. In the ordinary course of business, Meinel, acting for the appellant, entered into treaties with companies writing direct insurance in the United States, whereby appellant undertook the reinsurance of risks insured by those companies. Premiums for this reinsurance were collected by Meinel from the companies which had thus ceded insurance to appellant, and after depositing the required reserve for unearned premiums with the trustee of appellant, pursuant to the New York statute, the balance, together with documents giving particulars of all reinsurance to be effected by the Mutzenbechers for account of appellant, was transmitted to them in Hamburg. From the premiums thus received, the Mutzenbechers paid the expenses of their business, including their own commissions amounting to 3 1\/2 per cent., and remitted to Meinel in New York out of their own commission certain expenses and 3\/4 of 1 per cent. of the premiums thus transmitted, as commissions to Meinel for doing the business in New York. This continued to be the method of doing business after the outbreak of the World War until January 1, 1915, when the remittances from Meinel to the Mutzenbecher firm ceased because of war conditions. During the calendar year 1916, until November, Meinel paid to the Mutzenbechers from premiums received 2 1\/2 per cent. commission payable to them and retained its own commissions and expenses.\n In October, 1916, the Russian government promulgated a ukase by the terms of which all Russian subjects were forbidden to enter into any agreement or commercial relations whatever with citizens of enemy countries, and which proclaimed that all existing relations, by virtue of contracts, with enemy firms must be considered as at an end from the date of promulgation. Violation of the decree was punishable by imprisonment and fine. The appellant, \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n which up to that time had continued its ordinary business relations with the Mutzenbechers, then found it necessary to terminate its relations with them, which it did, in form at least, by the appointment of Meinel, as its general agent, to effect reinsurance and to carry on the business which had previously been carried on by the Mutzenbechers at Hamburg. By the terms of this appointment Meinel was appointed general agent for the appellant, authorized to effect reinsurance for appellant's account, and to retain for itself, as compensation for handling the business, commissions at the rate of 3 1\/2 per cent. of the net premiums received.\n The principal question of fact presented for consideration by the courts below was whether this transfer of the general reinsurance agency from the Mutzenbechers to Meinel was made in good faith, or whether it was formal only, and a mere cover under which the business was intended to be conducted by the Mutzenbechers as it had been previously conducted. On that question of fact, both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Alien Property Custodian and against the appellant. That finding we adopt. The evidence was sufficient to support it and will not be discussed here, except in so far as it may be necessary to indicate what the legal relationship of Meinel to the Mutzenbechers was, so that the question of law presented here may be adequately dealt with.\n No further remittances were made by Meinel to the Mutzenbechers after November 22, 1916, but it deducted from all net premiums received 3 1\/2 per cent. commission as stipulated by its agency appointment. Of the commission thus deducted it retained for itself a commission of 3\/4 of 1 per cent. plus its expenses and the balance was deposited in a special bank account in its name and carried on its books as a 'suspense reserve account.' The account remained undisturbed until July 26, 1918, when, the Alien \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n Property Custodian having begun an investigation of the books and records of Meinel, the fund which is the subject of this suit was then turned over by it to the New York Life Insurance & Trust Company, the trustee for appellant, and was by it later paid over to the Alien Property Custodian.\n The inference drawn by the courts below from these facts, and from voluminous testimony which need not be here reviewed, was that the transfer of the agency from the Mutzenbechers to Meinel was merely colorable; that the commissions segregated in the suspense reserve account which were commissions from old business, that is, premiums earned under reinsurance treaties effected before the transfer of the agency, notwithstanding the formal terms of the written appointment of Meinel, were commissioners to which Mutzenbecher was entitled under the contract or arrangement existing between Mutzenbecher, Meinel, and appellant before the transfer of the agency, and that Meinel had in fact received and set them apart as the property of the Mutzenbechers. These findings, so far as they relate to what the parties did in these somewhat complicated transactions, and the purpose and intent with which they acted, deal, with questions of fact, and as they are supported by the evidence, they are controlling here.\n The proposition of law which is presented, and on the basis of which we are asked to reverse the judgment below, rests upon the asserted illegality of appellant's own conduct. It is argued that the effect of the Russian ukase of October 29, 1916, was to make unlawful the agency of the Mutzenbecher firm for appellant and all further relations between them; that the Mutzenbechers were accordingly not entitled to earn or receive further commissions even from 'old business'; that the fund segregated in the suspense reserve account by Meinel was therefore at all times property of appellant and not subject to seizure by the Alien Property Custodian, since the illegal conduct of appellant \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n had prevented the acquisition of any rights in the fund or against the appellant by the German firm.\n To sustain this proposition it is necessary for the appellant to maintain: (1) That it has retained some form of legal interest in the 3 1\/2 per cent. commission deducted by Meinel under the terms of its agency appointment of November, 1916; and (2) that the Russian ukase should be given an extraterritorial effect such as to render the acts of the appellant within the United States, which were otherwise lawful and proper according to the laws of the United States, unlawful and void, and thus prevent the Mutzenbecher firm from acquiring any interest in the segregated fund.\n We think appellant does not succeed in establishing either proposition. Although Meinel was the statutory agent of appellant in the state of New York and transacted there certain business for the appellant, it was also, and had been for many years before the outbreak of the war, the subagent of the Mutzenbechers in handling the business which was transmitted to the German firm to be distributed in the reinsurance pool. The commissions for this service were paid to Meinel by the Mutzenbechers. After the outbreak of the war, it became their agent to receive and remit to them commissions for carrying on the reinsurance business for appellant. When the colorable transfer of the Mutzenbechers' agency was made to Meinel, it was accepted by Meinel only after it was authorized to do so by the Mutzenbechers. Appellant having formally authorized Meinel to deduct and retain 3 1\/2 per cent. commission for conducting the business, and Meinel having actually deducted and retained it, and the court having found that that portion of the commissions placed in the suspense account was placed there by Meinel for the benefit of the Mutzenbechers, with the knowledge and consent of the appellant, and they having formally claimed the segregated fund, we are unable to see that the appellant \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n is in any different situation with respect to this fund than it would have been if it had paid over the commissions directly to the Mutzenbechers or to their authorized agent.\n At the time the agency was transferred to Meinel, the United States was at peace with Germany. The action of Meinel, an American corporation controlled by American stockholders, in taking over the German agency, did not violate any law or policy of the United States. It was not unlawful for it to stipulate that it should receive commissions for doing the business or to agree to receive them for the Mutzenbechers, and having received them, it was not unlawful for it to hold the commissions as the agent of the German firm for its account and benefit. Whatever view we take of the arrangement entered into by the appellant with Meinel, appellant can claim under it no ownership in the deducted commissions. By appellant's formal agreement with Meinel, it relinquished all claims to the commissions. By the secret understanding between appellant, Meinel, and the Mutzenbechers, the segregated fund was received and held for account of the Mutzenbechers. Until the declaration of war by the United States against Germany, the Mutzenbechers in this state of facts could have maintained a suit against Meinel for an accounting and payment over of the segregated fund. Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 \nU.S. 113\n, 16 S. Ct. 139; Taylor v. Benham, 5 How. 233, 274; National Bank v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n; Coler v. Board of Commissioners (C. C.) 89 F. 257, 260; Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 206 F. 663, 665, 124 C. C. A. 463; In re Interborough Corporation (C. C. A.) 288 F. 334, 347, 32 A. L. R. 932.\n In view of the legal relationship existing between Meinel and the Mutzenbechers and the legal consequences which flow from it, we find it unnecessary to speculate as to the precise meaning and effect of the Russian ukase. The Circuit Court of Appeals below rejected the contention \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n that it should be given extraterritorial effect so as to make illegal the transactions had in New York between appellant and Meinel with respect to their dealings with the German firm. Certainly such an application of foreign law to acts done within the territorial jurisdiction of the forum carries the principle of the adoption of foreign law by comity much beyond its limits as at present defined, the more so as the contract between a Russian and a German which we are asked to hold illegal on the basis of Russian law is shown by the expert testimony in the case to be valid according to the German law. The contention runs counter to the reasoning of such cases, as Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 598; Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 \nU.S. 113\n, 16 S. Ct. 139; Hervey v. R. I. Locomotive Works, \n93 U.S. 664\n; Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 241; Polydore v. Plince, 19 Fed. Cas. No. 11,257; Dyke v. Erie R. R. 45 N. Y. 113, 6 Am. Rep. 43. Nor does Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhardt, \n109 \nU.S. 527\n, 3 S. Ct. 363, relied upon by appellant, support the contention. That case only laid down the doctrine recently affirmed by this court (Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, No. 308, \n267 \nU.S. 544\n, 45 S. Ct. 389, decided April 13, 1925) that the legal relations of the members of a corporation to the corporation and to each other must be regulated and controlled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the corporation is organized, and it extended the doctrine so as to make it applicable to mortgage security holders having a common interest in the corporate property. The Russian ukase, however, did not purport to regulate the internal relations of the corporation to its members or lienholders. By its terms it is applicable indiscriminately to individuals and all classes of associations and corporations, and apparently undertakes to deal with contracts of every kind. It cannot be brought within the purview of the rule established in Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Gebhardt and Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, supra.\n If, however, it be assumed that its true meaning and purpose was to control extraterritorially, Russian subjects, \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 561]\n\u00a0\n and that it not only imposed penalties on Russian nationals for its violation, but rendered unlawful and void all contracts and commercial intercourse within our own territory, between Russian nationals and Russian enemies, we still do not find in that assumption any basis for the reversal of the judgment below. Had the obligation of appellant to pay the commissions in question remained executory, the assumption that our courts should give an extraterritorial effect to the Russian ukase, and disregard the German law affecting the rights of the Mutzenbechers upon their contract with appellant to be performed in German territory, might have been of some avail to it. But as we have seen, the findings of the court below establish that payment of the commissions was made as effectually as if the payment had been by cash in hand. When Meinel set apart the fund for the Mutzenbechers, nothing further remained to be done by appellant with respect to the payment. It had relinquished all claim to the fund and Meinel held it for the Mutzenbechers. When the United States declared war, the fund was one held by an American national for the benefit of an alien enemy, and on passage of the Trading with the Enemy Act (October 6, 1917), it became its duty to report the fund to the Alien Property Custodian ( Trading with the Enemy Act,  7 [a], 40 Stat. [Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/2 d]) and to surrender it to the Custodian on demand (section 7[c], 40 Stat. 418).\n To hold that money thus situated was not subject to the seizure and retention, under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, would be going very far; but quite apart from the operation of that act, we find no basis for the contention that the principle of comity would require us to recognize any right in appellant to recover back the money thus paid because the payment of it was forbidden by the Russian ukase. No foundation \n\n[268 U.S. 552, 562]\n\u00a0\n for it in the Russian law is suggested. By our own law payments made under contracts which are illegal where the parties are in pari delicto may not ordinarily be recovered. The law leaves the parties where it finds them and gives no relief. Thomas v. City of Richmond, 12 Wall. 349; Higgins v. McCrea, \n116 \nU.S. 671, 684\n, 6 S. Ct. 557; White v. Barber, \n123 \nU.S. 392, 423\n, 8 S. Ct. 221; Dent v. Ferguson, \n132 \nU.S. 50\n, 10 S. Ct. 13; St. Louis R. R. v. Terre Haute R. R. Co., \n145 \nU.S. 393, 407\n, 12 S. Ct. 953; Harriman v.

While there are exceptions to this rule, appellant's case does not fall within any recognized exception and the record suggests no special considerations of equity or of our own public policy which would justify an exception in this case.\n We therefore reach the conclusion that the appellant was not entitled to recover the fund as against the Mutzenbechers. Such being the rights of the parties, while the fund remained in the hands of Meinel, their rights could not be altered to the prejudice either of the Mutzenbechers or that of the government by payment over of the fund by Meinel to the trustee for appellant. The trustee was not a purchaser and could not take the fund free of the legal or equitable rights of the Mutzenbechers (National Bank v. Insurance Co., supra), although it might and did discharge itself under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act by payment of the money over to the Alien Property Custodian (Trading with the Enemy Act,  7[e], 40 Stat. 418).\n The appellant establishes no right in the fund which is the subject of litigation; we find no error in the record.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSELZMAN v.

The first charged him, Martin Bracker, Harry Porter, and others with a violation of section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201) in conspiring to violate \n\n[268 U.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n section 15, title 3, of the National Prohibition Act (enacted October 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305 [Comp. St. Ann.

United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S. Ct. 480.\n Selzman was also convicted under four counts of the second indictment of violating section 4 of title 2 of the act (section 10138 1\/2 b) forbidding the sale of denatured alcohol for beverage purposes or under circumstances from which the seller may reasonably infer the intention of the purchaser to use it for such purpose.\n This is a writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), on the ground that the provisions of the Prohibition Act in respect to denatured alcohol under which these indictments were found exceed the power of Congress. Whether this is a sound contention is the only question for our decision.\n It is said that the Eighteenth Amendment prohibits the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes only, and that as denatured alcohol is not usable as a beverage, the amendment does not give to Congress authority to prevent or regulate its sale, and that such authority remains with the states and is within their police power exclusively.\n Reference is had to the part of section 1 of title 2 of the Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 307 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2]), as follows:\n'Sec. 1. When used in title 2 and title 3 of this act (1) the word 'liquor' or the phrase 'intoxicating liquor' shall be construed to include alcohol, brandy, \n\n[268 U.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n whisky, rum, gin, beer, ale, porter, and wine, and in addition thereto any spirituous, vinous, malt, or fermented liquor, liquids, and compounds, whether medicated, proprietary, patented, or not, and by whatever name called, containing one-half of 1 per centum or more of alcohol by volume which are fit for use for beverage purposes.'\n\n This, it is said, is a proper construction and limitation of what the Eighteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit and excludes denatured alcohol, although intoxicating, because not fit for beverage purposes. The argument is without force.\n In order that the uses of alcohol might not be lost to the arts by reason of the then heavy internal revenue tax, Congress made provisions ( Act of June 7, 1906, c. 3047, 34 Stat. 217, Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2571, 34 Stat. 1250, and Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  IV, N, subsec. 2, 38 Stat. 114, 199 [Comp. St.  6137]) by which alcohol was made tax free if denatured so that it could not be used for a beverage and evade the federal tax on the potable article. Any attempt to recover the alcohol thus denatured for beverage purposes was punished. The plaintiff in error's suggestion is that this was then within the power of Congress because necessary to protect its power of levying an excise tax on liquor under section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution; but that as there is now no tax upon alcohol to protect, denatured alcohol has passed out of the domain of Congressional action. But surely the denaturing of alcohol is now as necessary in maintaining its use in the arts and prohibiting its use as a beverage, as it was formerly needed to permit its use in the arts and to prevent its consumption as a beverage without paying the tax. The power of the federal government, granted by the Eighteenth Amendment, to enforce the prohibition of the manufacture, sale, and tran portation of intoxicating liquor, carries with it power to enact any legislative measures \n\n[268 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n reasonably adapted to promote the purpose. The denaturing in order to render the making and sale of industrial alcohol compatible with the enforcement of prohibition of alcohol for beverage purposes is not always effective. The ignorance of some, the craving and the hardihood of others, and the fraud and cupidity of still others, often tend to defeat its object. It helps the main purpose of the Amendment, therefore, to hedge about the making and disposition of the denatured article every reasonable precaution and penalty to prevent the proper industrial use of it from being perverted to drinking it. The conclusion is fully supported by the decisions of this court in Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 282\n, 40 S. Ct. 141, and National Prohibition Cases, \n253 U.S. 350\n, par. 11, 40 S.

Simpson, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to restrain the enforcement of the North Dakota Grain Grading Act, an initiated measure approved at a state election November 7, 1922. Laws N. D. 1923, p. 549. The plaintiffs own and operate country elevators within the state, at which they buy wheat from farmers for shipment to markets in other states, and the defendants are officers of the state, who are charged by the act with the duty of enforcing it. The plaintiffs challenge the validity of the act under the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  8, cl. 3) on the grounds, first, that it interferes with and burdens interstate commerce; and, secondly, that it conflicts with the United States Grain Standards Act, c. 313, 39 Stat. 482 ( Comp. St.  8747 1\/2-8747 1\/2 k). An injunction preventing its enforcement pending the suit was granted by the District Court, three judges sitting, and that interlocutory decree is here for review under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013 (Comp. St.  1243).\n A prior statute, concededly 'having the same general purpose,' was adopted by the state Legislature in 1919 (Laws 1919, c. 138) and held invalid by this court in Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S. Ct. 244, as an interference with interstate commerce. There are differences between that statute and the present one, of which the parties take divergent views. It would serve no purpose to take up \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n these differences in detail. We shall describe the situation to which the present act is intended to apply, state its material provisions, and then come to its operation on interstate commerce.\n Wheat is the chief product of the farms of North Dakota, the annual crop approximating 150,000,000 bushels. About 10 per cent. is used and consumed locally, and about 90 per cent. is sold within the state to buyers who purchase for shipment, and ship, to terminal markets outside the state. Most of the sales are made at country elevators to which the farmers haul the grain when harvested and threshed. These elevators are maintained and operated by the buyers as facilities for receiving the grain from the farmers' wagons and loading it into railroad cars. The loading usually proceeds as rapidly as grain of any grade is accumulated in carload lots and cars can be obtained. When a car is loaded it is sent promptly to a terminal market and the grain is there sold. This is the usual and recognized course of buying and shipment. Occasionally a farmer has his grain stored in the country elevator, or shipped to a terminal elevator for storage, and awaits a possible increase in price; but even in such instances he usually sells to the buyer operating the country elevator, and the latter then sends the grain to the terminal market, if it has not already gone there.\n The price paid at the country elevators rises and falls with the price at the terminal markets, but is sufficiently below the latter to enable the country buyer to pay for the intermediate transportation and have a margin of profit. All transactions at the terminal markets, including the price, are based on the grade of the wheat, and by reason of this all buying at the country elevators is by grade.\n The grading at the terminal markets is done by inspectors licensed under the United States Grain Stand \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n ards Act, who are required to apply to all interstate shipments the grading standards promulgated under that act by the Secretary of Agriculture. There are no inspectors licensed under that act at the country elevators, and so the grading is done there unofficially by the buyers or their agents as an incident and part of the buying.\n Grading includes an ascertainment of the proportions of clean wheat and of dockage in each lot of grain and an ascertainment of the quality of the wheat. Dockage consists of separable foreign material, such as dirt, pieces of straw, chaff, weed stems, weed seeds and grain other than wheat. Its proportion varies in different lots, but generally is less than five per cent. When not separated it causes the grain to bring a lower price per bushel than clean wheat would bring. When separated it has a value for poultry and stock feed which usually is in excess of the cost of separation. Occasionally the farmer separates it at the farm and sells only the clean wheat, and occasionally the buyer separates it at the country elevator, charges the farmer for that service, and buys and ships only the clean wheat; but generally the grain is sold by the farmer and shipped by the country buyer with the dockage included. The influence of dockage on the value of the grain and the current modes of handling it are shown in publications of the Agricultural Department of the United States, pertinent excerpts from which are set out in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[268 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n As many as 2,200 country elevators are operated within the state in the business here described-generally two or more by competing buyers at each station. Some of the buyers are individuals and others are corporations. A large number are farmers' cooperative companies, which buy grain grown by their stockholders and others in the vicinity of their elevators, ship and sell the same, and distribute as patronage dividends the surplus arising from such transactions-no profit being retained by the companies. $The plaintiffs comprise many buyers, individual and corporate, including 11 farmers' cooperative companies. In the aggregate they own and operate several hundred country elevators, widely distributed over the state, and buy and ship about 30,000,000 bushels of wheat a year. They carry on the business severally, each buying and \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n shipping independently of the others. All buy with the purpose of shipping to and selling in terminal markets outside the state and carry out this purpose in the manner already described.\n The North Dakota act in terms covers all farm products, but as it is chiefly aimed at dealings in wheat, and the parties have discussed it on that basis, our statement of its provisions will be shortened by treating them as if relating only to wheat.\n The title to the act describes it as one whereby the state undertakes ( a) 'to supervise and regulate the marketing' of wheat; (b) to prevent 'unjust discrimination, fraud and extortion in the marketing' of such grain; and (c) to establish 'a system of grading, weighing, and measuring' it. The first section declares the purpose of the state to encourage, promote, and safeguard the production \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 196]\n\u00a0\n of wheat and commerce therein by establishing a uniform system of grades, weights, and measures. The second and third sections provide for a state supervisor of grades, weights, and measures, and give him authority to make and enforce necessary orders, rules, and regulations to carry out the provisions of the act.\n The fourth section provides that the supervisor shall establish a system of grades, weights, and measures for wheat 'and shall in a general way investigate and supervise the marketing of same with a view of preventing unjust discrimination, unreasonable margins of profit, confiscation of valuable dockage, fraud and other unlawful practices'; declares that, whenever grades, weights, and measures for wheat are established by the Secretary of Agriculture under the United States Grain Standards Act, they shall become the grades, weights, and measures of \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 197]\n\u00a0\n the state; and concludes by saying:\n'In establishing such grades, weights and measures, the value of dockage shall be considered, and the buyer shall not be permitted to retain the same without just compensation. He shall pay the fair market value for same or separate it and return it to the producer.'\n\n The fifth section provides that no person shall buy any wheat 'by grade'-excepting where one producer buys from another producer-unless it has been inspected and graded by a licensed inspector under the provisions of the act, or those of the United States Grain Standards Act, and is bought by a grade fixed and recognized thereunder.\n The sixth section provides for the issue, by the supervisor, of licenses to grade to persons engaged in buying, weighing, and grading wheat-including buyers and agents at country elevators-where they pass a satisfactory examination. Each license is to be held on condition that the licensee shall honestly and correctly determine the grades and dockage and shall likewise weigh the grain. The seventh section authorizes the supervisor to suspend or revoke any such license where, after investigation, he finds that the licensee is incompetent, knowingly or carelessly has graded grain improperly, has short-weighed it, has taken valuable dockage without compensation, or has violated any provision of the act or of the United States Grain Standards Act.\n The eighth section requires every buyer operating an elevator to obtain from the supervisor a yearly license, the fee for which is to be adjusted by the supervisor to the capacity of the elevator as not exceeding $1 for each 1,000 bushels. The ninth section requires every elevator operator or individual 'buying or shipping for profit,' who does not pay cash in advance, to file with the supervisor a sufficient bond, running to the state, to secure payment for all wheat bought on credit. The tenth section requires every buyer operating an elevator to \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 198]\n\u00a0\n keep a record of the wheat bought at the elevator and to show therein the price paid and grades given, and 'the price received and the grades received at the terminal markets,' and further requires him to furnish this information to the supervisor when requested. The twelfth section makes it unlawful for any person to grade wheat who does not have a license therefor under the act or under the United States Grain Standards Act. And other sections make every violation of the act a misdemeanor and charge the Attorney General of the state and its other law officers with the duty of prosecuting such violations.\n The act dispenses with grading where the buying is by sample, by type, or by certain designations; but this has no bearing here, for the buying for interstate shipment is all by grade. The act also dispenses with grading by an inspector licensed thereunder, if the grain be graded by an inspector licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act; but this is an idle provision, for there are in North Dakota no inspectors licensed under that act. Such inspectors are found only at terminal markets, and there is no terminal market in North Dakota.\n This statement of the provisions of the act discloses its full purpose and scope; but some of its features, of special importance here, will be noticed again as we proceed.\n Buying for shipment, and shipping, to markets in other states, when conducted as before shown, constitutes interstate commerce; the buying being as much a part of it as the shipping. We so held in Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., supra, following and applying the principle of prior cases. Later cases have given effect to the same principle. Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 516\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 309\n, 44 S. Ct. 96.\n Wheat-both with and without dockage-is a legitimate article of commerce and the subject of dealings that are nation-wide. The right to buy it for shipment, and \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 199]\n\u00a0\n to ship it, in interstate commerce, is not a privilege derived from state laws, and which they may fetter with conditions, but is a common right, the regulation of which is committed to Congress and denied to the states by the commerce clause of the Constitution. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The decisions of this court respecting the validity of state laws challenged under the commerce clause have established many rules covering various situations. Two of these rules are specially invoked here-one that a state statute enacted for admissible state purposes and which affects interstate commerce only incidentally and remotely is not a prohibited state regulation in the sense of that clause;3 and the other that a state statute which by its necessary operation directly interferes with or burdens such commerce is a prohibited regulation and invalid, regardless of the purpose with which it was enacted. \n4\n These rules, although readily understood and entirely consistent, are occasionally difficult of application, as where a state statute closely approaches the line which separates one rule from the other. As might be expected, the decisions dealing with such exceptional situations have not been in full accord. Otherwise the course of adjudication has been consistent and uniform.\n In our opinion the North Dakota act falls certainly within the second of the two rules just stated. By it that \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 200]\n\u00a0\n state attempts to exercise a large measure of control over all wheat buying within her limits. About 90 per cent. of the buying is in interstate commerce. Through this buying and the shipping in connection with which it is conducted the wheat which North Dakota produces in excess of local needs-more than 125,000,000 bushels a year-finds a market and is made available for consumption in other states where the local needs greatly exceed the production. Obviously therefore the control of this buying is of concern to the people of other states as well as to those of North Dakota.\n Only by disregarding the nature of this business and neglecting important features of the act can it be said to affect interstate commerce only incidentally and remotely. That it is designed to reach and cover buying for interstate shipment is not only plain but conceded. To conform to recognized commercial practices such buying must be by grade, and it is so conducted. The act prevents buying by grade, unless the buyer secures from the state a grading license for himself or his agent. The general practice is to buy and ship without separating the dockage from the wheat, the price paid carrying a right to both. The act requires the buyer to separate the dockage and return it to the producer, unless it be distinctly valued and paid for. A failure to comply with this or any other requirement of the act is made cause for revoking the grading license. It is practically essential that the buyers have and operate elevators as facilities for handling and loading the wheat. The act requires every such buyer to give to the state, if he buys on credit, a bond securing payment for all wheat so purchased; to keep a record of all wheat bought, showing the grade given and price paid at his elevator and the grade fixed and price received at the terminal market; and to furnish such data to the state supervisor when requested. The act also intends and declares that the state supervisor \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 201]\n\u00a0\n 'shall in a general way investigate and supervise the marketing' of the grain with a view of 'preventing' various things deemed unjust or fraudulent, including 'unreasonable margins of profit' and 'confiscation of valuable dockage,' and, to the end that this and other provisions may be made effective, the act invests him with authority to make and enforce such orders, rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out all of its provisions.\n We think it plain that, in subjecting the buying for interstate shipment to the conditions and measure of control just shown, the act directly interferes with and burdens interstate commerce, and is an attempt by the state to prescribe rules under which an important part of such commerce shall be conducted. This no state can do consistently with the commerce clause.\n The defendants cite several cases as making for a different conclusion, but we do not so read them. In some the commerce clause was in no way involved, and those in which it was involved give no support to what is attempted in the act now before us. In Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 135 S., the question was whether, as respects an elevator devoted to storing grain for hire, the state could regulate the storage charge where part of the grain reached the elevator, or was destined to leave it, through the channels of interstate commerce. The court held such a regulation admissible because of the public character of the elevator and because interstate commerce was affected only incidentally and remotely. No restriction on buying or shipping was involved. In Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452\n, 21 S. Ct. 423, the court had before it a state statute, much of which had been pronounced unconstitutional by the state court. In sustaining a provision which remained, the court said (page 470 [21 S. Ct. 429]):\n'The statute puts no obstacle in the way of the purchase by the defendant company of grain in the state or the shipment \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 202]\n\u00a0\n out of the state of such grain as it purchased.'\n\n Plainly the case is not in point here. In Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365\n, 39 S. Ct. 114, the statute involved required that public weighers appointed for the purpose should do the weighing and issue weight certificates at elevators used for storing or transferring grain for hire, and prohibited any other person from issuing weight certificates at an elevator where a public weigher was stationed. Objection was made to the prohibition on the ground that as applied to grain received from or shipped to points without the state it burdened interstate commerce. Of course the objection was overruled, the statute being an admissible regulation of the business of conducting an elevator for hire, like the statute considered in Munn v. Illinois.\n The defendants make the contention that we should assume the existence of evils justifying the people of the state in adopting the act. The answer is that there can be no justification for the exercise of a power that is not possessed. If the evils suggested are real, the power of correction does not rest with North Dakota but with Congress, where the Constitution intends that it shall be exercised with impartial regard for the interests of the people of all the states that are affected.\n The defendants further contend that the act is simply an attempt on the part of the state, through inspection regulations, to assist in carrying out the purposes of the United States Grain Standards Act. We think the act discloses an attempt to do much more. To require the dockage be separated by the buyer and be returned to the producer unless it be distinctly valued and paid for is not inspection. Nor does the federal act contain or give support to such a requirement. To exclude one from buying by grade unless he secures a grading license for himself or his agent is apart from what usually is comprehended in inspection. Nothing like this is found in the federal act. \n\n[268 U.S. 189, 203]\n\u00a0\n On the contrary, it declares that persons licensed to grade under it shall not be interested in any grain elevator or in buying or selling grain, or be in the employ of any owner or operator of a grain elevator. Equally unrelated to inspection are the provisions exacting a bond to pay for all wheat bought on credit, requiring that a record be kept of the price paid in buying at the local elevator and the price received in selling at the terminal market, and authorizing the state supervisor to investigate and supervise the marketing with a view to preventing unreasonable margins of profit. None of these finds any example in the federal act, and their presence in the state act makes it a very different measure from what it would be without them. Aside from the adoption of the grades established and promulgated under the federal act, we find little in the state act to support and much to refute the assertion that it is merely an attempt to carry out the purposes of the federal act.\n For the reasons here given we hold that the act is a direct regulation of the buying of grain in interstate commerce, and therefore invalid, and that the District Court rightly granted the injunction.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Extracts from Farmers' Bulletin No. 1118, United States Department of Agriculture, pp. 5, 21:\n'The foreign material in wheat may seriously affect its value in that it often increases the cost of milling, and causes injury to the baking qualities of flour. Therefore that factor is considered in the inspecting and grading of wheat. The amount of dockage present has a bearing upon the commercial value of a lot of wheat. Especially when present in large amounts, it is a factor of considerable importance to the parties intersted in the marketing or storage of grain.' \n\n'All of the following methods of handling dockage are employed in normal times and all are generally found to be satisfactory:\n\n'1. The wheat is cleaned on the farm and only the clean wheat is hauled to market.\n\n'2. The wheat delivered by the farmer is run over the proper cleaning machinery at the country elevator or mill, and the dockage is separated and returned to the farmer.\n\n'3. The wheat is screened by the local buyer, payment is made to the seller on the basis of the grade of the clean wheat only, and the dockage is retained by the elevator or mill as compensation for services in removing it.\n\n'4. The wheat is screened by the local buyer, payment is made to the seller on the basis of the grade of the clean wheat, and the dockage is retained by the elevator or mill, and if the value of the dockage separated exceeds the cost of sepation, payment is made for it.\n\n'5. The wheat containing the dockage is consigned to the large market by the country mill or elevator, where the dockage is separated and its value is taken into consideration in connection with the price paid for the entire carload of dockage-free wheat. In some localities it is the practice to make a small charge for such services, while in other localities the services are performed without cost. \n\n'6. The wheat containing the dockage is sold to a local buyer, who in turn consigns it to the terminal market with the understanding that the price secured will be based upon the commercial value of both the wheat and the dockage.\n\n'The first two methods mentioned, in which only the screened wheat is delivered to the local buyer, tend to minimize the differences of opinion with regard to the grade of wheat delivered and therefore establish greater confidence in the grades given by the local buyer. Furthermore, these methods enable the farmer to utilize the foreign material for feed or to sell it locally.'\n\n Extracts from Farmers' Bulletin No. 1287, United States Department of Agriculture, pp. 5, 21:\n'The benefits derived from clean wheat are shared by the farmer and the country elevator. If the farmer cleans his wheat before delivering it to the elevator he saves the cost of hauling the dockstate, age to market, and he may be able to use it to advantage for feed, and make a saving in his feed bill. In many cases these savings will repay the farmer for the time and trouble required to clean his wheat. The contention as to the amount of dockage in the wheat which frequently arises between the farmer and the elevator operator will be avoided if clean wheat is delivered. The price paid for clean wheat at the elevator is usually more per bushel than the price paid for unclean wheat, because the elevator operator \n\n must consider either the cost of removing the dockage or the freight charges on it to the terminal market.'\n'The farm is the logical place to clean wheat, preferably as part of the thrashing operation, because the necessary power is available and later handling is avoided. Since satisfactory cleaning is not always possible under present conditions at thrashing time, other means of cleaning must be used.\n\n'The fanning mill is the most practical cleaning machine for farm use, and if properly adjusted and operated will clean wheat satisfactorily for commercial purposes with but little loss of wheat in the screenings.'\n\n'The operators of country elevators are beginning to realize more keenly each year that it pays to clean wheat before shipping it to the terminal markets. Many of the country elevators not only clean wheat for themselves but for the farmers as well. The latter is known as 'custom cleaning,' for which country elevators located in the central Northwest ordinarily charge from 2 to 3 cents per bushel, based on the gross weight of the grain before cleaning. A higher charge is made for cleaning the grain for seed purposes. The shrinkage in the weight of the grain is borne by the owner, but the screenings may be returned to him. The returns from custom cleaning add a considerable amount to the income of some country evevators during the year.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 57\n, 11 S.

Scott, both of Fort Worth, Tex., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sherwin and Schwarz were indicted in the federal court for northern Texas, under section 215 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10385), for \n\n[268 U.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n using the mails in consummation of a scheme to defraud; and also, under section 37 (section 10201), for a conspiracy to commit the offense. They filed in bar a plea of immunity under section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 723 (Comp. St.  8836i). Their claim was that the indictment rested upon information which the commission had compelled them to give. There was a replication; issue was joined; a trial was had upon the plea; and under instructions of the court, the jury found against the defendants upon their plea of immunity. They were found guilty upon the various counts of the indictment and sentenced. United States v. Lee, 290 F. 517. The judgment was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, 297 F. 704. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n265 \nU.S. 578\n, 44 S. Ct. 637. Whether the giving of the information under circumstances to be stated created an immunity is the sole question for decision.\n The Federal Trade Commission Act in section 5 (section 8836e) empowers and directs the commission to prevent the use of unfair methods of competition and provides for proceedings to that end. In section 6 ( section 8836f) it provides that the commission shall have power to investigate the practices of corporations engaged in interstate commerce; and may require of them special reports in writing, under oath or otherwise, concerning their practices. In section 9 it provides that the commission or its agents shall 'have access to, for the purpose of examination, amination, and the right to copy and documentary evidence of any corporation being investigated or proceeded against'; and 'to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation. Any member of the commission may sign subpoenas, and members and examiners of the commission may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.' Methods of enforcing obedience to such orders are provided by section 9. Refusal 'to attend \n\n[268 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n and testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce documentary evidence ... in obedience to the subpoena or lawful requirement of the commission' is punishable criminally under section 10 (section 8836j). It is further provided by section 9:\n'No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing documentary evidence before the commission or in obedience to the subpoena of the commission on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to criminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. But no natural person shall prosecution or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the commission in obedience to a subpoena issued by it: Provided, that no natural person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.'\n\n Sherwin and Schwarz were the promoters of alleged gas and oil properties conducted under the names of General Lee Interests Nos. 1 and 2, and General Lee Development Interests. The commission addressed to the concern letters requesting, under sections 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the act, detailed information in writing concerning its organization and business. No reply was made thereto. Later, an agent of the commission, referred to as a special examiner, called in person at the office of the concern and demanded the information. This was at first refused, on the ground that the concern, being a common-law trust, was not subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The agent insisted that the act required Sherwin and Schwarz to give the information and answers sought; pointed out that refusal to comply with the commission's request would subject them to the criminal penalties provided in the act; and, in so doing, omitted to call to \n\n[268 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n their attention the provision granting immunity from subsequent prosecution under certain circumstances. Conferences were then had with their legal adviser. Thereupon, they gave the agent access to books and papers; furnished him copies of some documents; ments; and answered freely the inquiries made by him. It does not appear that the commission, or any member thereof, ever issued any order in the matter. There was no hearing of any kind, unless the informal conversations of the agent with Sherwin and Schwarz could be called such. No subpoena from any source was ever served upon Sherwin or Schwarz or any other person connected with their business. No one made any answer under oath either orally or in writing. There was no claim by Sherwin or Schwarz of immunity, or that the giving of information might tend to incriminate them. The subsequent prosecution which resulted in the indictment was instituted by a post office inspector. It does not appear that the Federal Trade Commission had any part in the prosecution or communicated any of the information gained to any government officials who did have; or that any fact was elicited by the commission which connected Sherwin and Schwarz with the crime of which they were convicted.\n The question is not, as in Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n, 12 S. Ct. 195, Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, 16 S. Ct. 644, and Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, 26 S. Ct. 370, whether the immunity provided by the act is sufficiently broad to deprive the witness of his constitutional privilege against selfincrimination. It may be that, for this and other reasons, Sherwin and Schwarz could not have been compelled to furnish the information which they gave. See Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S. Ct. 336, 32 A. L. R. 786. The question is not, as in Glickstein v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 139\n, 32 S. Ct. 71, and Cameron v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 710\n, 34 S. Ct. 244, whether an admitted immunity extends to the particular attempted use of the testimony. Nor is it necessary to \n\n[268 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n consider the question involved in Heike v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 131\n, 33 S. Ct. 226, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 128, whether the information given was beyond the protection of the immunity provision because not of an incriminating nature and but remotely, if in any way, connected with the transactions forming the basis of the later prosecution. The immediate question here is whether, under this particular immunity provision, the mere furnishing of information of whatever character creates an immunity which bars the prosecution. Compare Tucker v. United States, \n151 \nU.S. 164, 167\n, 169 S., 14 S. Ct. 299.\n The question is said to be one of statutory construction. But, upon the facts stated, it is clear that there was no basis for the plea of immunity. The act grants immunity only when the person testifies or produces evidence 'before the commission in obedience to a subpoena issued by it.' Sherwin and Schwarz did nothing in obedience to a subpoena. None was issued. Whether the judgment below was right for other reasons also, we need not consider. The case is wholly unlike United States v. Pardue (D. C.) 294 F. 543.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMYTH v. ASPHALT BELT R CO(1925)\nNo. 206\nArgued: January 20, 1925Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 326, 327]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Kelley, Frank Andrews, and T. W. Gregory, all of Houston, Tex., for appellants.\n Messrs. Mason Williams and J. D. Wheeler, both of San Antonio, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the federal court for Western Texas which dismissed a bill in equity with costs. There was a full hearing upon pleadings and evidence. The plaintiffs had moved for an interlocutory injunction; the defendants to dismiss the bill. 292 F. 876. The decree recited, as the ground for dismissal, 'that the court is without jurisdiction.' The plaintiff took an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, assigning 15 errors, of which only a few referred in any way to jurisdiction. The appellate court was of opinion that, under the rule declared in United States v. Jahn, \n155 \nU.S. 109\n, 15 S. Ct. 39, it was without jurisdiction, because the jurisdiction of the District Court had been challenged and the decision there was in favor of the defendants. The Circuit Court of Appeals therefore transferred the case to this court, pursuant to Judicial Code,  238a, as added by Act Sept. 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  1215a). See McMillan Contracting Co. v. Abernathy, \n263 \nU.S. 438\n, 44 S. Ct. 200. Whether the transfer should have been made is the preliminary question requiring decision, although not raised by counsel. Smith v. Apple, \n264 \nU.S. 274, 275\n, 44 S. Ct. 311.\n If the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court was the question there in issue, and was the only question, it is clear that, under section 238 (Comp. st.  1215), this court alone had jurisdiction of the appeal (Chappell v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 16 S. Ct. 397; The Carlo Poma, \n255 \nU.S. 219\n, 41 S. Ct. 309 ), and it was proper to transfer the case (Hoffman v. McClelland, \n264 \nU.S. 552\n, 44 S. Ct. 407). But if the question, called one of jurisdiction \n\n[267 U.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n by the lower courts, was not in fact a question of the jurisdiction of the federal court as such, but whether the action complained of violated a federal law (Louie v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 548\n, 41 S. Ct. 188; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, Inc., \n263 U.S. 291\n, 304-308, 44 S. Ct. 96), or whether a power possessed by the court should be exercised (Smith v. Apple, \n264 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S. Ct. 311; Oliver American Trading Co., Inc., v. Mexico, \n264 \nU.S. 440\n, 44 S. Ct. 390), then the appeal was properly taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The proceedings in the District Court, including its opinion and decree, and the briefs filed in this court, show that at no time was the jurisdiction of the trial court as a federal court questioned there, and that its jurisdiction as a federal court was clear. The suit was brought as one 'arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and particularly under' the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended. The sum involved was alleged to exceed $3,000 exclusive of interest and costs. All the defendants were alleged to be citizens and residents of the district. All were duly served. All appeared generally, answered, and introduced evidence. The motion to dismiss assigned the grounds therefor, and lack of jurisdiction of the court as a federal court was not one of them. Lack of merits, lack of equity, and lack of that status which alone would entitle a private individual to sue were the objections urged. Lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter was also asserted in terms, but the pleadings and the opinion of the District Court show that this expression was not intended as a challenge of the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court, but as a denial of fundamental allegations in the bill essential to a cause of action, and to the relief under the federal statute invoked.\n The bill alleged that the plaintiffs owned a tract of land in Texas; that the two corporate defendants, and another defendant, who was the receiver of one of them, were \n\n[267 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n purposing to construct a railroad across the land; that, to this end, they were proceeding under a statute of the state to condemn, in the name of one of these corporations, a right of way over the land; that the proposed railroad is in fact an extension of the line of the other railroad corporation, which is engaged in interstate commerce; that the new line is intended to be used in interstate commerce, and that, irrespective of intention, it will be required by the laws of Texas to be open to such commerce; that it cannot legally be constructed without there first having been obtained from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity, as provided in paragraphs 18 to 20 of section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by Transportation Act 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 478 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923 ,  8563); that the proposed condemnation of plaintiffs' land was undertaken without first having secured such certificate; and that this action violates plaintiff's rights under the federal statute. The District Court said in its opinion:\n'Since the plaintiffs' right to injunction rests upon provisions of an act of Congress regulating interstate commerce, the court would be without jurisdiction unless the facts show: (1) That the Asphalt Belt Railroad Company is owned and controlled by the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf Railroad Company, an interstate carrier, thus constituting it an extension and branch of the latter road; or (2) that the A. B. Company is obliged by law, and its purpose is, to carry on business as an interstate carrier.'\n\n The trial court found, on the evidence and as matter of law, that the railroad which had instituted and brought condemnation proceedings was an independent intrastate carrier, that it was not obliged to conduct an interstate business, and that hence its action in instituting condemnation proceedings, without first obtaining a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission, was \n\n[267 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n not in contravention of the federal law. It is this ground, and this only, on which the District Court declared that the bill should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, meaning obviously that, upon the facts found, it was not warranted in enjoining the condemnation proceedings, and not that as a federal tribunal it was without power to entertain the suit and inquire into the matters alleged in the bill.\n This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the plaintiffs were ordered to pay 'all costs.' If the District Court had lacked jurisdiction as a federal court, it would have been without power to order the plaintiffs to pay costs. Blacklock v. Small, \n127 \nU.S. 96\n, 8 S. Ct. 1096; Citizens' Bank v. Cannon, \n164 \nU.S. 319\n, 17 S.

STODDARD(1925)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Arthur F. Gotthold, of New York City, Thomas M. Fields and Frank J. Hogan, both of Washington, D. C., and Walter W. Gross, of New York City, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[269 U.S. 186, 187]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. C. Fowler, James A. Beha, and Alfred C. Bennett, all of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Unkefer & Co., a Delaware corporation, on October 1, 1915, entered into a contract with the United States to erect a post office and courthouse building in Charlotte, N. C., and furnished a bond in accordance with the Act of February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811 (Comp. St.  6923). There were two sureties upon the bond, the Casualty Company of America of New York, and the Southwestern Insurance Company of Oklahoma; the former being liable under the terms of the bond for $50,000, and the latter for $46,000. Unkefer & Co. made various contracts for supplies and materials, including a contract with the Southern Electric Company for $ 201.23. The supplies were used in the post office building and were delivered before the middle of June, 1917. Unkefer & Co. became insolvent at that time and ceased work. Under the provisions of the bond, the Casualty Company became liable for 52 per cent. of the claim. Suit was brought by the Southern Electric Company against the Casualty Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, and a judgment in the sum of $105.50 was recovered August 4, 1921\n\n\n Meantime, by order of the Supreme Court of the State of New York dated May 4, 1917, the superintendent of insurance of that state took possession of the property of the Casualty Company of America and proceeded to liquidate its business in accordance with the statutes under which it was organized, and as liquidator made a report of the claims against the company to the Supreme Court of New York. A duly authenticated record of the judgment in favor of the Southern Electric Company in the United States court for the Western District of North Carolina was filed as a claim with the liquidator against \n\n[269 U.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n the Casualty Company. He reported that it could not be allowed, because it did not arise until after the date when the property of the Casualty Company had been taken over for liquidation, and must therefore be classed under the New York statute as a contingent claim, not to be paid out of the existing assets, until after the claims which had arisen before liquidation had been paid. An order of reference to consider the objections to the report of the liquidator was made in the Supreme Court, and they were sent to a referee to be heard. He sustained the report of the liquidator. The disallowance was approved by the Supreme Court, and on appeal was taken to the Appellate Division, which affirmed the order of the Special Term. The claimant then moved for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and that motion was denied by the Appellate Division. It is from the order of the Appellate Division, affirming the report of the superintendent of insurance, disallowing the claim, that this writ of error is taken.\n Both before the referee in the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division the claimant maintained that the refusal to allow the claim based on the judgment of the Western District of North Carolina was a denial of full faith and credit, in violation of article 4,  1, of the federal Constitution, that section 63 of the Insurance Law of the state of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 28), by which all the assets of the insurance company were appropriated to pay claims earlier than the North Carolina judgment here sought to be enforced, was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, in requiring a classification so unreasonable as to take claimant's property without due process of law, and that the New York statute impaired the obligation of a contract, in violation of article 1,  10, cl. 1, of the Constitution.\n A motion is made to dismiss this writ of error on the ground that it has not issued to the court of last resort \n\n[269 U.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n of the state of New York, as required by section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, 39 Stat. 726, c. 448 (Comp. St.  1214). By the first paragraph of section 588 of the Civil Practice Act of New York, an appeal to the Court of Appeals may be taken as of right from a judgment or order entered upon the decision of the Appellate Division which finally determines an action or special proceeding where is directly involved the construction of the Constitution of the state or of the United States. In this case there is directly involved the construction of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore it would seem that an appeal could have been taken from the Appellate Division as of right to the Court of Appeals, but this was not done. Instead, application was made to the Appellate Division to certify that a question of law was involved in the case which ought to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, and that certificate the Appellate Division declined. Thereafter no application was made to the Court of Appeals to allow an appeal. Paragraph 4 of section 588 provides that an appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals from a judgment or order entered upon the decision of the Appellate Division which finally determines an action or special proceeding, but which is not appealable as of right under subdivision 1 of the section, where the Appellate Division shall certify that in its opinion a question of law is involved which ought to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, or where in case of the refusal so to certify an appeal is allowed by the Court of Appeals.\n It is said that this order of disallowance could not have been appealed to the Court of Appeals, either under the first or fourth paragraph of section 588, because it is not an order entered upon the decision of the Appellate Division which finally determines an action of special proceeding, and that this was so held in the case of People v. American Trust Co., 150 N. Y. 117, 44 N. E. 949. We find, however, \n\n[269 U.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n that on December 12, 1922, in the matter of a claim of one Badgley, in this same proceeding for the liquidation of the Casualty Company of America, the Court of Appeals (234 N. Y. 503, 138 N. E. 423) entertained an appeal from the Appellate Division of the First Judicial Department, which had reversed an order of the Special Term, allowing the claim of the appellant therein, and dismissed the claim. This was not by permission of the Appellate Division, and must therefore have been found by the Court of Appeals to be within the fourth paragraph of section 588, an order upon a decision of the Appellate Division 'finally determining an action or special proceeding.' This clearly shows that in the view of the Court of Appeals of New York, if the order of disallowance in this case involved a federal constitutional question, as it did on this record, it was directly appealable to that court from the Appellate Division under the first paragraph of section 588. The claimant has failed to make proper application to the state court of final resort, and for that reason the writ must be dismissed.\n Motion granted. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC CO. v. U S(1925)\nNo. 285\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. R. Harr and Charles H. Bates, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Merrill E. Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Southern Pacific Company, having carried certain persons as passengers at the request of the Government and received payment for such transportation at land-grant rates, brought this action to recover the difference between the rates thus paid and the full tariff rates. The Court of Claims, on its findings of fact, being of opinion that the claimant bt its course of proceeding and acceptance of the land-grant rates was precluded from the recovery of the balance of the full tariff rates, entered judgment dismissing the petition. 59 Ct. Cl. 36.\n The facts found, shortly stated, are as follows: The claimant in 1911 became a party to the so-called land-grant equalization agreements' with the Quartermaster General, by which it agreed (subject to certain exceptions not here material) to transport troops of the United States at the net rates effective over land-grant lines, that is, at fifty per cent. of the rates charged private parties. \n1\n Thereafter, between March 1, 1912, and June 18, 1916,2 the claimant transported, upon Government requests, a number of applicants for enlistment in the Army, discharged, retired and furloughed soldiers, and civilian employees in the War Department. \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n It had been previously ruled by the Comptroller of the Treasury that such persons were to be regarded as troops of the United States and that their transportation could be paid for only at land-grant rates; and disbursing officers, as the claimant knew, were authorized to make payments on that basis only. Because of this ruling the claimant presented its bills for all such transportation on the form of voucher prescribed for transportation at land-grant rates,3 in which it stated in appropriate columns the 'gross amount' of the regular fares, the 'amount to be deducted on account of land-grant,' and, in the final column, the 'amount claimed' (the gross amount less the land-grant deduction); and certified the accounts to be correct. All these vouchers were presented to the Disbursing Quartermaster at San Francisco, and were paid by him in the amounts claimed; and all these payments were accepted by the claimant.\n Prior to January 1, 1914, the claimant, except in one instance, accepted payment of these bills without protest or other objection.\n After January 1, 1914, however, there was written, typewritten or stamped by the claimant upon a part of the land-grant vouchers, before they were paid, a so-called short form of protest, reading as follows: 'Amounts claimed in this bill accepted under protest.' This form of protest was understood by the clerk who handled these bills in the office of the Disbursing Quartermaster as being 'addressed to the matter of land- grant rates,' for the purpose of reserving the claimant's right to present a further claim for full commercial fares to the accounting officers or the courts. The claimant used this form of protest on 201 vouchers between January 1 and October 1, 1914;4 but 303 of the vouchers presented and paid during this period bore no protest. \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n On October 1, 1914, the claimant began 'systematically' to endorse in typewriting on the land-grant vouchers, before presentment, a so-called long form of protest, reading as follows:\n'As U. S. Government accounting officers claim they have no authority to allow or pay for the transportation of discharged soldiers more than the fares for troops of the U. S. such fares are shown herein but under protest and S. P. Co. for itself and connecting carriers does not waive any of its rights to full published tariff fares and any payment at any less amount will be accepted as part payment only for the services performed.'\n\n This form of protest was used on 516 vouchers between October 1, 1914 and June 18, 1916;5 but 212 of the vouchers presented and paid within this period bore no form of protest whatever.\n The claimant brought the present action in March, 1918, shortly before the decision in United States v. Union Pacific Railroad, \n249 \nU.S. 354\n, 39 S. Ct. 294. In that case the railroad company, a party to the land-grant equalization agreement, having transported persons of all the classes that are here in question except civilian employees, had presented to the Auditor for the War Department claims for such transportation at the full tariff rates, and the Auditor and Comptroller having successively refused to allow these claims at more than the land- grant rates, had then brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the full passenger fares. It was held by this court that such persons were not troops of the United States within the meaning of the land-grant acts and the equalization agreements, and that the railroad company was entitled to recover the full amount claimed. In the present case the Court of Claims held that in the light of this decision none of the classes of persons here in question could be regarded as troops of the United States, and recognized that the claimant would have been entitled \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n originally to compensation at the full passenger rates. This is not questioned by the Government; the sole contention being that, as was further held by the Court of Claims, the action of the claimant in voluntarily presenting its bills at the land-grant rates and accepting payment thereof, precludes it from recovery of the balance of the full rates to which it would otherwise have been intitled.\n The question when the substantive right to recover an amount justly due from the Government is lost through some act or omission upon the part of the claimant, was considered at length in St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway v. United States (No. 310) 45 S. Ct. 472, 69 L. Ed. --,6 decided April 27, 1925, in which the decisions bearing on this question were collated. It was there said that this right 'can be lost only through some act or omission on the part of the claimant which, under the rules of the common law as applied by this Court to claims against the Government, discharges the cause of action. Acquiescence by the claimant in the payment by the Government of a smaller amount than is due will ordinarily effect the discharge. Acquiescence can be established by showing conduct before the payment which might have led the Government to believe that the amount allowed was all that was claimed, or that such amount, if paid, would be received in full satisfaction of the claim. Acquiescence can, also, be established by showing conduct after the payment which might have led the Government to believe that the amount actually received was accepted in full satisfaction of the original claim. But to constitute acquiescence within the meaning of this rule, something more than acceptance of the smaller sum without protest must be shown. There must have been some conduct on the part of the creditor akin to abandonment or waiver or from which an estoppel may arise.' The defense of acquiescence by the acceptance of a smaller sum than the actually \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n due, it was further pointed out, is not to be confused with the defense 'of accord and satisfaction or compromise of a disputed claim,' evidenced by a receipt in full or a release.\n Manifestly there was here 'no accord and satisfaction or compromise of a disputed claim.' The claimant, while presenting its bills for transportation at the land-grant rates and accepting payment thereof, did not execute either a receipt in full for its transportation charges or a release thereof. The crucial question then is whether the conduct of the claimant with reference to the acceptance of the land-grant rates establishes an acquiescence in the payment thereof, in the nature of an abandonment or waiver, that operated as a discharge of its claim for the full passenger rates. This is to be determined by the application of the rules stated in St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway v. United States, supra.\n\n 1. \nIt is clear that as to all the bills which were presented at land- grant rates prior to January 1, 1914, and paid and accepted without protest or other objection, the conduct of the claimant was such as to lead the Government to believe that the land-grant rates were accepted in full satisfaction of the original claims and established an acquiescence on the part of the claimant that operated as a discharge of the claims for the full passenger rates.

Ct. 332; Louisville & Nashville Railroad v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 374, 375\n, 42 S. Ct. 337; Louisville & Nashville Railroad v. United States, No. 29, 45 S. Ct. 233, 69 L. Ed. --,7 decided March 2, 1925; St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway v. United States, supra. This is not seriously questioned by the claimant.\n\n 2. \nThe case is manifestly different as to those bills presented on the land-grant vouchers which bore either the short or long form of 'protest.' While a 'protest' has no \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n definite legal significance in connection with the receipt of money-being ordinarily used in connection with the involuntary payment of money under legal compulsion or duress-it it may nevertheless be effective as an indication of non-acquiescence in the receipt of the amount paid as a final settlement of the claim. In the present case it is clear that the use of these protests upon the vouchers was reasonably adapted to lead the Government officials to believe that the amounts of the vouchers were not all that was claimed and such amounts were not accepted in full satisfaction of the transportation claims. This was not only brought to the attention of the disbursing officer in the first instance, but later, in due course, to the attention of the accounting officers by whom the payment of the vouchers was approved. The clerk in the office of the Disbursing Quartermaster who handled these bills understood that the short form of protest was addressed to the matter of land-grant rates, for the purpose of reserving the claimants' right to present a further claim for full commercial fares; and there is no suggestion that either the Disbursing Quartermaster or the accounting officers understood that the payment of the vouchers on which the protests were endorsed was received in full settlement of the transportation claims.\n We find no essential difference in this respect between the short and long forms of protest. The short form gave notice that the amounts claimed in the bills were 'accepted under protest'; and the long form gave notice that by reason of the claim of the Government accounting officers the fares were shown at land-grant rates, under protest, without waiver of the claimant's right to full tariff fares, and that the payment of less than the full fares would be accepted 'as part payment only for the services performed.' And the fact that a preliminary reference was made merely to the claim of the accounting officers as to discharged soldiers, did not destroy the effect \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n of the protest in its entirety as a notice that the land-grant rates were claimed and accepted in part payment only.\n We conclude that the indorsement of these protests on the vouchers sufficiently notified the government officers that the payment of the land- grant rates was not accepted in final settlement of transportation claims, and that, as to such vouchers the Government has not established an acquiescence in the payment of the land-grant rates which discharges the claims for the remainder of the full tariff fares. And we are of opinion that the claimant was not compelled, at its peril, to present its claims originally for the full tariff rates, as was done in the Union Pacific Case-which would have involved delay in the payment of any part of its claims-but that, having first presented its claim for the land-grant rates accompanied by notices showing that it did not accept such rates in final settlement, it was thereafter entitled to bring suit for the recovery of the remainder of the full tariff fares.\n\n 3. \nA different question arises, however, as to those bills which were presented on land-grant vouchers after January 1, 1914, upon which no protests were indorsed. It is perhaps true that the claimant, although presenting its bills on land-grant vouchers, might have sufficiently preserved its right to full compensation by a general notice, in advance, to the War Department that in so doing and in accepting payment on such vouchers at land-grant rates it did not intend to waive its claims to the full tariff rates and reserved the right to present subsequently its claims for the difference between the amounts paid and the full rates, and that in such case it would not have been essential to the claimant's right to full compensation that each specific bill should be accompanied by a notice showing its non-acquiescence therein as a final settlement. This, however, it did not do. It gave no such general \n\n[268 U.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n notice, but adopted for the preservation of its rights the method of endorsing its protests upon the separate vouchers. Having adopted this method of procedure it was compelled to follow it in order to preserve its rights. Between January 1 and October 1, 1914, about three-fifths of the vouchers, and between October 1, 1914 and June 18, 1916, about two- sevenths, bore no protest. The number is too great to be presumptively explained on the theory of inadvertence and oversight. There is nothing in the findings of fact to indicate that this was the case, and no explanation whatever appears for the absence of the protests. Under these circumstances we think that as to all the bills presented on land-grant vouchers after January 1, 1914, which bore no protest whatever, the case is in the same situation as the bills which were presented prior to that date, without any protest; and that for the same reason it must be held that the presentation of these vouchers at the land-grant rates and the acceptance of payment thereof, established an acquiescence on the part of the claimant which discharged its claim for further compensation at the full tariff rates.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See United States v.

CITY OF PALATKA, FLA(1925)\nNo. 339\nArgued: April 27, 1925Decided: May 11, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. L. Ransom, of New York City, J. T. G. Crawford, of Jacksonville, Fla., and W. B. Crawford, of Orlando, Fla., for petitioner.\n Mr. P. H. Odom, of Jacksonville, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The City of Palatka brought this bill to restrain the petitioner, the Southern Utilities Company, from charging more than ten cents per kilowatt, metre measurement, for commercial electric lighting in the city. It alleged a contract in the grant of the petitioner's franchise \n\n[268 U.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n by which the petitioner was bound not to charge more than that sum. The defendant pleaded that in present circumstances the rate prescribed in the ordinance granting the franchise was unreasonably low and that to enforce it would deprive defendant of its property without due process of law contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The plea was overruled and defendant having declined to plead further a decree was entered for the plaintiff by the Circuit Court for Putnam County which subsequently was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 86 Fla. 583, 99 So. 236.\n The Supreme Court held that the City had power to grant the franchise and to make the contract and that it had no power of its own motion to withdraw, but it concedes the unfettered power of the legislature to regulate the rates. On that ground the defendant contends that there is a lack of mutuality and therefore that it is free and cannot be held to rates that in the absence of contract it would be unconstitutional to impose. The argument cannot prevail. Without considering whether an agreement by the Company in consideration of the grant of the franchise might not bind the Company in some cases, even if it left the city free, it is perfectly plain that the fact that the contract might be overruled by a higher power does not destroy its binding effect between the parties when it is left undisturbed.

Williamson, of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ethan B. Stroud, Jr., of Dallas, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Writ of error to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review its judgment, affirming a judgment for the plaintiff below of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, in an action upon a promissory note.\n Plaintiff in error, defendant below, a resident of Texas, executed his promissory note payable to the order of a national bank domiciled in Texas. The note was indorsed, before maturity, to defendant in error, also domiciled in Texas, as collateral security for an indebtedness owing by indorser to defendant in error, in excess of the amount of the note. Three principal grounds of error are assigned: (1) That the District Court was without jurisdiction as the plaintiff below was an indorsee of the note sued upon and as its indorser could not have brought suit upon the note against the maker in that court, Judicial Code,  24, subd. 1(c), being Comp. St.  991; (2) that defendant in error as holder of the note failed to present the note for payment at the indorser bank where it was payable and where the maker had funds on deposit sufficient to pay it; (3) that the District Court refused to stay the suit until such time as the defendant should exhaust \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n other collateral held by it as security for the indebtedness of the indorser.\n Suit being brought by a federal reserve bank, incorporated under the laws of the United States, it is a suit arising under the laws of the United States. Judicial Code,  24, 1(a); American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, \n256 \nU.S. 350\n, 41 S. Ct. 499. And as the defendant in error is not a national bank subject to the provisions of the Judicial Code,  24, subd. 16, the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit unless jurisdiction is excluded by the so-called 'assignee clause,' Judicial Code,  24, subd. 1(c), which reads as follows:\n'No District Court shall have cognizance of any suit (except upon foreign bills of exchange) to recover upon any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee, or of any subsequent holder if such instrument be payable to bearer and be not made by any corporation, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover upon said note or other chose in action if no assignment had been made. ...'\n\n It is unquestioned that where the sole ground of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship, such jurisdiction is excluded by the operation of this clause, and the question now presented is whether the clause has a like effect where the sole ground of jurisdiction is that the suit arises under the laws of the United States.\n No inference as to the meaning of the assignee clause can be drawn from its relative position in section 24, and that of the clause giving jurisdiction of suits arising under the laws of the United States. Judicial Code,  295 (section 1272).\n The history of the clause, however, shows clearly that its purpose and effect, at the time of its enactment, were to prevent the conferring of jurisdiction on the federal courts, on grounds of diversity of citizenship, by assignment, in cases where it would not otherwise exist, and \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n not to deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction where it was conferred on grounds other than diversity of citizenship.\n The assignee clause was incorporated in the Judiciary Act of 1789,  11, in substantially its present form. Under that act, jurisdiction could be invoked only by the United States, aliens, and in cases of diversity of citizenship. There was therefore no scope for its application in cases where jurisdiction depended upon the subject-matter of the suit. Jurisdiction in cases arising under the laws of the United States (except for a brief period under the Act of February 13, 1801 [2 Stat. 92, 93], was not conferred until the Act of March 3, 1875 [18 Stat. pt. 3, p. 470]). Before that date jurisdiction over suits brought by federal corporations was denied unless their charters expressly authorized them to sue in the federal courts. Where such authority was granted, the assignee clause was held to be inapplicable and not to defeat the jurisdiction. Commercial National Bank v. Simmons, 6 Fed. Cas. 226, No. 3,062; Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat. 904. In that case, the court, in holding that the Bank of the United States might bring suit on a note indorsed to it by a citizen of the same state as that of the defendant maker of the note, pointed out that the purpose of the assignee clause was to prevent extending the jurisdiction of the court by the mere process of assignment and not to limit a jurisdiction conferred on other grounds. The court said, at page 909:\n'It was apprehended, that bonds and notes, given in the usual course of business, by citizens of the same state, to each other, might be assigned to the citizens of another state, and thus render the maker liable to a suit in the federal courts. To remove this inconvenience, the act which gives jurisdiction to the courts of the Union over suits brought in by citizens of one state against the citizens of another, restrains that jurisdiction, where the suit is \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n brought by an assignee to cases where the suit might have been sustained, had no assignment been made. But the bank does not sue in virtue of any right conferred by the Judiciary Act, but in virtue of the right conferred by its charter. It does not sue, because the defendant is a citizen of a different state from any of its members, but because its charter confers upon it the right of suing its debtors in a Circuit Court of the United States.'\n\n Mr. Justice Story applied the same rule in the case of a claim assigned to the United States, holding that the assignee clause was not applicabel (United States v. Greene, 4 Mason, 427, Fed. Cas. No. 15,258), resting his decision both on the meaning and effect of the assignee clause, and on the effect of the Act of 1815, chap. 101 (3 Stat. 244), conferring general jurisdiction on the federal courts over suits brought by the United States.\n By the Act of 1875 (18 Stat. 336; Comp. St.  3926-3930), jurisdiction of the federal courts was extended generally to all suits arising under the laws of the United States. Where such is the ground of jurisdiction, the assignee clause appears to us to be inapplicable, just as it had been held to be in cases in which the like jurisdiction was conferred by special corporate charter provisions or where jurisdiction was given generally over suits brought by the United States.\n The precise question seems not to have been expressly passed upon by this court since the Act of 1875. It, however, was necessarily involved in Wyman v. Wallace, \n201 \nU.S. 230\n, 26 S. Ct. 495, in which the assignee clause would have defeated the jurisdiction attaching because of diversity of citizenship, but in which the jurisdiction was, nevertheless, upheld because the case was one arising under a law of the United States.\n We think that a reasonable interpretation of the language of the clause in the light of its history, its obvious purpose at the time of its enactment, and judicial declarations as to its meaning and effect, and the fact that the provision for jurisdiction generally over suits arising under \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n the laws of the United States was enacted later, and without any exceptions, lead to the conclusion that it should be so applied as not to limit jurisdiction arising from the nature of the subjectmatter of the suit, as is the case in suits brought by or against corporations organized under the laws of the United States. American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, supra, page 356 (41 S. Ct. 499). We hold that the District Court had jurisdiction over the cause.\n The note sued on contained a provision that the maker waived 'protest, notice thereof and diligence in collecting.' The Negotiable Instruments Law in force in Texas gives effect to stipulations waiving presentment, protest, or notice of dishonor, contained in the body of the instrument, and provides that they are binding on all parties to it. Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Supp. 1922, arts. 6001-82, 6001-83, 6001-109 to 6001-111. Plaintiff in error was therefore bound by his waiver, and the circumstance that defendant in error had knowledge of a deposit of the plaintiff in error with the payee bank sufficient to meet the note at maturity did not, contrary to the express terms of the waiver, impose a duty on defendant in error to present the note for payment. Defendant's rights were unimpaired by its failure to make due presentation of the note or to give notice of its dishonor.\n The contention of plaintiff in error that suit should have been stayed until defendant in error had exhausted its other collateral is not founded upon any special equities growing out of fraud, agreement among the parties, or suretyship, or other special relationship, giving rise to any equity in the maker of the note. The note was held by defendant in error, together with other collateral, as security for the debt of the payee who is insolvent and indebted to plaintiff in error in an amount exceeding the note. In such a situation there is no scope for the marshaling of the security at the behest of the maker of the note. The equitable doctrine of marshaling \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 457]\n\u00a0\n rests upon the principle that a creditor having two funds to satisfy his debt may not, by his application of them to his demand, defeat another creditor, who may resort to only one of the funds. The debtor may not ordinarily invoke the doctrine, for by doing so he would disregard the express provisions of his contract on which the creditor is entitled to rely. The plaintiff in error is bound to pay his obligation according to its tenor. He cannot deny his own contract merely because his creditor has acquired other rights with which he may satisfy his debt and because he wishes to avail himself of an eauitable set-off against the payee of the note. Had plaintiff in error set up any defense to the note, good as to the payee, such as fraud, or failure of consideration, he might, under the law of some jurisdictions, have urged such cases as McBride v. Potter, 169 Mass. 7, 47 N. E. 242, 61 Am. St. Rep. 265, or Second National Bank v. McGehee (Tex. Civ. App.) 241 S. W. 287, or Van Winkle, etc., Co. v. Citizens' Bank, 89 Tex. 147, 33 S. W. 862, as a basis for the claim that because of his special equites, affecting the inception of the note, the defendant in error should exonerate him by resorting to the other collateral, if shown to be sufficient to pay the note.\n But plaintiff in error shows only the obligation of his note, presumptively valid both in the hands of the payee and the defendant in error, and claims that since he has an equitable set-off good against the payee of the note, he should be relieved of his own obligation until the collateral of the payee bank has first been applied to its satisfaction. But these circumstances, which do not in any way affect the validity of negotiable paper as such, can afford no foundation for equitable relief to the maker or for depriving the creditor of the full benefit of his security in accordance with his contract. To ingraft upon the note the equity here asserted against an innocent holder would be to disregard its terms and impair its negotiability. Such authority as there is rejects it. Hanesley v. \n\n[268 U.S. 449, 458]\n\u00a0\n National Park Bank, 147 Ga. 96, 92 S. E. 879; Haas v. Bank of Commerce, 41 Neb. 754, 60 N. W. 85; Citizens' Bank v. Iddings, 60 Neb. 709, 84 N.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal by the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway from a judgment of the Court of Claims which disallowed three claims for transportation furnished to the War Department. 59 Ct. Cl. 82. That the claims were originally valid is conceded. The defense as to each is that recovery has been barred by discharge. As to two of the claims, by section 178 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1169); as to the third, by the rule declared in Oregon-Washington R. R. & Navigation Co. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 339\n, 41 S. Ct. 329. Whether on the facts found the statute and the rule apply are the questions for decision.\n First. The two claims (numbered 3055 and 4732) were for services rendered in 1917. They had been included with many others in a petition filed in the Court of Claims by the railway in 1920. On that petition a judgment had been entered for $22,624.78 and duly paid before this suit was begun. The Judicial Code provides in section 178 (Comp. St.  1169):\n'The payment of the amount due by any judgment of the Court of Claims ... shall be a full discharge \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n to the United States of all claim and demand touching any of the matters involved in the controversy.'\n\n The railway contends that these two claims were not 'matters involved in the controversy' on which the earlier judgment was entered. To establish that contention it must rely wholly upon the following finding made in this case:\n'One of the findings of fact in said [the earlier] case stated that 'the numbers and amounts referred to in the foregoing paragraphs constitute the component parts and sum total of the said $22,624.78 and are the only items in question in the case at bar.' Bills No. 3055 and No. 4732 are not mentioned in the findings in that case. The report of the Treasury Department filed in said case and upon which said stipulation of facts was based stated as to bills No. 3055 and No. 4732 that because no deduction had been made from these bills 'on account of the cause of complaint set forth in the petition nothing is due in recovery.\"\n\n The finding thus relied upon by the railway does not show that these two claims were not among 'the matters involved in the controversy' in the earlier case. On the contrary, it shows that they were there in controversy. And it suggests that the railway, after the introduction of the report of the Treasury Department, acquiesced in the latter's conclusion that as to these two claims 'nothing is due.' Compare United States v. Frerichs, \n124 \nU.S. 315, 320\n, 8 S. Ct. 514; Michot v. United States, 31 Ct. Cl. 299; Vaughn v. United Sttaes, 34 Ct. Cl. 342. The case is unlike Spicer v. United States, 5 Ct. Cl. 34, Book v. United States, 31 Ct. Cl. 272, and Adams v. United States, 33 Ct. Cl. 411. As to these two claims the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.\n Second. The remaining claim is for the disallowed part of a claim for $ 2,549.08 which was 'settled by the Auditor for the War Department May 10, 1920,' by making certain deductions, thus allowing a smaller sum. It has \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n never been involved in any litigation. The whole claim presented to the auditor was on a single government bill of lading for transporting, in 1916, so-called Army improdimenta; that is, guns, ammunition, caissons, tents, and miscellaneous military equipment belonging to the United States. That the whole of the service covered by the bill was actually rendered was never questioned. Nor was there any dispute either as to quantity or weight, or as to the tariff rate under which such articles ordinarily move. Thus the claim presented to the Auditor was definite in amount. The deduction made by him was somewhat in the nature of a counterclaim. The Comptroller of the Treasury ruled in 1918 that, for the transportation of military impedimenta, the government was entitled to the benefit of a provision in a passenger tariff by which, when persons travel in a party, there is allowed for every 25 passenger fares one baggage car free for personal effects. The Auditor apparently found that, at the same time these impedimenta moved, at least 25 soldiers had moved over the line. He therefore deducted a corresponding amount from this independent bill for freight. In suits brought by other companies the Court of Claims held that the Comptroller's ruling was wrong. See Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 56 Ct. Cl. 341. Thereupon, this suit was brought in August, 1922, to recover the amount wrongly deducted. The lower court held that the railway was barred from recovery because it had accepted, without protest or appeal, the reduced amount which the Auditor allowed.\n There is no statute or departmental rule which, as in Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, makes such protest or appeal a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action or to plaintiff's right to resort to the Court of Claims. In respect to furnishing transportation, a railroad ordinarily bears to the government the same relation that it does to a private person using its facilities. It may \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 174]\n\u00a0\n exact payment either in advance or upon the completion of the service rendered. It may, as a matter of accommodation or convenience, give a reasonable credit. Payment for transportation, as for other service or supplies, may ordinarily be secured by presenting the claim to the appropriate disbursing office of the department served. Because of limitations imposed upon the powers of disbursing officers, it is often desirable to present the claim for direct settlement to the Auditor for the department, who is an accounting officer of the Treasury. The Auditor may allow the claim in whole or in part. If his action is not satisfactory, either to the claimant or to the head of the department affected, an appeal may be taken to the Comptroller of the Treasury for its revision. In the absence of an appeal, the settlement of the Auditor is 'final and conclusive upon the executive branch of the government.' In case of such appeal the decision of the Comptroller is conclusive. Any person accepting payment under a settlement by the Auditor is precluded from obtaining such revision of the settlement as to any item upon which payment is accepted. Dockery Act July 31, 1894, c. 174,  7, 8, 28 Stat. 162, 206, 207 (Comp. St.  420, 425, 703).\n No action of these officials can bar the right of a claimant to have the Court of Claims determine whether he is entitled to recover under a contract with the government. Oregon-Washington R. R. & Navigation Co. v. United States, 54 Ct. Cl. 131, 138, 139. Compare United States v. Harmon, \n147 \nU.S. 268\n, 13 S. Ct. 327; United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328\n, 39 S. Ct. 464. The right to invoke the legal remedy may be lost by the claimant's failure to invoke it within the statutory period of limitations. But the substantive right to recover an amount confessedly due can be lost only through some act or omission on the part of the claimant which, under the rules of the common law as applied by this court to claims against the government, discharges the cause of action. Acquiescence by the claim- \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n ant in the payment by the government of a smaller amount than is due will ordinarily effect the discharge. Acquiescence can be established by showing conduct before the payment which might have led the government to believe that the amount allowed was all that was claimed, or that such amount, if paid, would be received in full satisfaction of the claim. Acquiescence can, also, be established by showing conduct after the payment which might have led the government to believe that the amount actually received was accepted in full satisfaction of the original claim. But to constitute acquiescence within the meaning of this rule, something more than acceptance of the smaller sum without protest must be shown. There must have been some conduct on the part of the creditor akin to abandonment or waiver or from which an estoppel might arise. Every case in which this court has sustained the affirmative defense of acquiescence rests upon findings which include at least one of these additional features. \n1\n In the case at bar they are wholly lacking.\n The affirmative defense of acquiescence by acceptance of a smaller sum than was actually due-the bar relied upon in this suit-must not be confused with other affirmative defenses which are often interposed to suits in which the plaintiff claims that the government has \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 176]\n\u00a0\n paid him only a part of what was due. Among these are accord and satisfaction or compromise of a disputed claim;2 voluntary submission of a disputed claim to an investigating board and acceptance of the amount allowed by it;3 adjustment of damages inherently unliquidated;4 surrender of the instrument sued on;5 prior acceptance of the principal of a debt as a bar to a suit for accrued interest;6 prior judgment on part of an indivisible demand. \n7\n Cases in which acquiescence by acceptance of a smaller sum is relied upon as an affirmative defense must also be differentiated from those in which acquiescence is proved to show that the claim sued on never arose. Prominent among the cases of this character are those in which a railroad, free to decline, carried the mail after notice from the Postmaster General that payment for future services would be made at a reduced rate. \n8\n in \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 177]\n\u00a0\n such cases the plaintiff fails, even where it appears that the reduced payment was accepted under protest, because the contract implied in fact on which it seeks to recover cannot be established. Cases involving the affirmative defense of acquiescence by acceptance of a smaller sum than was actually due must likewise be differentiated from those in which one wrongly removed from a statutory office is denied relief unless suit is instituted promptly. The latter rest upon a policy not here applicable. \n9\n The cases urged upon our attention by counsel for the government present, in the main, instances of defenses other than acquiescence.\n The claim here in question was for an amount fixed by the tariff. A bill for the full sum due was presented to the appropriate officer. The deduction made by the Auditor was without warrant in law. There was no act or omission of the claimant which could conceivably have induced the making of the deduction. Nor did the claimant in any way indicate satisfaction with the reduced amount received by it. The government did not establish the affirmative defense of acquiescence by showing merely acceptance without protest. To hold that such acceptance barred the right to recover the balance wrongly withheld was to give it an effect in judicial proceedings similar to that which it had within the executive department under the Dockery Act. See Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 57 Ct. Cl. 284. For such a rule there is no support either in the legislation of Congress or in the decisions of this court. Compare Clyde \n\n[268 U.S. 169, 178]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, 13 Wall. 38.

S.(1925)\nNo. 229\nArgued: January 23, 1923Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. S. Ashbaugh, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. A. A. McLaughlin, of Washington, D. C., and Sidney F. Andrews, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims which dismissed the petition on demurrer. The plaintiff owns a shortline railroad which it operated, but which is alleged to have been under federal control from January 1 to July 1, 1918. The suit was brought to recover, for that period, amounts representing the deficit in operating income, under maintenance of way and equipment charges, and the rental value of the property, \n\n[267 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n which are claimed under section 3 of the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 454 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919 ,  3115 3\/4 c). There was annexed to the petition as an exhibit the copy of a contract between the plaintiff and the Director General of Railroads, dated February 26, 1919. It deals, in the main, with the mutual relations of the parties for the period after July 1, 1918, but section 3 of the contract provides as follows:\n'The company ... expressly accepts the covenants and obligations of the Director General in this agreement set out and the rights arising thereunder in full adjustment, settlement, satisfaction, and discharge of any and all claims and rights at law or in equity, which it now has or hereafter can have against the United States, the President, the Director General or any agent or agency thereof by virtue of anything done or omitted, pursuant to the acts of Congress herein referred to.\n\n'This is not intended to affect any claim said company may have against the United States for carrying the mails or for other services rendered not pertaining to or based upon the Federal Control Act.'\n\n The acts of Congress referred to in the contract were the Federal Control Act, the Act of August 29, 1916, c. 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 (Comp. St.  1974a), and the Joint Resolutions of April 6, 1917, and December 7, 1917, 40 Stat. 1, 429. The government assigned as a ground of demurrer that the copy of the contract annexed to the petition showed that the claims sued on had been settled and that the United States had been released from any liability to the plaintiff.\n The petition alleges, among other things, 'that section 3 thereof does not contain and was not intended to contain any receipt or acknowledgement of any consideration by or in favor of the plaintiff for the use of said railroad property during said six months from January 1 to July 1, 1918;' that the section refers only to other provisions; \n\n[267 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n and that the 'plaintiff gained nothing by the execution of this contract, and by it no rights were lost.' The contention is that these allegations are admitted by the demurrer; and that for this and other reasons section 3 cannot properly be construed to apply to claims of the character of those sought to be recovered, because these 'did not arise out of the contract or because of anything contained in it.' The allegations in the petition as to the meaning, application and effect of section 3, being conclusions of law, are not admitted by the demurrer. United States v. Ames, \n99 U.S. 35\n, 45; Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 536\n, 13 S. Ct. 695; Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Brown, \n213 \nU.S. 25, 43\n, 29 S. Ct. 404. The legal effect of the instrument remains that which its language imports. Inter-State Land Co. v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., \n139 \nU.S. 569, 578\n, 11 S. Ct. 656. The contract here in question appears to have been carefully drawn. It is the standard form short-line or co-operative contract said to have been executed by more than a hundred railroads. \n1\n The language employed in section 3 to embody the agreement for settlement and release of claims is so clear and comprehensive as to leave on its face no room for construction. United States v. Wm. Cramp & Sons Co., \n206 \nU.S. 118, 128\n, 27 S. Ct. 676. And we do not find in any other part of the contract any provision which prevents the application of the release clause to the claims here in suit.\n There is no contention that the contract as written does not express the actual agreement, nor a prayer that, because of mutual mistake, it should be reformed. The petition contains allegations which indicate that originally it was intended to challenge the validity of the contract because of duress, lack of consideration, and want of power in the Director General to enter into the same. \n\n[267 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n But the plaintiff's brief declares that the sole question before the court is whether section 3 of the contract is a settlement or waiver of the claim in suit. And more specifically:\n'It is not alleged nor now claimed that the contract was wholly and absolutely void because of total lack of consideration, or because the same was executed under forceable and legal duress.'\n\n Any claim based on a lack of authority in the Director General is clearly unfounded.\n There is in the brief a suggestion that the lower court erred in giving effect to section 3 because 'the contract was set out as an exhibit to the petition not as a part thereof, but merely for the purpose of showing to the court that the cause of action set out in the petition ... [was] entirely independent of and arose outside of the contract itself.' The suggestion is unsubstantial. Ordinarily, the defense of release or accord and satisfaction must be pleaded in bar. But where the fact appears either in the body of the petition, or from an exhibit annexed, the defense may be availed of on demurrer. Compare Randall v. Howard, 2 Black, 585, 589; McClure v. Township of Oxford, \n94 U.S. 429\n, 433; Speidel v. Henrici, \n120 \nU.S. 377, 387\n, 7 S.

The Proteus and her cargo were lost. Petitioner and respondents filed their petitions for limitation of liability. R. S.  4283-4285 ( Comp. St.  8021-8023); admiralty rule 54. The proceedings were consolidated. The District Court found that both vessels were at fault and referred the question of damages to a commissioner. The Cushing, 266 F. 570. He reported that there should be awarded on account of the loss of the Proteus $750,000, with interest. The report was confirmed and decree entered, November 28, 1922. Petition of Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 285 F. 617. Petitioner and Southern Pacific Company appealed; the Director General did not appeal. The petitioner maintained that the Cushing was not at fault, and sought reversal on that ground. The Southern Pacific Company contended \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 153]\n\u00a0\n that the commissioner's valuation of the Proteus was too low. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the fault of the Cushing, and held that the value of the Proteus at the time of the collision was $1,225,000, and the decree of the District Court was modified accordingly. The Cushing, 292 F. 560. The petition to this court for a writ of certiorari alleges that at the time of the collision the Proteus was under the sole control of the Director General of Railroads, and that, if the vessel had not been lost, it would have continued in his control until March 1, 1920; that the claim of the Southern Pacific Company was against the Standard Oil Company and the Director General, who were joint tort-feasors causing the loss of the Proteus; and that, after the expiration of the term of the Circuit Court of Appeals, petitioner learned that a final settlement had been made between the Southern Pacific Company and the Director General, by which the liability of the latter for the loss of the Proteus was satisfied by payment of $750,000, or by adjustment and settlement on that basis. And the petition asserts that thereby any claim of the Southern Pacific Company against petitioner was extinguished, because a settlement with one joint tort-feasor precludes recovery from the other for the same loss. The petition was granted. \n263 \nU.S. 696\n, 44 S. Ct. 133. Later the order granting the writ was vacated as to personal injury, cargo, and passenger claimants against whom no error was assigned. \n263 \nU.S. 681\n, 44 S. Ct. 135. By leave of this court, additional testimony relating to the settlement was taken in accordance with paragraph 2 of rule 12. \n265 \nU.S. 569\n, 44 S. Ct. 458\n\n\n The material facts may be briefly stated. December 28, 1917, the President took over the combined rail and water transportation system of the Southern Pacific Company and its subsidiaries. February 19, 1919, the Director General and the owner made a contract in respect of the operation and upkeep of the properties and for the compensation to be paid for their use during federal control. By it the Director General was required to pay for \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n property destroyed and not replaced. December 19, 1922, final settlement under the contract was made. The total amount of all items claimed by the company was $54,252,694.57. There was paid $9,250,000 as a lump sum, and that was accepted in full satisfaction of all claims, with certain exceptions not here material. The company claimed $1,268,090.26 for the Proteus and $16,663.80 for the lighter Confidence. The Railroad Administration kept a record, showing how the lump sum was arrived at. In this record there was allocated on account of the Proteus and the Confidence a lump sum of $885,000, but this was not in any wise communicated to the company. There was no agreement as to the value of the Proteus, or as to the amount included in the lump sum on account of her loss, or on account of any other item. On the facts disclosed, it is impossible to attribute to her loss any particular amount.\n The rule of the common law that one who is injured by a joint tort and accepts satisfaction from one of the wrongdoers cannot recover from the other does not apply. By reason of the immunity of the United States from suit, the Southern Pacific Company did not have the same remedy against the Director General that an owner would have against a private charterer. Waiver of sovereign immunity from suit was not broad enough to permit an action in tort by the company against the Director General for the loss of the Proteus. See section 108 Federal Control Act, 40 Stat. 456, c. 25 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j); Dupont De Nemours & Co. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 456, 462\n, 44 S. Ct. 364; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554\n, 41 S. Ct. 593. In respect of that, there was no breach of duty owed to the respondent by the Director General as a common carrier. As was said in The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 433\n, 42 S. Ct. 159, 161 (66 L. Ed. 299):\n'The United States has not consented to be sued for torts, and therefore it cannot be said that in a legal sense the United States has been guilty of a tort.'\n\n At the time of the collision, the Director General was a special owner having exclusive possession and control \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 155]\n\u00a0\n of the vessel; the Southern Pacific Company was the owner of the reversion. Together they had full title, and joined in the petition for limitation of liability. Adjustment of their interests under the contract could be made before as well as after the end of litigation. No question of tort or negligence on the part of the Director General was involved. The settlement had no relation to the wrongful act of petitioner and did not affect its liability. Ridgeway v. Sayre Electric Co., 258 Pa. 400, 406, 102 A. 123, L. R. A. 1918A, 991, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1. Petitioner is not entitled to dismissal as against the Southern Pacific Company. Nor is the Director General bound by the decree of the District Court as to the amount of damages. On appeal in admiralty, there is a trial de novo. The whole case was opened in the Circuit Court of Appeals by the appeal of the Southern Pacific Company, as much as it would have been if the Director General had also appealed. Reid v. American Express Co., \n241 \nU.S. 544\n, 36 S. Ct. 712; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S. Ct. 1, 3 A. L. R. 323; The John Twohy, \n255 \nU.S. 77\n, 41 S.

Ct. 1177.\n It is fundamental in the law of damages that the injured party is entitled to compensation for the loss sustained. Where property is destroyed by wrongful act, the owner is entitled to its money equivalent, and thereby to be put in as good position pecuniarily as if his property had not been destroyed. In case of total loss of a vessel, the measure of damages is its market value, if it has a market value, at the time of destruction. The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 385. Where there is no market value, such as is established by contemporaneous sales of like property in the way of ordinary business, as in the case of merchandise bought and sold in the market, other evidence is resorted to. The value of the vessel lost properly may be taken to be the sum which, considering all the circumstances, probably could have been obtained for her on the date of the collision; that is, the sum that in all probability \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 156]\n\u00a0\n would result from fair negotiations between an owner willing to sell and a purchaser desiring to buy. Brooks-Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 123\n, 44 S. Ct. 471. And by numerous decisions of this court it is firmly established that the cost of reproduction as of the date of valuation constitutes evidence properly to be considered in the ascertainment of value. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, and cases cited; Bluefield Co. v.

Toronto Railway Corporation , \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 1925]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 177, 191. It is to be borne in mind that value is the thing to be found, and that neither cost of reproduction new, nor that less depreciation, is the measure or sole guide. The ascertainment of value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n The Proteus was a steel passenger and freight steamship, built in 1900 for use in the Southern Pacific Company's service between New York and New Orleans. Her original cost was $557,600. In 1909 she was reboilered and otherwise improved at a cost of $90,000. The evidence shows that she was unusually well kept and in excellent condition for use. The District Court found that in 1917 and 1918, on account of unprecedented demand and a shortage of shipbuilding facilities, the market value of ships was higher than the cost of construction, and also found that in 1918, when the Proteus was lost, the cost of construction was approaching the peak which came some months later. Petition of Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 285 F. 619, 620. Respondents \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 157]\n\u00a0\n called three witnesses experienced in shipbuilding and familiar with construction costs and value of ships in 1918. Each made an estimate of the cost of reproduction of the Proteus as of the date of the loss. Their estimates were respectively $1,755,450, $1,750,000, and $1,750,000. One of these witnesses and two others called by respondent testified respectively that in 1918 the value of the Proteus was $1,225,000, $1,297,637, and $1, 350,000. The petitioner called a mechanical engineer and naval architect connected with its construction department, who testified that the cost of reproduction of the Proteus in 1918 would have been three times its original cost or approximately $1,679,000. It called two other witnesses, who had been members of a government board of appraisers for the determination of just compensation for vessels requisitioned. They expressed the opinion that the cost of reproduction of the Proteus in 1918 would have been 2 1\/2 times its original cost, or approximately $1,400,000. But they made no detailed estimates. The figures were arrived at by examination of statistics showing labor and material costs. These three witnesses testified respectively that at the time of the loss the value of the ship was $630,000, $650,000, and $611,000.\n In view of changed prices, the original cost of the vessel was not useful as a guide to her value when lost. In The Clyde, 1 Swabey, 23, Dr. Lushington, speaking of what a vessel would fetch in the market, said ( page 24):\n'In order to ascertain this, there are various species of evidence that may be resorted to-for instance, the value of the vessel when built. But that is only one species of evidence, because the value may furnish a very inferior criterion whereby to ascertain the value at the moment of destruction. The length of time during which the vessel has been used, and the degree of deterioriation suffered, will affect the originals price at which the vessel was built. But there is another matter infinitely more important than this-known even to the most unlearned-the \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 158]\n\u00a0\n constant change which takes place in the market. It is the market price which the court looks to, and nothing else, as the value of the property. It is an old saying, 'The worth of a thing is the price it will bring.\"\n\n And see City of Winona v. Wisconsin-Minnesota Light & Power Co. (D. C .) 276, F. 996, 1003.\n'Restitutio in integrum' is the leading maxim applied by admiralty courts to ascertain damages resulting from a collision (The Baltimore, supra, 385), and, on the same principle, value is the measure of compensation in case of total loss. The evidence requires a finding that, as of the date of her loss, the cost of reproduction new of the Proteus was not less than $1,750,000. Ordinarily, contemporaneous cost of construction would be a good indication of the amount of damages resulting from the loss of a new ship. There ought not to be any difference between reasonable original cost and estimated cost of reproduction as of the date when built. But the Proteus was 18 years old when lost, and all the witnesses who testified on the subject fixed her value at that time higher than her original cost and lower than the estimated cost of construction. There is no established method or rule for determining the difference between her value at the time of the loss and what her value would have been if then new. It was shown that annual rates of depreciation used in the accounts of shipowners varied from 2 1\/2 to 5 per cent., and that such rates are affected by the policy of the owners, business conditions, taxes, and other things. It was not shown whether such deductions covered annual depreciation resulting notwithstanding proper maintenance, or whether they included all or part of the current cost of upkeep. It did not appear whether the rates were applied to reproduction cost or to original cost, or to an amount remaining after deduction on account of scrap value or salvage value or other minimum. In August, 1918, the immediate demand for ships was greater than the supply, the \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 159]\n\u00a0\n shipyards were working to full capacity, wages and prices were high, the trend of construction costs was upward, and the element of time was of the utmost importance. And witnesses on both sides testified that such conditions make for a lower rate of depreciation to be taken into account in determining value. If new, the Proetus would have been worth at least her cost of reproduction. Plainly, conditions in 1918 justified a smaller deduction from cost of reproduction new than before the war, and made value of a vessel in good condition and ready for use approach more nearly its value new.\n\n Petitioner's mechanical engineer arrived at $630,000, by taking 34 per cent. of $1,670,000 reproduction cost as found by him, and by making some relatively small adjustments one account of expenditures for maintenance and improvement. He arrived at 66 per cent. deducted, by taking 4 per cent. for 14 years and 2 1\/2 per cent. for four years, making an average of over 3.6 per cent. The two other witnesses called by petitioner arrived at $650,000 and $611,000, respectively, by taking 45.2 per cent. of $1,400,000, reproduction cost found by them, and by making similar adjustments. They arrived at 54.8 per cent. deducted, by the use of a depreciation table prepared by another member of the board of appraisers. This table applies to steel steamers in salt water service. It is based on a life of 40 years. It makes a different deduction for each year. For the first 20 years it takes off 60 per cent. and for the last, 40 per cent. The average annual rate is 2 1\/2 per cent. The evidence showed that the useful life of such a vessel is not any fixed number of years, but varies greatly, depending on upkeep and maintenance. The table was intended to reflect average conditions of the different depreciable elements of ships of that class and to guide to average values over extended periods, including times of depression as well as of prosperity. The value fixed by each of petitioner's witnesses is more than $1,000,000 less than the \n\n[268 U.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n reproduction cost. The rate of depreciation taken by petitioner's mechanical engineer is too high in view of the conditions prevailing at the time of the loss. The other witnesses based their calculation on a reproduction cost that was too low. Moreover, certain valuations made by the government board of appraisers of which they were members seriously impair the weight of their testimony. In 1917, the United States requisitioned the Havana and the Saratoga, vessels of the same type as the Proteus and about 1 1\/2 times its size, and constructed in 1906. Cramp's estimated reproduction cost of each in 1917 to be $3,000,000, about 3 times original cost. The board fixed value at $2,240,000 each, about 74 per cent. of reproduction cost. But the value of the Proteus, as given by these witnesses, was less than 38 per cent. of her cost of reproduction new.\n We think the commissioner and District Court failed to give due regard to construction costs, conditions, wages, and prices affecting value in 1918, and that the evidence sustains the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL CO. OF NEW JERSEY v. UNITED STATES(1925)\nNo. 169\nArgued: January 14, 1925Decided: February 2, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Cletus Keating and John M. Woolsey, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Frank Staley, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel upon two policies of insurance issued by the Government insuring respectively the steamship Llama and her freight and advances against war risks. \n\n[267 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n Act of September 2, 1914, c. 293,  5; 38 Stat. 711, 712 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  514e). The libelant recovered in the District Court, but the decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 291 F. 1. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n263 \nU.S. 694\n, 44 S. Ct. 37.\n The risks assumed by the insurer in the two policies included 'takings at sea, arrests, restraints and detainments of all Kings, princes, and peoples, of what nation, condition or quality soever, and all consequences of hostilities or war-like operations, whether before or after declaration of war.' The loss happened as follows. On October 14, 1915, the Llama sailed from New York for Copenhagen with a cargo of oil, routed via Kirkwall that her papers might be examined. On October 29 she was stopped by the British warship Virginia and was boarded by a lieutenant and four men, all armed, and her papers examined. The result was signalled to the Virginia and the lieutenant directed to proceed to Kirkwall, which was 400 miles to the east on the further side of the Orkneys, keeping to the northward of Scule Skerry and North Rona and not to pass between the islands at night. The steamer arrived off Westray Frith, one passage between the islands, on the night of October 30. The next morning it started on a course through Westray Frith but in a few hours struck a rock and was totally lost.\n In defense it is argued that the proximate cause was a marine peril not covered by the policies and that the decision should be governed by Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531; Queen Insurance Co. v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 487\n, 44 S. Ct. 175, and other similar cases. But in those very strict applications of a well-known rule, however strong the motives of the insured or owners for acting as they did, the loss ensued upon their own conduct. But if a vessel should be taken from an owner's hands without his consent and should be lost while thus held by a paramount power, obviously a company that had insured \n\n[267 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n against such a taking could not look beyond and attribute the loss to a peril of the sea. Whatever happens while the taking insured against continues fairly may be attributed to the taking. That is a nonconductor between the insured and subsequent events. See Muller v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., 246 F. 759, 763, 159 C. C. A. 61; Cory v. Barr, 8 App. Cas. 393, 398; Anderson v. Marten, \n\n[267 U.S. 76, 1908]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 334.\n The Llama at the time of the accident was under the paramount control and in the possession of the Virginia. We regard the differences between the testimony of the British officer and that of the master of the Llama as immaterial. The master, who was believed in the District Court, makes the intervention of the British lieutenant frequent, active, and the cause of a change of the course that the ship otherwise would have taken. But whether the intervention was more or less, if by mutual understanding, after a manifestation of armed force, the last word was with the lieutenant, it does not matter whether he uttered his commands often or rarely. The lieutenant while denying that he had a general charge of the navigation testifies again and again to facts that show that he assumed and was recognized to be the ultimate power. After his signaling his ship the master, he says, asked him if he could proceed 'So I said, 'Yes.\" He looked at the course to see that it complied with the orders from his captain. 'The captain approached me and asked my permission to go through the Westray Frith. ... I gave my consent.' If the captain had suggested a course that the lieutenant did not approve, the latter said he assumed that he had power to correct it. He recognized that the vessel might possibly be the subject of prize court proceedings. Some comment was made upon the meagreness of the entries in the log as to any control of the master's conduct. But after an entry 'British naval officer boarded ship with prize crew' nothing more was necessary to show what the master understood his position \n\n[267 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n to be, whether in fact the crew was a prize crew or not. As was said of similar facts in Muller v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., 246 F. 759, 762, 159 C. C. A. 61, that the vessel and her cargo were seized, arrested and detained within the meaning of the policy we think too plain to require must more than mention. It no more mattered that the master took an active part in the navigation than that the ship still was steered by one of the crew.\n As the vessel had passed out of the owner's control before the accident by a seizure within the policy and as the loss happened while the vessel thus was held by an adverse hand, it follows that the libelant must prevail.\n Some question was made as to the allowance of interest. When the United States went into the insurance business, issued policies in familiar form and provided that in case of disagreement it might be sued, it must be assumed to have accepted the ordinary incidents of suits in such business. The policies promised that claims would be paid within 30 days after complete proofs of interest and loss had been filed with the Bureau of War Risk Insurance. The proofs seem to have been filed on January 11, 1917. Interest at 6 per cent. should be allowed from February 11, 1917. The decree of the District Court will be corrected so as to allow for total loss of the Llama, $115,000, with interest at 6 per cent. from February 11, 1917; total loss of the freight, etc., $44,686.82, with interest at 6 per cent. from February 11, 1917; Expenses incurred under sue and labor clauses, $2,270.34, with interest at 6 per cent. from February 11, 1917\n\n\n Thus modified the decree will be affirmed.\n Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Decree of District Court modified and affirmed. \n\n[267 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ARK. v. STATE OF TENN.(1925)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 152, 153]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Caruthers Ewing, of Memphis, Tenn., for complainant.\n Messrs. Guston T. Fitzhugh, of Memphis, Tenn., Charles T. Cates, Jr., of Knoxville, Tenn., and Albert W. Biggs, of Memphis, Tenn., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The commissioners, who were named by the decree entered June 10, 1918 ( \n247 \nU.S. 461\n, 38 S. Ct. 557), and directed to run, locate, and designate the boundary line between the states along the portion of the Mississippi river that was left dry as a result of the avulsion in 1876, filed their report May 24, 1921. They correctly understood, and counsel for the parties agreed with them, that the directions contained in the decree applied to the two branches of the river as it formerly flowed- the Devil's Elbow \n\n[269 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n around Centennial Island and Island 37, and also the old river bed between Brandywine Island and the Tennessee shore. They found and recommended a line indicated by courses and distances set out in, and shown on a map attached to, their report. The defendant filed numerous exceptions which need not be quoted at length. The substance of its contentions is sufficiently indicated below.\n Defendant asserts that the commissioners established the boundary line before its witnesses were heard and before cross-examination of any witness for the plaintiff. But the record does not support the contention. In July, 1918, the commissioners examined the territory involved. In October, 1919, they took a survey party to the place to commence work. In 1920, they completed their surveys including the line, then only provisional, which later was recommended in their report. The making of these surveys in advance of hearing the testimony was an appropriate step in the investigation. While the field work was in progress the commissioners spent most of the time in the field, assisting, and examining the topography and comparing the evidence. Facts disclosed by the survey and so gathered well might be deemed to be useful to enable the commissioners the better to understand and determine the value of other evidence. The report states that the commissioners spared no effort to secure maps and evidence indicating the course of the channel from the earliest record down to the time of the investigation. And that statement seems well supported. There is nothing to justify the suggestion that the commissioners established the line without considering the evidence.\n Defendant insists that the middle of the main navigable channel as it existed before the avulsion could not be located with reasonable certainty, and that the commissioners should have so reported (decree, par. 5). It maintains that the recommended boundary, except that \n\n[269 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n portion between Island 37 and Arkansas, is based entirely on a reconnoissance made by Maj. Charles R. Suter, Corps of Engineers, United States Army, in 1874, and insists that the Suter line is not established by the evidence. Objection is also made to the location of the channel on the east side of Island 39, and to certain other parts of the commissioners' line.\n The boundary line to be located is the middle of the main channel of the river as it existed in 1783 subject to subsequent changes occurring through natural and gradual processes. In 1823, the location of the river was substantially as indicated on a map, referred to in the record as Humphrey's map, and there has been no map or survey, which tied the channel to any fixed monument, showing the location of the river as of any later date. The evidence shows that such channels are liable to change substantially from time to time. And the parties stipulated that from 1823 to 1876 the river and land lines had been altered as shown in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in the case of State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 59, 104 S. W. 437. The Humphrey map is on page 60 and the Suter map on page 62 of the opinion (104 S. W. 439, 440). The changes found to have taken place in this period need not be specified. There is nothing to indicate that the 1823 map is useful as a guide to the boundary line as established by the interlocutory decree. The reconnoissance of 1874 was made pursuant to an Act of Congress approved June 23, 1874, c. 457 (18 Stat. 237, 242), providing for surveys and estimates for the improvement of certain transportation routes to the seaboard. Maj. Suter was assigned to make examination of the Mississippi river from Cairo to the Gulf. His party had a government steamboat and, in the performance of the work, passed over the part of the river here involved four times. The courses of the channel were taken by compass. Distances were determined by the speed of the boat. Widths of the river were \n\n[269 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n estimated, and to some extent these estimates were checked by triangulation. The purpose was to ascertain the appearance of the river and to get a general idea of the shape and location of the channel. No survey by actual measurements was made, and accuracy was not attained. From the evidence and a stipulation of the parties, the commissioners found that there had been no material change in the river between the time of the reconnoissance in 1874 and the avulsion in 1876. While not made according to actual measurements, the Suter map may be said to present the general situation as it existed immediately before the avulsion. The commissioners did not follow the map at all places, and did not take it as their sole guide for the ascertainment of any part of the line. On satisfactory evidence that was not contradicted, the commissioners found that Island 37 was on the Tennessee side of the main channel as it existed in 1876, and not on the Arkansas side, as shown by the Suter map. The commissioners also found that the United States township plats show that Island 39 at the foot of Brandywine was included in the public surveys of Arkansas, and that the old maps which were used as guides for the navigation of the river show that island very close to or against the Arkansas side. They report that they could not find any evidence to the contrary. And so they determined the main channel to have been on the easterly side of that island. As their conclusion is well sustained by the evidence, it is immaterial whether, as stated in the report, Suter's map shows a line on each side of the island.\n Counsel for the defendant asserts that 'a map, to be of any value for the purpose of locating any particular lines or objects thereon, must be based upon a survey accurately made by measurement and instrumental observations, and must be a faithful and correct delineation of a faithful survey, in every detail.' And on that basis \n\n[269 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n he argues that the Suter map is valueless as a means accurately to fix the old channel, because not properly tied to some point or monument. But the standard demanded is not applicable. The thing to be done must be regarded. It is to locate the boundary along that portion of the bed of the river that was left dry as a result of the avulsion, according to the middle of the main navigable channel at the time the current ceased to flow therein as a result of the avulsion. Absolute accuracy is not attainable. A degree of certainty that is reasonable as a practical matter, having regard to the circumstances, is all this is reguired. The line of the greatest depth of water is not necessarily the middle of the channel. Minnesota v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 273, 282\n, 40 S. Ct. 313. The location, limits, and width of the main navigable channel were not precisely defined or permanent. The determination of its location involved more than mere measurements and required the exercise of judgment based on experience. The degree of accuracy insisted on is not reasonable or practicable.\n Defendant's principal reliance is on opinions expressed by some of the witnesses to the effect that the line cannot be located with reasonable certainty. But such opinions are of little weight as against the facts shown and the determination of the commission. In addition to the commissioners' careful investigation in the held, there was the testimony of steamboat men and others who were familiar with the situation as it existed before the avulsion in 1876. It is sufficient to say that, when taken in connection with the Suter map and considered in the light of established physical facts and other evidence, the testimony of these witnesses clearly establishes the line reported by the commissioners. The exceptions are without merit and are overruled. The report of the commissioners is confirmed.\n Plaintiff paid the cost of printing the report and testimony, and moves that such cost be borne by defendant. \n\n[269 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n The reasons stated by plaintiff are that defendant alone was dissatisfied with the report, and, as a condition to excepting thereto, required plaintiff to pay for such printing, and that the exceptions are frivolous. We are of the opinion that the printing of the evidence was not necessary, and require defendant to bear the cost of that part of the printing. All other expenses, including the commissioners' compensation, will be divided equally between the parties.\n The decree will be in accordance with this opinion. At any time within 40 days the parties may submit suggestions as to form. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF COLORADO v. TOLL(1925)\nNo. 234\nArgued: April 24, 1925Decided: May 11, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. L. Boatright, of Denver, Colo., and Paul W. Lee and George H.

C., for appellee. \n\n[268 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought in the District Court by the State of Colorado to enjoin the superintendent of the Rocky Mountain National Park from enforcing certain regulations for the government of the park, which are alleged to be beyond the authority conferred by Acts of Congress and to interfere with the sovereign rights of the State. These regulations forbid any person to reside permanently, engage in any business, or erect buildings in the park without permission in writing from the Director of the National Parks Service, provide for the removal of disorderly persons and forbid their return without permission from the Director, and impose a fine or imprisonment or both for violating these regulations, the defendant, it seems, being the sole judge. The special subject of complaint is a further regulation subject to similar penalties that--\n'The park is open to automobiles operated for pleasure, but not to those carrying passengers who are paying, either directly or indirectly, for the use of machines. (Excepting, however, automobiles used by transportation lines operating under Government franchises.)'\n\n It is alleged that the defendant and his superior officers assert full authority over all highways in the park to the exclusion of the State and refuse permission to anyone operating automobiles for hire except one corporation which has received a permit. It is alleged that he asserts the right to exact a license fee from privately owned vehicles, although it does not appear that this has been done in this park. There are many thousands of acres in the park owned by private persons, and there are houses and hotels that were built before the park was laid out. It is feared that the same jurisdiction \n\n[268 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n will be exercised over the forest reservations in the State and it is alleged that all the main highways connecting the eastern and western parts of the State traverse either the reservations or the park, which last contains about 400 square miles. The roads were built by counties and the State under the grant of right in Revised Statutes,  2477 (Comp. St.  4919), before the park was laid out. It is alleged that the State never has ceded its power. The bill was dismissed for want of equity by the District Court.\n The object of the bill is to restrain an individual from doing acts that it is alleged that he has no authority to do and that derogate from the quasi-sovereign authority of the State. There is no question that a bill in equity is a proper remedy and that it may be pursued against the defendant without joining either his superior officers or the United States. Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 431\n, 40 S. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 619\n, 620 S., 32 S. Ct. 340. As the bill was dismissed upon the merits it is not necessary to say more upon this preliminary question. Also the direct appeal to this Court is proper as the State complains of an infringement of its right in the highways and of its other reserved powers and the case as made involves the construction of the Constitution of the United States.\n The park was created by the Act of January 26, 1915, c. 19; 38 Stat. 798 (Comp. St.  5249a et seq.). By section 2 the Act is not to 'affect any valid ... claim, location, or entry under the land laws of the United States, whether for homestead, mineral, right of way, or any other purpose whatsoever,' and by section 3 'no lands located within the park boundaries now held in private, municipal, or State ownership shall be affected by or subject to the provisions of this Act.' By section 4 the park is put under the executive control of the Secretary of the Interior and it is made his duty to make such reasonable regulations, not inconsistent with the laws of the United States, as he deems proper for the management of the same, such 'regulations being primarily \n\n[268 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n aimed at the freest use of the said park for recreation purposes by the public and for the preservation of the natural conditions and scenic beauties thereof. ... The regulations governing the park shall include provisions for the use of automobiles therein.' There is no attempt to give exclusive jurisdiction to the United States, but on the contrary the rights of the State over the roads are left unaffected in terms. Apart from those terms the state denies the power of Congress to curtail its jurisdiction or rights without an act of cession from it and an acceptance by the national government. Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, \n114 \nU.S. 525\n, 5 S. Ct. 995. The statute establishing the park would not be construed to attempt such a result. Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston R. Co. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 733\n. As the defendant is undertaking to assert exclusive control and to establish a monopoly in a matter as to which, if the allegations of the bill are maintained, the State has not surrendered its legislative power, a cause of action is disclosed if we do not look beyond the bill, and it was wrongly dismissed. The cases cited for the defendant do not warrant any such extension of the power of the United States over land within a State. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 404\n, 37 S. Ct. 387; McKelvey v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 353, 359\n, 43 S. Ct. 132. See Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343\n, 38 S. Ct. 323.\n It is said, although it does not appear in the record, that the decision below was based upon Robbins v. United States (C. C. A.) 284 F. 39, in which these regulations were held to be justified by a cession from the State. But the alleged cession is not in this record and the State denies it in the bill. In its argument it maintains that the Acts relied upon by the superintendent do not have the scope attributed to them and asserts that if they had purported to go so far they would have been without authority. The State is entitled to try the question and \n\n[268 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n to require the alleged grant to be proved. As the case can be dealt with more satisfactorily when the exact facts are before the Court we go into no more elaborate discussion now.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF N.M. v.

Under the Acts of Congress under which they were admitted into the Union and their respective Constitutions, this is the 37th parallel of north latitude between its intersections with the 103d and 109th meridians of longitude west from Greenwich. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The only dispute is as to the location of this line. Different surveys have been made. New Mexico alleges in its bill that the true line is that which was surveyed \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n and marked by Howard B. Carpenter in 1903, and prays that this be decreed to be the boundary. Colorado, in an answer and cross bill, alleges that the true line is that which was surveyed and marked by Ehud N. Darling in 1868, and extended by John J. Major and Levi S. Preston in 1874 and 1900, and prays that this line be decreed to be the boundary, and that, in so far as necessary, it be restored and remarked.\n The case has been heard on evidence taken by examiners, supplemented by a stipulation of the parties. The material facts are these: The Territory of New Mexico was established in 1850,2 and the Territory of Colorado in 1861.3 Under the Acts of Congress their common boundary was the 37th parallel, between the 103d and 109th meridians.\n In 1867 Congress made an appropriation for the 'survey of the thirty- seventh parallel of north latitude, so far as it constitutes the northern boundary of the Territory of New Mexico.'4 The Commissioner of the General Land Office employed Ehud N. Darling, a surveyor and astronomer, to make this survey. He made the survey in 1868, and filed his field notes in the Land Office. In accordance with his instructions, he adopted as the northeast corner of New Mexico a stone monument that had been established by Capt. J. N. Macomb, an Army Engineer, in 1859, to mark the intersection of the 37th parallel with the 103d meridian, and, taking this as his beginning point, surveyed and marked the line of the parallel, as determined by astronomical observations and calculations for latitude, westwardly to the 109th meridian, a distance of over 331 miles. As shown by the field notes he established on this line eleven 'astronomical monuments,' with 'mile corners,' usually marked \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n stones, at the end of each mile where the nature of the ground made this possible, otherwise locating the mile corners by triangulation. In 1869 the Commissioner of the General Land Office approved these field notes, and published an official 'Map of the Boundary Line between Colorado & New Mexico an the 37th Parallel North Latitude,' made in conformity to them.\n Several years later the Commissioner of the General Land Office employed John J. Major, a surveyor and astronomer, to survey and mark the remaining portion of the southern boundary of the Territory of Colorado, extending along the 37th parallel to the 102d meridian. Major made this survey in 1874, and marked the line of the parallel between the Macomb monument and that meridian. The field notes of this survey were filed in the Land Office and approved by the Commissioner.\n In 1876 the State of Colorado was admitted into the Union, with the same southern boundary line as that of the Territory. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Some years later the 103d meridian was established on a line known as the 'Cimarron Meridian,' intersecting the 37th parallel a short distance east of the Macomb monument. Thereafter the United States Surveyor General employed Levi S. Preston, a deputy surveyor, to resurvey and retrace the north boundary of New Mexico between the Macomb monument and the Cimarron meridian. Preston made this survey in 1900, retracing and remarking this portion of the Major line, and established at the intersection of that line and the Cimarron meridian, about two miles east of the Macomb monument, a sandstone corner since known as the Preston monument. The field notes of this resurvey were filed in the office of the Surveyor General and approved by him. \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n In 1901 the State of Colorado appointed a commissioner to resurvey and remark a portion of its southern boundary line as surveyed and established by Darling, on which one of his astronomical monuments had disappeared and a number of mile corners could not be found. \n6\n Both the Territory of New Mexico and the Interior Department were invited to join in this resurvey, but neither did so; and it was made by the Colorado commissioner alone.\n In 1902 an examiner of surveys in the General Land Office, on an inspection of about sixty miles of Darling's original line, reported that but few of the corners then remained, and that the line was evidently erroneously established between identified monuments; and the Commissioner urged that the entire southern line of Colorado be resurveyed and reestablished. Thereupon, on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior,7 Congress made an appropriation for 'the resurvey and reestablishment, on the line of the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude, of the boundary line between the State of Colorado and the Territories of New Mexico and Oklahoma' between the 102d and 109th meridians. \n8\n The Commissioner of the General Land Office employed Howard B. Carpenter, a surveyor and astronomer, to make this resurvey. He was not directed to retrace the lines previously established, but to make an independent survey, and was specifically instructed to 'obliterate' all evidences of the corners and monuments that had been set by Darling. Carpenter completed this resurvey in 1903, and filed his field notes in the Land Office in 1904. These were approved by the Commissioner. Carpenter surveyed \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n an entirely different line from the Darling and Major-Preston lines. His new line commenced on the 109th meridian, at some distance north of the Darling line, and ran for the greater portion of the boundary north of that line, although crossing it shortly before reaching the Macomb monument and running for the remainder of the distance somewhat to the south of the Darling and Major-Preston lines. Taken as a whole, its effect, if established as the boundary, would be to transfer a large strip of territory from Colorado to New Mexico, including the greater portions of one town and two villages, and five post offices. Carpenter established on his new line eight stone astronomical monuments, and mile corners, marked by iron posts, wherever it was practicable; and whenever he found one of Darling's mile corners or astronomical monuments, after noting its location, either destroyed it completely or obliterated the marks upon it.\n After the Commissioner's approval of the Carpenter line the General Land Office ceased to recognize the Darling and Major-Preston lines as the boundary between Colorado and New Mexico in so far as related to the public lands, as it had theretofore done, and for a time recognized the Carpenter line as the boundary.\n In 1908 Congress passed a Joint Resolution accepting the line of the Carpenter survey 'as the proper location of the thirty-seventh paralled and the true boundary line' between the States of Colorado and Oklahoma and the Territory of New Mexico.9 This resolution was, however, vetoed by the President; and no further action was taken by Congress.\n After this veto by the President the General Land Office abandoned its recognition of the Carpenter line, and thereafter continued to recognize the Darling and Major-Preston line as the boundary. \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n In 1912 the State of New Mexico was admitted into the Union, with the same northern boundary line as that of the Territory. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n In 1917 about forty miles of Darling's original line included in the resurvey that had been made by the Colorado commissioner, were resurveyed and restored under the direction and with the approval of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n In addition to the foregoing matters the stipulation of the parties recites:\n'That, except as may otherwise be shown by the record in this case as now made, for more than thirty years the position of the Darling line, from the Macomb Monument to the ... 109th meridian of longitude west from Greenwich, remained undisputed and the correctness of its technical execution unquestioned, and, as so established, the said Darling line has been recognized and acquiesced in by the United States, by the Territory and State of Colorado, by the Territory of New Mexico and by the State of New Mexico except as otherwise indicated by the bringing of this suit, and has been and is now recognized and accepted by the Land Department of the United States, in its surveys of the public domain, as the boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico from the Macomb Monument westward, except so far as may otherwise, appear (if it does otherwise appear) by the record in this case; that from 1868 to the present time the Territory and later the State of Colorado ... has claimed and exercised dominion and sovereignty, and now claims the same, over the territory down to the boundary as established by said Darling and no farther; that county lines have been formed, towns and settlements have grown up, school districts, election districts, voting precincts, and land districts and water districts have been created with reference to said \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n line; public officers have been elected, property has been assessed and taxes levied and collected under the authority of the Territory and State of Colorado, and its courts of both civil and criminal jurisdiction have exercised jurisdiction in all places north of said Darling line and the Territory and State of New Mexico has exercised like jurisdiction in all places south of said line; that government postoffice[s] have been established as being in Colorado when north of said line and as in New Mexico when south of said line, and that public land surveys on both sides of said line have been closed thereon, lands have been disposed of, rights acquired and political boundaries in both Colorado and New Mexico have been fixed by reference to said line. That since 1874 the Major survey and marking of the 37th parallel of north latitude ... westward to the Macomb Monument has been the recognized and accepted south boundary of Colorado between said points and since the acceptance of the Preston survey, retracement and remarking of said line, in the year 1901, said line as remarked and retraced by Preston between said Macomb Monument and the Preston Monument, at the intersection of said parallel with the Cimarron Meridian, has been and now is the recognized and accepted boundary between Colorado and New Mexico at all points between said Monuments.'\n\n There is some evidence, of a very general nature, as to the relative correctness of the location of the line of the 37th parallel as established by Darling, Major and Preston, and by Carpenter. It may well be that neither is entirely correct. We have no occasion, however, to determine this question, or to settle the precise location of the parallel line as an original matter, since, upon the uncontradicted facts, it is entirely clear that the line of the parallel as surveyed and marked by Darling westwardly from the Macomb monument, and by Major and Preston from the Macomb monument to the Preston \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n monument, must be now taken as the established boundary between the two States.\n There is no question as to the portion of this line between the Macomb monument and the Preston monument, since it is expressly agreed that since this line was surveyed by Major in 1874 and resurveyed by Preston in 1901 it 'has been and now is the recognized and accepted boundary between Colorado and New Mexico at all points between said Monuments.'\n The remainder of the line as surveyed and marked by Darling from the Macomb monument to the 109th meridian, must likewise be held to be the recognized and established boundary.\n From 1868, when Darling ran and marked the line of the 37th parallel, to 1919, when this suit was brought, a period of more than half a century, his line was recognized and acquiesced in, successively, as the boundary between the two Territories, between the State of Colorado and the Territory of New Mexico, and between the two States. In Missouri v. Iowa, 7 How. 660, which involved the location of the boundary line between the two States running with 'the Indian boundary line,' it was held that governments are bound by the practical line that has been established as their boundary, although not precisely a true one; and that as the United States before either of the States had been admitted into the Union and after Missouri had been admitted but while Iowa still remained a Territory, had recognized and adopted the line of a certain survey as the 'Indian boundary line' and was committed to that line as the boundary of Missouri, Iowa when admitted was bound by the recognition and adoption of that line by the United States, her predecessor, and could not be heard to disavow it as the boundary. So here, the United States, from 1868 to 1876, while still owning the public domain and having paramount jurisdiction as to territoria boundaries, recognized \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 41]\n\u00a0\n and adopted the Darling line as the true location of the parallel and the boundary between the two Territories, and thereafter, from 1876 to 1912, while retaining paramount jurisdiction as to New Mexico, recognized this line as the boundary between the State of Colorado and the Territory of New Mexico; and that State of New Mexico on being admitted into the Union was bound by the previous recognition and adoption of this line by the United States, her predecessor, and cannot be heard to disavow the boundary thus recognized. The effect of this recognition of the Darling line by the United States was not impaired by the temporary recognition of the Carpenter line by the General Land Office, from 1904 to 1908. The United States had resumed its recognition of the Darling line several years before New Mexico was admitted as a State. Further, after Colorado had been admitted into the Union in 1876 its right to rely upon the line previously established could not be impaired by any subsequent action on the part of the United States. Thus, after the Land Department has surveyed and disposed of public lands, the rights therein acquired are not affected by corrective surveys subsequently made by the Department. United States v. Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 212\n, 44 S. Ct. 289, and cases there cited. And, independently of these matters, New Mexico is bound by its own recognition and adoption of the Darling line, from 1912 to the beginning of this suit, after its admission to statehood. Missouri v. Iowa, supra, page 677.\n It results that the bill of New Mexico, praying the establishment of the Carpenter line, must be dismissed; and that, under the cross bill of Colorado, the Darling and Major-Preston line must be decreed to be the boundary between the two States.\n This boundary line should now be resurveyed and remarked by a commissioner or commissioners appointed by the court; such action to be subject to its approval. \n\n[267 U.S. 30, 42]\n\u00a0\n Missouri v.

The true and lawful boundary between the state of New Mexico and the state of Colorado consists of the following connecting lines: (a) The line extending westwardly from what is known as the Preston monument, marking the intersection of the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude with the Cimarron meridian (the one hundred and third) of longitude west from Greenwich, to what is known as the Macomb monument, as the said line was surveyed and marked in the year 1900 by Levi S. Preston, deputy surveyor, while engaged, under the direction of the Surveyor General for New Mexico, in retracing and re-marking between said Cimarron meridian and Macomb monument the line that had been surveyed in the year 1874 by John J. Major, astronomer and surveyor, under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and (b) the line extending westwardly from said Macomb monument to the intersection of said parallel of latitude with the one hundred and ninth meridian of west longitude, as the said line was surveyed and marked in the year 1868 by Ehud N.

STATE OF TEXAS(1925)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for the State of Oklahoma.\n Messrs. C. W. Taylor, of Corsicana, Tex., and Orville Bullington and \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n A. H. Carrigan, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for the State of Texas.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n As an incident of the receivership in this cause, it becomes necessary to determine conflicting claims to the royalty interest in the impounded proceeds of the oil taken from wells Nos. 152, 153 and 154, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S. Ct. 406. These wells are immediately south of the south bank of Red River, and therefore in the State of Texas. \n261 \nU.S. 340\n, 43 S. Ct. 376. The claimants are T. P. Roberts and A. H. Britain on the one hand and the Durfee Mineral Company on the other. Both claims are founded on Texas surveys-that of Roberts and Britain on the Lewis Powell survey made in 1861 and patented in 1868, and that of the Durfee Mineral Company on the A. A. Durfee survey made in 1886 and patented in 1889\n\n\n The principal question is whether the Powell survey extended northward to the south bank of Red River, leaving nothing between it and the bank, or stopped short of the bank, leaving a narrow wedge-shaped strip between it and the bank. The Durfee survey was made 25 years later on the assumption that the Powell survey left such a strip there. The three wells are in the wedge-shaped strip or land accreted to it. A secondary question is whether, if the Powell survey included this strip, the present owners of that survey are estopped from claiming the strip, and therefore the royalty interest, as against the Durfee Mineral Company. \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n January 19, last, the conflicting claims were referred to a special master with directions to take the evidence and report the same with findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree. \n267 U.S. 7\n, par. 8, 45 S. Ct. 198, 69 L. Ed. --. The master made his report with findings, conclusions and recommendations favorable to the claim of Roberts and Britain; the Durfee Mineral Company excepted; and both claimants have been heard in briefs and oral argument on the report and exceptions.\n The master found that the Powell survey fronted on the river and had the south bank as its northerly boundary. In the exceptions it is insisted that this finding rests on an erroneous interpretation of the survey. For reasons which will be explained, we think it rests on a right interpretation.\n The Powell was one of five surveys made by the same surveyor on the same day-May 8, 1861. These surveys were contiguous and were in the form required of surveys fronting on a stream like Red River. \n1\n They were also so tied together that the interpretation of one involves an examination of the others.\n The surveyor began with the easterly one and proceeded westerly until he had finished all five. His field notes described all as 'on the south bank of Red River,' and the drawings or plats accompanying the field notes represented all as fronting on the river and having its irregular line as a northerly boundary. The field notes of all, excepting the Powell, also described the northerly line as beginning at the northwest corner of the adjoining survey on the east and running 'thence up the river with its meanders' in a stated direction a given distance to a stake or mound 'in the bottom' or 'on the bluff' at the other end. The Powell was the fourth survey in the line, and so as between others the field notes of which said \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n 'thence up the river with its meanders.' The field notes of the Powell transmitted to the state land office, and on which the patent issued, were like the others, save that they said 'thence up the river' and omitted 'with its meanders.' But the field notes entered in the appropriate local records said 'thence up the river with its meanders.' Doubtless the discrepancy resulted from a clerical error in preparing the duplicate sent to the state land office.\n We put aside the question of the effect to be given to the entry in the local records; for the phrase 'thence up the river' in the field notes sent to the state land office and in the patent evidently mean up the natural course of the river. Schnackenberg v. State (Tex. Civ. App.) 229 S. W. 934, 937; Stover v. Gilbert, 110 Tex. 429, 247 S. W. 841, 843; Brown v. Huger, 21 How. 305, 320. Of course, that phrase must be read with the declaration that the survey was on the south bank of the river and in the light of the drawing or plat representing the river as the northern boundary.\n We think it apparent that the survey was intended to call, and did call, for the river as a boundary and that controlling influence must be given to that call rather than to the course and distance given for that boundary. The courts of Texas, in common with other courts, recognize and apply this rule of interpretation. Anderson v. Stamps, 19 Tex. 460, 465, 466; Stafford v. King, 30 Tex. 257, 271, 272, 94 Am. Dec. 304; Schnackenberg v. State, supra; Stover v. Gilbert, supra, and cases there cited; Cordell Petroleum Co. v. Michna (C. C. A.) 276 F. 483. The evidence, as pointed out by the master, does not admit of the conclusion that the surveyor mistook a bayou or other body of water for the river, or that the river was not in immediate proximity to the upper corners of the survey when it was made (see United States v. Lane, \n260 \nU.S. 662\n, 43 S. Ct. 236); so authorities rejecting an obviously mistaken call for a river or lake are not in point. See Jeems Bayou \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n Fishing and Hunting Club v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 561\n, 43 S. Ct. 205.\n The master next found that the land lying between the south bank as now existing and that bank as existing at the time of the Powell survey is accretion to the bank, and therefore part of the Powell tract. Exception is taken to this finding on grounds that are not made very clear. A short statement of what the evidence tends to show in this connection will make it plain that the exception must be overruled. During the 25-year period intervening between the Powell survey and the Durfee survey there was a large addition to the south bank, but in later years most of that addition was cut away. At present the bank extends a little farther northward than it did when the Powell survey was made. These changes all resulted from the natural and gradual processes of accretion and erosion, which are rather pronounced in Red River. Its currents and channels shift from one side of its wide bed to the other, gradually cut away one bank and build up the other, and later on reverse that action. Where, as here, a boundary bank is changed by these processes the boundary, whether private or public, follows the change. Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606, 636\n, 43 S. Ct. 221; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n265 \nU.S. 493, 499\n, 44 S. Ct. 571.\n The necessary result of the two findings we have mentioned is that there was no public land between the Powell tract and the river to which the Durfee survey and patent could give any right.\n The next exception is to the master's conclusion that there was no sufficient evidence on which to invoke an estoppel against the assertion by Roberts and Britain of title to the strip in controversy or to the royalty interest arising therefrom.\n The grounds on which an estoppel is invoked are that Specht, from whom Roberts acquired the Powell tract, had theretofore made and distributed a plat of that tract, \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n along with others, whereupon it was represented as not extending to the river bank; that Roberts after getting the title made and distributed a plat with a like representation of the northern boundary; that Roberts pointed out to the Durfee Company and its predecessors as the northern boundary a line running south of the land in dispute; and that, acting upon those plats and Roberts' statement, the Durfee Company and its predecessors purchased the land in dispute from a claimant under the Durfee survey and paid a valuable consideration for it. The evidence bearing on the asserted estoppel is in several respects conflicting. It is fully and fairly reviewed by the master in his report and need not be restated here. The master concluded, and we agree with him, that as a whole the evidence shows that the Durfee Company and its predecessors purchased with full knowledge of the record title, including the surveyor's field notes before described; that the plats made by Specht and Roberts were too vague to have been relied upon as a representation of the nature or location of the northern boundary; that the conveyance from Specht to Roberts, which was part of the record title, described the Powell tract as extending to the meanders of the river; that the Durfee Company and its predecessors in purchasing did not in fact rely upon the Specht and Roberts plats or any statement of Roberts, but upon a report made by their attorneys based on the record title, including the field notes; and that the alleged statement by Roberts to them, if made, was made after they had purchased, gone into possession and paid the purchase price. In this situation the assertted estoppel must fail. Only where conduct or statements are calculated to mislead a party and are acted upon by him in good faith to his prejudice can he invoke them as a basis of such an estoppel. And if they relate to the title of real property 'where the condition of the title is known to both parties, or both have the same means of \n\n[268 U.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n ascertaining the truth, there can be no estoppel.'

He soon went to the land with a surveyor to run out his lines and make his claim known, but was prevented from doing so by an armed guard. With reasonable promptness he brought a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his rights. Proceedings in that suit were soon suspended by reason of this receivership, and he promptly asserted his claim here.\n An order will be entered overruling the exceptions, confirming the master's report and directing payment of the royalty interest to Roberts and Britain.

Ct. 376), in the above- entitled cause, we have run, located, and marked upon the ground the boundary between the states of Texas and Oklahoma along the Red river from the Big Bend Area westward to a southerly extension of the west line of range 16 west in Oklahoma, in accordance with the decree and the principles announced in the opinion delivered January 15, 1923 (\n260 \nU.S. 606\n, 43 S. Ct. 221), and in the manner stated in our report of April 25, 1924, on the Big Bend Area. We have called this portion of the boundary the 'Fort Augur Area.'\n The maps, which accompany and are made a part of this report, are identified as follows:\n Map No. 4. Cadastral map of the Texas and Oklahoma boundary, Fort Augur Area, scale 2,000 feet to the inch;\n Map No. 5.

Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for the State of Oklahoma.\n Messrs. C. W. Taylor, of Corsicana, Tex., and Orville Bullington and A. H. Carrigan, both of Wichita Falls, Tex., for the State of Texas.\n\n PER CURIAM. \n\n[267 U.S. 7, 8]\n\u00a0\n On consideration of the thirteenth report of the receiver herein the court makes the following orders:\n\n 1. \nThe receiver is instructed to pay the net proceeds derived from well 155, amounting to $4,514.47, to the Kirby Petroleum Company by way of partly reimbursing it for expense incurred by it or its predecessor in drilling that well prior to the receivership-such payment to be in full discharge of all possible claims against the receivership by reason of that work and expense.\n\n 2. \nThe receiver is instructed to pay a balance of $1,097.76 out of the net proceeds of well 156 to the Kirby Petroleum Company on its claim for expense incurred by it or its predecessor in drilling that well prior to the receivership-such payment to be in full discharge of all possible claims against the receivership by reason of that work and expense.\n\n 3. \nUnless within 40 days from this date Tom Testerman shall accept the moneys directed to be paid to him by paragraph 11 of the order of June 9, 1924, in discharge of the claim therein described, he shall be deemed to have abandoned that claim, and the moneys reserved to cover the same shall be paid over by the receiver to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United \n\n[267 U.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n States, as a part of the net impounded funds derived from the receiver's operations within the river bed area. The receiver is instructed to deliver or transmit forthwith to Tom Testerman a copy of this order.\n\n 4. \nUnless within 40 days from this date the operators who presented claims for reimbursement out of the proceeds of well 139 (known as the Burke-Senator well) for the cost of drilling that well prior to the receivership shall adjust the differences between them and accept reimbursement as contemplated in paragraph 13 of the order of June 9, 1924, they are directed to show cause, within five days after the expiration of that period, why those claims should not be denied and why the moneys reserved to cover them should not be paid over to the Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United States, as part of the net impounded funds derived from river bed wells. The receiver is instructed to deliver or transmit forthwith to such claimants copies of this order.\n\n 5. \nPursuant to a stipulation made and presented by the conflicting claimants thereto, the receiver is instructed to pay the balance of the net royalty interest in the proceeds of wells 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 109, and 119 to A. H. Carrigan, as the joint agent and trustee of such claimants, to the end that he, according to such stipulation, may deposit such moneys in the First National Bank of Wichita Falls, Tex., there to be held to await the outcome of litigation now pending in the courts of Texas to determine the rights of such claimants in such royalty interest.\n\n 6. \nPursuant to a stipulation made and presented by the conflicting claimants thereto, the receiver is instructed to pay to Rhea S. Nixon, receiver of the Southwest Petroleum Comapny and trustee of certain claimants, 27\/96 of the net balance of the operating interest in the proceeds of well 180 (after deducting the overriding royalty belonging to C. J. Ferguson), and also to pay to the Security \n\n[267 U.S. 7, 10]\n\u00a0\n National Bank of Wichita Falls, Texas, 1\/6 of the said balance-the 27\/96 to be held by Rhea S. Nixon, as receiver and trustee, to await the outcome of litigation now pending in the courts of Texas to determine the rights of those who are claiming interests therein, and the 1\/6 to be held by the Security National Bank to await the outcome of litigation now pending in those courts to determine the rights of those who are claiming interests therein.\n\n 7. \nThe motion of the state of Texas presented January 16, 1925, for leave to file a claim for a royalty or owner's interest in a part of the impounded funds in the receiver's custody is denied, because, as appears from the receiver's thirteenth report before mentioned, no claim thereto was presented by that state within the period prescribed by paragraph 18 of the order of June 9, 1924, because that period has long since expired, and because to permit such a claim by the state to be presented and entertained at this time would unreasonably prolong the receivership and would be inequitable to other claimants whose claims were seasonably presented.\n\n 8. \nThe several conflicting claims to impounded funds derived from wells 152, 153, 154, 157, 159, 160, 162, 165, 169, 170, and 172 presented to the receiver under paragraph 18 of the order of June 9, 1924, and reported in his thirteenth report before mentioned, are referred to Joseph M. Hill, Esq., of Ft. Smith, Ark., as a special master, with directions that such special master take the evidence bearing on such claims and report the same to the court, together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations in the premises, for the ultimate consideration and action of the court. The evidence shall be taken at Wichita Falls, Tex., and the taking thereof shall begin February 16, 1925, and shall proceed with reasonable expedition and be concluded not later than March 7, 1925. The report of the special master shall be \n\n[267 U.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n filed with the clerk within 30 days after the evidence is taken, and shall be printed by the clerk. Claimants shall have 15 days after the filing of the report within which to prepare, print, and file exceptions to it accompanied by supporting briefs. The special master shall have authority to issue subpoenas to secure the attendance of witnesses, and also authority to employ competent stenographic and clerical assistance. Claimants shall be permitted to introduce and use in evidence any documents or other instruments appearing in the printed records in this cause without procuring new exemplifications thereof or presenting other proof of their authenticity or identification. The special master shall receive an allowance covering his actual expenses and a reasonable compensation for his service. This allowance, together with the cost of his stenographic and clerical assistance and the cost of printing his report, shall be charged against and be borne by the several claimants in such proportions and in such manner as the court hereafter may direct. Each claimant, however, shall make to the clerk an advance payment of $50 towards such costs within 20 days from this date, and in default thereof the claimant shall be deemed to have abandoned his claim.\n\n 9. \nIf, before the time fixed for taking evidence under the last paragraph, the several conflicting claimants to any particular fund make and present to the receiver a stipulation adjusting their differences and settling their rights to such fund, or providing that the fund shall be paid over to a trustee of their selection to await an adjustment or adjudication of their claims through some medium other than this court, the receiver shall be authorized to give effect to such stipulation and to pay over the fund as therein provided, and the stipulation shall operate to withdraw the claims covered by it from the reference to the special master. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

RILEY(1925)\nNo. 227\nArgued: March 9, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 137, 138]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Carey Van Fleet, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. R. W. Smith, of Sacramento, Cal., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of California to review the determination of that court upholding the constitutionality of the Inheritance Tax Act of the state of California enacted in 1917 (St. 1917, p. 880), particularly subdivision 10 of section 2 of the act, which prescribes the \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 139]\n\u00a0\n method of determining the market value of the property transferred, for the purpose of fixing the amount of the tax. Subdivision 10 of section 2 reads as follows:\n'In determining the market value of the property transferred, no deduction shall be made for any inheritance tax or estate tax paid to the government of the United States.'\n\n The decedent left a gross estate exceeding $1,800,000, on which the federal estate tax amounted to the sum of $128,730.08. In fixing the amount of inheritance tax due to the state of California upon the residuary legacies, the state tax appraiser, acting pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 10 of section 2, did not deduct the amount of federal estate tax. In consequence the total amount of state tax assessed upon the residuary estate was $37,699.30 greater than it would have been, had the federal estate tax been deducted from the residuum of the estate before fixing the amount of the state tax. The superior court of San Francisco county, having jurisdiction in the premises, confirmed the tax, and the Supreme Court of California, on writ of error, held that the tax was in accordance with the laws and the Constitution of California, and was not a denial of due process or equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Stebbins v. Riley, 191 Cal. 591, 217 P. 1073\n\n\n It is urged here that the California Inheritance Tax Act of 1917 is a succession tax; that the provision of the taxing law requiring that there shall be no deduction of the federal tax in fixing the fair value of the legacy on which the state tax is levied is an arbitrary discrimination, bearing no relation either to the persons succeeding to the decedent's estate or to the amount which the taxpayer taxes by succession; and that it is accordingly a taking of property without due process of law, and because of the inequalities in the amount of the tax resulting \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 140]\n\u00a0\n from the application of the taxing statute to successions there is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. On the other hand, it is urged that the so-called 'right' of acquiring property by devise or descent is not a property right, but a mere privilege, the creature of state law, and the authority which confers it may impose conditions upon its exercise; that in consequence the state may tax the privilege, discriminating not only between the status of those who inherit and the amounts which they thus acquire, but discriminating likewise between inheritances or legacies of like amount which are transmitted from estates of varying size, if the discrimination is based upon or bears some reasonable relation to the size of the whole estate transmitted on the death of the decedent. In presenting this aspect of the case, it was argued by the appellant on the one hand that there was a natural right to inheritance entitled to the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and by the appellee on the other that the legislative authority could deny wholly the privilege of inheritance, and consequently could place unlimited burdens upon it.\n There is much in judicial opinion to suggest that a state may impose any condition it chooses on the privilege of taking property by will or descent, or, indeed, that it may abolish that privilege altogether, and for this reason that a state is untrammeled in its power to tax the privilege. See Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, at page 55, 20 S. Ct. 747; Campbell v. California, \n200 U.S. 87\n, at page 94, 26 S. Ct. 182.\n But we do not find it necessary to discuss the issue thus raised, for it has been repeatedly held by this court that the power of testamentary disposition and the privilege of inheritance are subject to state taxation and state regulation and that regulatory taxing provisions, even though they produce inequalities in taxation, do not effect an unconstitutional taking of property, unless as \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 141]\n\u00a0\n was said in Dane v. Jackson, \n256 \nU.S. 589, 599\n, 41 S. Ct. 566, 568 (65 L. Ed. 1107) the taxing statute 'results in such flagrant and palpable inequality between the burden imposed and the benefit received, as to amount to the arbitrary taking of property without compensation-'to spoliation under the guise of exerting the power of taxing,\" citing Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n137 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Ct. 533; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City, \n173 \nU.S. 592, 615\n, 19 S. Ct. 553; Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 220\n, 36 S. Ct. 66.\n The subject-matter of an inheritance taxing statute may be either the transmission or the exercise of the legal power of transmission of property by will or descent (United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625, 629\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115, 125\n, 20 S. Ct. 829; New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660), or it may be the legal privilege of taking property by devise or descent (Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283\n, 18 S. Ct. 594; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; Campbell v. California, \n200 \nU.S. 87\n, 26 S. Ct. 182).\n Even assuming that a state does not, under the Constitution of the United States, possess unlimited power to curtail the power of disposition of property at death or the privilege of receiving it by way of inheritance, there is nevertheless no constitutional guaranty of equality of taxation. The power of the states to discriminate in fixing the amount and incidence of taxation upon inheritances is undoubted. A state may levy a tax upon the power to dispose of property by will, graduated by the size of the legacy, and it may grant exemptions. See Plummer v. Coler, supra; Keeney v. Comptroller of N. Y. \n222 \nU.S. 525\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139. It may discriminate between property which has not borne its full share of taxation in the testator's lifetime and other property passing to the same class of transferees. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122\n, 41 S. Ct. 43. It may fix a graduated succession tax, even though the amount of tax assessed does not vary in proportion \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 142]\n\u00a0\n to the amount of the legacy received by persons of the same class. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, supra. It may fix a succession tax which imposes a tax upon inheritances to brothers and sisters and not on those to daughters-in-law and sons-in-law. Campbell v. California, supra.\n The guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment of the equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality of operation or application of state legislation upon all citizens of a state. As was said in Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, supra, at page 293 (18 S. Ct. 598):\n'It only prescribes that that law have the attribute of equality of operation, and equality of operation does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to their relations. In some circumstances it may not tax A. more than B., but if A. be of a different trade or profession than B., it may. ... In other words, the state may distinguish, select, and classify objects of legislation, and necessarily this power must have a wide range of discretion.'\n\n The taxing statute may therefore make a classification for purposes of fixing the amount or incidence of the tax, provided only that all persons subjected to such legislation within the classification are treated with equality and provided further that the classification itself be rested upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, supra; F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412\n, 40 S. Ct. 560.\n'It may, if it chooses, exempt certain classes of property from any taxation at all, such as churches, libraries, and the property of charitable institutions. It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and may vary the rates of excise upon various products; it may tax real estate and personal property in a different manner; it may tax visible property only, \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 143]\n\u00a0\n and not tax securities for payment of money; it may allow deductions for indebtedness, or not allow them. All such regulations, and those of like character, so long as they proceed within reasonable limits and general usage, are within the discretion of the state legislature or the people of the state in framing their Constitution.' Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 U.S. 232\n, at page 237, 10 S. Ct. 533, 535 (33 L. Ed. 892).\n\n It is not necessary that the basis of classification should be deducible from the nature of the thing classified. It is enough that the classification is reasonably founded in the 'purposes and policies of taxation.' Watson v. Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122\n, 41 S. Ct. 43. It is not open to objection unless it precludes the assumption that the classification was made in the exercise of legislative judgment and discretion. Campbell v. California, supra.\n Unquestionably the operation of subdivision 10 of section 2 of the California Inheritance Act of 1917 now under consideration may result in inequalities in the incidence of taxation. The requirement that the federal estate tax shall not be deducted in fixing the state inheritance tax imposes a much larger proportionate tax on the succession to a residuum of a large estate than a smaller estate, although the residuary estate and the residuary legacy be equal in each instance.\n The plaintiffs in error base their argument that this is a denial of the equal protection of the laws on the assumption that the California inheritance tax must be dealt with exclusively as a tax upon succession, and that since the privilege of receiving residuary legacies of like amounts by persons of like relationship is subjected to unequal taxation, the inequality depending upon the size of the estate from which the legacy is received, there is an arbitrary discrimination and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. It is true that the inheritance tax law of California in force before the adoption of the law of 1917 repealing it, was held by the Supreme Court of \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 144]\n\u00a0\n California to be a succession tax. Estate of Miller, 184 Cal. 678, 195 P. 413, 16 A. L. R. 694. That statute contained no express provision prohibiting the deduction of federal estate taxes before fixing the state tax on legacies, and that court held, adopting the principle of construction applied in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, that the true effect of the California Inheritance Tax Act, being that of a tax on succession, the federal tax must be deducted in order to determine the amount on which the state tax should be based. It is true, too, that the California Inheritance Tax Act of 1917 provides for a graduated tax dependent upon the size of the legacy and discriminates between different classes of persons receiving the legacy, provisions which are characteristic of laws levying the tax upon successions. But section 2 of that act expressly imposes the tax 'upon the transfer of any property' of the character described in the act, and subdivision 3 of section 1 of the act provides that the word 'transfer' as used in this act shall be 'taken to include the passing of property or any interest therein' in the manner provided in the act. Subdivision 10 of section 2, which is new, in its practical operation, makes the amount of the tax dependent to some extent upon the amount of the decedent's estate which passes, since the federal estate tax which under that provision may not be deducted in fixing the state tax is assessed upon the whole estate. To that extent the statute establishes a classification based on the amount of the estate passing under the power of disposition at the time of death as well as the classification, based upon the amount of the legacy received, contained in other provisions of the taxing law.\n There are two elements in every transfer of a decedent's estate; the one is the exercise of the legal power to transmit at death; the other is the privilege of succession. Each, as we have seen, is the subject of taxation. The incidents which attach to each, as we have observed, \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 145]\n\u00a0\n may be made the basis of classification. We can perceive no reason why both may not be made the basis of classification in a single taxing statute so that the amount of tax which the legatee shall pay may be made to depend both on the total net amount of the decedent's estate subject to the jurisdiction of the state and passing under its inheritance and testamentary laws and the amount of the legacy to which the legatee succeeds under those laws. Such a classification is not, on its face, unreasonable. The discrimination is one which bears a substantial relationship to the exercise of the power of disposition by the testator. It is one of the elements in the transfer which is made the subject of taxation. The adoption of the discrimination does not preclude the assumption that the Legislature, in enacting the taxing statute, did not act arbitrarily or without the exercise of judgment or discretion which rightfully belong to it, and we can find in it no basis for holding the statue unconstitutional.\n It is urged by appellants that the decision of this court in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, is in conflict with the conclusion here reached. We do not so read the opinion in that case. It was there held that an act of Congress fixing a graduated tax upon legacies was within the taxing power of the United States. In construing that law, however, the question arose whether the progressive rate of tax which it imposed upon legacies or distributive shares of decedent's estate, should be measured, not separately by the amount of each legacy or distributive share, but by the total amount of the estate transmitted. This court held that, inasmuch as the statute laid down no express rule determining the question, it would adopt the construction which produced the least inconvenience and inequality to taxpayers and that the tax should therefore be measured and apportioned according to the amount of each individual legacy rather than the amount of the whole estate. The question was one of construction only \n\n[268 U.S. 137, 146]\n\u00a0\n and not of constitutional power. Here the construction of the taxing act is not open to question. Its meaning and application have been determined by the Supreme Court of California and by its determination we are bound. We hold that in enacting it the Legislature did not exceed its constitutional power.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTEELE v. U S(1925)\nNo. 235\nArgued: March 11, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Meyer Kraushaar, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. James M. Beck, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Mahlon D. Kiefer, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under section 238 of the Judicial Code,1 direct from the District Court, being a case involving the application of the federal Constitution. The judgment complained of denied a petition of Steele for an order vacating a search warrant, by authority of which Steele's premises were searched and a large amount of whisky and other intoxicating liquor was found and seized. He contends that the search warrant violated the Fourth Amendment, because not issued upon probable cause, and not particularly describing the place to be searched or the property to be seized, and because the search conducted under the warrant was unreasonable. The affidavit for search warrant was as follows:\n'Southern District of New York-ss.:\n\n'Isidor Einstein, being duly sworn, deposes and says: I am a general prohibition agent assigned to duty in \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n the state of New York. On December 6, 1922, at about 10 o'clock a. m., accompanied by Agent Moe W. Smith, I was standing in front of the garage located in the building at 611 West Forty-Sixth street, Borough of Manhattan, city and Southern district of New York. This building is used for business purposes only. I saw a small truck driven into the entrance of the garage, and I saw the driver unload from the end of the truck a number of cases of stenciled whisky. They were the size and appearance of whisky cases and I believe that they contained whisky. A search of the records of the federal prohibition director's office fails to disclose any permit for the manufacture, sale, or possession of intoxicating liquors at the premises above referred to.\n\n'The said premises are within the Southern district of New York, and upon information and belief have thereon a quantity of intoxicating liquor containing more than one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol by volume, and fit for use for beverage purposes, which is used, has been used, and is intended for use, in violation of the statute of the United States, to wit, the National Prohibition Act.\n\n'This affidavit is made to procure a search warrant, to search said building at the above address, any building or rooms connected or used in connection with said garage, the basement or subcellar beneath the same, and to seize all intoxicating liquors found therein.\n\n'Isidor Einstein.\n\n'Sworn to before me this 6th day of December, 1922. Saml. M. Hitchcock, U. S. Commissioner, Southern District of New York.'\n\n The search warrant issued by the commissioner followed the affidavit in the description of the place and property to be searched and seized and was directed to Einstein as general prohibition agent.\n Section 25, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305, 315, c. 85 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 m]) provides for the issue of a search \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n warrant to seize liquor and its containers intended for use in violating the act, and provides that the search warrant shall be issued as provided in title 2 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, 228, c. 30 [ Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10496 1\/4 a-10496 1\/4 v]).\n Under that title, in conformity with the Fourth Amendment the warrant can be issued only upon probable cause, supported by affidavit, particularly describing the property and place to be searched. The judge or commissioner must before issuing the warrant examine on oath the complainant and any witness he may produce, and require their affidavits or take their depositions in writing and cause them to be subscribed by the parties making them. The affidavits or depositions must set forth the facts tending to establish the grounds of the application or probable cause for believing that they exist. If the judge or commissioner is satisfied of the existence of the grounds for the application, or that there is probable cause to believe their existence, he must issue a search warrant, signed by him with his name of office, to a civil officer of the United States duly authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof, stating the particular grounds or probable cause for its issue and the names of the persons whose affidavits have been taken in support thereof, and commanding him forthwith to search the person or place named, for the property specified, and to bring it before the judge or commissioner. If the grounds on which the warrant was issued be controverted, the judge or commissioner must proceed to take testimony in relation thereto, and the testimony of each witness must be reduced to writing and subscribed by each witness. If it appears that the property taken is not the same as that described in the warrant, or that there is no probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued, the judge or commissioner must cause the property to be restored to the person from whom it was taken; but if it appears that the \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n property taken is the same as that described in the warrant, and that there is probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued, then the judge or commissioner shall order the same retained in the custody of the person seizing or to be otherwise disposed of according to law.\n The facts developed before the commissioner on hearing this petition for return of the seized goods were these: Einstein and Moe Smith were prohibition agents. They saw a truck depositing cases in a garage on the opposite side of Forty-Sixth street from where they were. Einstein crossed the street and saw they were cases stenciled as whisky. Einstein left his companion to remain in the neighborhood until he could get the warrant, and in something more than an hour returned with it and made the seizure. The building searched was a four-story building in New York City on the south side of West Forty-Sixth street, with a sign on it 'Indian Head Auto Truck Service-Indian Head Storage Warehouse, No. 609 and 611.' It was all under lease to Steele. It was entered by three entrances from the street, one on the 609 side, which is used, and which leads to a staircase running up to the four floors. On the 611 side there is another staircase of a similar character, which is closed, and in the middle of the building is an automobile entrance from the street into a garage, and opposite to the entrance on the south side is an elevator reaching to the four stories of sufficient size to take up a Ford machine. There is no partition between 611 and 609 on the ground or garage floor, and there were only partial partitions above, and none which prevented access to the elevator on any floor from either the 609 or 611 side. The evidence left no doubt that, though the building had two numbers, the garage business covering the whole first floor and the storage business above were of such a character and so related to the elevator that there was no real \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n division in fact or in use of the building into separate halves. The places searched and in which the liquor was found were all rooms connected with the garage by the elevator. One of them was a room on the second floor with a door open toward the elevator, in which, when Einstein made his search, three men were bottling and corking whisky. There was a room on one of the floors, flimsily boarded off, in which an employee had a cot and a cook stove. The prohibition agent seized 150 cases of whisky, 92 bags of whisky, and one 5-gallon can of alcohol on the third floor on the 609 side. On the second floor, 33 cases of gin were seized on the 609 side, and six 5-gallon jugs of whisky, 33 cases of gin, 102 quarts of whisky, and two 50-gallon barrels of whisky, and a corking machine were taken on the 611 side of the building.\n The description of the building as a garage and for business purposes as 611 West Forty-Sixth street clearly indicated the whole building as the place intended to be searched. It is enough if the description is such that the officer with a search warrant can, with reasonable effort ascertain and identify the place intended. Rothlisberger v. United States ( C. C. A.) 289 F. 72; United States v. Borkowski (D. C.) 268 F. 408, 411; Commonwealth v. Dana, 2 Metc. (Mass.) 329, 336; Metcalf v. Weed, 66 N. H. 176, 19 A. 1091; Rose v. State, 171 Ind. 662, 87 N. E. 103, 17 Ann. Cas. 228; McSherry v. Heimer, 132 Minn. 260, 156 N. W. 130.\n Nor did the search go too far. A warrant was applied for to search any building or rooms connected or used in connection with the garage, or the basement or subcellar beneath the same. It is quite evident that the elevator of the garage connected it with every floor and room in the building and was intended to be used with it.\n The attempt to give the building the character of a dwelling house by reason of the fact that an employee slept and cooked in a room on one of the floors was of \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n course futile. Section 25 of the Prohibition Act forbids the search of any private dwelling unless it is used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, or unless it is in part used for some business purpose, such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel or boarding house. It provides that 'private dwelling' is to be construed to include the room or rooms used and occupied, not transiently, but solely as a residence in an apartment house, hotel, or boarding house. Certainly the room occupied in this case was not a private dwelling within these descriptions, but, more than this, it was not searched and no liquor was found in it. Forni v. United States ( C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 354.\n The search warrant properly described the building searched as a garage and one for business purposes.\n Then it is said that the property seized was not sufficiently identified in the warrant. It was described as 'cases of whisky,' and while there is no evidence specifically identifying the particular cases which were seized as those which Einstein saw the description as 'cases of whisky' is quite specific enough. Elrod v. Moss (C. C. A. 4th) 278 F. 123, 129; Sutton v. United States, 289 F. 488 (C. C. A. 5th); Tynan v. United States, 297 F. 177 (C. C. A. 9th); Forni v. United States, 3 F.(2d) 354 (C. C. A. 9th).\n Finally it is said there was no probable cause for the warrant and the seizure, Einstein, a man of experience in such prosecutions and in such seizures, saw the name 'whisky' stenciled on cases and said they looked like whisky cases. He ascertained by his own investigation of the official records that there was no permit for the legal storage of whisky on these premises. In a recent case we have had occasion to lay down what is probable cause for a search. Carroll v. United States, \n267 U.S. 132\n, 45  Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. --, decided March 2, 1925. 'If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant a man of prudence and caution in \n\n[267 U.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n believing that the offense has been committed, it is sufficient.' What Einstein saw and ascertained was quite sufficient to warrant a man of prudence and caution and his experience in believing that the offense had been committed of possessing illegally whisky and intoxicating liquor and that it was in the building he described.\n The search warrant fully complied with the statutory and constitutional requirements as set forth above, the liquor was lawfully seized and the District Court rightly held that it should not be returned.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.

Gen., of Washington, D. C., Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Mr. Mahlon D. Kiefer, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1215) to a conviction in the District Court of John F. Steele on an information in the District Court for unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly possessing a quantity of intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 et seq.). The prosecution grew out of the seizure of whisky and gin upon a search warrant at 611 West Forty-Sixth street, New York City, the validity of which we have had occasion to examine in the case just preceding. The question here is as to the competency of the evidence of seizure under the search warrant which we there found sufficient. In addition to the grounds urged in the last case, the validity of seizure is attacked because the search warrant was issued to a general prohibition agent, when under section 6 of title 11 of the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 217, 228, c. 30 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp 1919,  10496 1\/4 f]), such a warrant must be issued 'to a civil officer of the United States duly authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof.'\n The argument is that the prohibition agent is appointed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and therefore is only an employee and not a civil officer of the government in the constitutional sense, because such an officer under article 2, section 2, of the Constitution \n\n[267 U.S. 505, 507]\n\u00a0\n can only be appointed either by the President and the Senate, the President alone, the courts of law, or the heads of departments.\n It should first be said that Steele is not in a position to raise this question. He might have raised it in the preceding case, but he did not do so, and did not assign error on account of it in his appeal to this court. The refusal to vacate the search warrant and to return the liquor seized was a final decree. The question is therefore res judicata as against him.\n But, even if this were not so, we do not think the objection well taken. We think that the expression 'civil officer of the United States duly authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof,' as used in the Espionage Act, does not mean an officer in the constitutional sense, that Congress in incorporating the provision in section 26, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 mm) did not so construe it, and had no intention thus to limit persons authorized to receive and serve search warrants. It is quite true that the words 'officer of the United States,' when employed in the statutes of the United States, is to be taken usually to have the limited constitutional meaning. Burnap v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 512\n, 40 S. Ct. 374; United States v. Mouat, \n124 \nU.S. 303\n, 8 S. Ct. 505; United States v. Smith, \n124 \nU.S. 525\n, 8 S. Ct. 595. But we find that this court, in consideration of the context, has sometimes given it an enlarged meaning, and has found it to include others than those appointed by the President, heads of departments, and courts. United States v Hendee, \n124 \nU.S. 309\n, 8 S. Ct. 507. The emphasis of the words of description in the Espionage Act is really on the limitations that the person designated shall be a civil and not a military agent of the government, and shall be one 'duly authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law of the United States.' It is not to be supposed that Congress wished to exclude from those empowered to receive and execute \n\n[267 U.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n search warrants persons usually called officers who are in their duties most widely employed to enforce or assist in enforcing laws. Thus deputy marshals of the United States are appointed by the United States marshal under whom they serve (section 780, Revised Statutes [Comp. St.  1304]), and he and his deputies have in each state the same power in executing the laws of the United States as the sheriffs and their deputies in such state in executing the laws thereof. The deputy marshal is not in the constitutional sense an officer of the United States, and yet marshals, and deputy marshals are the persons chiefly charged with the enforcement of the peace of the United States, as that is embraced in the enforcement of federal law. In re Neagle, \n135 \nU.S. 1, 68\n, 69 S., 10 S. Ct. 658. A deputy marshal is engaged in serving all sorts of writs, and is called upon to exercise great responsibility and discretion in the service of some of them, in dealing with the person and property of individuals and in the preservation of their constitutional rights. The same thing may be said of deputy collectors of customs. Under section 2630 (Comp. St.  5368), a collector of customs, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may employ within his district such number of proper persons, as deputy collectors of customs as he shall deem necessary, and such deputies are declared to be officers of the customs, and the collector may exercise his powers and perform his duties by deputy. And one of the chief functions of the collector of customs and of the deputy collectors is the seizure of goods which have not paid a tax, as seen by chapter 10 of title 34 of the Revised Statutes (sections 3058-3094 [Comp. St.  5760-5794]). Deputy collectors of internal revenue are to be appointed by the collector of internal revenue. Section 3148, R. S. He may appoint as many as he thinks proper. Each deputy is to have the like authority which by law is vested in the collector himself, and distraint and seizure in the assessment and collection of taxes are authorized by chapter 2, title 35. \n\n[267 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n The National Prohibition Act, in title 1, section 5 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/4 e), reads:\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, his assistants, agents, and inspectors, and all other officers of the United States whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws, shall have all the power for the enforcement of the War Prohibition Act or any provisions thereof which is conferred by law for the enforcement of existing laws relating to the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors under the laws of the United States.'\n\n Title 2, section 28 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 o) is:\n'The Commissioner, his assistants, agents, and inspectors, and all other officers of the United States, whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws, shall have all the power ... in the enforcement of this act or any provisions thereof which is conferred by law for the enforcement of existing laws relating to the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors under the law of the United States.'\n\n Section 3462 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6364) is one of the laws thus referred to in the foregoing sections, and provides:\n'That the several judges of the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, and commissioners of the Circuit Courts, may, within their respective jurisdictions, issue a search warrant, authorizing any internal revenue officer to search any premises within the same, if such officer makes oath in writing that he has reason to believe, and does believe, that a fraud upon the revenue has been or is being committed upon or by the use of the said premises.'\n\n Again, title 2, section 1, of the Prohibition Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2), reads:\n'Any act authorized to be done by the commissioner may be performed by any assistant or agent designated by him for that purpose.'\n\n Again, title 2, section 26 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10138 1\/2 mm ), reads:\n'When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors \n\n[267 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law.'\n\n The foregoing would seem to indicate that lawful seizures were not to be confined to constitutional officers.\n Again, in section 6 of the act supplemental to the National Prohibition Act (42 Stat. 223 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10184a]), it is provided that any officer, agent or employee of the United States engaged in the enforcement of this act or the National Prohibition Act, or any other law of the United States, who shall search any private dwelling as defined in the National Prohibition Act, without a warrant directing such search, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n This justifies an inference that Congress expected searches to be made with search warrants by officers, agents, or employees.\n The question whether a prohibition agent has the power and right to serve a search warrant as provided in the Espionage Act, and section 25 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, has led to some difference of opinion among the judges of the Circuit Courts of Appeal and also of the District Courts, but the weight of authority as indicated by the decisions is strongly in favor of the broader construction which vests the power and duty to receive and serve a search warrant in prohibition agents appointed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Raine v. United States, 299 F. 407 (C. C. A. 9th); Keehn v. United States, 300 F. 493 (C. C. A. 1st); United States v. American Brewing Co. (D. C.) 296 F. 772; United States v. O'Connor (D. C.) 294 F. 584; United States v. Syrek (D. C.) \n290 U.S. 820\n; United States v. Keller (D. C.) 288 F. 204.\n The second question which is raised here by proper exception and assignment is whether the defendant had the right to have submitted to the jury the issue of fact \n\n[267 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n whether there was probable cause to issue the warrant, with direction that if the jury found that there was not probable cause, it should ignore the evidence resulting from the seizure and acquit the defendant. There are two answers to this assignment of error. One has already been referred to, that the fact of the existence of probable cause in the issue of the search warrant was res judicata, made so by the judgment of the court in the case preceding that the property could not be returned to Steele. The second answer is that the question of the competency of the evidence of the whisky by reason of the legality or otherwise of its seizure was a question of fact and law for the court and not for the jury.

Dodd, of Louisville, Ky., for defendant in error. \n\n[267 U.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover damages for breach of a contract to purchase 80,000 pounds of Badex, a foodstuff. The defendant demurred because, as it alleged, the petition showed that the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, did not exceed the sum of $3,000, and the action was dismissed by the District Court on that ground. Judicial Code,  24 (Comp. St.  991). The case comes here on that single question, as determining the jurisdiction of the District Court.\n The material allegations are that the agreed price was $5,800; that at the time of the breach no price could be got for the goods and that they had no value then in the market or elsewhere; that upon the breach the plaintiffs took possession of them as their own, and that nearly a year later they sold the same as their own to third persons for $4,521.95, but it is expressly denied that the plaintiffs sold on behalf of the defendant. The position of the defendant is that the price realized, even if diminished by transportation charges of $620.45, must be deducted from the contract price and leaves less than $3,000. We presume that the District Court took the same view although its opinion referred to in the judgment is not printed as it should have been. Rule 8. But obviously the plaintiffs have a claim that cannot be dismissed as absurd, and on which they are entitled to the judgment of the Court. Their allegations are that on the unjustified refusal of the defendant to accept the Badex they rescinded the transaction, and they argue that when they did so their rights against the defendant became fixed and that what they may have done a year afterwards was wholly their own affair. The cases where instead of rescinding the seller sells for the buyer's account have no application. The breach of contract occurred in Louisville, Kentucky, where possibly the contract was made. If the case is governed \n\n[267 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n by the law of that State, as to which it would be premature to express an opinion, we infer that the plaintiffs' argument probably would be regarded as correct.

KIRTLEY(1925)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 163, 164]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward W. Knight and Harold A. Ritz, both of Charleston, W. Va., for appellants.\n Mr. J. H. McClintic, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants brought this suit in equity in the District Court to set aside certain proceedings in a Circuit Court of West Virginia, whose validity they challenged, inter alia, for repugnancy to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The bill was dismissed by the District Court, upon defendants' motion, without opinion. This direct appeal was allowed, March 31, 1924, under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1215).\n The case made by the bill and exhibits is this: The plaintiffs are nonresidents of West Virginia. Four of them claim to be the owners of certain undivided interests in lands in Nicholas county, West Virginia, conveyed to them by deeds from their coplaintiff W. B. Stephenson, executed in good faith and for valuable considerations. The defendant Cawley, a creditor of W. B. Stephenson holding unsatisfied judgments against him, brought a suit in equity against the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of the county to set aside the deeds as fraudulent and sell the lands to satisfy the judgments. The plaintiffs were proceeded against as nonresidents, by an order of publication, without personal service of process. An order of attachment was also issued and levied upon the lands. The plaintiffs not having appeared within the time required by the order of publication, a decree nisi was entered and set for hearing; and thereafter a decree was \n\n[269 U.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n entered adjudging that the deeds from W. B. Stephenson were made to defraud his creditors, setting the same aside as to the debt to Cawley, and directing a sale of the lands in satisfaction of the judgments. They were purchased by the defendants Kirtley and Herold at the commissioners' sale. This sale was confirmed by a subsequent decree; and a deed was executed by the commissioners to the purchasers, who entered into possession of the lands. The plaintiffs, who under the laws of West Virginia were allowed to appear and make defense to the suit within two years from the date of the final decree, had no knowledge of these proceedings until after this time had expired.\n The bill alleged that these proceedings were null and void: First, because the Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to enter the decrees, since under the laws of West Virginia the order of attachment upon which its jurisdiction depended was void and conferred no jurisdiction for the reason that the affidavit upon which it was based lacked the required certainty and was invalid; and second, because under the law of West Virginia there can be no valid decree in a suit in which no personal service has been had without proof of the facts upon which it rests, and the court was without jurisdiction to enter the decree, setting aside the deeds and ordering the sale, for the reason that no proof was offered that the deeds were fraudulent.\n The bill further alleged that the action of the Circuit Court in adjudging that the deeds were fraudulent, without personal service of process or hearing any evidence or having any trial upon the question, and decreeing the sale of the lands, was a denial of due process of law to the plaintiffs in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it prayed that the decrees directing and confirming the sale of the lands and the commissioners' deed thereto, be decreed to be null and void; that the cloud arising therefrom upon their title be removed; and that they be adjudged to be the owners of the lands.\n\n\n[269 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n 1. Assuming, without deciding, that notwithstanding the constructive service of process by the order of publication, the jurisdiction of the court over the lands depended upon the attachment, we find no invalidity in the affidavit on which the order of attachment issued. The statute merely requires the affidavit to state 'the nature of the plaintiff's claim.' Barnes' West Virginia Code, c. 106,  1, p. 1995. Here, after stating generally the nature of the claim, it set forth with reasonable certainty and the particularity of fact necessary to show a cause of action, the unpaid judgments held by Cawley against W. B. Stephenson upon which the claim was based. This was sufficient. Flannigan v. Tie Co., 77 W. Va. 158, 159, 87 S. E. 165. Furthermore, where a writ of attachment has been issued and levied, the preliminary affidavit has served its purpose, and even though it be defective and an appellate court might find in it sufficient error to reverse the judgment, this does not deprive the court of the jurisdiction acquired by the levy of the writ. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 319; Ludlow v. Ramsey, 11 Wall. 581, 588; Miller v. White, 46 W. Va. 67, 71, 33 S. E. 332, 76 Am. St. Rep. 791; McIntosh v. Oil Co., 47 W. Va. 832, 837, 35 S. E. 860.\n\n 2. \nIt is recited in the decree of sale that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court 'from the papers and evidence' that the deeds from W. B. Stephenson were made to defraud his creditors. The present suit is a collateral proceeding to set aside the sale made by the Circuit Court, Ludlow v. Ramsey, supra, page 587, a court of general jurisdiction; and the recitals in its decree, which import verity, cannot be drawn in question herein. Ballard v. Hunter, \n204 \nU.S. 241, 265\n, 27 S. Ct. 261. Furthermore, as the court had acquired jurisdiction by the levy of the writ of attachment and a decree nisi had been entered upon the order of publication, a failure to hear proof before adjudging that the deeds were fraudulent and ordering the sale, would neither have deprived the court of its jurisdiction \n\n[269 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n nor constituted a denial of due process. The allegations of the complaint might be established either by the introduction of proof or by admission through the default; and error or irregularity in this respect would neither constitute ground for setting aside the decree which the court had acquired jurisdiction to render, nor take from it the attribute of due process. Ballard v. Hunter, supra, pages 250, 258 (27 S. Ct. 261).\n\n 3. \nThis disposes of all the grounds upon which the validity of the proceedings was challenged by the bill. We therefore neither consider other matters urged in the appellants' brief relating to the alleged invalidity of the order of publication, nor the defense of good faith purchase relied upon in the brief of appellees. We find no want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court by reason of the matters alleged in the bill, nor want of due process invalidating the proceedings under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The decree of the District Court is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTILZ v. UNITED STATES(1925)\nNo. 38\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry B. Stilz, pro se.\n Mr. John W. Loveland, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[269 U.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the court.\n Plaintiff brought this action, under the Act of Congress approved July 1, 1918, c. 114 (40 Stat. 705), to recover compensation for the use and manufacture, by or for the Navy Department, of certain oil burners alleged to infringe patents 945,873 and 1,066,161, granted him January 11, 1910, and July 1, 1913, respectively. The Court of Claims filed findings of fact and conclusion of law (59 Ct. Cl. 21), and adjudged that plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\n The substance of the findings in respect of the prior art, the burners covered by plaintiff's patents, and the burners manufactured and used by the United States and alleged to be infringements, may be indicated briefly. Each of these patents was for improvements in oil burners. In order successfully to be used for fuel, oil must be atomized to permit its mixture with the proper amount of air for combustion. In the prior art to which plaintiff's patents relate, there were numerous structures disclosed by patents and publications referred to in the findings, including two types of burners in use, and known, respectively, as mechanical atomizers and steam atomizers. In the former, the oil is atomized by means purely mechanical. It is projected under heavy pressure from the burner into the furnace in a whirling cone-shaped film, which almost immediately develops into fine spray. In the latter, there is a combination with the oil, while yet within the burner proper, of a stream of steam, air, or other gaseous fluid under pressure for the purpose of aiding the atomization. In both, air for combustion is admitted through a surrounding register, and is more or less intimately intermixed with the oil spray.\n The burner covered by patent 945,873 provides for the use of steam, air, or other gaseous fluid under pressure to aid in atomization of the oil. The oil, under heavy pres- \n\n[269 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n sure, is discharged tangentially into the annular space of the nozzle between the outer casing and center plug, thus giving the oil a rotary motion in the nozzle. The steam or other fluid, under heavy pressure is also discharged tangentially into this space in the same direction as the oil with which it rotates; and thus aids in atomizing the oil, which issues from the orifice of the nozzle at a high velocity through an air register and into the furnace in a cone-shaped filmand spray. Air for combustion is supplied through the register, and mixes with the oil spray in it and in the furnace.\n The burner covered by patent 1,066,161 also provides for the use of steam, air, or other gaseous fluids under pressure as an aid in the atomization of the oil. This device includes an annular space between inner and outer casings of the nozzle. The oil and steam are not brought together until after the oil, under heavy pressure, is forced through a spiral and orifice into the front of this space in a rapidly rotating cone- shaped film. The steam, air, or other fluid passes through a pipe under heavy pressure, and is discharged tangentially into this space, rotating towards the outer orifice in a whirling layer. The oil leaving the inner orifice is struck by the rotating steam before it passes through the outer orifice. Air for combustion is supplied through a circular register attached to the front of the furnace, through the center of which the oil is projected from the nozzle into the furnace in a cone-shaped spray. The air flows around the oil spray and mixes with it in the register and in the furance, where combustion takes place.\n The type and character of the oil burners and equipment manufactured and used by the United States, and which are alleged by plaintiff to infringe his patents, are indicated by the findings. These oil burners and equipment provide for the atomization of the oil by means of its projection into the furnace under heavy pressure \n\n[269 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n through spiral passages in the nozzle of the burner in a whirling cone- shaped film which almost immediately upon leaving the nozzle develops into fine spray. The air for combustion is furnished under mild blower pressure in the furnace room, through an air register surrounding The burner and burner opening into the furnace. The register is provided with vanes or other means for giving the air a whirling motion to facilitate the intermixture with the oil spray. The oil and air are whirled together in the same direction. No steam, air, or other gaseous fluid is introduced into or used in the burner proper for any purpose, nor used with any part of the equipment for the atomization of the oil. The air, which passes through the register encircling the burner, is to supply oxygen necessary for combustion.\n From the findings, it clearly appears that the mixing of the steam, air, or other gaseous fluid with the oil in the annular space to aid atomization before the spray is brought into contact with the air supplied for combustion, and before it passes into the furnace, is the important feature distinguishing the burners covered by plaintiff's patents from those above described which are manufactured and used by the United States. The Court of Claims expressly found:\n'It does not appear that any of the devices of the plaintiff's said letters patent No. 945,873 and No. 1,066,161 have been manufactured or used by the United States, or that said letters patent have been infringed by the United States.'\n\n Infringement is a question of fact. The quoted finding is in the nature of special verdict of a jury. United States v. Anciens Etablissements, \n224 \nU.S. 309, 322\n, 330 S., 32 S. Ct. 479; Brothers v.

United States, \n173 \nU.S. 79, 80\n, 19 S. Ct. 330. And, even where a finding determines a mixed question of law and fact, it is conclusive unless the \n\n[269 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n court is able to separate the question to see whether there is a mistake of law.

Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 aa), that the word 'enemy' should be deemed to mean and include, for the purpose of the act, 'any ... corporation ... incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within' the 'territory (including \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation with which the United States is at war.' The plaintiff's petition admitted that at the time of the seizure the plaintiff was doing business in Germany, and was then an ememy of the United States under the definition, and that the seizure was lawful. It is further conceded in argument that the stock of the plaintiff corporation was largely held by Germans, and a failure to aver the contrary in the petition makes this fact a part of the case on the motion of defendants to dismiss the bill.\n The grounds stated in the bill for its recovery of the securities were threefold-first, that since the seizure the company had ceased to do business in Germany; second, that the war had been officially declared ended; and, third, that by virtue of the amendment of the Trading with the Enemy Act, approved June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e), the plaintiff became expressly entitled to the recovery sought.\n The motion of defendants was granted, and the bill dismissed. The decree of the District Supreme Court was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals.\n The first contention, that because the company had ceased to do business in Germany after the seizure, the Alien Property Custodian lost his right to continue to hold the property, cannot be sustained. A change like this could not take away the status of the seized property as enemy property. The withdrawal from business in Germany might well involve a transfer of something of value from the plaintiff to enemy citizens or subjects and strengthen the enemy resources.\n Second, it is argued that, as the war ended by joint resolution of July 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 105), the plaintiff thereby ceased to be an enemy and was entitled to a return of its property without express legislation giving such a right. It is clear from section 12 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 411, 424 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 ff), that Congress did \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n not intend that such a right should exist. One clause of that section provides:\n'After the end of the war any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money or other property received and held by the Alien Property Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury, shall be settled as Congress shall direct.'\n\n The argument for the appellant is that, when the war ended, it ceased to be an enemy, and so the words quoted do not apply to it. This is an impossible construction of the section. After the end of the war, there could be no enemy in the sense in which the appellant argues. The word 'enemy,' used in section 12, of course refers to the person who or corporation which fulfilled the definition of an enemy during the war. It follows that the right of the appellant to recover its property must depend on the congressional direction subsequent to the original act. This brings us, then, to the amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act of June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. 977.\n The third argument of the appellant is then directed to the question whether the appellant comes within the class of enemies given the right to recover their property from the Alien Property Custodian by the 1920 amendment. Section 9, paragraph (a), of that amendment (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2 e), provides for a return by order of the President to a person not an enemy claiming an interest in property seized by the Custodian, and, failing such order, allows a suit in equity to recover the property or money due. Paragraph (b) gives a similar opportunity to any one who is the owner of property seized and held by the custodian, if the President finds the owner to have been in one of eight defined classes at the time of the seizure. The first class among these is:\n'A citizen or subject of any nation or state or free city other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary, and [who] is at the time of the return \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n of such money or other property hereunder a citizen or subject of any such nation or state or free city.'\n\n The sixth class is this:\n'A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals outside the United States, or a corporation incorporated within any country other than the United States, and [which] was entirely owned at such time by subjects or citizens of nations, states, or free cities other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary, and is so owned at the time of the return of its money or other property hereunder.'\n\n It urged for appellant that it is a citizen of Switzerland and is thus included with those favored in the first class. Section 2 of the original Trading with the Enemy Act approved October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 aa), and unrepealed, provides that 'the word 'person,' as used herein, shall be deemed to mean an individual, partnership, association, company, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation or body politic,' and the word 'enemy' is declared to be equally inclusive. But there is in the act and its amendments no such definition of the words 'citizen or subject.' The term 'citizen or subject' may be broad enough to include corporations of the country whose citizens are in question. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Selover v. Walsh, \n226 U.S. 115\n 33 S. Ct. 69; Western Turf Association v. Greenberg, \n204 \nU.S. 359\n, 27 S. Ct. 384. Whether it is so inclusive in any particular instance depends upon the intent, to be gathered from the context and the general purpose of the whole legislation in which it occurs. United States v. Northwestern Express Co., \n164 \nU.S. 686, 689\n, 17 S. Ct. 206. The first clause of paragraph (b) refers to a citizen or subject who may change his nationality which could hardly refer to a corporation. The second and third clauses describing the second and third classes refer to married women and obviously the term citizen or subject in them includes only natural persons. Clause 4 \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 47]\n\u00a0\n concerns a citizen or subject of Germany accredited to the United States as the wife or child of a diplomatic officer, of course, a natural person. Clause 5 describes a citizen or subject transferred after arrest to the custody of the War Department, evidently only a natural person. In clause 6, the subjects or citizens therein referred to are the owners of partnerships, associations, or incorporated bodies, indicating that they, too, are natural persons. The context would therefore seem to show that the words are not used in the paragraph to include more than individuals. Where, as in the amendment to section 9 of the year before (Act July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35), a proviso was intended to include individuals and corporations, the word 'persons' is used in connection with the words 'citizens or subjects,' and thus no doubt is left of the inclusive effect of the proviso. The foregoing inferences as to the narrower scope of the term 'citizen' in paragraph (b) are not conclusive, though they are persuasive.\n But the strongest and to us the convincing argument that the language of clause 1 of paragraph (b) was not intended to include corporations is the especial mention of partnerships, associations, and corporations in clause 6 as a different class from that of clause 1 of the same section. That class is partnerships, associations, corporations who were enemies under the act because of the business they did in Germany or Austro- Hungary, but whose owners as partners, associates or stockholders were not enemies either at the time of the sequestration or at the time of the return.\n It was evidently intended by section 9(b) not to allow any individual enemies to be favored unless they as women only acquired their status as enemies because of marriage to a male enemy or unless they were diplomatic representatives of the enemy countries or members of their families and the property involved was within \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 48]\n\u00a0\n the United States because of their diplomatic service, or unless they were enemies interned in the United States during the war and were living in the United States at the time of the return of their property. There was an obvious purpose to exclude all other individual Germans or Austrians from the privileges of the section and it was to carry out this exclusion that clause 6 was drafted to cover especially the subject of corporations, partnerships and associations in which Germans or Austrians should have no interest. It was of a piece with the subsequent provision of the fifth section of the Act of July 2, 1921, ending the war (42 Stat. 105, 106, c. 40), designed to retain in custody the property of all German and Austrian nationals deposited with the Custodian in order to aid this country and its nationals in collecting claims for losses against the two enemy governments. The design was further subsequently revealed, though not so closely adhered to, in clause 11, added to section 9, par. (b), by the second amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act (42 Stat. 1511, 1513, c. 285), by which property could be returned to non-German or non-Austrian corporations provided that Germans or Austrians did not own 50 per cent. of the stock.\n Clause 11 of the second amendment was in fact a legislative construction of clause 1 of paragraph (b) of section 9 in the amendment of 1920 as we construe it, because otherwise and according to the contention of the defendants, a non-German or non-Austrian corporation though doing business in Germany or Austria could, under clause 1 and without clause 11, recover its property whatever its stock ownership.\n Had no clause 6 been inserted in the act, possibly the words 'citizens or subjects' of clause 1 might have been held to include corporations; but, with a specification of them as a separate class, it would violate an obviously sound rule to include them by construction in clause 1 also as citizens or subjects. \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 49]\n\u00a0\n Much has been said in respect to the intent of Congress to be liberal in this series of acts as shown by the correspondence of the Attorney General and his subordinates with the congressional committees; but nothing has been called to our attention that seems to us to have real significance in respect to the exact point in this discussion.\n In order to supply some reason or occasion for clause 6, if clause 1 is to be held to include corporations as citizens or subjects, it is suggested for appellants that the clause was intended to cover German and Austrian corporations entirely owned by citizens of the United States or of other countries than Germany or Austria. We think this a farfetched argument to explain the very general words of this clause when such a purpose might have been easily attained by specific provision for such exceptional instances. Under the appellant's construction of clause 6, the improbable overlapping duplication of clause 1 and clause 6 is so manifest that we think the construction must be rejected. We concur, therefore, with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, and the District Supreme Court.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA participated in the consideration of this case and concurred in the opinion prior to his resignation.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This cause requires interpretation of section 9, Trading with the Enemy Act, approved October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat. 411, 419, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 1\/2e), copied below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[267 U.S. 42, 50]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 of the original Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. 1919,  3115 1\/2 aa), which has remained unchanged, declares:\n'The word 'person,' as used herein, shall be deemed to mean an individual, partnership, association, company, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation or body politic,'\n\n -and that the word 'enemy' shall be deemed to mean:\n'(a) Any individual, partnership, or other body of individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (including that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation with which the United States is at war [or an ally of such nation], or resident outside the United \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 51]\n\u00a0\n States and doing business within such territory, and any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war [or an ally of such nation] or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory. ...'\n\n For many years appellant has been incorporated under the laws of Switzerland. Prior to 1917 and continuously thereafter until 1922 it did an insurance business in Germany. From 1910 until November 18, 1918, it carried on the same business within several of our states, and as security for its obligations deposited many domestic \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 52]\n\u00a0\n bonds-a million dollars. On the latter date-a week after the Armistice-the Alien Property Custodian took possession of these bonds, and either he or the Treasurer of the United States now holds them. Claiming the sequestered securities or their proceeds under section 9, subsection (b), appellant began this proceeding in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, November 28, 1921. That court held the corporation could not prevail because subjects of Germany held some of its stock; and upon motion dismissed the bill. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. The corporation came within the term 'enemy' solely because of its business within Germany; but \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 53]\n\u00a0\n it is admitted that enemy subjects owned and controlled a majority of the capital stock. Apparently the sequestration was permissible; its propriety after cessation of hostilities is not for our determination.\n As an incorporated citizen or subject of Switzerland appellant claims to come within paragraph (1) of the amended act--\n'(1) A citizen or subject of any nation or state or free city other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary, and is at the time of the return of such money or other property hereunder a citizen or subject of any such nation or state or free city.' \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 54]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand the insistence is that, although the words 'citizen or subject' often include corporations, as well as natural persons, this is not necessarily true, but depends always upon the intent disclosed by context and other accompanying circumstances. Further, that although corporations would normally fall within the words of paragraph (1), without more, the contrary intent is disclosed and they are excluded therefrom by the provisions touching certain corporations found in paragraph (6):\n\n'(6) A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals outside the United States, or a \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 55]\n\u00a0\n corporation incorporated within any country other than the United States, and was entirely owned at such time by subjects or citizens of nations, states, or free cities other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary and is so owned at the time of the return of its money or other property hereunder.'\n\n Also, that the purose to exclude corporations from paragraph (1) is further accentuated by the legislative construction disclosed by paragraph ( 11), adopted March 4, 1923 (42 Stat. 1511, 1513, c. 285):\n'(11) A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, having its principal place of \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 56]\n\u00a0\n business within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, or a corporation, organized or incorporated within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, and that the control of, or more than 50 per centum of the interests or voting power in, any such partnership, association, other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, was at such time, and is at the time of the return of any money or other property, vested in citizens or subjects of nations, states, or free cities other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary: Provided, however, that this subsection shall not affect any rights which any citizen or subject may have under paragraph (1) of this subsection.' \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 57]\n\u00a0\n The proviso of paragraph (11) sufficiently repels the suggestion that it restricts paragraph (1):\n\n'This subsection [paragraph] shall not affect any rights which any citizens or subject may have under paragraph (1) of this subsection.'\n\n Reporting June 21, 1917 (H. R. 85, 65th Cong. 1st Sess.), the House committee on interstate and foreign commerce recommended passage of the original Trading with the Enemy Act, and said:\n'The chief objects of this bill are (1) to recognize and apply concretely, subject to definite modifications, the principle and practice of international law interdicting trade in time of war, and ( 2) to conserve and utilize upon \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 58]\n\u00a0\n a basis of practical justice enemy property found within the jurisdiction of the United States. ... Citizens cannot be permitted directly or indirectly to augment the material resources of the enemy by commercial intercourse, and the necessity for this interdiction is more obvious today than at any period of the world's history. Never were the industrial, commercial and financial resources of belligerent nations so vital to the success of war as now. It is not extravagant to affirm that the effective organization of these resources is more likely to determine the result of the present conflict than armies and navies. Therefore, everything reasonably possible should be done to prevent our enemy from reaping the advantages of commercial transactions with the people of the United States. To summarize, the purpose of the bill is not to create new international rules or practices, but to define and mitigate them.'\n\n In a favorable report on the same measure, August 31, 1917 (S. R. 113, 65th Cong. 1st Sess.), the Senate committee on commerce said:\n'The purpose of this bill is to mitigate the rules of law which prohibit all intercourse between the citizens of warring nations, and to permit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on. It also provides for the care and administration of the property and property rights of enemies and their allies in this country pending the war. The spirit of the act is to permit such business intercourse as may be beneficial to citizens of this country, under rules and regulations of the President, which will prevent our enemies and their allies from receiving any benefits therefrom until after the war closes, leaving to the courts and to future action of Congress the adjustment of rights and claims arising from such transactions. Under the old rule warring nations did not respect the property rights of their enemies, but a more enlightened opinion prevails \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 59]\n\u00a0\n at the present time, and it is now thought to be entirely proper to use the property of enemies without confiscating it; also to allow such business as fire insurance, issuance and use of patents, etc., to be carried on with our enemies and their allies, provided that none of the profits arising therefrom shall be sent out of this country until the war ends.'\n\n The intent to conserve and utilize enemy property upon a basis of practical justice and to prevent the owners from receiving benefits therefrom until after the war, but without ultimate confiscation, is clear. And, where the words permit, the statute and its amendments should be liberally interpreted to that end.\n By executive orders the President vested certain wide powers, conferred upon him by the Trading with the Enemy Act, in the Alien Property Custodian, and that officer diligently proceeded to sequestrate property which, as he held, belonged to enemies. See Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 567\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 41 S. Ct. 293; Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, \n262 \nU.S. 51, 56\n, 43 S. Ct. 486. Reporting to the President, February 22, 1919 (Sen. Doc. vol. 8, pp. 9, 13 ), the Custodian said:\n'At the close of business on February 15, 1919, 35,400 reports of enemy property had been received. The property of each enemy person is treated in the office as a trust and administered by an organization which is built upon the general lines of a trust company. The number of separate trusts now being administered amounts to 32, 296 [at one time, it is said, they amounted to 50,000-Senate Hearing, S. 3852, July 27, 1922, p. 21], and have an aggregate value of $509, 945,724.75. About 9,000 of these cases are covered by reports in which the administration has not yet reached the stage of valuation. When the entire number of trusts reported shall have been finally opened on the books and the readjustment of values consequent upon appraisal shall have been com- \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 60]\n\u00a0\n pleted, it is safe to say that the total value of the enemy property in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian will reach $700,000,000 . ...\n\n'The legislative intent was plainly that all enemy property, concealed as well as disclosed, should be placed entirely beyond the control or influence of its former owners, where it cannot eventually yield aid or comfort to the enemy directly or indirectly. Until the peace terms are finally signed and the ultimate disposition of enemy property determined by the act of Congress, it shall be the firm purpose of the Alien Property Custodian to carry out the will of the Congress in respect thereto. Neither litigation nor threat of litigation ought to be interposed to stay that purpose.'\n\n During hostilities and thereafter he sequestered the property of enemy subjects, of citizens of the United States, of associated nations, and of neutrals, found in the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, the Virgin Islands, Porto Rico, and throughout continental United States. It included practically all forms of tangible and intangible assets- industrial plants, chemical and woolen mills, steamship lines, banks, land and cattle companies, salmon factories, mines of gold, silver and other metals, corporate bonds and shares of stock, real estate, trusts represented by securities, liquid assets, thousands of patents (5,700), trade-marks, prints, labels, and copyrights, etc. The individual items varied in value from one dollar to thousands, even millions of dollars. The enactment was novel, and gave rise to many troublesome questions of fact and law.\n After the conclusion of hostilities insistent demands were made for return of the property belonging to citizens of the United States, of associated powers, of neutrals, and of the states partly composed of territory detached from Germany or Austria.\n The Act of July 11, 1919, c. 6, 41 Stat. 35, added to section 9 a proviso which gave right of recovery to subjects \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 61]\n\u00a0\n of associated nations whose property had been sequestered solely because of residence within territory occupied by enemy forces; e. g., Belgium and Northern France. There were several hundred cases of French and Belgium property taken solely because the owners were in such occupied territory. [ H. Comm. Hearings 1920, vol. 232-1, part 8, p. 11.] This amendment (copied in the margin2) applied to 'a person who was an enemy or ally of enemy' and 'is a citizen or subject of such associated nation.' The words 'citizen or subject' include 'person,' and 'person,' according to the statutory definition, \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 62]\n\u00a0\n includes 'corporation.' The same meaning of 'citizen or subject' should be accepted wherever they occur in the section.\n March 31, 1920, the Attorney General advised the House committee on interstate and foreign commerce (H. R. 1089, 66th Cong. 2d Sess.):\n'The Secretary of State has written to me that this government has recognized that the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine have now become a part of France and that, in his opinion, the continued retention by the Alien Property Custodian of property of residents of these provinces who have acquired French nationality under the Versailles treaty of peace cannot fail to have an unfavorable effect upon the relations of the United States and France. The Secretary of State expressed the view that the Trading with the Enemy Act should be so amended as to allow the return of this property. He suggested that I recommend to Congress an amendment to this effect.\n\n'The Secretary of State also points out that this government has recognized the republics of Poland and Czechoslovakia and the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and that for this government to retain the property of persons who are citizens of those countries and resident within their borders would have a prejudicial effect upon the relations between the countries in question and the United States. The Secretary of State's recommendation was that any amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act should be broad enough to authorize the return of property belonging to citizens of these counties. He also felt that the amendment should cover the cases of residents of territory which may be allotted, under treaties yet to become effective, to an allied or associated power (as, for example, Trieste), as well as territory which, under plebiscites to be held in accordance with treaty provisions, may be allotted to a neutral country (as, for example, that portion of Schleswig which may be allotted to Denmark). \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 63]\n\u00a0\n 'I am herewith forwarding to you a draft of a bill to amend section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, which I believe will provide the relief requested by the Secretary of State.'\n\n May 5, 1920 (H. R. 1089, 66th Cong. 2d Sess.), the Secretary of State wrote to the Attorney General:\n'I have the honor to refer to my letter of March 23, 1920, concerning an amendment to section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, authorizing the release of property taken over by the Alien Property Custodian belonging to enemy persons who, by virtue of the peace treaties, become citizens, subjects or nationals of countries other than Germany, Austria or Hungary. In addition to the classes of property referred to therein, I believe that any amendment to section 9 should also contain provisions permitting the return of all property which, at the time it was taken over by the Alien Property Custodian, belonged to nationals, citizens or subjects of the United States, as well as those of neutral or friendly states and of Turkey and Bulgaria.\n\n'The various neutral and allied states whose nationals' property has been taken over by the Alien Property Custodian by reason of their residence in enemy or ally of enemy territory, or otherwise, for some time have been pressing for the release of such property. It appears that the Department of Justice has ruled that, under the Trading with the Enemy Act in its present form, it is not in a position to release this property. During the actual conduct of hostilities it may have been advisable to retain such property. In view, however, of the cessation of hostilities, this department feels that the government should no longer retain this property, even though a technical state of war may still exist. To do so would undoubtedly create an unfavorable impression in the states concerned, and would be of no advantage to the United States in its negotiations with enemy countries.' \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 64]\n\u00a0\n Inclosing the letter last quoted, the Attorney General wrote again to the House committee, May 11, 1920 (H. R. 1089, 66th Cong. 2d Sess.):\n\n'Referring to my letter of March 31, concerning certain legislation amendatory to section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act to be submitted to your committee at the suggestion of the Secretary of State, as stated to you in my letter of April 22, through inadvertence the draft of the proposed legislation was not inclosed in the letter of March 31, and thereafter the Secretary of State requested that the matter be held up so that certain additional relief, which he considered necessary to give, might be incorporated in the proposed amendment. These suggestions he has since furnished to me, and the inclosed draft of a bill, amending section 9, has been drawn with a view to meeting these suggestions. I am also inclosing a copy of his letter to me, dated May 5, 1920, in order that your committee may have the benefit of the information which it contains.\n\n'The relief called for by this letter required extensive changes in the text of the bill which was designed to accompany my letter of March 31, and accordingly I will reanalyze its provisions, and indicate the change which it would make in existing law. ...\n\n'Subsection (b) of the proposed amendment provides, in substance, for the return of all enemy property, except that held by persons who are in fact bona fide subjects or citizens of Germany, Austria or Hungary.'\n\n May 21, 1920, the Secretary of State sent the following to the same committee (H. R. 1089, 66th Cong. 2d Sess.):\n'The Attorney General has informed me that on May 11, 1920, he submitted to you a draft of an amendment to section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, permitting the return of property taken over by the Alien Property Custodian belonging to citizens or subjects of neutral \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 65]\n\u00a0\n states and states associated with this government in the World War, as well as to persons who have or will, in pursuance of treaty provisions, become citizens or subjects of such states, for example, Alsace-Lorraine, or citizens or subjects of new states which have been recognized by this government, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.\n\n'The draft, it is understood, is largely based on representations from this department, made in view of the fact that the Attorney General holds that under the Trading with the Enemy Act, in its present form, he is unable to release property to owners, who when it was taken over were included, for any reason, in the terms 'enemy' or 'ally of enemy,' as used in the act, and consequently, in spite of strong representations by various neutral and associated governments, it has been impossible to return the property of their nationals, which it would appear this government should no longer retain. To longer retain property of this character can hardly fail to unfavorably affect the relations of this government with the governments concerned, and I am strongly of the opinion that section 9 of the act should be amended at an early date, so as to permit in proper cases the return of such property. I hope that it will be possible to give favorable consideration to the matter, and that an amendment of the act can be passed before the recess of Congress.'\n\n The House Committee held protracted hearings (H. Comm. Hearings 1920, vol. 232-1, part 8), and heard representatives of the State Department, the Attorney General's office and the Alien Property Custodian, who stated what had been done and pointed out the purpose of the proposed amendments. The following is quoted from statements of Mr. Hill, Assistant to the Solicitor, State Department, and Mr. Boggs, Special Assistant to the Attorney General: \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 66]\n\u00a0\n 'The Chairman: [Mr. Hill,] does not seizure and retention of this property, by the Alien Property Custodian, of citizens of Czechoslovakia, Jugo-Slavia, Bulgaria, Turkey and Alsace- Lorraine, involve any embarrassment on the part of the State Department?\n'Mr. Hill: It does; yes, sir. In addition to that, they have taken the property of citizens of Switzerland, Holland and other neutral countries, who at the time by reason of residence in Germany or otherwise, were included in the term 'enemy.' We have taken over that property, and under the present wording of the act the Custodian cannot release it, and the Attorney General cannot upon application act favorably, because it was, technically, enemy property at the time. We have a number of cases of that kind and they are causing a great deal of embarrassment.\n\n'I may also refer to the case of Czechoslovakia. This government has recognized the government of Czechoslovakia. Congress made an appropriation for a minister to that country and we have accredited a minister there. This government has recognized the existence of that country through the executive, and yet we continue to hold the property of its citizens, which we cannot release at this time without an amendment of the act, because they were enemies at the time the property was taken over. The Czechoslovakian government has pressed us a good deal for the return of that property. Conditions in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Jugo-Slavia, etc., are very serious and the return of their citizens' property, in view of the very advantageous rates of exchange at this time, would be of material assistance in the rehabilitation of those countries.\n\n'Take the case of Poland: The same situation exists there. We have a great deal of Polish property. Where the Poles were residing in that part of Poland which was formerly Austria-Hungarian or German territory, the department \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 67]\n\u00a0\n has been very much embarrassed because there is no discretion with the Attorney General to return such property. There has been considerable irritation shown by the various neutral countries and considerable pressure by these new associated states, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia and also Jugo-Slavia, which is a part of the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. We continue to hold the property of their citizens, although they were our associates during the war.\n\n'Mr. Denison (of the committee): Under the terms of this bill can that situation be met in the case you referred to of citizens of Sweden and Norway?\n\n'Mr. Hill. Paragraph 1 on page 4 permits the return of property of 'a citizen or subject of any nation or state or free city other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary (including any state or free city in the four nations last named).' That would permit the return of such property.'\n\n'Mr. Dewalt (of the committee): [Mr. Boggs,] does the proposed act have in contemplation the cases of residents of Alsace-Lorraine, occupied territory?\n\n'Mr. Boggs: Yes, sir.\n\n'Mr. Dewalt: How do you protect them and what rights do they receive under this act?\n\n'Mr. Boggs: That refers to subdivision No. 1 of subsection (b), contained on page 4 of the present draft. 'A citizen or subject of any nation or state or free city other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary'-as it now reads-'(including any state or free city in the four nations last named), and is at the time of the return of his money or other property hereunder a citizen or subject of any such nation or state or free city.'\n\n'Now, that would permit the return to a person who was not a citizen at the time the property was taken and is not now a citizen of one of the enemy countries. In order to clarify the situation with regard to Alsace-Lorraine \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 68]\n\u00a0\n and other countries that have been transferred from enemy to nonenemy or friendly status, by virtue of the war, there has been inserted the proviso' [to section 9 quoted above].\n\n The foregoing letters and statements indicate the complicated situation which followed common acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles and failure by the United States to end the technical state of war until July 2, 1921 (chapter 40, 42 Stat. 105). They reveal the desire of the Executive Departments for prompt return of sequestered property not owned by bona fide subjects or citizens of Germany or Austria-Hungary, and their interpretation of the proposed enactment. Paragraphs (1), (4), (6), (7), and (8) of subsection (b) apparently originated with the State Department. The House committee made a favorable report upon the bill, accompanied by these letters (H. R. 1089, June 2, 1920, 66th Cong. 2d Sess.), and among other things said:\n'The bill has the approval of the Departments of Justice and State, as will appear by the letters attached and which are made a part of this report. ...\n\n'The United States, while holding approximately $556,000,000 worth of private property which it found in this country belonging to individual citizens of enemy countries residing in their country at the outbreak of the war and still residing there, does not intend to confiscate this property. It was the intention of Congress when the property was taken that it should merely be held in custody during the war and that after the war the property or its proceeds should be returned to the owners. It has never been the purpose or the practice of the United States to seize the private property of a belligerent to pay our government's claims against such belligerent. Such practice is contrary to the spirit of international law throughout the world. The reasons for the enactment of the pending measure are clearly set forth in the accompanying \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 69]\n\u00a0\n communications received from the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. For the reasons set forth in the letter of the Secretary of State prompt and favorable action is urged in order that the State Department may be relieved of some embarrassment in its dealings with some countries of Europe. For these reasons the committee favorably reports the bill as above amended.'\n\n The House (Cong. Rec. vol. 59 pt. 8, p. 8429) passed the bill shortly after this report, and within a few days thereafter the Senate took like action (Id. 8475). The manifest design was to restore certain property in compliance with the original purpose of Congress.\n The amending statute re-enacted the material provisions of original section 9 as subsection (a), and added six subsections-(b), (c), (d), (e), ( f), and (g). It deleted the proviso of July 11, 1919, concerning persons in occupied territory, and inserted a general proviso applicable to the whole section, which directs that no person shall be deemed or held to be citizen or subject of Germany or Austria-Hungary who had been or should become citizen or subject of any state or nation partly composed of territory once held by either of those empires. \n3\n 'Person,' of course, includes corporation, and thus, in the section now to be construed, 'citizen or subject' clearly include corporations and have their true and normal meaning. \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 70]\n\u00a0\n Behn, Meyer & Co. v. Miller, \n266 \nU.S. 457\n, 45 S. Ct. 165, 69 L. Ed . -- (decided January 5), considers section 9, and declares:\n'Subsection (a) of section 9 gives now, as the same words gave from the first, the right of recovery to any person never 'an enemy or ally of enemy,' within the statutory definitions. ... Subsection (b) adds to those allowed to recover from the first a considerable number always within the definition of 'enemy' and affords to them the measure of relief which Congress deemed proper long after peace had been actually restored. ... Before its passage the original Trading with the Enemy Act was considered in the light of difficulties certain to follow disregard of corporate identity and efforts to fix the status of corporations as enemy or not according to the nationality of stockholders. ...\n\n'Section 7, subsection (c), was never intended, we think, to empower the President to seize corporate property merely because of enemy stockholders' interests therein. Corporations are brought within the carefully framed definitions (section 2) of 'enemy' and 'ally of enemy' by the words, 'Any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war [or any nation which is an ally of such nation] or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory.\"\n\n We there pointed out that under the act a corporation is an entity with character of its own irrespective of the status attributed to stockholders, and is 'enemy' only when directly within the statutory definition. The theory that all corporations are excluded from subsection ( a) \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 71]\n\u00a0\n because some are specifically mentioned in subsection (b), paragraph (6), was definitely rejected; and we held that a corporation of the Straits Settlements (British in character) which had never done business in enemy territory did not come within the definition, although German nationals owned the controlling interest.\n In his letter of May eleventh the Attorney General expressed the view that subsection (b) provided 'for the return of all enemy property, except that held by persons who are in fact bona fide subjects or citizens of Germany, Austria or Hungary,' and the Secretary of State thought that it permits the 'return of property taken over by the Alien Property Custodian belonging to citizens or subjects of neutral states, and states associated with this government in the World War, as well as to persons who have or will, in pursuance of treaty provisions, become citizens or subjects of such states, for example Alsace-Lorraine, or citizens or subjects of new states which have been recognized by this government, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.'\n The eight paragraphs of subsection (b) are separated by 'or,' and owners of seized property who are within any described class may recover. Every paragraph adds some owners, and none restricts another by express words. The apparent purpose was to relieve any owner if within any paragraph-not to mark out inclusive and exclusive classes.\n Paragraph (1) is broad enough to include the property of all neutrals, and so to interpret it will do no violence to any part of the act. The words 'citizen or subject,' as commonly used in international matters, include corporations. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 177, 178; United States v. Northwestern Express Co., \n164 \nU.S. 686, 689\n, 17 S. Ct. 206; Ramsey v. Tacoma Land Co., \n196 \nU.S. 360, 362\n, 25 S. Ct. 286; Moore's International Law Digest, vol. 3, p. 804; Id. vol. 6, pp. 641, 642. \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 72]\n\u00a0\n Corporations of neutral countries, although controlled by enemy stockholders, were never declared to be 'enemy' unless they did business within hostile territory; the statute gave no regard to residence or nationality of stockholders. Such business also made enemies of neutral individuals; and they can recover under paragraph (1). Hostilities having ended, neutral nations could properly demand the same right for their corporations. Confiscation is everywhere disavowed; neutral property may not be used for adjusting claims against belligerents; and ordinary fair dealing requires its release. To seize the effects of a neutral corporation after cessation of hostilities and then hold them solely because of some enemy stockholder, would defeat the lawmakers' honorable intention and give rise to grave suspicion concerning the purpose of our government. On the argument counsel for appellees admitted that the view which he advocated would prevent return of the sequestered property of a corporation organized under the laws of a neutral nation if a German subject owned a single share of the stock-if, indeed, he owned less than 1 per cent., while Americans or neutrals held the remainder. This unfortunate, if not absurd, result indicates the unsoundness of the proposed construction.\n Paragraphs (2) and (3) add certain women who married enemy nationals; ( 4) and (5) add diplomatic and consular officers and interned persons; (7) and (8) make further definite additions.\n Paragraph (6) adds to those already described, 'a partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals outside the United States' (Germany and Austria-Hungary are outside); also 'a corporation incorporated within any country other than the United States ( this includes Germany and Austria-Hungary) and was entirely owned at such time by subjects or citizens of nations, states or free cities other than Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary and is so owned at \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 73]\n\u00a0\n the time of the return of its money or other property hereunder.' This includes corporations of Germany or Austria-Hungary, or of any state left within those empires,4 if entirely owned by citizens of the United States or an associated power or a neutral. The practice of organizing local companies to do the business of foreign owners has become very general. Certain important German corporations were wholly owned by individuals or corporations of the United States. British subjects had large investments in German concerns, and probably the same is true of subjects of Sweden, Norway, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, and Italy. There were obvious reasons for releasing property of a corporation when wholly owned by our own people, by nationals of associated powers, or by neutrals, and paragraph (6) effects this.\n Consider--\n That the purpose of the original act was to provide for the care and administration, pending the war, of property which might be helpful to our enemies, and to deprive the owners of its use 'until the war closes.'\n That no corporation was declared 'enemy' because of the nationality of stockholders, but only when incorporated within enemy territory or doing business there.\n That property of Americans, of citizens of associated nations and of neutrals was sequestered because of residence or business carried on within enemy countries.\n That although appellant had been permitted to do business within the United States during the whole period of \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 74]\n\u00a0\n actual hostilities its property was seized after the Armistice when such property could not be utilized for hostile purposes.\n That the act of 1919 permitted return of property of any 'person' ( this includes corporation) then a 'citizen or subject' of an associated power treated as 'enemy' solely because of residence within enemy lines.\n That after the Armistice our Executive Departments represented to Congress the urgent demands for sequestered property of citizens and subjects of associated nations, neutrals, and states composed in part of territory formerly within Germany or Austria-Hungary, and reported the impending deleterious effect upon our foreign relations.\n That the agents of the State Department and the Attorney General's office pointed out that the amendments proposed by them provided, 'in substance, for the return of all enemy property except that held by persons who are in fact bona fide subjects or citizens of Germany, Austria or Hungary.'\n That a general proviso applicable to all of section 9 directs that, for its purposes, 'no person shall be deemed or held to be a citizen or subject of Germany or Austria or Hungary or Austria-Hungary,' if he becomes the subject of any nation composed in part of territory formerly belonging to those empires, and it extends relief to such persons. The words 'citizen or subject,' as there used, clearly include 'persons,' and, by statutory definition, the latter includes a corporation.\n That the original seizure of the property in question would be difficult to justify; and certainly the United States can have no moral right longer to retain or to confiscate it. Neutral property cannot be used in settlement of claims against enemy countries. So to do would be wholly inconsistent with our traditions and pretensions. \n\n[267 U.S. 42, 75]\n\u00a0\n That the words 'citizen or subject of any nation,' in paragraph (1), according to common usage, are broad enough to include corporations.\n That the use of the disjunctive 'or,' in separating the paragraphs of subsection (b), indicates that if an owner comes within the description of any class he may recover. The fact that he falls within more than one is not material.\n That paragraph (6) describes a class of owners not within the words of paragraph (1) and affords possible relief, obviously desirable, for our own citizens, associates and neutrals.\n That a liberal construction should be given the amendment with a view to carrying out its benevolent purposes, and not a narrow, strained one which would reflect discredit upon the government.\n That the construction asked by appellees is neither natural nor necessary and would lead to the unfortunate conclusion that seized property of a neutral corporation must be retained because a German owns one share out of many thousand. Without doing violence to any part of the act and by giving effect to every word therein, citizens of neutrals may secure just relief and the United States escape the serious charge, of oppressive and unfriendly action.\n In view of all these things, I am unable to accept the view which appellees urge upon us. It seems sufficiently plain that the court below fell into error, and to affirm the challenged decree would leave our government in a most unenviable position. 'There is no debt with so much prejudice put off as that of justice.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 9.

U S(1925)\nNo. 143\nArgued: December 11, 1924Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Raymond M. Hudson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims. The petition was dismissed on demurrer for \n\n[266 U.S. 491, 492]\n\u00a0\n failure to state a cause of action. It alleges in substance these facts. Cotton linters are used in the manufacture of mattresses and bedding. They are also used as the base of smokeless powder. The plaintiff had in stock, on May 27, 1918, a lot of cotton linters. On that day, the War Industries Board1 issued a circular 'To dealers in and users of cotton linters' notifying them for their 'information and guidance' that, because of the government's requirements, all linters were requisitioned. On July 10, 1918, it issued a further circular on the subject. Later, the board had direct dealing with the plaintiff about taking over its linters at their actual value. A price was offered which the plaintiff refused to accept. The 'Ordnance Department then began exercising the right to commandeer by which the owner was to be given an opportunity to establish the actual value of the linters but before this commandeering process was completed the Armistice was signed and the government did not then take the linters.' Because of the government's action, plaintiff had retained the linters. Because of the release by the government after the Armistice of all linters held under such orders and regulations, the plaintiff's stock became worth less than it had cost the plaintiff and less than its market value had been during the preceding summer. The resulting loss was $11,744. 18.\n Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to recover the amount of this loss. The suit must have been brought under the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 c ), or under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code,  145 [Comp. St.  1136]), upon the ground that there was either an express executory contract to accept and pay the war value or that what occurred was a legal taking from which an implied agreement \n\n[266 U.S. 491, 493]\n\u00a0\n to pay arose, under the doctrine of United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645\n, 5 S. Ct. 306, and later cases. We need not discuss the precise facts alleged in the petition. \n2\n Whatever interpretation be given to the action of the War Industries Board and the Ordnance Department there set forth, the plaintiff must fail.\n Recovery cannot be had under the Dent Act, among other reasons, because the agreement, if any, has not been 'performed in whole or in part,' and no 'expenditures have been made or obligations incurred upon the faith of the same.' Compare Price Fire & Water Proofing Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 179\n, 43 S. Ct. 299. Nor is recovery possible under the Tucker Act. It cannot be had as upon an express contract, because the transaction comes within Rev. Stat.  3744 (Comp. St .  6895); was not 'reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof,' and was wholly executory. South Boston Iron Co. v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 37\n, 6 S. Ct. 728; Erie Coal & Coke Corporation v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 518\n, 45 S. Ct. 181, 69 L. Ed. --, decided this day. Compare United States v.

Recovery cannot be has as upon an implied contract, because the only authority to requisition the linters was that conferred by section 10 of the Lever Act (Aug. 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 279 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii]), and proceedings under that section are not based on contract. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 43 S. Ct. 354. Moreover, they must be brought in the District Court. United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547\n, 41 S.

St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830). Proceedings were brought under section 1014, R. S. (Comp. St.  1674), before a United States commissioner to remove them from Illinois to the trial district in Ohio. After a hearing the commissioner ordered their discharge for want of probable cause. Subsequently, similar proceedings were instituted before a federal district judge of the Illinois district, and appellants were taken into custody by the United States marshal upon a warrant issued by the district judge. Thereupon, in advance of a hearing, they sued out writs of habeas corpus in the court below seeking to be discharged upon the ground that the proceedings before the district judge were without authority of law and in violation of their constitutional and statutory rights. The specific ground relied upon was that their discharge by the commissioner for want of probable cause after a hearing was an adjudication upon that question and a bar to a second proceeding. The court below held otherwise and entered orders quashing the writs. 3 F. (2d) 816. The government has moved this court to dismiss the appeals or affirm the judgments for lack of substance and on the ground that the appeals were taken solely for delay. The motion to affirm must be sustained.\n Under state law it has uniformly been held that the discharge of an accused person upon a preliminary examination for want of probable cause constitutes no bar to a subsequent preliminary examination before another magistrate. Such an examination is not a trial in any sense and does not operate to put the defendant in jeopardy. Marston v. Jenness, 11 N. H. 156, 161, 162; Nicholson v. The State, ex rel.

The utmost that can be said is that the decision of a commissioner favorable to the accused is persuasive and may be sufficient to justify like action upon a second application; but it is not controlling. Undoubtedly, care should be exercised by the magistrate to whom a subsequent application for removal is made to see that the accused is not oppressed by repeated and unwarranted petitions for removal.

McCullough, of Baltimore, Md., for plaintiff in error.[ U S Fidelity & Guaranty Co v.

On November 1 following the defendant in error was appointed receiver, and on April \n\n[268 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n 14, 1922, began this suit upon a bond executed by the plaintiff in error on August 28, 1921, binding it to indemnify the Bank for losses of this character to the extent of $25,000. The Guaranty Company pleaded in set- off that on August 24, 1921, it became surety for the Bank upon another bond to the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company, conditioned upon payment by the Bank to the Railway Company of the Company's deposits in the Bank, and that on January 16, 1922, it paid to the Railway Company $23, 312.51 and as matter of law become subrogated to the rights of the Company against the Bank, and in addition took an assignment of such rights, which was approved by the plaintiff on February 1. An agreement of the parties was filed, that the facts alleged were true and that the only question for the Court was 'whether or not under the facts alleged, the defendant is entitled as against the plaintiff to set off the demand it holds as assignee or subrogee of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company.' Thus the answer and the agreement confine the issue before us to the rights of the defendant Guaranty Company by way of subrogation or assignment. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals gave judgment for the plaintiff for $25,000 interest and costs and denied the defendant's right. 295 F. 847.\n The two bonds were wholly independent transactions and were not brought into mutual account by any agreement of the parties. The Guaranty Company after the insolvency of the Bank could not have bought a claim against the Bank and used it in setoff. Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 511\n, 13 S. Ct. 148; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 290\n, 16 S. Ct. 502; Yardley v. Philler, \n167 \nU.S. 340, 360\n, 17 S. Ct. 835. The receiver contends that that is the position of the defendant here, because it was only a guarantor and was only liable upon the default of the President of the Bank that produced the insolvency. The Court \n\n[268 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n below treated the claim of the Railway Company against the Bank as acquired by the defendant after the insolvency. The defendant, however, contends that upon its payment to the Railway Company its subrogation related back to the date of its contract; and we will assume for purposes of argument that this is true. But suppose it is, the right of the Railway Company was simply that of a depositor, a right to share with other unsecured creditors in the assets of the Bank, of which the bond now in suit was a part. There would be no equity in allowing the Railway Company a special claim against this bond. We will assume that if the Railway Company had insured the honesty of the Bank's officers the Bank might have offset the obligation of the company against its claim as a depositor. But it is impossible to treat the succession of the defendant to the Railway Company's claim as effecting such an absolute identification with the Railway Company that one and the same person insured the Bank and made the deposits. The doctrine of relation 'is a legal fiction invented to promote the ends of justice. ... It is never allowed to defeat the collateral rights of third persons, lawfully acquired.' Johnston v.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii).\n That the coal in question had been shipped from the mines under valid contracts during the first part of October, 1919, was owned by the claimant, and prior to October 30, 1919, was at Port Richmond piers, Philadelphia, or at Port Reading piers, New Jersey.\n That 'by virtue of the authority conferred by the aforesaid act of Congress, the President of the United States, acting by and through the Fuel Administrator at Port Richmond piers, Philadelphia, or at Port Reading piers, New Jersey, commandeered and requisitioned' this coal during November and December, 1919. 'The said coal was commandeered and requisitioned from or through the Commissioner of the Tidewater Coal Exchange, the superintendent of transportation of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, the shipping and freight agent of the United States Railroad Administration at Port Reading terminal piers, New Jersey, the Bituminous Coal Distribution Committee, the Regional Coal Committee, the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, the Port Reading Railroad Company, the federal treasurer at Port Reading terminal piers of the United States Railroad Administration, and the Jamison Coal & Coke Company, the vendors of the said coal to the plaintiff. All of the aforesaid coal was received, accepted, retained and used by the United States of America, and used in the operation of various railroads, to wit: Boston & Maine Railroad, Maine Central Railroad-which said use was a public use connected with the common defense.'\n That the fair and reasonable value of the coal was $4.536 per ton f. o. b. the mines; that nothing has been \n\n[267 U.S. 302, 306]\n\u00a0\n paid to claimant on account of said coal so commandeered and requisitioned, and it should have judgment for the value thereof with interest.\n A motion by the United States, to dismiss the action upon the ground that the claimant was a citizen of Connecticut and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction, was overruled. Thereupon the United States interposed a demurrer, and set up that the court had no jurisdiction of the cause; that the statement of claim showed no cause of action; that under the Lever Act District Courts of the United States have jurisdiction of actions only after determination by the President of the value of the property taken, expression of dissatisfaction by the owner, and payment of 75 per centum of the determined amount; that the complaint sets forth a diversion of coal under section 25 of the Lever Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Am. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 q), not a requisition under section 10, and that the remedy, if any, was to sue the Agent designated by the President under section 206(a) of the Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 cc). This was overruled and the United States answered.\n It was stipulated by counsel that 'a jury trial being waived, the issues of fact in this case may be tried and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, in accordance with sections 649 and 700 of the United States Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1587, 1668).' The cause was heard by the court upon the pleadings and evidence. What purports to be a transcript of the latter is printed; but it was not made part of the record by bill of exceptions. The trial judge filed an opinion and entered judgment for the claimant. No special findings were asked or made.\n The cause is here by direct writ of error. The parties agree that only the question of jurisdiction is open. For the United States it is said 'the court below was without jurisdiction to render the judgment, and that is the sole question presented.' \n\n[267 U.S. 302, 307]\n\u00a0\n As the record contains no bill of exceptions, upon this direct writ of error we can review only questions of law apparent on the face of the pleadings in so far as they directly relate to the court's jurisdiction.

Serven, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee a domestic corporation, carries on the business of issuing fire and marine insurance policies in Massachusetts, New York, and elsewhere. It sued to recover $8,755.92, exacted as income tax for 1916 ( Act Sept. 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756 (Comp. St.  6336a et seq.)), and maintains that the addition made during the year to its reserve funds, 'in the amount and on account of its liabilities for unsettled loss claims,' as \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n required by the superintendent of insurance for New York, should have been deducted from gross income in order to determine the net sum subject to taxation. The amount of the deduction claimed was ascertained by subtracting $775,900.10, the reserve for loss claims on December 31, 1915, and required as condition precedent to doing business within New York during the following year, from $1,336,578.53, the amount necessary therefor during 1917\n\n\n The Revenue Act of 1916 levied an annual tax upon the net income received during the preceding year by domestic insurance companies, and provided:\n'Sec. 12. (a) In the case of a corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, organized in the United States, such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of its income received within the year from all sources-\n\n'First. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, including rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of property to which the corporation has not taken or is not taking title or in which it has no equity.\n\n'Second. All losses actually sustained and charged off within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out of its use or employment in the business or trade; (a) in the case of oil and gas wells a reasonable allowance for actual reduction in flow and production to be ascertained not by the flush flow, but by the settled production or regular flow; (b) in the case of mines a reasonable allowance for depletion thereof not to exceed the market value in the mine of the product thereof which has been mained and sold during the year for which the return and computa- \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n tion are made, such reasonable allowance to be made in the case of both (a) and (b) under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury; ... and (c) in the case of insurance companies, the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds and the sums other than dividends paid within the year on policy and annuity contracts.' (Comp. St.  6336l).\n\n During 1915, 1916, and 1917, as a condition precedent to the right to do insurance business in the state, the New York superintendent of insurance required the following reserves:\n'Stock, Fire and Marine Insurance Companies-\n'A. Loss reserve, including all unpaid losses and estimated expense of investigations and adjustment thereof, less admitted reinsurance.\n\n'B. Reserve for unearned premiums as required by statute and departmental regulations; i. e. (a) on fire insurance risks a sum equal to the actual unearned premium on the policies in force claculated on the gross sum without any deduction except for admitted reinsurance, and (b) on marine hull risks calculated in the same manner and on marine cargo risks 100 per cent. of the last month's gross premium writings.\n\n'C. Reserve for all other outstanding liabilities due or accrued.\n\n'Stock, Casualty, Surety and Credit Insurance Companies-\n'A. Loss reserve, including all unpaid losses and estimated expense of investigation and adjustment thereof, whether on account of compensation and liability insurance or otherwise, less admitted reinsurance, and such additional contingent reserves for losses as may be required by the superintendent of insurance.\n\n'B. Unearned premium or reinsurance reserve calculated as required by statute and all premiums paid in advance at 100 per cent. \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n 'C. Reserve for all other outstanding liabilities due or accrued.'\n\n The superintendent did not direct that funds to meet liabilities should be kept separate and distinct from other assets. They were specified by book entries as (1) reserves to meet liabilities for unearned premiums; (2) unpaid loss claims; and (3) all other outstanding liabilities, due or accrued. He required all companies to keep on hand sufficient assets to meet every liability.\n The opinion of the Court of Claims (58 Ct. Cl. 603) states:\n'The one question, and the only one properly raised, is whether, within the meaning and intent of the federal Revenue Act, the net additions so made by the plaintiff to its reserve funds in pursuance of the requirements of the superintendent of insurance for New York, to cover accrued but unsettled loss claims, may be said to be such a fund as comes within the meaning of 'reserve funds,' as those terms appear in the Revenue Act. The defendant does not dispute that the sum involved was reserved, nor that it was required by the proper insurance authorities of New York to be reserved. Defendant's argument is predicated upon an assertion that Congress, in exempting net additions to reserve funds, clearly intended to exempt only such funds as are technically known and universally understood in the insurance word as reserve funds, and as thus understood the terms have a well-defined, limited and certain status and meaning.'\n\n Following Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342, 350\n, 40 S. Ct. 155, 158, that court held the 'loss claims item' was a 'net addition' required by law to be made to 'reserve funds' within the meaning of the act of 1916 and gave judgment for the appellee.\n We think McCoach v. Insurance Co. of North America, \n244 \nU.S. 585, 589\n, 37 S. Ct. 709, 710, is conclusive of the issue here presented; and appellee's claim must be denied. There a fire \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 201]\n\u00a0\n and marine insurance company sought to recover the tax assessed upon the addition during the year to 'reserve funds' held against accrued but unpaid losses. Through Mr. Justice Pitney this court said:\n'The question is 'whether, within the meaning of the act of Congress, 'reserve funds,' with annual or occasional additions, are 'required by law,' in Pennsylvania, to be maintained by fire and marine insurance companies, other than the 'unearned premium' or 'reinsurance reserve,' known to the general law of insurance. ...\n\n'It appears that under this legislation, and under previous statutes in force since 1873, the insurance commissioner has required plaintiff and similar companies to return each year, as an item among their liabilities, the net amount of unpaid losses and claims, whether actually adjusted, in process of adjustment, or resisted. And, although this practice has not been sanctioned by any decision of the Supreme Court of the state, it is relied upon as an administrative interpretation of the law.\n\n'Conceding full effect to this, it still does not answer the question whether the amounts required to be held against unpaid losses, in the case of fire and marine insurance companies, are held as 'reserves,' within the meaning of the Pennsylvania law or of the act of Congress, however they may be designated upon the official forms. As already appears, the Pennsylvania act specifically requires debts and claims of all kinds to be included in the statement of liabilities, and treats them as something distinct from reserves. The object is to exercise abundant caution to maintain the companies in a secure financial position.\n\n'The act of Congress, on the other hand, deals with reserves not particularly in their bearing upon the solvency of the company, but as they aid in determining what part of the gross income ought to be treated as net income for purposes of taxation. There is a specific \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 202]\n\u00a0\n provision for deducting 'all losses actually sustained within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise.' And this is a sufficient indication that losses in immediate contemplation, but not as yet actually sustained, were not intended to be treated as part of the reserve funds; that term rather having reference to the funds ordinarily held as against the contingent liability on outstanding policies.\n\n'In our opinion the reserve against unpaid losses is not 'required by law,' in Pennsylvania, within the meaning of the act of Congress.'\n\n It follows from McCoach v. Insurance Co. that the permitted deductions specified by section 12, Act 1916, do not necessarily include anything which may be denominated 'reserve fund' by state statute or officer. We there distinctly ruled that the 'reserve fund' of the federal act did not include something held by a fire and marine insurance company to cover accrued, but unsettled, claims for losses. We adhere to and reaffirm that doctrine. How far it must be modified, if at all, in respect of insurance companies which issue casualty, surety, or liability policies, or similar obligations, is not now before us.\n Our opinion in Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States contains the following passage:\n'Unearned premium reserve and special reserve for unpaid liability losses are familiar types of insurance reserves, and the government, in its amended returns, allowed these two items, but rejected the third, 'loss claims reserve.' The Court of Claims, somewhat obscurely, held that the third item should also be allowed. This 'loss claims reserve' was intended to provide for the liquidation of claims for unsettled losses (other than those provided for by the reserve for liability losses) which had accrued at the end of the tax year for which the return was made and the reserve computed. The finding that the insurance department of Pennsylvania, pursuant to statute, has at all times \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 203]\n\u00a0\n since and including 1909 required claimant to keep on hand, as a condition of doing business in that state, 'assets as reserves sufficient to cover outstanding losses,' justifies the deduction of this reserve as one required by law to be maintained, and the holding that it should have been allowed for all of the years involved is approved.'\n\n Upon a re-examination of the record, it becomes plain that we misapprehended the opinion and ruling of the lower court; also that the reason advanced to support our conclusion is insufficient. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue had refused to allow the deduction claimed because of addition to the reserve for unpaid loss claims (except liability claims-the net addition to which reserve was allowed). The Court of Claims, in a perplexing opinion approved the Commissioner's action. The finding that the insurance department of Pennsylvania pursuant to statute, had at all times since and including 1909 required claimant to keep on hand, as a condition of doing business in the state, 'assets as reserves sufficient to cover outstanding losses,' without more, was not sufficient to justify the deduction of the reserve as one required by law to be maintained, within the meaning of the act of Congress. This had been announced by McCoach v. Insurance Co.\n The Maryland Casualty Company's Case involved many items of complicated returns and reassessments. The record is confused, but the findings supply no adequate ground for any holding contrary to the general doctrine which we had theretofore approved. The principal business of the company was employers' liability, accident, and workmen's compensation insurance, and it may be that considering certain state statutes, practice and general understanding, the term 'reserve fund' when used relative to the affairs of such a company should be given broader significance than when it refers only to fire and marine insurance. But if relied upon these things should be shown. \n\n[269 U.S. 197, 204]\n\u00a0\n Appellee's claim is not well founded, and the judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BUTTERWORTH-JUDSON CORPORATION(1925)\nNo. 338\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., and The Attorney General, for appellants.\n Mr. William C. Breed, of New York City, for appellee National Newark & Essex Banking Co.\n Mr. David Paine, of New York City, for appellees Chase National Bank and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States, plaintiff below, and certain surety companies, defendants below, appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals ( 297 F. 971), affirming that of the District Court dismissing the complaint as to certain banks, defendants below, and dismissing counterclaims set up against the banks in the answers of the surety companies. The decree also dismissed counterclaims against the banks, set up in the answer of the \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n Butterworth-Judson Corporation and its receivers, defendants below They have not appealed.\n The controversy concerns the right of the banks, as against appellants, to set off against debts owing to them by the Butterworth- Judson Corporation the deposit balances remaining with them in special accounts.\n The Butterworth-Judson Corporation, a contractor, and the United States, made an agreement, dated May 9, 1918. The contractor agreed to select a site and, for a profit of $1 and no more, to design, construct, and equip thereon a plant for the production of picric acid, and to manufacture for the United States 72,000,000 pounds for 53 cents per pound. The entire cost of the plant was to be paid by the United States. The contractor was to make all necessary expenditures for the construction work, and the United States from time to time was to reimburse it therefor. The United States agreed to recommend to the War Credits Board an advance payment to the contractor of $1,500,000, upon such terms as the board might prescribe, and also agreed that, if the board should require interest on the advance payment, it would reimburse the contractor as a part of the cost and expense of the latter under the contract. The United States reserved the right to cancel the agreement at any time that its need for the plant or output ceased. It agreed in such event to reimburse the contractor for its expenditures, to assume all its outstanding obligations incurred under the contract, and to pay for all the picric acid wholly or partly manufactured, and it agreed in case of cancellation before 18,000,000 pounds were delivered, to pay three cents per pound for the undelivered portion up to that amount.\n The same parties made a supplementary agreement, dated May 22, 1918. The United States agreed to advance $1,500,000 to the contractor. The contractor agreed to account for the advance with interest, by applying that \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n amount to the payment of vouchers covering deliveries of picric acid. The contractor reserved the right at any time to repay in cash. If the United States did not recoup, through the deliveries of picric acid, the total amount of the advance with interest, the contractor was required to 'return to the government, on demand, any balance of the said advance and interest after deducting the total of any recoupments made as hereinabove provided together with all liquidated accounts that may be due and owing under the principal agreement from the government to the contractor.' The contractor agreed to give the United States, as collateral security for the recoupment or return of the above-mentioned advance and any interest due, it demand note for $1,500,000, bearing 6 per cent. interest, and to furnish a bond in the sum of $750,000, with surety for the performance of the agreement. The United States reserved the right, in case of failure of the contractor to comply with the agreement, to sell the note and apply the proceeds to the repayment of the advance, accounting to the contractor for the surplus, if any; but it agreed not to negotiate or demand payment of the note, so long as the contractor was not in default, and to return the note and bond upon complete performance. And the agreement contained the following:\n'The contractor shall deposit the money advanced hereunder in special accounts in banks, separate from its other funds, and shall draw on said accounts only in payment of expenditures made and obligations incurred in designing, constructing and equipping the plant specified in the principal agreement, and for other equipment and for material, labor and overhead expense, required in the direct performance of the principal agreement, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the War Credits Board.'\n\n It was stipulated that the contracting officer might require the contractor to deposit in the special accounts the funds paid by the government, reimbursing \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n the contractor for expenditures made from such advance payment. The contractor was to collect from the banks with which such accounts were kept such interest as is usually allowed for similar accounts, and credit or pay that interest to the government.\n The bonds provided for in the principal and supplementary agreements were furnished. The United States advanced $1,500,000 to the contractor, and the latter gave its note as agreed. The contractor deposited the money with defendant banks in special accounts, and entered upon the performance of the agreement. It made withdrawals from these accounts for the specified purposes, and from time to time deposited therein the sums paid to it by the United States in reimbursement of its expenditures. The banks at all times knew that the moneys deposited by the contractor in the special accounts consisted exclusively of the advance payment and replenishments, and that all deposits and balances in these accounts were held pursuant to the principal and supplementary agreements. Shortly after the Armistice, the plant being less than half completed, the United States terminated the principal agreement. No picric acid had been manufactured. The United States reimbursed the contractor and assumed all the latter's obligations under the principal agreement. It was shown in a creditors' suit in the District Court that the contractor was unable to pay its debts, and April 22, 1922, the court appointed receivers who are defendants in this case. Neither the contractor nor its receivers accounted to the United States for any part of the advance of $1,500,000 or interest, except $348,550, leaving unaccounted for, as the United States claims, $1, 151,450. The total of the balances in the special accounts on April 22, 1922, was $519,631.99. On that day, the contractor was indebted to each of the banks in an amount in excess of the balance in the special account with it, and each bank set off the amount of such deposit against the debt owed by the contractor. \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n The suit was for an accounting and to have the balances in the special accounts applied on the amount found unaccounted for and due the United States on the settlement of the account between it and the contractor. In affirming the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the advance payment was for supplies purchased and thereafter to be delivered, and that the Secretary of War had no authority to retain title to the moneys advanced and make the contractor agent of the United States for its disbursement; that the supplementary agreement created no relation of trust or agency between the parties, but only that of debtor and creditor. It held that the doctrine of trust or equitable lien or equitable assignment did not apply, and that the banks had the right of set-off. The appellants maintain that the United States had an equitable lien on the balances in the special accounts, and that the banks, having notice of the lien, could not set off the deposits against the debts owed them by the contractor.\n The advance payment was made under the authority of an Act of Congress of October 6, 1917,  5, c. 79, 40 Stat. 383 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6648a), which provides:\n'That the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy are authorized, during the period of the existing emergency, from appropriations available therefor to advance payments to contractors for supplies for their respective departments in amounts not exceeding thirty per centum of the contract price of such supplies: Provided, that such advances shall be made upon such terms as the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, respectively, shall prescribe and they shall require adequate security for the protection of the government for the payments so made.'\n\n The act was intended to relax during the period of the war the strict rule against advances of public money. See R. S.  3648 (Comp. St.  6647); The Floyd Acceptances, 7 Wall. 666. The act plainly authorized advance payments, such as that covered by \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n the supplementary agreement. It left the terms to the discretion of the Secretary of War, subject to the duty to require adequate security, but the act did not specify or limit the amount or kinds of security to be taken. A lien upon and right over the balances in the special accounts required to be kept is clearly within the meaning of the word 'security,' as used in the act. The power of the Secretary to exact such a lien or right in addition to the collateral note and surety bond cannot be doubted.\n The agreements made the balances in the special accounts security for the obligations of the contractor and so created an equitable lien in favor of the United States.\n The established rule as to the creation of equitable liens is stated in Walker v. Brown, \n165 \nU.S. 654, 664\n, 17 S. Ct. 453, 457:\n'The doctrine may be stated in its most general form that every express executory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting party sufficiently indicates an intention to make some particular property, real or personal, or fund, therein described or identified, a security for a debt or other obligation, or whereby the party promises to convey or assign or transfer the property as security, creates an equitable lien upon the property so indicated, which is enforceable against the property in the hands not only of the original contractor, but of his heirs, administrators, executors, voluntary assignees and purchasers or incumbrancers with notice.'\n\n See, also, Hauselt v. Harrison, \n105 U.S. 401\n, 405; Ingersoll v. Coram, \n211 \nU.S. 335, 368\n, 29 S. Ct. 92; Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.)  1233, 1234, 1235\n\n\n It may be assumed that the United States did not retain title to the advance payment, and that when it was made it became the property of the contractor, and also that the contract contemplated that the relation of debtor and creditor might arise. The contractor's obligation, subject to its right at any time to repay the government in cash, \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 394]\n\u00a0\n was to account for the amount of the advance with interest, by deliveries of the picric acid at the agreed price, or to return that amount to the United States, after making the authorized deductions, if any. The contractor's note and the surety bond were given to secure performance of the agreement. And the requirement, that the contractor deposit the money in special accounts in banks, separate from its other funds, and collect and account for interest on deposit balances, and draw on such accounts only for the purposes specified and return the balance of the advances, was additional security. It was to make more certain the performance of the agreement. The purpose and effect of the special accounts was to identify and keep separate the advance payment and replenishments, to limit the use of the fund to the purposes specified, and so to make it available as security to the United States. Failure of the agreement expressly to grant a lien on or declare these balances to be additional security is not significant. See Barnes v. Alexander, \n232 \nU.S. 117, 121\n, 34 S. Ct. 276. The Armistice came, and the United States terminated the agreement before there was any production at the plant. The advance and replenishments were not wholly expended, or accounted for by deliveries of picric acid. The contractor was bound to 'return' and the United States was entitled to demand and have 'any balance of the said advance' remaining after the deductions authorized. The agreements show that the parties contemplated that the need for picric acid might cease before the advance payment was covered by deliveries; and bound the contractor, in that event, to return the balances in the special accounts to the United States. This case is plainly within the rule.\n Ordinarily, the relation existing between banks and their depositors is that of debtor and creditor, out of which the right of set-off arises. As a general rule, in the \n\n[267 U.S. 387, 395]\n\u00a0\n absence of an agreement to the contrary, a deposit, not made specifically applicable to some other purpose, may be applied by the bank in payment of the indebtedness of the depositor. See Studley v. Boylston Bank, \n229 \nU.S. 523, 528\n, 33 S. Ct. 806; New York County Bank v. Massey, \n192 \nU.S. 138, 145\n, 24 S. Ct. 199; National Mahaiwe Bank v. Peck, 127 Mass. 298, 300, 34 Am. Rep. 368. But a bank having notice that a deposit is held by one for the use of or as security for another has only such right of set-off as is not inconsistent with the rights of the latter. Here, the banks had knowledge of the agreements, under which these balances constituted security for the advance made by the United States. By acceptance of the moneys furnished in accordance with the agreement, their right of set-off was made subject to the rights of the United States and the obligations of the contractor. See National Bank v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n, 71; Union Stockyards Bank v. Gillespie, \n137 \nU.S. 411, 421\n, 11 S. Ct. 118; Boyle v. Northwestern National Bank, 125 Wis. 498, 507, 103 N. W. 1123, 104 N. W. 917, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1110, 110 Am. St. Rep. 844. The appropriation of these balances by the banks cannot be sustained.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

The specified price was 'for each and every day of the charter period,' and the owner agreed 'to furnish everything for these tugs with the exception of coal and water which you are to furnish.'\n The vessels reported for service in accordance with the several contracts and the plaintiff rendered monthly bills \n\n[267 U.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n at the per dim rate stated therein. Those for December, 1917, were paid as rendered. Thereafter deductions were made which amounted in all to $24,822. 48. They were based upon the vessels' logs, kept by their captains and engineers as directed by the Army Transport Service, and were entered if a boat reported with a short crew, or not in condition to perform the service required, or if too long a time was consumed in taking on supplies. The owner saved its right through proper claims and protests.\n While in the service of the United States the Ira M. Hedges sank. It was raised and repaired by and at the expense of the owner, and was subsequently used by them. One of the challenged deductions was for loss of time incident to this accident.\n'During the time when the tugs hereinbefore mentioned were in the service of the government, the Army Transport Service had the entire use of the tugs and they were subject at all times to the orders and directions of the officers of the government, and at no time during the period did the plaintiff have the use of and [it] did not in any way interfere with or direct the operations of the said tugs.'\n\n The United States maintain that the owner did not part with possession, command and navigation during the charter periods; that the charter was for service, and not a demise; and that consequently they rightly made deductions for the time the vessels were not at their disposal.\n Relying upon the doctrine approved in United States v. Shea, \n152 \nU.S. 178\n, 14 S. Ct. 519, the Court of Claims concluded that the charter amounted to a demise and that the deductions were not permissible. It accordingly sustained the claim of the owner, appellee here. Accepting the facts as found, we agree with that conclusion and affirm the judgment. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Reed, both of Kansas City, Mo., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment was returned in the court below charging defendants in error as owner-editor and managing editor of several newspapers published at Kansas City, Mo., with printing and publishing therein parts of certain designated federal income-tax returns, showing the names of the taxpayers and the amounts of their income taxes. Demurrers were interposed to the indictment upon the ground that the facts set forth were not sufficient in law to charge any crime against the defendants, because the information so published was open to public inspection, constituted a public record available to the general public, and, consequently, was proper matter for news publication; and that, if any statute attempted to forbid or penalize such publication, it contravened the First Amendment to the federal Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. The court below sustained the demurrers and dismissed the indictment. 3 F. (2d) 190.\n The indictment is drawn under that part of section 1018 of the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 344-346, which re- enacts R. S.  3167, copied in the \n\n[268 U.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n margin. \n1\n Section 257(b) of the same act, 43 Stat. 293, provides:\n'The Commissioner shall as soon as practicable in each year cause to be prepared and made available to public inspection in such manner as he may determine, in the office of the collector in each internal revenue district and in such other places as he may determine, lists containing the name and the post office address of each person making an income tax return in such district, together with the amount of the income tax paid by such person.'\n\n The prohibition against publication contained in section 3167, it will be seen, is not absolute, but subject to possible qualification by other provisions of law. The language is that it shall be unlawful to print or publish in any manner 'not provided by law' any income return or any part thereof, etc. On behalf of defendants in error, it is contended that section 257(b) effects such a qualification. To this the government replies that the extent to which that provision goes is to authorize the Commissioner of Internal \n\n[268 U.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n Revenue to make available for public inspection lists showing names of taxpayers and amounts of taxes paid by them; and that this falls short of authorizing the printing and publishing of the information contained in the lists.\n Something is said in the briefs, and was said at the bar, as to the wisdom, on the one hand, of secrecy, and, on the other hand, of publicity, in respect of tax returns. But that is a matter addressed to the discretion of the lawmaking department, with which the courts are not concerned, so long as no constitutional right or privilege of the taxpayer is invaded; and there is no contention that there is any such invasion here, whichever view may be adopted. The problem, therefore, is, primarily, one of statutory construction, the disposition of which will determine whether the constitutional question as to the freedom of the press needs to be considered. For the purposes of the inquiry, we assume the power of Congress to forbid or to allow such publication, as in the judgment of that body the public interest may require.\n The Commissioner is directed to make the lists of taxpayers and amounts paid available for public inspection in the office of the collector and elsewhere as he may determine. His discretion in that respect is limited only by his own sense of what is wise and expedient. And the inquiry at once suggests itself: To what end is this discretion, so vested in him, to be exercised? The obvious answer is: To the end that the names and addresses of the taxpayers and the amounts paid by them may be generally known. To the extent of the information authorized to be put into the lists, this is the manifest policy of the statute, with which the application of section 3167 to the present case, it fairly may be argued, will be out of harmony. Whatever one's opinion may be in respect of its wisdom, the policy having been adopted as an aid to the enforcement of the revenue laws or to the accomplishment \n\n[268 U.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n of some other object deemed important, it is not easy to conclude that Congress nevertheless intended to exclude and severely to penalize the effective form of secondary publicity now under consideration. Information, which everybody is at liberty to acquire and the acquisition of which Congress seemed especially desirous of facilitating, in the absence of some clear and positive provision to the contrary, cannot be regarded otherwise than as public property, to be passed on to others as freely as the possessors of it may choose. The contrary view requires a very dry and literal reading of the statute quite inconsistent with its legislative history and the known and declared objects of its framers.\n Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, the policy in respect of tax publicity, as evidenced by congressional legislation, had not been uniform. Generally, the earlier acts had been liberal and the later ones restrictive in character. Section 3167, R. S., first appeared in substantially its present form in the Act of August 27, 1894,  34, c. 349, 28 Stat. 509, 557. It was re-enacted by the Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1919, and 1921, and by the existing Act of 1924. The Act of 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 177, provided that tax returns should be open to inspection only upon order of the President; but allowed state officers under certain conditions to have access to the returns showing the names and income of corporations, etc. The Act of 1919,  257, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1086, in addition to this, allowed stockholders of any corporation to examine its returns upon conditions therein stated. That act further provided (page 1087) that the Commissioner should cause to be prepared and made available to public inspection, etc., 'lists containing the names and the post office addresses of all individuals making income tax returns in such district'; and this was expanded by the present law, section 257(b), Act of 1924, to include the amount of the income tax paid. \n\n[268 U.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n It is significant that, while these progressively liberal publicity amendments were being made, section 3167-to the general rule of which they were in terms opposed-was carried along by re-enactment without change, plainly indicating that, in the opinion of Congress, by the application of the qualifying clause 'not provided by law,' the scope of the general rule against publication would become automatically narrowed to the extent of the liberalizing exceptions. The congressional proceedings and debates and the reports of the conferees on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, which we have examined but think it unnecessary to review, strongly confirm our conclusion that Congress, understanding that this limitation would apply, intended to open the information contained in the lists to full publicity.\n As a result, we hold that, to the extent provided by section 257(b), Congress meant to abandon the policy of secrecy altogetber and to exclude from the operation of section 3167 all forms of publicity, including that here in question.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 3167.

St.  1186). The case in the Court of Customs Appeals was an appeal from a decisions of the Board of General Appraisers, denying two petitions filed under section 489 of the Tariff Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 962 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  5841f-26). The parts of section 489 which are relevant here are inserted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The importer purchased at Hong Kong plaited peacock flues:\n 50 pounds at $26 per pound, July 9, 1922\n\n\n 48 pounds at $28 per pound, July 27, 1922. \n\n[268 U.S. 607, 609]\n\u00a0\n 50 pounds at $28 per pound, August 20, 1922.\n 36 pounds at $28 per pound, August 30, 1922.\n 27 pounds at $32 per pound, August 30, 1922.\n The importations were entered at the custom house by the importer's broker and the entered value stated in the entries was the invoice price paid for each lot of flues. All the goods were appraised at $32 per pound. Under paragraph 1419 of the Tariff Act of 1922 (42 Stat. 915 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923  5841a]), the duty on the peacock flues was 60 per cent. ad valorem. The appraised value of $32 a pound exceeded the entered value $ 28 a pound by 14 per cent. It exceeded the entered value of $26 a pound by 23 per cent. This increased the duty on the first 50 pounds from $960 to $ 1,328, and on the remaining undervalued 134 pounds $2,572 to $3,173 or a total on all entries of additional duties $968. This illustrates the importance of the conclusion of the board as to the intent of the importer in undervaluation under section 489. In due time after the appraisement the importer filed petitions to avoid the imposition of the additional duties. At the hearing before the board the only witness was the importer, who testified that when he bought he got quotations by cable; that the market changed rapidly, sometimes as much as 50 per cent.; that he had been importing for two years, and that this was the first instance in which there had been an advance in value by the appraiser; that he gave the broker the invoice and told him to make the entry, and that in so doing he did not intend to deceive the appraiser. This was all the evidence. The Board of General Appraisers denied the petition, on the ground that the broker who made the entry should have testified, and suggested that the most favorable view as to the importer's conduct was that he was very careless. The importer appealed. The government moved to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that there was no right to appeal. The court denied the \n\n[268 U.S. 607, 610]\n\u00a0\n motion to dismiss, holding that it had jurisdiction. On the merits the court found that the Board of General Appraisers erred in not finding whether there was or was not fraud or intent to deceive by the importer or his broker, and remanded the case for a new trial on that issue.\n The relevant parts of section 195, as amended, 38 Stat. 703, and of section 198 of the Judicial Code, adopted March 3, 1911, are as follows:\n'Sec. 195. The Court of Customs Appeals established by this chapter shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided, final decisions by a Board of General Appraisers in all cases as to the construction of the law and the facts respecting the classification of merchandise and the rate of duty imposed thereon under such classifications, and the fees and charges connected therewith, and all appealable questions as to the jurisdiction of said board, and all appealable questions as to the laws and regulations governing the collection of the customs revenues . ...\n\n'Sec. 198. If the importer, owner, consignee, or agent of any imported merchandise, or the collector or Secretary of the Treasury, shall be dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of General Appraisers as to the construction of the law and the facts respecting the classification of such merchandise and the rate of duty imposed thereon under such classification, or with any other appealable decision of said board, they, or either of them, may, within sixty days next after the entry of such decree or judgment, and not afterwards, apply to the Court of Customs Appeals for a review of the questions of law and fact involved in such decision. ...'\n\n Comp. St.  1186, 1189.\n The government insists that the action of the Board of General Appraisers under section 489 of the Tariff Act of 1922, does not involve such an exercise of judicial judgment as to be regarded as appealable under the general jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals. The suggestion \n\n[268 U.S. 607, 611]\n\u00a0\n is that, as the evidence to be submitted on the point at issue is to be under rules to be approved by the board, it is a matter confined to their action; that their discretionary power is to be exercised very much as the discretion is to be exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury on clerical errors under section 489, or as exercised by him on a question of intent of the importer in the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  III, I, 38 Stat. 114, 184 (Comp. St.  5527).\n The Court of Customs Appeals reached the conclusion that the decision of the board on the law and facts might affect the duty imposed on the imported articles so materially that Congress must have intended to give the importer the right to avail himself of the provision for appeal to the Court of Customs Appeals. We agree with that conclusion. We think that this is a decision of the law and the facts respecting the rate of duty imposed on classified merchandise imported, or at least that it concerns the fees and charges connected therewith. We think that it is a question relating to the laws and regulations governing the collection of customs revenues of importance and is appealable. It comes, therefore, under the several heads of the jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals, as defined in sections 195 and 198. We think that the interpretation of the expression 'appealable questions' as only including questions which are elsewhere referred to as appealable, is too narrow a view of the purpose of the statute. It would be unreasonable to suppose that in a Court of Appeals given the power to re-examine both the law and the facts on all the important issues raised in respect to duties was excluded from reviewing the issue of retaining or remitting a considerable percentage of those duties. This view is sustained by Brown & Co. v. United States, 12 Ct. Cust. App. 93, although the point there involved was only one of jurisdiction of the board.\n But it is said that this decision of the Board of Appeals is not a final decision, and that only final decisions are \n\n[268 U.S. 607, 612]\n\u00a0\n subject to review by the Court of Customs Appeals. Section 195 refers to final decisions; section 198, to decisions. But, even if the language of section 195 is to prevail, we think that under section 489 the decision of the Board of General Appraisers as to increase or decrease of duties is final, so far as the board is concerned. Such a decision under section 489 cannot take place until there is a final appraisement, because until that time there is no opportunity to determine whether the 1 per centum clause applies. But it is said that the decision is not really final until after the liquidation by the collector, and that liquidation in this case has not taken place. We do not think that the liquidation by the collector of the duties in such cases constitutes the final decision subject to appeal. Section 489 itself shows that the final decision of the board on this point may be before or after liquidation. This is not a case analogous to the final judgments in the ordinary practice of appellate courts, in respect to which it is held that cases appealed may not be taken up piecemeal. As the board may make a final decision on the point, we do not see why the Court of Customs Appeals has not jurisdiction at once to consider the ruling of the board and thus facilitate the ultimate liquidation of the duties if it has not already been completed.\n Upon the merits of the case, we think the Court of Customs Appeals was right and that the finding of the Board of General Appraisers did not respond to the requirement of the statute. The issue to be found by the board was whether the importer showed by his evidence that the entry of the merchandise at a less value than that returned upon final appraisement was without any intention to defraud the revenue of the United States or to conceal or misrepresent the facts of the case or to deceive the appraiser as to the value of the merchandise. The issue presented to the board was: 'Has the importer sustained the negative in this regard?' Merely to find that \n\n[268 U.S. 607, 613]\n\u00a0\n the importer was careless is not a finding sufficient to justify the board in deciding whether there should be a remission. Both the importer and the government are entitled to a finding either that there was no intent to defraud or that the importer did not sustain his burden that there was no such intent.\n The judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 489. Additional Duties. If the final appraised value of any article of imported merchandise which is subject to an ad valorem rate of duty or to a duty based upon or regulated in any manner by the value thereof shall exceed the entered value, there shall be levied, collected, and paid, in addition to the duties imposed by law on such merchandise, an additional duty of 1 per centum of the total final appraised value thereof for each 1 per centum that such final appraised value exceeds the value declared in the entry. Such additional duty shall apply only to the particular article or articles in each involice that are so advanced in value upon final appraisement and shall not be imposed on any article upon which the amount of duty imposed by law on account of the final appraised value does not exceed the amount of duty that would be imposed if the final appraised value did not exceed the entered value, and shall be limited to 75 per centum of the final appraised value of such article or articles. Such additional duties shall not be construed to be penal and shall not be remitted nor payment thereof in any way avoided, except in the case of a manifest clerical error, upon the order of the Secretary of the Treasury, or in any case upon the finding of the Board of General Appraisers, upon a petition filed and supported by satisfactory evidence under such rules as the board may prescribe, that the entry of the merchandise at a less value than that returned upon final appraisement was without any intention to defraud the revenue of the United States or to conceal or misrepresent the facts of the case or to deceive the appraiser as to the value of the merchandise. ... Upon the making of such order or finding, the additional duties shall be remitted or refunded, wholly or in part, and the entry shall be liquidated or reliquidated accordingly. ... \n\n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. FLANNERY(1925)\nNo. 527\nArgued: January 12, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n Mr. Edward B. Burling, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n James J. Flannery bought, prior to March 1, 1913, certain corporate stock for less than $95,175. Its market value on March 1, 1913 was $116, 325. He sold it in 1919 for $95,175 that is, for more than cost. He died in March, 1920. The executors of his estate in returning his income for the year 1919 deducted, as a loss, the difference between the market value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and the price received. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the loss claimed, and an additional tax was assessed. The executors paid this under protest, and thereafter, a claim for refund having been denied, brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the amount paid. Judgment was rendered in their favor. 59 Ct. Cl. 719.\n The question presented is whether, under the income tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918,1 a deductible loss was sustained by the sale of the stock in 1919 for more than it had cost by reason of the fact that on March 1, \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n 1913, between the dates of purchase and sale, it had a market value greater than the sale price.\n This Act provided that net income should include 'gains' derived from sales or dealings in property, sections 212(a), 213(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 f, 6336 1\/8 ff; that there should be allowed as deductions 'losses' sustained during the taxable year 'incurred in any transaction entered into for profit,' section 214(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 g; and that 'for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of property ... the basis shall be-(1) In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of that date; and (2) In the case of property acquired on or after that date, the cost thereof. ...' Section 202(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 bb.\n The United States contends that under section 214(a) there was no deductible loss whatever unless the taxpayer had sustained an actual 'loss' in the entire transaction by selling the property for less than it had cost, and that the effect of section 202(a) was merely that if such an actual loss had been sustained in selling property acquired before March 1, 1913, only so much thereof could be deducted as was sustained after the latter date, that is, the difference between the market value on that date and the sale price.\n The executors contend, on the other hand, that section 202(a) established the market value of such property on March 1, 1913, as the sole basis for ascertaining the loss sustained, without regard to its actual cost, and that if such market value was higher than the sale price, this conclusively determined that there had been a deductible 'loss' in the transaction, and fixed the amount thereof at the difference between the market value on that date and the sale price.\n It is clear, in the first place, that the provisions of the Act in reference to the gains derived and the losses sustained from the sale of property acquired before March 1, 1913, were correlative, and that whatever effect was intended to be given to the market value of property on \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n that date in determining taxable gains, a corresponding effect was intended to be given to such market value in determining deductible losses. This conclusion is unavoidable under the specific language of section 202( a) establishing one and the same basis for ascertaining both gains and losses.\n Taking this as a premise, we think that the question of determining taxable gains is concluded, in accordance with the contention of the Government, by the decisions of this Court in Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S. Ct. 390, and Walsh v. Brewster, \n255 \nU.S. 536\n, 41 S. Ct. 392. These cases, which were decided in 1921, arose under the income tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916.2 That Act provided, as did the Act of 1918, that the 'gains' derived from sales or dealings in property should be included in net income,3 and also that the losses actually sustained in transactions entered into for profit should be allowed as deductions. \n4\n In the Act of 1916, however, the provisions for the ascertainment of the gains derived and losses sustained from the sale of property were not contained, as in the Act of 1918, in one provision, but in separate clauses of the same tenor and effect as the combined provision in the Act of 1918. Section 2(c), being Comp. St.  6336b, provided that: 'For the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property ... acquired before' March 1, 1913, 'the fair market price or value of such property as of' March 1, 1913, 'shall be the basis for determining the amount of such gain derived.' The correlative clause relating to the ascertainment of loss was in precisely the same language except that the words 'the loss' and 'loss sustained' were used instead of the words 'the gain' and 'gain derived.'5- \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n In Goodrich v. Edwards, supra, in the second transaction involved, the taxpayer had acquired in 1912 certain corporate stock of the then value of $291,600. Its market value on March 1, 1913, was only $148,635.50. He sold it in 1916 for $269,346.25, being $22,253.75 less than its value when acquired, but $120,710.75 more than its value on March 1, 1913. A tax was assessed on the latter amount, which was sustained by the trial court. The Government confessed error in this judgment. After reciting this fact and setting forth the pertinent provisions of the Act, this court, in reversing the judgment, said:\n'It is ... very plain that the state imposes the income tax on the proceeds of the sale of personal property to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by the vendor, and we therefore agree with the Solicitor General that since no gain was realized on this investment by the plaintiff in error no tax should have been assessed against him. Section 2(c) is applicable only where a gain over the original capital investment has been realized after March 1, 1913, from a sale or other disposition of property.'\n\n This case was followed by Walsh v. Brewster, supra. In the first transaction there involved the taxpayer had purchased bonds in 1899 for $ 191,000, which he sold in 1916 for the same amount. Their market value on March 1, 1913, was $151,845. A tax was assessed on the difference between the latter amount and the selling price, namely, $39,155. This tax was held invalid, under the authority of Goodrich v. Edwards, on the specific ground that 'the owner of the stock did not realize any gain on his original investment by the sale in 1916.' In the second transaction involved the taxpayer had purchased certain bonds in 1902 and 1903 for $ 231,300, which he sold in 1916 for $276,150. Their market value on March 1, 1913, was $164,480. A tax was assessed upon the difference between the selling price and the market value of \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n the bonds on March 1, 1913. It was held however, that 'since the gain of the taxpayer was only the difference between his investment of $231,300 and the amount realized by the sale, $276,150,' under the authority of Goodrich v. Edwards, 'he was taxable only on $44,850,' the difference between the purchase and sale prices.\n These decisions are equally applicable to the Act of 1918. There is no difference in substance between the language of the two Acts in respect to the ascertainment of the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of property acquired before March 1, 1913; and the correlative nature of these two provisions is emphasized in the Act of 1918 by their combination in one and the same sentence. As it was held in these decisions that the Act of 1916 imposed a tax to the extent only that gains were derived from the sale, and that the provision as to the market value of the property on March 1, 1913, was applicable only where a gain had been realized over the original capital investment, so we think it should be held that the Act of 1918 imposed a tax and allowed a deduction to the extent only that an actual gain was derived or an actual loss sustained from the investment, and that the provision in reference to the market value on March 1, 1913, was applicable only where there was such an actual gain or loss, that is, that this provision was merely a limitation upon the amount of the actual gain or loss that would otherwise have been taxable or deductible.\n We cannot sustain the contention that the decision in Goodrich v. Edwards, is not entitled to controlling weight in the matter of deductible losses because of the Government's confession of error, or because it involved the question of taxable gains, as to which it is said, that under a different construction of the Act a grave constitutional question would have arisen which could have no application to the question of deductible losses. The decision shows that it was not based on the confession of error or \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 104]\n\u00a0\n on any constitutional question, but upon the conclusion that, as a matter of construction, it was 'very plain' that the statute imposed a tax upon the proceeds of sales 'to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by the vendor.' \n6\n The language of the opinion is specific and unambiguous; it embodied the reasoned judgment of the court as to the proper construction of the Act; and it applies equally to the construction of the similar provisions of the Act of 1918, relating to gains and losses alike.\n This was recognized by the Treasury Department, which promptly amended its former Regulations by incorporating therein 'the rule announced by the Supreme Court in the cases of Goodrich v. Edwards and Walsh v. Brewster respecting the basis for the determination of taxable gains or deductible losses in the case of property acquired prior to March 1, 1913, and sold or disposed of subsequent thereto.' 23 T. D. 763, 764. To the same effect is the opinion thereafter given to the Secretary of the Treasury by the Attorney General in reference to taxable gains and deductible losses under both of the Acts. 33 Op. Atty. Gen. 291. And, it may be noted, a like construction has been independently given by the courts of New York, without reference to any constitutional \n\n[268 U.S. 98, 105]\n\u00a0\n question, to the Income Tax Law of that State (Consol. Laws, c. 60,  350- 385), in which the provisions relating to gains derived and losses sustained from the sale of property, are a substantial transcript of those of the Act of 1918, except that January 1, 1919, is substituted for March 1, 1913; this construction being embodied in a series of decisions, the first of which, relating to taxable gains, was written before those in Goodrich v. Edwards and Walsh v. Brewster were announced. People ex rel. Klauber v. Wendell, 196 App. Div. 827, 188 N. Y. S. 301 (affirmed without opinion 232 N. Y. 549, 134 N. E. 567); People ex rel. Keim v. Wendell, 200 App. Div. 388, 193 N. Y. S. 143; Bush v. Law, 206 App. Div. 800, 201 N. Y. S. 513.\n It is unnecessary to consider in detail, as in a matter of first impression, various contentions urged in behalf of the executors in respect to the construction that should be given to the provisions of the Act of 1918 in reference to deductible losses. For the reasons stated we think that the question should be resolved according to the earlier decisions; and nothing has been suggested which disposes us to depart from them now. Decisions affecting the business interests of the country should not be disturbed except for the most cogent reasons. National Bank v. Whitney, \n103 U.S. 99\n, 102.\n Since Flannery sustained no actual loss in the transaction in question, having sold the stock for more than it had cost, his executors were not entitled to the deduction which they claimed because it was sold at less than its market value on March 1, 1913\n\n\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, tit. 2, 40 Stat. 1058 (Comp.

And this was followed by the statement that in the Government's view the similar provision relating to losses must be construed in the like manner, 'that is, it must first be ascertained by comparing the purchase and selling price that a loss on the entire transaction has been sustained.' \n\n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6309 5\/8 a, 6309 5\/8 c, 6371 1\/2 h). He also was convicted under section 47 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10214) of embezzling the amounts collected as taxes on the same occasions. Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321,  47, 35 Stat. 1097. The judgment was reversed and the District Court was directed to dismiss the indictment by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 290 F. 120. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court as the decision was said to be of grave importance to the administration of the revenue laws. \n263 \nU.S. 692\n, 44 S. Ct. 6.\n So far as the charge of embezzlement goes we think that the Court below and the intimation of the Treasury Department that it followed were clearly right. However it may have been under other statutes (United States v. Thomas, 15 Wall. 337), it seems to us that under this law the person required to pay over the tax is a \n\n[268 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n debtor and not a bailee. The money paid for the tax is not identified at the outset but is paid with the price of the ticket that belongs to the owner of the show. We see no ground for requiring the ticket office of a theatre to create a separate fund by laying aside the amount of the tax on each ticket and to keep it apart, either in a strong box or as a separate deposit in a bank. Reports are required only once a month, sections 802, 502 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  5309 5\/8 c, 6309 1\/3 c), which does not look as if the Government were dealing with these people otherwise than with others answerable for a tax. Further argument seems unnecessary upon this point.\n On the other counts we are of opinion that the Court below was wrong. We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and discuss specific facts. But the Court seems to have regarded the formal relations of Johnston to the Central Manhattan Boxing Club, Inc., made necessary by the laws of New York, as conclusive upon his relations to the United States. The laws of New York permitted a license only to a corporation, and so Johnston may have assumed the technical position of agent and manager for the Club. But if as a matter of fact all this was machinery to enable Johnston to give exhibitions, collect the entrance fees and make himself liable for the tax, it properly might be alleged that he collected the fees and if he wilfully failed to pay that he refused and failed to pay the tax. As the jury found Johnston guilty, although with an earnest recommendation of mercy, we are of opinion that the sentence and judgment of the District Court, which was much less than it might have been under section 1308(b), must be affirmed.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgment of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Hartfield, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were heard together in the Circuit Court of Appeals. They involve a single question relating to the extent of the priority of the United States in the collection of taxes in bankruptcy proceedings.\n In 1921, on an involuntary petition filed in the Southern District of New York, Finkelstein Brothers, a partnership, and the individual partners thereof were adjudged bankrupts. In 1923 the Collector of Internal \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n Revenue filed proof of claim for an income tax assessed against Abraham Finkelstein, one of the partners, for the year 1919. It is stipulated that the income on which this tax was based 'was derived from the business of the co-partnership.' No individual assets of Finkelstein had come into the hands of the trustee, and the partnership assets were insufficient to yield any surplus after the payment of the partnership debts. The Collector claimed that the tax against Finkelstein should be paid out of the partnership assets prior to the partnership debts. The referee denied this claim, and ordered that the partnership assets first be applied to the payment of the partnership debts. This order was affirmed by the District Judge.\n In 1923 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed in the same court against Jones & Baker, a partnership. A receiver was appointed, who collected and held the partnership assets. Before an adjudication of bankruptcy the partnership offered a composition to its creditors at less than the full amount of their claims. This was confirmed by the District Judge. Before the partnership assets were distributed, the Collector of Internal Revenue filed proofs of claims against the individual partners for income taxes assessed against them for the years 1918, 1919 and 1920. It does not appear that the income on which these taxes were based was derived from the business of the partnership. The Collector claimed that these taxes should be paid out of the partnership assets prior to the payments to the partnership creditors. The District Judge denied this claim of priority.\n On appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals both orders of the District Court were affirmed. 298 F. 11.

They were neither assessed against, nor due from, the partnerships. \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 411]\n\u00a0\n The tax assessed against Finkelstein was none the less an individual tax because the income on which it was based was derived from partnership business. The Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, c. 18,  218(a), being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 i, under which it was assessed, specifically provided that 'individuals carrying on business in partnership shall be liable for income tax only in their individual capacity.' The provision that in computing the income of each partner there should be included his distributive share of the income of the partnership, whether distributed or not, did not change the nature of the tax or make it one against the partnership.\n\n 2. \nThe Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585-9656) gives the United States no priority of payment out of partnership assets for a tax due from an individual partner. Section 64(a) being Comp. St.  9648, which provides that 'the court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to the United States ... in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors,' manifestly relates to the payment of the taxes out of the estate of the bankrupt from whom they are 'due and owing.' Where the bankrupt owing the tax is a member of a partnership, it gives the United States no priority of payment out of the partnership estate.\n The Bankruptcy Act clearly recognizes the separate entity of the partnership for the purpose of applying the long-established rule as to the prior claim of partnership debts on partnership assets and of individual debts on individual assets, and 'establishes on a firm basis the respective equities of the individual and firm creditors.' Francis v. McNeal, \n228 \nU.S. 695, 700\n, 33 S. Ct. 701, L. R. A. 1915E, 706; Schall v. Camors, \n251 \nU.S. 239, 254\n, 40 S. Ct. 135. Section 5f (section 9589) provides that:\n'The net proceeds of the partnership property shall be appropriated to the payment of the partnership debts, and the net proceeds of the individual estate of each partner to the payment of his individual debts. Should any surplus \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 412]\n\u00a0\n remain of the property of any partner after paying his individual debts, such surplus shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to the payment of partnership debts. Should [there be] any surplus of the partnership property remain after paying the partnership debts, such surplus shall be added to the assets of the individual partners in the proportion of their respective interests in the partnership.'\n\n The intention of Congress that the partnership assets shall be first applied to the satisfaction of the partnership debts, and that only the interests of the partners in the surplus remaining after the payment of partnership debts shall be applied in satisfaction of their individual debts, is plain.\n It is urged, however, on the authority of United States v. Herron, 20 Wall. 251, 255, and other cases, that as the United States is not named in this section of the Bankruptcy Act it is not bound by the rule for marshaling assets thereby established. But, however this may be, it is clear that, independently of the provisions of his section, the priority of payment of taxes given the United States by section 64(a) extends only to the bankrupt's share in the surplus of the assets of a partnership of which he is a member. This follows from the decision in United States v. Hack, 8 Pet. 271, 275, a case arising under the Act of March 2, 1799,1 providing that if the maker of any bond given to the United States for the payment of duties became insolvent or committed an act of bankruptcy, the debt due the United States on such bond should be first satisfied. The maker of such a bond had become insolvent. He had no individual property, and the assets of an insolvent partnership of which he was a member, were insufficient to pay the partnership creditors. It was held, on these facts, that the United States was not entitled to priority of satisfaction out of the partnership assets, since the Act merely gave it priority of payment \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 413]\n\u00a0\n out of the property of its debtor, and the rule was too well settled to be questioned, that his interest in the partnership property was his share in the surplus after the partnership debts were paid, and that such surplus only was liable for his separate debts. To the same effect is United States v. Evans, Crabbe, 60, 25 Fed. Cas. 1033, a case arising under the same Act. These decisions are directly applicable to section 3466 of the Revised Statutes, being Comp. St.  6372-on which the United States relies- which incorporated the provisions of the Act of 1799 and similar Acts of August 4, 1790 (1 Stat. 169) and March 3, 1797 (1 Stat. 512), in the general provision that whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied, and that this priority shall extend to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed. And in so far as this section, under the rule stated in Guarantee Co. v. Title Guaranty Co., \n224 \nU.S. 152\n, 32 S. Ct. 457, may now be applicable in bankruptcy proceedings, it must be held that any priority of payment to which the United States is entitled for a debt due it from an individual partner, extends only to his share in the surplus of the partnership assets.\n There is no conflict between the decisions in these cases and in Lewis v. United States, \n92 U.S. 618\n, 624, and In re Strassburger, 4 Woods, 557, 23 Fed. Cas. 224, on which the United States relies. In the Lewis Case the members of the firm of Jay Cooke & Co. had been adjudicated bankrupts, and a trustee had been appointed who held their individual assets and those of the firm as well. This firm was not indebted to the United States, but another firm, of which several of the bankrupts were members, was so indebted. On these facts it was held that the bankrupt members of such other firm, as to its indebtedness, stood to the United States in the relation of 'individual debtors,' and that under the priority given to debts due the United States by section 3466 of the Revised \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 414]\n\u00a0\n Statutes, recognized and reaffirmed in section 28 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 530), it was entitled, as a creditor of these individual bankrupts, to priority of payment out of their individual estates. There was, however, no suggestion that the United States as a creditor of these individual bankrupts was entitled to priority of satisfaction out of the partnership assets of Jay Cooke & Co. In the Strassburger Case, Mr. Justice Bradley, sitting at circuit, while explicitly recognizing the rule that where one member of a firm is indebted to the United States, its priority extends only to his interest in the surplus of the partnership assets, held that as the United States had a judgment against both members of the firm, it was entitled to priority of payment thereof out of their joint property in preference to their joint creditors. Whether a correct result was reached we need not inquire. And if to any extent the reasoning in this case may be in conflict with that in the Hack Case, it cannot be approved.\n Nor is the contention of the United States strengthened by the provision in section 3186 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 166, 37 Stat. 1016 (Comp. St.  5908), that the amount due the United States from any person as a tax shall be a lien on all property and rights to property belonging to such person. To whatever extent this statute may be now applicable in a bankruptcy proceeding, under its very terms the lien includes only the property of the person owing the tax; and in the case of a partner owing an individual tax, it extends only to his interest in the surplus of the partnership property.\n It results that in proceedings in bankruptcy against a partnership the partnership assets must be first applied to the payment of the partnership debts, and that the United States is not entitled to any priority of payment out of such assets for a tax due it from an individual partner, except to the extent of the share of such partner, if any, in the surplus remaining after the payment of the partnership debts. \n\n[267 U.S. 408, 415]\n\u00a0\n 3. The United States also relies, independently of the foregoing matters, upon the decision in Re Brezin (D. C.) 297 F. 300, 306, in which it was held that as the individual partners, instead of drawing out their distributive shares of the income of the partnership from year to year, had left a large portion thereof in the partnership business, the United States had a claim in the nature of an equitable lien for the collection of their individual income taxes which it could follow into the partnership property. Whether or not this case was correctly decided on its peculiar facts, it has no application to either of the present cases, in which no such facts appear.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 3 Laws, U.

In the Act of 1915 this provision reads:\n'Pay to Clerks, Messengers, and Laborers at Headquarters of the Several Territorial Departments, Territorial Districts, Tactical Divisions and Brigardes, Service Schools and Office of the Chief of Staff.\n\n'One chief clerk, at the office of the Chief of Staff, $2,000 per annum.

In all, $ 312,320.\n\n'Additional pay while on foreign service, $9,000.\n\n'Provided, That on and after July first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, the pay of clerks and messengers at headquarters of territorial departments, tactical divisions, brigades, and service schools, who are citizens of the United States, shall be increased $ 200 each per annum while serving in the Philippine Islands, such service to be computed from the date of departure from the continental limits of the United States to the date of return. ...\n\n'And said clerks, messengers, and laborers shall be employed and assigned by the Secretary of War to the offices and positions in which they are to serve. ...'\n\n By a separate provision in the Act a lump sum appropriation of $1,833, 127 was made for incidental expenses of the quartermaster corps, including the 'hire of laborers' and 'compensation of clerks and other employees to the officers' (page 363.)1\n Morrow, a citizen of the United States, went to the Philippine Islands in 1899. From May 15, 1914, to January 17, 1917, he served as chief clerk of the depot quartermaster's office, at the headquarters of the Philippine Department of the Army, in Manila. He received a salary of $ 2,000 a year, which was fixed by the War Department and paid out of the lump sum appropriations for the quartermaster corps. Later he submitted to the Auditor a claim for additional pay at the rate of $200 a year for the period of his service after July 1, 1914, under \n\n[266 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n the proviso in the acts increasing the pay of clerks and messengers at headquarters of territorial departments while serving in the Philippine Islands. This was allowed and paid; but was thereafter charged against him as having been erroneously paid, and deducted from the pay then accruing to him as a captain in the quartermaster's corps. Thereupon he brought this action to recover the amount claimed, and was awarded judgment. 58 Ct. Cl. 20.\n It is conceded that Morrow was a clerk in the quartermaster corps, and not one of the headquarters2 clerks included within the first paragraph of the appropriation.\n The contention of the United States3 is that the proviso applied only to the headquarters clerks and messengers employed at the statutory salaries fixed by the appropriation, and did not include clerks in the quartermaster corps employed at salaries fixed by the War Department; that is, that it merely increased the statutory salaries of the clerks and messengers provided for by the specific appropriation when they should serve in the Philippine Islands.\n This we think is its plain meaning. The general office of a proviso is to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify and restrain its generality and prevent misinterpretation. Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445; Georgia Banking Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 9 S. Ct. 47; White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545, 551\n, 24 S. Ct. 171; Cox v.

Whitridge, \n197 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 25 S. Ct. 406. And although sometimes used to introduce independent legislation, the presumption is that, in accordance with its primary purpose, it refers only to the provision to which it is attached. United States v. Falk, \n204 \nU.S. 143, 149\n, 27 S. Ct. 191. Here it clearly appears that the proviso was employed in its primary sense. The entire context shows that it was intended to apply only to the headquarters clerks and messengers employed at the statutory salaries fixed by the special appropriation, and related to the $9,000 provided for the additional pay of such employees while on foreign service; and it plainly had no reference to clerks and messengers in the quartermaster corps whose salaries were fixed by the War Department under the lump sum appropriation.\n This is emphasized when the proviso is examined in the light of prior legislation, the condition it was evidently intended to correct, and its legislative history. Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, \n240 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Work v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S. Ct. 39, 69 L. Ed. --, Nov. 17, 1924. In all of the Army Appropriation Acts from 1895 to 1914 special appropriations were made for a designated number of clerks and messengers at headquarters and army stations, at specified rates of pay; but no provision for any increase in their pay while on foreign service. Lump sum appropriations were also made for staff corps and departments, including the quartermaster corps, under which clerks and messengers were employed at rates of pay fixed by the War Department. In 1904 the War Department issued an order under which clerks in the staff corps and departments paid under the lump sum appropriations were granted an increase of $200 in their annual compensation when transferred to the Philippines. This, however, could not be applied to the headquarters clerks whose salaries were fixed by the specific appropriations. In 1912 the Secretary of War wrote to \n\n[266 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n the Speaker of the House of Representatives, stating that the pay of the headquarters clerks who were serving in the Philippines was not commensurate with their work and less than that of any other similar government employees in the Islands, and that as there were 'no means' by which the War Department could remedy this condition, he recommended that Congress insert in the next appropriation for headquarters employees a proviso that the pay of such clerks and messengers be increased 20 per centum while serving in the Philippines. This recommendation was renewed by the succeeding Secretary of War, prior to the consideration of the Army Appropriation Bill for 1915.4 Thereafter Congress added to the appropriation the $9,000 for additional pay while on foreign service, and the proviso relating to the increase of pay while serving in the Philippines, in the form in which they have been quoted; these additions being adopted after the proposed increase had been changed, on a report of the Conference Committee, from 20 per centum, the amount recommended by the Secretaries, to $200 a year, the increase given by the War Department to clerks in the staff corps and departments. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of this history there is no room to doubt-even if it were not plain from the face of the Act itself-that the proviso was intended to apply merely to the headquarters clerks and messengers included within the specific appropriation. It manifestly was not intended that clerks in the staff corps and departments should receive, in addition to the $200 increase given them by the War Department, a second increase of like amount under the terms of the proviso.\n It is entirely clear that Morrow's service in the quartermaster's office in the Philippines was not within the scope \n\n[266 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n of the proviso. It is unnecessary to review in detail the various contentions urged in his behalf. We do not find them sufficient to sustain the judgment; and it must be and is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A like provision was contained in the Act of 1916 (p. 1074). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The term 'headquarters' is used in this opinion as including the various army stations mentioned in the special appropriations. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In the Court of Claims the United States contended that Morrow did not come within the proviso because he was residing in the Philippine Islands when appointed to the clerkship. This was apparently the sole contention then made; but, although repeated in the brief here, it was expressly abandoned by the United States in the argument at bar. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 63d Cong., 1st Sess., H.

Ansell, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Daniel Noce was major of engineers in the United States Army in the emergency establishment from May 18, 1920, until June 30, 1920, when he returned to a captaincy in the regular establishment. He sued the United States in the Court of Claims for $467.66 as longevity pay, alleged to be due him under the law over and above the pay he received. He was appointed cadet at the West Point Military Academy August 1, 1913. He was graduated April 20, 1917. If he can count for longevity pay his cadet service from August 1, 1913, to April 20, 1917, he will be entitled to the amount he claims from the date of approval of the Act of Congress (section 11, c. 190, 41 Stat. 601, 603; Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  2089a\n\n[268 U.S. 613, 1]\n\u00a0\n, 8562ee), May 18, 1920, to April 19, 1922, the period covered by this suit. The accounting officers denied the claim.\n The Court of Claims found that under the act claimant's cadet service must be counted, and gave judgment for him. The United States has appealed, and urges a reversal, on the ground that such a conclusion is forbidden by the Army Appropriation Act of August 24, 1912, c. 391,  6, 37 Stat. 569, 594 (Comp. St.  1923), which provides:\n'That hereafter the service of a cadet who may hereafter be appointed to the United States Military Academy, or to the Naval Academy, shall not be counted in computing for any purpose the length of service of any officer of the Army.'\n\n A similar provision was made in the Naval Appropriation Act of March 4, 1913, c. 148, 37 Stat. 891 (Comp. St.  2619), as follows:\n'Hereafter the service of a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, or that of a cadet at the United States Military Academy, who may hereafter be appointed \n\n[268 U.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n to the United States Naval Academy, or to the United States Military Academy, shall not be counted in computing for any purpose the length of service of any officer in the Navy or in the Marine Corps.'\n\n The Court of Claims held that these two provisions held been repealed by the Act of May 18, 1920, already referred to. The act is entitled 'To increase the efficiency of the commissioned and enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Public Health Service.' It increased the pay of certain commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Public Health Service, mentioning in detail the ranks affected and the increases provided. It provided for a temporary commutation of quarters, heat, and light theretofore granted to Army officers on duty in the filed to those of the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service. It gave warrant officers of the Navy an increase, in addition to all pay allowances, of $240 per annum. It increased the pay of all enlisted men of the Army and Marine Corps and of female nurses 20 per centum, with certain exceptions. It increased the commutation rations of noncommissioned officers of the Army, of the Marine Corps, and of filed clerks of the Army and the Quartermaster Corps. It gave a new base pay for enlisted ratings of petty officers and noncommissioned officers and of enlisted men in the Navy, of the Naval Academy band, and of the Fleet Naval Reserve. It authorized the Secretary of the Navy in his discretion to readjust the prevailing rates of pay of civilian professors and instructors of the Naval Academy. In section 8 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8459 1\/2a [3 1\/2], [3 3\/4]) it provided that the Coast Guard should have the same pay ratings to correspond with the Navy and mentioned the officers. Then by section 11 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8562ee and section 2089a\n\n[268 U.S. 613, 1]\n\u00a0\n) it provided as follows:\n'Sec. 11. That in lieu of compensation now prescribed by law, commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey shall receive the same pay and allowances as now \n\n[268 U.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n are or hereafter may be prescribed for officers of the navy with whom they hold relative rank as prescribed in the Act of May 22, 1917, entitled 'An act to temporarily increase the commissioned and warrant and enlisted strength of the Navy and Marine Corps, and for other purposes,' including longevity; and all laws relating to the retirement of commissioned officers of the Navy shall hereafter apply to commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey: Provided, that hereafter longevity pay for officers in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and Coast and Geodetic Survey shall be based on the total of all service in any or all of said services.'\n\n It is this proviso which it is said repealed the laws of 1912 and 1913 above quoted. It is urged that the words 'longevity pay shall be based on the total of all service in any or all of said services' are inconsistent with the exclusion of service in the Military Academy or in the Naval Academy from the calculation of longevity pay.\n We are unable to put such a construction on this proviso. The whole act was intended to promote equality between the six services. After equalizing their pay, it was intended to give any officer or any man in either of the services the benefit of longevity increases for any service which he might have had in any other of the services. The Report of the Managers of the House of Representatives as to section 11 and its proviso ( H. R. 948, 66th Congress, 2d Sess.) said:\n'It provides that commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, a highly technical and specialized service, shall receive the same pay and allowances as are prescribed for officers of the Navy with whom they hold relative rank as prescribed in the Act of May 22, 1917. It also contains a proviso placing all services on an equality in the matter of computation of longevity or service pay.' \n\n[268 U.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n In other words, the longevity pay of a member of any service was to be determined by his total service in any or all of the services. It was not dealing with the rules as to the longevity in any one service. It was to make the calculation of longevity as if the six services were but one service. It was not aiming at any inequality within a service, but at an inequality between services. No reference is made to cadet service, and nothing to indicate that Congress had it in mind.\n\n The question whether service in either of the Academies was Army or Navy service which should count for longevity pay and retirement was a long-standing issue between the officers of the Army and Navy who were graduates of the two Academies on the one hand and the officers who were not graduates and the accounting officers of the Treasury on the other. This is evident from the decision of this court in United States v. Morton, \n112 \nU.S. 1\n, 5 S. Ct. 1, and United States v. Watson, \n130 \nU.S. 80\n, 9 S. Ct. 430. The legislative history of the act of 1912 and that of 1913 shows that the question was much contested between the two houses. The Report of the House Committee on Military Affairs (H. R. 270, 62d Congress, 2d Sess.) gives an extended argument against the practice of computing cadet service for pay and retirement purposes. It said:\n'The result of this practice is that a graduate of the Military Academy who was appointed a second lieutenant, after having been educated for that appointment for four or more years wholly at the expense of the government, receives his first 10 per cent. increase of pay after not more than one year of service as a commissioned officer, whereas the second lieutenant who is appointed from civil life, after having been fitted for the appointment wholly at his own expense, must serve for five full years as a commissioned officer before he can receive his first 10 per cent. increase of pay. And the same disparity between the two cases continues to the end.' \n\n[268 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n After pointing out other discriminations arising from this practice, the report continues:\n\n'It is but just to say that this preposterous practice did not originate with the War Department. It was the result of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court October 27, 1884 (Morton v. United States, \n112 U.S. 1\n), to the effect that the time during which a person has served as a cadet is to be regarded as 'actual time of service in the army.' ...'\n\n After referring specifically to retirement, the report says:\n'These are additional discriminations against the civilian appointee who pays for his own preliminary education and in favor of the graduate of the Military Academy who is educated for his commission at the expense of the government.'\n\n In view of this long-continued controversy, which before 1912 had finally been settled only by two decisions of this court, it is inconceivable that the two acts of 1912 and 1913, nullifying the effect of those decisions, and passed after a heated struggle, should have been repealed without mention of the cadet service in the proviso now said to have worked this result. As already pointed out, the act of which this was a part was detailed in its reference to the commissioned officers, the noncommissioned officers, and to the enlisted men of the various six services affected, and to the pay and increases which they were to receive. Had it been intended to increase the 'fogey' pay, as the longevity pay is called, for only a part of the commissioned officers of the Army and only a part of the commissioned officers of the Navy, and only a part of the commissioned officers of the Marine Corps in such a specific act, the favor thus to be conferred upon them would certainly have been set forth in language whose meaning could not be mistaken.\n It is, indeed, very difficult to say that there is any real inconsistency between the proviso of 1920 and the acts of \n\n[268 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n 1912 and 1913. It is supposed to be shown in the use of the words 'any or all the services' and it is said that, as 'any' may mean one or more, it may apply to the Army alone, and can only be satisfied by making it apply to the total service in the Army alone and must therefore mean service in the Army as construed by this court in the Morton Case and the Watson Case, in which it was held that, under then existing legislation, service in the Military Academy was service in the Army. This, it seems to us, is a strained method of first finding an inconsistency, by no means clear if it exists at all, and then erecting it into an implied repeal. Implied repeals are not favored.

St.  6204) and was paid in the usual way by stamps for the amount, bought and attached to the original packages before they were removed from the factory. An additional tax of 80 cents per thousand was imposed by the Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,  400, 40 St. 300, 312. The cigarettes had not been removed, and the Company paid the additional tax but without attaching new stamps, the practice being to treat the payment as so much added to the cost of the old ones. Then the Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, tit. 7,  700, 40 St. 1057, 1116 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6204c), in lieu of the internal- revenue taxes then imposed, raised the tax to $3 per thousand to be paid as before by attaching and canceling stamps. By  702 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6204a), if the goods had been removed from the factory and were held for sale on the day after the Act, a 'floor tax' equal to the difference between the sum already paid and $3 was to be paid. These goods had been removed and the Company having previously paid $2.05 paid the additional 95 cents. Between August 29 and November 21, 1919, these cigarettes were exported. By Rev. Sts.  3386, amended, Act of March 1, 1879, c. 125,  16, 20 Stat. 347 (Comp. St.  6195), a drawback on tobacco, etc., on which the tax has been paid by suitable stamps, etc., affixed before removal, is allowed, 'equal in amount to the value of the \n\n[267 U.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n stamps found to have been so affixed.' The Commissioner of Internal Revenue allowed the claim for the $2.05 paid under the two earlier Acts, but rejected that for the 95 cents paid under the last. The Court of Claims gave the Company judgment for $145,397.50, the amount of the rejected claim.\n The argument for the Government stands on a strict adhesion to the letter of the statute giving the drawback and a narrow interpretation of even the letter of the Act. It contends that only the value of the stamps attached before removal from the factory can be recovered, and while admitting that the second payment made after the stamps had been bought and attached can be taken as adding to their value, it denies that the payment of what the statute calls a floor tax, paid after removal of the goods, can be added in a similar way. But we are of opinion that the Court of Claims was right. When it is considered that at the time the Act allowing the drawback was passed the tax was collected wholly by stamps, it seems evident that Congress meant to carry the policy of the Constitution against taxing exports beyond its strict requirement and to let the event decide about the tax. In this case if the cigarettes still had been in the factory, the additional payment would have been treated as made for the stamps already on, if that fiction was necessary to secure the rebate. We see no insuperable difficulty in adopting the same device for a payment of the same amount under the same Act by the same people for the same goods, after they had left the factory. And if the payment should be made by a third person who had purchased from the manufacturer it seems to us that if necessary he also might be taken to stand in the manufacturer's shoes, and still to make the payment on account of the stamps. Our opinion perhaps gets some confirmation from  1310(c) \n\n[267 U.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n of the Act of 1919 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6371 1\/2 k), but we rest it upon what we have said.\n A protest was not necessary at the time of payment because apart from other reasons at that time the event creating the right to the drawback had not come to pass.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ROYER(1925)\nNo. 359\nArgued: April 30, 1925Decided: May 25, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On August 5, 1918, General Pershing, commanding the American Expeditionary Forces, recommended by cable to the Chief of Staff the appointment of respondent, then first lieutenant, as major in the Medical Reserve Corps. The Surgeon General of the Army, to whom the recommendation was referred, recommended an approval of the appointment of respondent as captain, and this was ratified by the Secretary of War. On September 23, 1918, the Adjutant General cabled General Pershing that the appointment as major had been made, and five days later the Surgeon General's office in France notified the respondent that he had been commissioned as major and requested him to submit his letter of acceptance and oath of office without delay. Respondent submitted a letter of acceptance and executed an oath of office on October 18, 1918, and thereupon assumed the insignia of rank of major, performed the duties appropriate to that office, and was so officially addressed. In fact, respondent had been appointed captain and not major; but subsequently, on February 17, 1919, he was promoted to the rank of major. \n\n[268 U.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n He was not informed until February 19, 1919, that there had been a mistake in the first aotice of his appointment as major. He was paid by the pay officers as major during his entire service from October 18, 1918, to the date of his discharge on August 31, 1919. On the latter date there was deducted from his pay, as an overpayment, the sum of $240.19, being the difference between the pay of a captain and that of a major from October 18, 1918, to February 16, 1919. This suit was to recover that amount. The court below, upon the foregoing facts, gave judgment for respondent upon the ground that--\n'Having been ordered by competent authority to assume the rank of major and having discharged the duties of that rank in good faith in time of war, and having been paid the emoluments of that rank in good faith by the officers who are intrusted with the duty of making such payments, he cannot be required to return the money so received to the government.' Royer v. United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 199.\n\n The Adjutant General, from the nature of his office, is the appropriate channel through which information in respect of appointments and promotions is transmitted. U. S. Army Regulations, 1913, p. 14, par. 21; Dig. Op. Judge Advocate General, 1912, pp. 87, 88. That officer having informed General Pershing that the appointment of respondent as major had been made, General Pershing was warranted in giving notice to respondent that he had been so appointed, and respondent was justified in accepting and acting upon it. Indeed in time of war and in the field of actual military operations it was his duty to do so. Was respondent, under these circumstances, a major de facto? The government contends not upon the grounds: (1) There was no attempt to appoint him to the office of major by any officer possessing the power of appointment; (2) there is no proof that there was a vacancy in the office of major. Neither ground is tenable. \n\n[268 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n 1. While some general expressions will be found in the decisions tending to support the government's contention, the rule is well established that to constitute an officer de facto it is not a necessary prerequisite that there shall have been an attempted exercise of competent or prima facie power of appointment or election. The leading case is State v. Carroll, 38 Conn. 449, 456-466, 472, 9 Am. Rep. 409, where the English and American cases are fully reviewed; In re Ah Lee (D. C.) 5 F. 899, 907 et seq.; Heard v. Elliott, 116 Tenn. 150, 154, 92 S. W. 764. A good general definition is to be found in Waite v. City of Santa Cruz (C. C.) 89 F. 619, 627, expressly approved by this court in Waite v. Santa Cruz, \n184 \nU.S. 302, 323\n, 22 S. Ct. 327, 334 (49 L. Ed. 552):\n'A de facto officer may be defined as one whose title is not good in law, but who is in fact in the unobstructed possession of an office and discharging its duties in full view of the public, in such manner and under such circumstances as not to present the appearance of being an intruder or usurper.'\n\n A shorter definition is that of the Supreme Court of Kansas, in Jay v. Board of Education, 46 Kan. 525, 527, 26 P. 1025, 1026:\n'A de facto officer is one who is surrounded with the insignia of office, and seems to act with authority.'\n\n Here, respondent occupied the office and discharged its duties in good faith and with every appearance of acting with authority; and, upon the facts heretofore recited, since he was not a mere intruder or usurper, he must be regarded as an officer de facto, within the spirit of the general current of authority.\n\n 2. \nOf course, there can be no incumbent de facto of an office if there be no office to fill. Norton v. Shelby County, \n118 \nU.S. 425, 441\n, 6 S. Ct. 1121. But the contention that there is no evidence of a vacancy in the office of major in the present case cannot be seriously considered. Everything was done upon the theory that there was such a vacancy; the Commanding General evidently determined that there was; and respondent entered upon and actually performed the duties of that office by direction \n\n[268 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n of his superior officers. These facts are enough to establish the existence of the vacancy, for it is a well-settled rule that all necessary prerequisites to the validity of official acts are presumed to exist, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Nofire v. United States, \n164 U.S. 657\n, 660-661, 17 S. Ct. 212.\n We need not determine whether respondent might have maintained an action against the government for unpaid salary; but, clearly, the money having been paid for services actually rendered in an office held de facto, and the government presumably having benefited to the extent of the payment, in equity and good conscience he should not be required to refund it. In substance the case is ruled by Badeau v. United States, \n130 \nU.S. 439, 452\n, 9 S. Ct. 579, 583 (32 L. Ed. 997), where this court, referring to a similar situation, said:\n'But inasmuch as the claimant, if not an officer de jure, acted as an officer de facto, we are not inclined to hold that he has received money which, ex aequo et bono, he ought to return.'\n\n See, also, Montgomery v. United States, 19 Ct. Cl. 370, 376; Bennett v. United States, 19 Ct. Cl. 379, 388; Palen v. United States, 19 Ct.

They present, on substantially similar facts, the question whether interurban electric railroads engaged in interstate commerce are subject generally to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Each case is a direct appeal, under Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, from a final decree of the federal court for Northern Ohio setting aside an order of the Commission. In each the plaintiff below was an Ohio municipality, and the carrier, who intervened as defendant, an independent interurban electric railroad. The carriers operate lines within and between Ohio municipalities, and also between these and a city in an adjoining state. The orders require the carriers to raise intrastate interurban passenger fares which, as the Commission found, subject interstate commerce to unjust discrimination. Fares within the Ohio municipalities are not affected. Ohio Rates, Fares, and Charges, 64 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 493; Ohio and Pennsylvania Rates, Fares, and Charges, 64 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 517.\n The Commission granted the relief under the rule of The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833, and Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086. The District Court held the orders void, on the ground that the jurisdiction conferred by Congress upon the Commission did not extend to interurban electric railroads of the character of those here involved; that its jurisdiction was limited to those which are operated as part of a general steam railroad system, \n\n[266 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n or which, if operated independently, are engaged in the general transportation of freight, in addition to their passenger and express business; and that these carriers possessed neither of 'these dominating characteristics.' Village of Hubbard, Ohio, v. United States et al. (D. C.) 278 F. 754; City of Wellsville, Ohio, v. United States et al. (D. C.) 278 F. 769. We have no occasion to inquire into the correctness of the latter ruling, as we are of opinion that the Commission's jurisdiction to prevent unjust discrimination by interurban electric railroads against interstate commerce is not so limited. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In 1897, the Commission assumed jurisdiction over the passenger fares of an electric railroad which operated between the District of Columbia and a neighboring village in Maryland. Willson v. Rock Creek Ry. Co., 7 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 83. The development of interurban roads became general about 1902.2 The authority to regulate them has been consistently exercised by the Commission in many cases and for many purposes. Since 1915, interurban electric roads have been required to file with it annual reports of their finances and operations. \n3\n Jurisdiction over Urban Electric Lines, 33 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 536. In exercising authority over their passenger fares, no distinction has been made between those interurban roads which were engaged in the general transportation of freight in addition to their \n\n[266 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n passenger and express business and those which were not. \n4\n On the other hand the distinction suggested in Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n230 \nU.S. 324, 337\n, 33 S. Ct. 890, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 385, between interurban railroads and urban or suburban street railways has been carefully observed.\n Neither in the Act to Regulate Commerce Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, nor in any amendments thereto prior to that of Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 552, is there any specific reference to electric railroads. The basis for the jurisdiction of the Commission over them is the generality of the language of the original act, which declared in section 1 (Comp. St.  8563) that its provisions 'shall apply to any common carried engaged in the transportation of passengers or of property ... by railroad.' As the act made no distinction between railroads operated by steam and those operated by electricity, the \n\n[266 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n Commission made none. Similarly, the words 'common carrier by railroad' contained in the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, being Comp. St.  8657-8665 (Kansas City Ry. Co. v. McAdow, \n240 \nU.S. 51\n, 36 S. Ct. 252), in the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531, c. 196, as amended by Act March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943, being Comp. St.  8613-8615 (Spokane & Inland Empire R. Co. v. Campbell, \n241 \nU.S. 497\n, 36 S. Ct. 683), and in Hours of Service Act March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415, being Comp. St.  8677-8680 (Denver & Interurban Ry. Co. v. United States, 236 F. 685, 150 C. C. A. 17), were applied to interurban electric railroads.\n The correctness of the Commission's action in assuming jurisdiction over the interurban roads is confirmed by the action of Congress which, in recent amendments of the Act to Regulate Commerce, limited, in respect to certain subjects, the authority over them. The Commission entertained, in 1908, applications of interurban electric railroads to establish for freight through routes and joint rates with steam railroads. \n5\n The Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 551, 552 (Comp. St.  8583) provided that 'the Commission shall not, ... establish any through route, classification, or rate between street electric passenger railways not engaged in ... transporting freight in addition to their passenger and express business and railroads of a different character.' \n6\n Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et seq.), enlarged, in several respects, the powers of the Commission, and dealt also in other ways with carriers engaged in interstate commerce. In doing so, it provided expressly in five sections for the exclusion of certain electric railways from the \n\n[266 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n operation of the powers conferred; and it also differentiated interurban electric railways from street and suburban railways by specific reference to each, although a distinction in treatment was made in only one case. \n7\n These provisions indicate that Congress did not intend to deny to the Commission the power to regulate interurban railways in other respects.\nREVERSED.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n In Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Railway Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n230 \nU.S. 324\n, 33 S. Ct. 890, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 385, decided June 9, 1913, this court pointed out the radical difference between street railroads and common carriers by railroad and, for the potent reasons indicated, held the latter were within \n\n[266 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.) and the former were not. The distinction is certainly a sound one and, I think, it was rightly observed by the court below.\n Since the opinion in 1913 Congress has given much consideration to the Interstate Commerce Act, but nowhere do I find expression of a definite purpose to disregard the limitations there approved. The question is highly important; the subject-matter is essentially local in nature; the states can and should control until and unless Congress, by clear language, shall indicate its intent to regulate. The creators ought not be deprived of power over their own creatures as to domestic traffic permitted only under carefully considered contracts, because of detached and obscure sentences found here and there in a general enactment designed for carriers whose lines constitute integral parts of the great interstate railway system of the country. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It was also contended that because the intrastate fares has been fixed by contract between the municipalities and the carriers (Interurban Railway & Terminal Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 98 Ohio St. 287, 120 N. E. 831, 3 A. L. R. 696), Congress was without power to authorize an increase of the fares. The unsoundness of this contention was settled in New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591\n, 42 S. Ct. 239. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 77 Commercial & Financial Chronicle, July 25, 1903, p. 172; Louis E.

Ct. 638\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n This decision is in conflict with the earlier decisions in Franco v. Shipping Corporation (D. C.) 272 F. 542, and Castner v. Hamilton (D. C.) 275 F. 203, in which the Act was applied to aliens brought in as seamen on American vessels.\n The question of construction presented is whether the term 'alien seamen,' as used in the Act, means seamen who are aliens, as the Government contends, or seamen on foreign vessels, as the Steamship Company contends: that is, whether in applying the Act the test is the citizenship of the seaman or the nationality of the vessel.\n We think the term 'alien seamen' is not to be construed as meaning seamen on foreign vessels. The general principle that an alien while a seaman on an American vessel is regarded as being an American seaman in such sense that he is under the protection and subject to the laws of the United States, In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 479\n, 11 S. Ct. 897, has no application to the question whether aliens employed on American vessels are included within the terms of a special statute dealing solely and specifically with 'alien seamen,' as such. And if the rule attributing to a seaman the nationality of the vessel should be applied to this Act so as to give to the term 'alien seamen' the meaning of 'seamen on foreign vessels,' it would result, under the terms of its last clause, that an American seaman employed on a foreign vessel who was afflicted with an incurable disease, on being brought into an American port could not be admitted into the United States, but would have to be returned; an anomalous result which, obviously, Congress did not intend.\n It is clear that the term 'alien seamen' as used in the Act means 'seamen who are aliens.' It describes, aptly and exactly, seamen of alien nationality, dealing with them, as individuals, with reference to their personal citizenship; and it has no other significance either in common usage or in law. The Act does not qualify this term by \n\n[269 U.S. 304, 311]\n\u00a0\n any reference to the nationality of the vessels. Nor does it use the words 'seamen on foreign vessels' or any equivalent phrase which would have been appropriate had it been intended to describe the seamen on such vessels.\n This conclusion is emphasized when the Act is considered in the light of the Alien Immigration Act of 1917, and the legislative history showing the condition it was evidently the intention to correct. United States v. Morrow, \n266 \nU.S. 531, 535\n, 45 S. Ct. 173. The Act of 1917, inter alia, dealt specifically with 'alien seamen,' using that term, as shown by its general definitions and various provisions, as meaning 'aliens employed on any vessel arriving in the United States from a foreign port.' It provided that, if not within any of the classes excluded by reason of disease or otherwise, they might be admitted into the United States as other aliens, but, if not so admitted, prohibited them from landing, except for certain temporary purposes, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor; and it required the owner or master of 'any vessel' coming from a foreign port to furnish a list of all its alien seamen and not to pay off or discharge them unless duly admitted or permitted to land. (Sections 1, 2, 32-34, 36.) And by section 35-which was specifically referred to in the Act of 1920-it was provided that if 'any vessel' carrying passengers, on arrival from a foreign port, had on board employed thereon, any alien afflicted with any enumerated disability or disease which had existed when he shipped on the vessel and might then have been detected by competent medical examination, the owner or master of the vessel should pay a fine, and, pending its departure, the alien should be treated in hospital at the expense of the vessel.\n There was, however, no provision expressly authorizing the hospital expenses incurred in the treatment of a diseased alien seaman to be charged to the vessel when it carried freight or the disease could not have been detected at the time that he shipped on the vessel. \n\n[269 U.S. 304, 312]\n\u00a0\n In this situation the Department of Labor, in 1919, prepared the draft of the bill which later, with minor changes, became the Act of 1920. In a letter transmitting this draft to the Chairman of the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, the Secretary stated that the Department was very anxious to have it enacted into law in order to fix definitely 'the responsibility of steamship lines and vessels for the expenses which arise from the frequent necessity of placing in hospitals alien seamen who, upon arrival at our ports, are found to be afflicted with various diseases, often of a loathsome or dangerous contagious character'; the existing law not being clear upon this matter. The Committee, in reporting the bill,2 set forth this letter from the Secretary, and said:\n'The bill simply provides that the care and treatment in hospital of diseased alien seamen be placed on the same basis as the care and treatment in hospital of diseased aliens, namely, at the expense of the ship or steamship company bringing the diseased alien seamen into this country. At present there is a difference of opinion as to who shall pay the expenses of taking care of these alien seamen who come here and require medical or surgical treatment.'\n\n No substantial doubt is cast upon the purpose of the Act by the incidental statement of the Chairman of the Committee in the course of debate, that the bill applied only to foreign ships, especially since, in the same debate, he described it as referring to 'sick alien seamen,' and stated that it perfected a provision already 'partly in the immigration laws' making the owners of vessels responsible for their medical treatment. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of this history, as well as from the face of the Act itself, it is clear that the words 'alien seamen' were used in the same sense as in the Act of 1917, with \n\n[269 U.S. 304, 313]\n\u00a0\n which it is in pari materia, that is, as meaning aliens employed as seamen on any vessel arriving in the United States; and that it was intended to extend the provisions of section 35 of that Act by providing that the hospital expenses incurred in treating and such diseased alien should be borne in all cases by the vessel bringing him in, whether carrying passengers or freight, and without reference to the time when the disease might have been detected. And it has been so construed and applied by the Department of Labor.\n The Steamship Company, while conceding that the Act as thus construed is constitutional as applied to foreign vessels, contends that as applied to American vessels it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment in that 'it imposes liability without causation or causal connection.' This contention is without merit. The power of Congress to forbid aliens and classes of aliens from coming within the borders of the United States is unquestionable. The Chinese Exclusion Case, \n130 \nU.S. 581, 606\n, 9 S. Ct. 623; Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 228, 237\n, 16 S. Ct. 977; Turner v. Williams, \n194 \nU.S. 279, 289\n, 24 S. Ct. 719; Oceanic Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 336\n, 29 S. Ct. 671. Congress may exercise this power by legislation aimed at the vessels bringing in excluded aliens, as by penalizing a vessel bringing in alien immigrants afflicted with diseases which might have been detected at the time of foreign embarkation, Oceanic Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, supra, 332 (29 S. Ct. 671) or by requiring a vessel bringing in aliens found to be within an excluded class, to bear the expense of maintaining them while on land and of returning them, United States v. Nord Deutscher Lioyd, \n223 \nU.S. 512, 517\n, 32 S. Ct. 244. There is no suggestion in any of these cases that this power is limited to foreign vessels. It may be exercised in reference to alien seamen as well as other aliens. And if they are found to be diseased when brought into an American port, the vessel, whether American or for- \n\n[269 U.S. 304, 314]\n\u00a0\n eign, may lawfully be required to bear the expenses of their medical treatment.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874 (Comp.

St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 ee), makes it the duty of every person, including owners, officers, and agents of vessels or transportation lines, etc., bringing aliens to ports of the United States to prevent the landing of such aliens at any time or place other than as designated by the immigration officers, and failure to comply with the requirements of the section is made a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $200 or more than $1,000, or by imprisonment or by both. 'Or, if in the opinion of the Secretary of Labor it is impracticable or inconvenient to prosecute the person, owner, master, officer, or agent of any such vessel, a penalty of $1,000 shall be a lien upon the vessel whose owner, master, officer, or agent violates the provisions of this section, and such vessel shall be libeled therefor in the appropriate United States court.' The United States libeled the Coamo for a violation of this section by a failure to deliver two aliens at the designated place, Ellis Island, and to prevent their landing elsewhere. The District Court found the violation, but held that $1,000 was simply the upward limit and imposed a penalty of $200 for each alien. The libellant appealed demanding $1,000 for each. The Circuit Court of Appeals certifies the question whether in such a case the trial court is 'bound as matter of law to pass a decree condemning said vessel for a penalty of exactly $1,000, neither more nor less, for each a lien landing from said vessel in violation of said section of said statute.'\n We are of opinion that the language of the statute is too definite to be escaped by construction. After dealing with the personal liability of owners and agents of vessels and transportation lines, the section passed to another matter, \n\n[267 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n the liability of vessels. It provides a remedy against them irrespective of any fine that may have been incurred by owners or agents. The liability is not a security for any such fine, it is a new one. The statute does not say that the fine or penalty previously mentioned shall be a lien upon the vessel but that a penalty of $1,000 shall be. It seems to us as plain that this is the sum to be demanded as it is that the right to demand it does not depend upon a conviction of the owner or agent of the ship. See Scow 6- S, \n250 \nU.S. 269, 272\n, 39 S. Ct. 452.

St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 ss, 4289 1\/4 t), discretion is given to the Secretary of Labor. But here the statute allows only one judgment in case of guilt.

Rault, all of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States libeled the steamship Panoil and asked a decree for $ 2,000 because of damage inflicted upon spur dike No. 5, a structure extending into the Mississippi river. Upon exception duly taken the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction of the matter and dismissed the libel.\n In order to deflect the current and cause it to deepen the channel at the mouth of the river the United States built submerged dikes and sills, composed of willow mattresses weighted down with stone; also several spurs. Spur dike No. 5, located near the 'Head of the Passes,' consists of a cribwork of round piles, hewn walings, and \n\n[266 U.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n sawn cross-braces, all securely bolted together, with a curtain of round piles bolted against the upstream face. It is driven into the bed of the river, and extends out about 700 feet from the east bank, approximately at right angles to the channel. Its special purpose is to slacken the current, induce deposits of sediment, and eventually built out the shore, and in this way to improve the channel and aid navigation. Proceeding in a thick fog the Panoil struck this dike, shoved 30 feet of the channel end upstream, and so damaged it as to require rebuilding at an expense of $2, 000.\n Appellants maintain that as the dike is an aid to navigation the court below had jurisdiction of the alleged tort, within the doctrine of The Blackheath, \n195 \nU.S. 361\n, 25 S. Ct. 46, and The Raithmoor, \n241 \nU.S. 166\n, 36 S. Ct. 514. We think the principle of those cases does not go so far. The dike constitutes an extension of the shore, and must be regarded as land. The mere fact that its presence may affect the flow of the water and thereby ultimately facilitate navigation is not enough to bring the injury within the admiralty jurisdiction.

Davisson, of Ardmore, Okl., for appellees Gillam.\n\n\n\n[268 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit from so much of its decree as affirms a decree of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Oklahoma dismissing the bill of the plaintiff-the appellant here. 288 F. 158.\n Suit was begun to cancel an oil and gas lease of 40 acres of land, given to appellees Dunn and Gillam, by Thomas, guardian, and signed by Eaves, curator of Allie Daney, a minor full-blood Choctaw Indian. Both Thomas and Eaves claimed the right to represent the minor and to lease her land. Eaves was appointed curator \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n of the minor by the United States Court for the Southern District of the Indian Territory in November, 1905, and on admission of the territory of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory to statehood as the state of Oklahoma that court transmitted the curatorship record to the county court of Love county. Thomas was appointed guardian by the county court of Le Flore county in July, 1911. On August 18, 1913, Eaves executed a lease of the premises in question to one Mullen, which lease was approved by the county court of Love county. On the same day Thomas, as guardian, executed a lease of the same premises to Dunn and Gillam, which lease was approved by the county court of Le Flore county. The two leases came to the Indian superintendent for his recommendation for approval by the Secretary of the Interior at about the same time. This developed a controversy between Mullen, on the one hand, and Dunn and Gillam, on the other, as to whether Thomas or Eaves properly represented the minor and had legal authority to enter into a lease of the minor's lands. A compromise was finally effected between the contesting parties, whereby Eaves added his signature as curator to the lease which had been given by Thomas to Dunn and Gillam and acknowledged it. At the same time the Bull Head Oil Company, a corporation and one of the defendants, was organized. The Thomas lease was assigned to it, under an agreement that the lessees would take for their respective interests in the leasehold equal shares of stock. The capital of the Bull Head Oil Company was fixed at $18,000, of which 8,000 shares of the capital stock of the company, having a par value of $8,000, were issued to Mullen, the lessee under the Eaves lease, and 8,000 shares were issued to Dunn, as trustee, for account of the lessees under the Thomas lease and those claiming under them. The remainder of the capital stock was reserved and issued for other corporate purposes. \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n The bill of complaint joined as defendants the Bull Head Oil Company, Dunn and Gillam and their wives, and Mullen and others, who were stockholders of the company. It charged that the Thomas lease was voidable because, as alleged, Thomas, the guardian, had been induced to execute the lease by a secret agreement with Dunn and Gillam to the effect that a one- fourth interest in the lease was to be transferred by them to a third person for the personal benefit of Thomas. The bill prayed that the minor, Allie Daney, be decreed to be the owner in fee of the lands described in the Thomas lease; that the defendants be adjudged to have no interest therein, and that they be required to account for the oil and gas taken from the land and for the money received by them as the proceeds of the oil and gas so taken, and in the alternative, if for any reason the court should adjudge that the lease of the premises could not be canceled, then that the defendant stockholders be adjudged the holders of said stock respectively in trust for the minor, and that the plaintiff be awarded the custody thereof for her use and benefit, and that the defendants who are or at any time have been stockholders of the Bull Head Oil Company be required to account for all money received by them respectively either as dividends or as proceeds of sale of their stock.\n On trial the court found that a part of the consideration moving Thomas, as guardian, to execute the lease to Dunn and Gillam, was a one- fourth interest in the lease transferred by them pursuant to a secret agreement with the guardian to a third person for the personal use and benefit of Thomas. The trial court further found that Eaves, as curator, by subscribing his name to the Thomas lease, with the approval of the county court of Love county and with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, gave legal validity to that lease; that such action of Eaves was free from the legal effect of the fraud of \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n Thomas and of Dunn and Gillam; and that by the transfer of the lease to the Bull Head Oil Company in exchange for its issue of capital stock, the full legal ownership of the lease was thereupon vested in the Bull Head Oil Company free from any legal effect of the fraud in the execution of the original lease by Thomas, the guardian. The court also found that, of the shares of stock acquired by Gillam as a result of the compromise entered into with Dunn and Gillam by Mullen, 3,266 2\/3 shares, of which his wife, Mrs. Gillam, a party defendant, held 1,266 2\/3 shares, were sold by them to one Hamon, a party defendant, for the sum of $75,000, and that Hamon was an innocent purchaser for value of the stock; that the defendant T. H. Dunn still retained his holdings in the stock of the company. There was also finding that certain shares of the Dunn and Gillam stock, transferred by them respectively to Mrs. Dunn and Mrs. Gillam, were so transferred without consideration. Upon the basis of these findings the court entered its decree in favor of the defendants and dismissed the case.\n After the entry of the decree of the District Court, the plaintiff, acting by the Secretary of the Interior, entered into an agreement, approved by the Secretary and an Assistant Attorney General, with all the defendants other than the defendants Dunn and his wife and the defendants Gillam and his wife, whereby it was stipulated that, in any appeal which the United States should take from the decision of the District Court in this cause, 'the United States would neither ask nor insist upon a reversal of the said cause, or a recovery against the Bull Head Oil Company or against any of the defendants in said cause, save and except T. H. Dunn, N. E. Dunn [wife of T. H. Dunn], J. Robert Gillam, and Mrs. J. Robert Gillam, and that it will not insist upon any judgment impressing a trust upon any of the stock in the \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n Bull Head Oil Company heretofore owned by J. Robert Gillam or Mrs. J. Robert Gillam and assigned to Jake Hamon, but will insist upon a money judgment against them for whatever amount the testimony may show should be awarded.'\n Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found, and the appellees do not question the correctness of the finding, that the Thomas lease to Dunn and Gillam was procured by fraud; nor can it be questioned on this record that the claim of Dunn and Gillam to rights under the Thomas lease was the only basis and consideration moving from them for the compromise agreement by them with Mullen, claiming under the Eaves lease, which resulted in Dunn and Gillam together receiving in exchange for their interest in the lease, 8,000 shares of the capital stock of the Bull Head Oil Company as the fruits of their fraudulent enterprise. Of this stock Dunn and his wife still hold a substantial amount. Gillam and his wife have converted the stock held by them into cash by sale of it to an innocent purchaser, and the leasehold itself, by the action of Dunn and Gillam, has been transferred to the Bull Head Oil Company, and has been adjudged by the decree of the District Court to be beyond the reach of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's ward, and the plaintiff in error has abandoned its appeal from that part of the decree.\n There is thus presented the narrow question whether the appellees, Dunn and wife and Gillam and wife, against whom this appeal is now prosecuted, may retain the fruits of this fraudulent course of conduct, immune from attack in a court of equity. The court below rested its decision on the ground that the compromise settlement entered into with the defendants, some of whom were stockholders of the Bull Head Oil Company, other than the appellees against whom this appeal is prosecuted, had the effect of confirming the Thomas lease and \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n if the appellant had the right to continue the litigation against Dunn and Gillam, that right is based on their alleged fraudulent conduct and is a claim for damages on account of the fraud, and since there was no evidence that the lease was granted for an inadequate return, there was no basis for an award of legal damages to the appellant.\n Undoubtedly in an action at law for fraud or deceit, since the action sounds in damage, the plaintiff must prove damage to establish a right to recover. If Dunn and Gillam had retained the lease which they fraudulently obtained from Thomas, as guardian, the plaintiff could, at its option, either have brought suit in equity against them for the cancellation of the lease or for damages against the guardian, or possibly also at law for damages against Dunn and Gillam, and on familiar principles any relinquishment of plaintiff's right to cancel the lease would necessarily have limited plaintiff to a right of recovery for damages. But such is not the situation here presented. The grant of the lease by Thomas, the guardian, to Dunn and Gillam, with a secret agreement that the guardian should be jointly interested in the lease with Dunn and Gillam, was a fraud upon the ward, rendering the whole transaction voidable at the option of the ward or those legally representing her. It is not necessary in such a situation, in order to establish the right to relief to show that the beneficiary was damaged by the fraudulent conduct of the trustee. It is sufficient to establish that the fiduciary has exercised his power of disposition for his own benefit without more. Michoud et al. v. Girod et al., 4 How. 503, 533; Wardell v. Railway Co., \n103 U.S. 651\n, 658; Thomas v. R. R. Co., \n109 \nU.S. 552\n, 3 S. Ct. 315; Burns v. Cooper, 140 F. 273, 277, 72 C. C. A. 25; Mastin v. Noble, 157 F. 506, 509, 85 C. C.

A. 415. \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 132]\n\u00a0\n Dunn and Gillam did not retain their interest in the lease which they had fraudulently acquired. They transferred it, together with the secret interest of Thomas, the guardian in the lease, to the defendant, the Bull Head Oil Company in exchange for stock in that corporation. They then acquired, by purchase from Thomas for the sum of $3,500 and an automobile, his interest in the stock of the corporation. Some of the stock which they acquired by this transaction was turned over to their wives, who, the court found, took as donees, and some of it was retained and is now held by appellees, and some of it has been transferred by them to innocent purchasers for value. In such a situation equity adopts the salutary rule that he who fraudulently traffics with a recreant fiduciary shall take nothing by his fraud. The ward or the beneficiary of a trust may, at his option, follow the trust res fraudulently diverted until it reaches the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, or he may, at his option, claim the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the trust res in the hands of him who fraudulently acquired it of the fiduciary.\n The legal principles governing the right to follow trust funds diverted in breach of the trust were succinctly and accurately stated by Turner, L. J., in Pennell v. Defell, 4 De Gex, M. & G. 372, 388, as follows:\n'It is an undoubted principle of this court that as between a cestui que trust and trustee and all parties claiming under the trustee, otherwise than by purchase for valuable consideration without notice, all property belonging to a trust, however much it may be changed or altered in its nature or character, and all the fruits of such property, whether it is in its original or its altered state, continues to be subject to or affected by the trust.'\n\n To the same effect are Oliver et al. v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 401; Lane v. Dighton, Amb. 409; Ex parte Dumars, 1 Atk. 232, 233; Taylor v. Plummer, 3 Maule & S. \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 133]\n\u00a0\n 562, 571; Cobb v. Knight, 74 Me. 253; People v. California Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 175 Cal. 756, 167 P. 388; Hubbard v. Burrell, 41 Wis. 365.\n The rule is the same as against a fraudulent vendee who has exchanged the property purchased for other property. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Fancher, 145 N. Y. 552, 40 N. E. 206, 27 L. R. A. 757.\n The rule is the same with respect to the proceeds of property tortiously misappropriated and found in the hands of the tort feasor or his transferee with notice. Newton v. Porter, 69 N. Y. 133, 25 Am. Rep. 152.\n Dunn and Gillam, when they fraudulently acquired the Thomas lease by the corrupt action of the guardian, which action they actively induced, became trustees ex maleficio of the lease, and as such trustees they became equitably bound to hold the lease for the benefit of the ward or, in the event of a sale or other disposition of it, to hold its proceeds upon a like obligation. Any other rule would enable the fraudulent recipient of trust property acquired through a breach of trust to render himself immune to the remedial action of equity by the simple expedient of transferring the trust res thus acquired, to an innocent purchaser for value, or otherwise placing it beyond the reach of the defrauded beneficiary of the trust. Nor are they in any better situation with respect to the stock which they acquired by purchase from Thomas with full knowledge that it was a part of the proceeds of the lease fraudulently acquired from the guardian and by them fraudulently transferred to the oil company. Not being innocent purchasers, they took it impressed with the trust to which the lease itself was subject. Newton v. Porter, supra.\n The plaintiff's bill was framed in conformity to the rule as we have stated it. It prayed cancellation of the lease in the hands of the Bull Head Oil Company, the transferee of Dunn and Gillam, 'but if for any reason the \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 134]\n\u00a0\n court shall hold' that the lease could not be canceled, then it prayed that the stockholders be adjudged to hold the stock in trust for the plaintiff. The District Court having decreed that the leasehold itself could not be followed into the hands of the Bull Head Oil Company, the plaintiff was not barred from claiming the proceeds of the lease in the form of stock or money in the hands of those stockholders who were not innocent purchasers for value and the pleadings were appropriately framed to that end. Suit to establish an equitable claim to specific property does not bar a recovery of the proceeds of that property, if it develops in the course of the trial that the defendant has conveyed it away in violation of his equitable obligation to the plaintiff.

Davison, 16 Vesey, 249; and 1 Sugden on Vendors, 277.\n In Valentine v. Richardt, supra, suit was brought in equity to cancel a conveyance of real estate for fraud. The alleged fraudulent grantee and his grantee and a subsequent mortgagee were made parties defendant and the relief demanded was that the two conveyances and the mortgage be declared void and that they be surrendered up and canceled and for such further and other relief as might be just. On the trial the court found that the first conveyance was procured by fraud, but that the second conveyance and the mortgage were taken in good faith for value and the complaint was dismissed as to them. It was held that the first grantee was a trustee of the property ex maleficio, that the bill might be retained against the first grantee and that the plaintiff might, in equity, secure a money judgment for the value of the land, not as damages, but as a substitute for the land it \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 135]\n\u00a0\n self, and that, under the frame of the bill and prayer, the court had power to render any judgment consistent with the facts alleged and proved; a principle of decision which we think is exactly applicable to the present case. See, also, Mooney v. Byrne, 163 N. Y. 86, 57 N. E. 163.\n The compromise agreement entered into by plaintiff with defendants other than Dunn and Gillam was not technically a confirmation of the lease. It was both in form and in substance only an abandonment of an appeal from a decree of the court, adjudging an indefeasible title to the lease to be in the defendant corporation. The practical effect was to enable the other stockholders, at a price, to weaken the danger of being involved in the fraud by their probable guilty knowledge of it. But, even if it were deemed to be a confirmation of the lease, such a confirmation is not inconsistent with a recovery of the proceeds of the lease from Dunn and Gillam and those claiming under them, nor, as has been pointed out, does it bar a recovery of the proceeds. Indeed, a recovery of the proceeds of the assignment of the lease by Dunn and Gillam could be predicated only on a confirmation of the transfer which would bar a recovery of the leasehold itself. Bonner v. Holland, 68 Ga. 718; Cadieux v. Sears, 258 Ill. 221, 101 N. E. 542; Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 70 Or. 384, 396, 142 P. 326.\n Nor do we find it necessary to consider the question whether Eaves, the curator, or Thomas, the guardian, properly represented the minor or whether either of them possessed exclusively the power to dispose of the property of the minor, or to determine the precise legal effect of the addition of Eaves' signature to the Thomas lease. Thomas, under whom Dunn and Gillam claim, assumed to act as guardian in the disposition of his ward's property. Dunn and Gillam dealt with him in that capacity. On common-law principles they cannot deny the legal capacity in which their lessor purported to act in executing the lease under which they claim. Terry v. Ferguson, 8 \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 136]\n\u00a0\n Port. (Ala.) 501; Pouder v. Catterson, 127 Ind. 434, 26 N. E. 66; Wolf v. Holton, 92 Mich. 136, 52 N. W. 459; Id., 104 Mich. 108, 62 N. W. 174; Parker v.

Harris, 4 Humph. (Tenn.) 24; Tiffany, Landlord & Tenant,  78(h) and (j). This is the rule adopted by the statute of Oklahoma. See section 5247, Compiled Statutes of Oklahoma 1921; Avey v. Van Voorhis, 42 Okl. 232, 241, 140 P. 615. In a suit founded upon the very existence of the lease and praying relief from its execution and legal operation because procured by the fraud of the lessees, the lessees cannot claim under the lease, hold the benefits derived from it, and, at the same time deny the power and authority of the lessor to execute it.\n We can perceive no reason why a doubtful or uncertain claim of Dunn and Gillam to the leasehold, sufficient nevertheless to constitute the consideration for the compromise contract with Mullen, (Blount v. Wheeler, 199 Mass. 330, 85 N. E. 477, 17 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1036; Zoebisch v. Von Minden, 120 N. Y. 406, 24 N. E. 795; Dredging Co. v. Hess, 71 N. J. Law, 327, 60 A. 362), could not become the subject-matter of a trust arising ex maleficio from the fraud of Dunn and Gillam and upon principles already referred to, it follows that, if Dunn and Gillam could not resist a bill to compel the cancellation of the lease, they cannot now resist the prayer that they account for the proceeds of the lease acquired by their sale of it and which are the direct fruits of their fraud.\n A period of about six years elapsed between the giving of the Thomas lease and the filing of the bill. The defendants neither pleaded nor have they urged laches as a defense; nor do we find in the record any adequate basis for denying relief on that ground. One who claims the benefit derived from a breach of trust in which he actively participates, and who shows no prejudice resulting from the delay in bringing suit to compel him to account, \n\n[268 U.S. 121, 137]\n\u00a0\n cannot complain of laches. See Insurance Company v. Eldredge, \n102 U.S. 545\n, 548.\n We hold that Dunn and Gillam were constructive trustees of whatever interest they acquired in the Thomas lease, and of the proceeds derived from the transfer thereof to the Bull Head Oil Company, whatever its form, whether stock or money, and that they and all defendants claiming under them, other than innocent purchasers for value, may in equity be compelled to account to the plaintiff for such proceeds, for the benefit of the minor.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, with respect only to the defendants T. H. Dunn, N. E. Dunn, J. Robert Gillam, and Mrs. J. Robert Gillam, is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; as to the other defendants, the appeal was barred by the agreement entered into by appellant with them, and as to them the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

St.  8597). The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case, with directions to grant a new trial. 284 F. 90. This court granted a writ of certiorari. Section 240, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217), \n262 \nU.S. 738\n, 43 S. Ct. 524\n\n\n Defendant, insisting that this court is without jurisdiction, made a motion to dismiss th writ. The determination of the matter was postponed to the hearing on the merits. In United States v. Dickinson (1909) \n213 \nU.S. 92\n, 29 S. Ct. 485, it was held that certiorari could not be granted in a criminal case at the instance of the United States. Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,  6, 26 Stat. 826, 828. But that act was modified by the Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  239, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157, being section 240, Judicial Code. which is as follows:\n'In any case, civil or criminal, in which the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is made final by the provisions of this title, it shall be competent for the Supreme Court to require, by certiorari or otherwise, upon the petition of any party thereto, any such case to be certified to the Supreme Court for its review and \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 545]\n\u00a0\n determination, with the same power and authority in the case as if it had been carried by appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court.'\n\n The words italicized above were added to the provisions of the act of 1891. The phrase 'upon the petition of any party thereto' is not limited by the context. The language, circumstances, and history of the elactment make clear the intent of Congress to give this court jurisdiction on the petition of the United States to bring up criminal cases on writ of certiorari. See 46 Congressional Record, pp. 2134, 4001. And the petition may be granted, notwithstanding the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial and did not render a final judgment therein. American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville Railway, \n148 \nU.S. 372, 385\n, 13 S. Ct. 758. Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 513\n, 17 S. Ct. 665. The motion to dismiss the writ is overruled.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals said (page 102):\n'It is our opinion that when all competent and relevant proof in the case is given a fair and impartial consideration the conclusion that the verdict is without support, is inevitable,' and held that the District Court erred in denying defendant's motion that a verdict be directed in its favor. The United States asserts that this was error.\n\n The pertinent language of the act, defining the offense charged, is as follows:\n'... It shall be unlawful for any ... corporation ... to solicit, accept or receive any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce by any common carrier ... whereby any such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published and filed by such carrier ... or whereby any other advantage is given or discrimination is practiced.' 34 Stat. 587 (Comp. St.  8597).\n\n The gist of each count is that the Gypsy Oil Company delivered gasoline to interstate carriers by \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 546]\n\u00a0\n railroad at places in Oklahoma-Keifer, Drumright, and Jenks-for transportation to Port Arthur, Tex., there to be delivered to defendant; and that defendant knowingly did accept and receive from the carriers a concession or discrimination in respect of such transportation, whereby the property was transported at a rate substantially less than the lawful rate for gasoline. It is not alleged what defendant represented the commodity to be or what, if any, tariff, was applied. It was shown at the trial that all shipments referred to in the indictment were made as 'unrefined naphtha,' under tariffs specifying rates therefor substantially lower than the contemporaneous rates on gasoline between the same points. The rates then in force from Keifer are illustrative. They were 'Oils: Petroleum Oil and its Products ... listed under the head of 'Petroleum and Petroleum Products,\" 39 cents per 100 pounds; 'Gasoline in tank cars,' 33 cents; and 'Unrefined Naphtha in tank cars' 19 1\/2 cents.\n Where a commodity shipped is included in more than one tariff designation, that which is more specific will be held applicable. U. S. Industrial Alcohol Co. v. Director General, 68 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 389, 392; Augusta Veneer Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 41 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 414, 416. And where two descriptions and tariffs are equally appropriate, the shipper is entitled to have applied the one specifying the lower rates. Ohio Foundry Co. v. P., C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 19 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 65 67; United Verde Copper Co. v. Pennsylvania Co., 48 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 663. It follows that, if the property in question properly might have been described either as gasoline or as unrefined naphtha, the lower rate was lawfully applied, and defendant was not guilty, and the burden was on the United States to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the property so shipped was gasoline and was not unrefined naphtha.\n The substance of the evidence as to whether the shipments complained of were gasoline or unrefined naphtha \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 547]\n\u00a0\n is given in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and need not be repeated here. The first distillation of crude oil takes off the elements more volatile than kerosene, and these taken together are known as the 'naphtha fraction.' After treatment with sulphuric acid, this fraction is divided by further distillation into three products-gasoline, the lightest, benzine, the intermediate, and naphtha, which is called 'painter's naphtha,' the heaviest. The gravity of such naphtha is around 54 degrees (Baume). Casing-head gasoline is produced by compression of gases which come from oil wells. Like the lighter ends or elements first coming off in the distillation of crude oil, casing-head gasoline is highly volatile and dangerous to handle. Its gravity is about 88 to 90 degrees, and its vapor tension is from 20 to 30 pounds to the square inch. During the period in question some of the painter's naphtha produced at defendant's refinery was shipped from Port Arthur in tank cars to the casing-head gasoline compression plants of the Gypsy Company at Keifer and Drumright, there to be blended-about one part naphtha to two parts casing-head gasoline. The gravity of the product was about 70 to 75 degrees, and its vapor tension less than 10 pounds per square inch. At Jenks, casing-head gasoline was not so blended, but it was subjected to a treatment called 'weathering.' which lowered specific gravity and reduced vapor tension to substantially the same extent as was effected by the blending with painter's naphtha. The shipment referred to in each count was casing-head gasoline so blended or weathered. Such reduction of specific gravity and vapor tension made permissible its transportation in tank cars, under the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized by the Transportation of Explosives Act. Act of March 4, 1909,  233, 35 Stat. 1088, 1135 (Comp. St .  10403), amending Act of May 30, 1908,  2, c. 234, 35 Stat. 554; Regulations for the Transportation of Explosives and Other Dangerous Articles, \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 548]\n\u00a0\n effective October 1, 1914, revised July 15, 1918.1 There is involved no claim on the part of the United States that there was any violation of the act or regulations.\n The tariff on unrefined naphtha, under which the shipments complained of were made, became effective December 2, 1916. Prior to that, the blended product was shipped from Keifer and Drumright to defendant's refinery at the gasoline rate. The compression plant at Jenks was not put in operation until after that date. None of the products so shipped as unrefined naphtha was sent to the market or sold to be used as gasoline. All was used at defendant's refinery and mixed or blended with other products to make gasoline which defendant sold; it constituted from 5 to 25 per cent. of such gasoline. The casing-head gasoline, before or after such blending or weathering, did not correspond with specifications for any gasoline sold in the market for use fuel for motor engines and the like. The evidence was not sufficient to sustain a finding that the casing- head gasoline in question was suitable for ordinary or general use as fuel for such engines. And, on a consideration of all the evidence, it must be held to have been established conclusively that such substance was not so used and was not reasonably suitable for such use. It follows, therefore, that, whatever it may be called, the product was not the familiar article of commerce sold as gasoline.\n A lower rate properly may be applied to a product when in an unfinished condition than that applicable to it when finished. In National Refining Co. v. M., K. & T. Ry. (1912) 23 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 527, it was held that rates applicable to refined oil were exceissive when applied to carload shipments of the so-called lighter ends of petroleum \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 549]\n\u00a0\n which had been separated from crude oil by a skimming process-that is, by distillation sufficient to take off the more highly volatile elements-but which was useless for commercial purposes until a further process of refinement had been undergone; and that a reasonable rate on such product was not more than 2 cents per hundred pounds in excess of the rates contemporaneously applicable to crude oil. Subsequent to this decision, tariffs covering 'unrefined naphtha' were put in effect on the lines from Muskogee, Okl., to Coffeyville, Kan., and from Oklahoma producing points to Baton Rouge, La. The product in that case was similar to the casing- head gasoline here in question. Both included the lighter ends or more volatile elements of crude oil; they were unfinished products and differed from ordinary gasoline of commerce in like respects. Presumably, this decision and these tariffs were known to and considered by the shipper and carriers when the tariff on unrefined naphtha was published. And before that tariff was put in, defendant's representative applied by letter to the carriers for a '17-cent rate crude unfinished naphtha' from Port Arthur to Keifer and from Keifer to Port Arthur. The carrier's representative testified that they were requested 'to put in a rate on crude naphtha or unrefined naphtha or unfinished naphtha,' and that he did not recall which. The United States suggests that the shipper did not disclose to the carrier that it intended to ship the product here in question under the proposed tariff. But the evidence negatives any purpose to deceive or defraud the carriers, and shows that the purpose of the carrier was to put in a tariff covering the unfinished product referred to in the negotiations as crude unfinished naphtha, crude naphtha, unrefined naphtha, and unfinished naphtha.\n The United States introduced evidence to show contemporaneous shipments by the Gypsy Oil Company of \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 550]\n\u00a0\n such casing-head gasoline to Port Arthur, billed as unrefined naphtha and to Pittsburg billed as gasoline, and also shipments by that company and others of the same product to other places, billed as gasoline. But it was not shown that the carriers had published any tariff covering unrefined naphtha to Pittsburg or the other points. In the absence of a rate on unrefined naphtha, such shipments are without significance. There was nothing to show, and no reason to presume, that all classifications had been made that could be made in respect of the numerous products of petroleum, and of those referred to in the industry as gasoline of one kind or another. There being no rate on unrefined naphtha or opportunity to choose between the gasoline rate and some other rate, shipments of the product as gasoline had no probative value or tendency to show that the product was not fairly described by and included within the phrase 'unrefined naphtha' in the tariff in question.\n The regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, revised July 15, 1918, required liquid condensates from natural gas or from casing-head gas of oil wells, alone or blended with other petroleum products, having a vapor pressure of not more than 10 pounds per square inch, to be shipped as gasoline, casing-head gasoline, or casinghead naphtha.' Unrefined naphtha was not mentioned. The description of the shipments as gasoline under these regulations had no tendency to show that the tariff rate on unrefined naphtha was not applicable. The purpose of the regulations was to require a disclosure of the character of the shipment, having regard, not to rates, but to the dangers to be guarded against. It was not an admission on the part of the defendant that the gasoline rate was applicable or that the shipments were not unrefined naphtha within the meaning of the tariff. The language of the regulation illustrates the use of the word 'naphtha' to include the casing-head product. \n\n[268 U.S. 542, 551]\n\u00a0\n 'Naphtha' is a generic term, and embraces the lighter or more volatile parts of crude oil down to and sometimes including kerosene. This takes in all the elements of finished gasoline. The words 'naphtha' and 'gasoline' are often used interchangeably to include the unfinished product of which the gasoline of commerce is made. The thing shipped was an unfinished product. It was taken to Port Arthur to be used to make gasoline. The evidence required a finding that it was naphtha. The insistence of the United States is that it was not 'unrefined.' The processes for refining crude oil in the production of gasoline include the separation and combining of various elements of the crude product, and are not limited to the elimination of impurities. The evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that the making of gasoline of commerce by the use of the blended or weathered casinghead gasoline shipped to Port Arthur did not involve refining, properly so-called. But, even if the process was, as contended by the United States, a finishing and not a refining process, it is clear that the phrase 'unrefined naphtha' in the tariff in question was not misleading and did not contribute to any deception or fraud. The thing shipped was not ordinary gasoline, and it was lawful to distinguish it by tariff designation and to make the specified rate applicable. The words employed describe the product with sufficient accuracy. The evidence was not sufficient to sustain a finding that the shipments in question were not unrefined naphtha.\n Motion to dismiss denied.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This act has since been further amended (Act of March 4, 1921, c. 172, 41 Stat. 1444 [Comp.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Edward G. Griffin, of New York City, for respondent Alice Estella Spring.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nathaniel C. Patterson, a duly enrolled Seneca Indian residing on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in the state of New York, died testate leaving a widow (a white woman), a daughter and three sons. The widow was named in the will as sole executrix. The will was regularly admitted to probate by the surrogate of Erie county, N. Y., and letters of administration granted. The widow thereupon presented her letters of administration together with the will to the peacemakers' court of the Cattaraugus Reservation, where the deceased had left real property, asking that the probate of the will be recognized or the \n\n[269 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n will itself be admitted there to probate. The peacemakers' court, holding that the widow and her children were not members of the Seneca Nation, and therefore, under tribal custom, not entitled to inherit lands in the reservation, declined to grant either prayer, but appointed Pierce administrator. Pierce brought an action in the peacemakers' court to eject the widow from the property and to set aside the probate of the will by the surrogate of Erie county. The widow appeared specially and objected to the jurisdiction of the peacemakers' court. That court overruled the objection and entered judgment against her for possession of the property. Upon the application of the widow, the Supreme Court of the state issued its final order prohibiting Pierce, administrator, and the members of the peacemakers' court from taking any further steps in the matter. In violation of that order, Pierce caused a mandate of the peacemakers' court to be issued and delivered to Warren Kennedy, marshal of the reservation, under which the latter took possession of the property. Thereupon contempt proceedings were had before the state Supreme Court, as a result of which Pierce and Kennedy were adjudged guilty of a contempt of that court in having wilfully disobeyed its prohibition order and sentenced to pay a fine in the sum of $184.50 with imprisonment as the alternative. Upon their failure to pay the fine, Pierce and Kennedy were ordered committed to the Erie county jail, and to that end were taken into custody by the sheriff of Erie county. A writ of habeas corpus was immediately sought in the federal District Court for the Western District of New York, upon the grounds that Pierce and Kennedy were Seneca Indians and their detention was in violation of their rights under treaties with the Seneca Nation; that both the Indians and the lands in question were outside the sovereignty of the state, and consequently of the jurisdiction of its courts; and that by their arrest and detention they were denied the due \n\n[269 U.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The writ was sued out by the relator Walter S. Kennedy, father of Warren.\n The District Court exercised its discretion in favor of issuing the writ principally upon the ground that Pierce and Warren Kennedy, being Seneca Indians, were wards of the nation and entitled to the protection of the federal courts. But, in deciding the case upon the merits, that court pointed out that as early as 1849 the state of New York, at the earnest request of the Indians themselves, had assumed jurisdiction over them and their lands and possessions within the state; that to that end state laws had been enacted for their civil government and the regulation of their internal affairs; that the peacemakers' courts on the several reservations were created by state law; and that the courts of the state had uniformly held that the power of the state in respect of these matters had never been doubted or questioned, and such sovereignty as the Indians may have formerly possessed had been merged and lost in the sovereignty of the state, under which they must look for protection of life and property. In the absence of congressional action, the District Court concluded that these state laws and decisions, by long acquiescence on the part of the Indians, had become rules of property within the state and were controlling. The writ was accordingly dismissed. United States v. Waldow, 294 F. 111.\n We are asked to enter upon a review of these matters and of the historical relations of the Indians to the nation and to the state of New York from a time long anterior to the adoption of the federal Constitution. The conclusion we have reached makes this unnecessary. It is enough for present purposes to say that the state of New York, as early as 1849, at the request of the Indians, assumed governmental control of them and their property, passed laws creating and defining the jurisdiction of the \n\n[269 U.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n peacemakers' courts, administered these laws through its courts, and that Congress has never undertaken to interfere with this situation or to assume control. Whether the state judicial power extends to controversies in respect of the succession of Indian lands within the boundaries of the state, whether the peacemakers' court in the exercise of its jurisdiction is subject to the authority of the state Supreme Court, whether the subject-matter of these controversies and proceedings was one exclusively within the control of the national government and beyond the authority of the state, are all questions which, under the circumstances recited, it is peculiarly appropriate should in the first instance be left to be dealt with by the courts of the state. In so far as they involve treaty or constitutional rights, those courts are as competent as the federal courts to decide them. In the regular and ordinary course of procedure, the power of the highest state court in respect of such questions should first be exhausted. When that has been done, the authority of this court may be invoked to protect a party against any adverse decision involving a denial of a federal right properly asserted by him.\n The rule has been firmly established by repeated decisions of this court that the power conferred on a federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of the detention of any person asserting that he is being held in custody by the authority of a state court in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, is not unqualified, but is to be exerted in the exercise of a sound discretion. The due and orderly administration of justice in a state court is not to be thus interfered with save in rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.

Hoy, \n227 \nU.S. 245, 247\n, 33 S. Ct. 240.\n In New York v. Eno, supra, a federal Circuit Court had discharged a prisoner held by virtue of the judgment of a state court on the ground that the offenses for which he was indicted were exclusively cognizable under the authority of the United States. This court reversed the judgment, holding that the state court of original jurisdiction was competent to decide the questions in the first instance and that-\n'Its obligation to render such decision as will give full effect to the supreme law of the land and protect any right secured by it to the accused is the same that rests upon the courts of the United States. When the claim of the accused of immunity from prosecution in a state court for the offenses charged against him has been passed upon by the highest court of New York in which it can be determined, he may then, if the final judgment of that court be adverse to him, invoke the jurisdiction of this court for his protection in respect of any federal right distinctly asserted by him, but which may be denied by such judgment.'\n\n This general rule is emphasized by a consideration of the few cases where this court has upheld the allowance of the writ. They were all cases of exceptional urgency. Such, for example, were In re Neagle, \n135 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S. Ct. 658, where a deputy marshal of the United States was discharged on habeas corpus from state custody on a charge of homicide committed in the performance of his duty to guard and protect a justice of this court; In re Loney, \n134 \nU.S. 372\n, 10 S. Ct. 584, where petitioner, charged with perjury in testimony given in a contested congressional election case, was discharged \n\n[269 U.S. 13, 19]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that to permit him to be prosecuted in the state courts would greatly impede and embarrass the administration of justice in a national tribunal; and Wildenhus' Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 385, where a member of the crew of a foreign merchant vessel was discharged from the custody of the state because the arrest was contrary to the provisions of an international treaty. Thus, it will be seen, two of these cases involved interferences by the state authorities with the operations of departments of the general government, and the other concerned the delicate relations of that government with a foreign nation.\n It is hardly necessary to say that this case presents no such exceptional and imperative circumstances. The state courts proceeded under laws passed in response to the request of the Indian Nation of which contemners are members-laws which apparently for the greater part of a century had not been seriously challenged as impeding the authority of the federal government. Under these conditions, contemners, deliberately having taken the risk of setting at defiance the judgment of the state court, must look for redress, if they are entitled to any, to the appropriate and authorized appellate remedies. They are not entitled to relief in a federal court by the writ of habeas corpus.\n Something is said in the opinion of the court below to the effect that the relators pleaded lack of ability to bear the expense of proceedings for their protection in the state courts or to furnish bonds required on appeal. We are unable to find anything in the record to support this claim, but, even if it were true, it would afford no basis for a different conclusion. Markuson v. Boucher, \n175 \nU.S. 184, 185\n, 187 S., 20 S. Ct. 76.\n The court below should have discharged the writ upon the foregoing grounds, rather than upon the merits; but, the result being the same, the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","209":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEBSTER v. FALL(1925)\nNo. 149\nArgued: December 11, 1924Decided: January 5, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 507, 508]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Preston A. Shinn, of Pawhuska, Okl., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, for appellees.\n\n\n\n[266 U.S. 507, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, an adult member of the Osage Tribe of Indians and without a certificate of competency, brought this suit against the Secretary of the Interior, Wright, the superintendent of the Osage Agency, and Wise, a special disbursing agent charged with the duty of paying and disbursing funds and moneys due individual Osage Indians, to secure a mandatory injunction commanding and requiring that moneys and funds due appellant under the Act of March 3, 1921,  4, c. 120, 41 Stat. 1249, 1250, be assigned and paid over to him, alleging that the same was being unlawfully withheld. The act requires the Secretary to cause to be paid to each adult member of the Osage Tribe not having a certificate of competency one thousand dollars quarterly, etc., payments to be made under the supervision of the superintendent of the Osage Agency. But section 2087, Rev. Stats. (Comp. St.  4056), provides:\n'No annuities, or moneys, or goods, shall be paid or distributed to Indians while they are under the influence of any description of intoxicating liquor, or while there are good and sufficient reasons leading the officers or agents, whose duty it may be to make such payments or distribution, to believe that there is any species of intoxicating liquor within convenient reach of the Indians,' etc.\n\n In virtue of this provision payments to appellant were refused. This refusal is attacked by the bill of complaint upon the ground that section 2087 and all orders, rules, or regulations issued thereunder by the Secretary of the Interior, in so far as appellant is concerned, are unconstitutional. The facts upon which it was determined that appellant came within the statutory prohibition are not in question.\n There has been no service upon the Secretary, and he has not appeared in the suit. The other defendants were served, the case went to trial, and the bill, after a hearing, \n\n[266 U.S. 507, 510]\n\u00a0\n was dismissed for want of equity and on the merits. But the suit was one which required the presence of the Secretary, and the bill should have been dismissed for want of a necessary party. Gnerich v. Rutter, \n265 \nU.S. 388\n, 44 S. Ct. 532; Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, \n165 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 17 S. Ct. 225. The statutory direction to case quarterly payments to be made (subject to section 2087) is addressed to the Secretary. The power and responsibility are his. Neither Wright nor Wise have any primary authority in the matter. They can act only under, and in virtue of, the Secretary's general or special direction. In the absence of it no payments or disbursements properly can be made. Authority in the superintendent to supervise such payments is not authority to cause them to be made. The statement of this court in the Gnerich Case (page 391 [ 44 S. Ct. 533]) is pertinent here:\n'They act under his direction and perform such acts only as he commits to them by the regulations. They are responsible to him and must abide by his direction. What they do is as if done by him. He is the public's real representative in the matter, and, if the injunction were granted, his are the hands which would be tied.'\n\n In the Smith Case, suit was brought against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office to enjoin them from exercising further jurisdiction with respect to the disposition of certain public lands, from further trespassing upon complainant's right of quiet possession, and to command the issue of patents to plaintiff. The suit abated as to the Secretary because of his resignation, and it was held that it could not be continued against the Commissioner alone. We quote from the opinion (pages 34, 35 [17 S. Ct. 228]):\n'The purpose of the bill was to control the action of the Secretary of the Interior; the principal relief sought was against him, and the relief asked against the Commissioner of the General Land Office was only incidental, and by way of restraining him from executing the orders of his official head. To maintain \n\n[266 U.S. 507, 511]\n\u00a0\n such a bill against the subordinate officer alone, without joining his superior, whose acts are alleged to have been unlawful, would be contrary to settled rules of equity pleading.'\n\n Counsel for appellant directs our attention to other cases, where this court proceeded to determine the merits notwithstanding the suits were brought against inferior or subordinate officials without joining the superior. We do not stop to inquire whether all or any of them can be differentiated from the case now under consideration, since in none of them was the point here at issue suggested or decided. The most that can be said is that the point was in the cases if any one had seen fit to raise it. Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents. See New v. Oklahoma, \n195 \nU.S. 252, 256\n, 25 S. Ct. 68; Tefft, Weller & Co. v. Munsuri, \n222 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 32 S. Ct. 67; United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 172; The Edward, 1 Wheat. 261, 275, 276. In any event, this case falls within the principles definitely established by the Gnerich and Smith Cases.\n Decree reversed, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of a necessary party. \n\n\n\n","210":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELLER v.

They are copied in the margin. \n1\n Section 168 directs:\n'No person, \n\n[268 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n firm or corporation shall resell or engage in the business of reselling any tickets of admission or any other evidence of the right of entry to a theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other places where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held without having first procured a license therefor from the comptroller.'\n\n And section 173 declares every violation of the inhibition shall be a misdemeanor.\n By an information in the Court of Special Sessions, New York City, the District Attorney accused plaintiff in error of engaging in the business of reselling theater tickets without the license required by law. The evidence showed he was engaged in the business, and it was conceded he had never taken out a license or complied with chapter \n\n[268 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n 590. His defense rested upon the claim that the statute is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court adjudged him guilty and imposed a fine of $25. This was affirmed by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals. People v. Weller, 207 App. Div. 337, 202 N. Y. S. 149; Id., 237 N. Y. 316, 143 N.E. 205. In an extended opinion the latter court upheld the challenged enactment, but said nothing of the \n\n[268 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n possibility of sustaining the license provisions if those relating to resale prices were invalid.\n Counsel for plaintiff in error now insists that the two provisions are inseparable; that those which undertake to establish resale prices are clearly invalid; and, consequently, the whole act must fall. On the contrary, counsel for the prople maintain that the power of the state to require such licenses is clear and that we need not determine the validity of the price restrictions.\n It is not, and we think it cannot, seriously be urged that the state lacked power to require licenses of those engaging in the business of reselling theater tickets. The conviction and sentence were for failure to observe that requirement. In the absence of an authoritative announcement of another view by some court of the state we shall hold this provision severable and valid. Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340\n, 36 S.

Reselling of Tickets of Admission; Licenses. No person, firm or corporation shall resell or engage in the business or reselling any tickets of admission or any other evidence of the right of entry to a theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other places where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held without having first procured a license therefor from the comptroller. Such license shall be granted upon the payment by or on behalf of the applicant of a fee of one hundred dollars and shall be renewed upon the payment of a like fee annually. Such license shall not be transferred or assigned, except by permission of the comptroller. Such license shall run to the first day of January next ensuing the date thereof, unless sooner revoked by the comptroller. Such license shall be granted upon a written application setting forth such information as the comptroller may require in order to enable him to carry into effect the provisions of this article and shall be accompanied by proof satisfactory to the comptroller of the moral character of the applicant.\n Sec. 169. Bond. The comptroller shall require the applicant for a license to file with the application therefor a bond in due form to the people of the state of New York in the penal sum of one thousand dollars, with two or more sufficient sureties, who shall be freeholders within the state of New York, conditioned that the obligor will not be guilty of any fraud or extortion, and will not exact or receive a price for any such ticket or evidence of the right of entry in excess of the price authorized by this article.

In the event that any licensee shall be guilty of any fraud or misrepresentation or shall charge for any ticket a price in excess of the price authorized by this article or otherwise violate any of the provisions of this article or any other law or local ordinance, the comptroller shall be empowered, on giving ten days' notice by mail to such licensee, and on affording such licensee an opportunity to answer the charges made against him, to revoke the license issued to him. \n Sec. 171. Supervision of Comptroller. The comptroller shall have the power, upon complaint of any citizen or of his own initiative, to investigate the business, business practices and business methods of any such licensee if in the opinion of the comptroller such investigation is warranted. Each such licensee shall be obliged, on request of the comptroller, to supply such information as may be required concerning his business, business practices or business methods.\n Sec. 172. Restriction as to Price. No licensee shall resell any such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry to any theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other place where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are given at a price in excess of fifty cents in advance of the price printed on the face of such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry. Every person, firm or corporation who owns, operates or controls a theater, place of amusement or entertainment, or other place where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held shall, if a price be charged for admission thereto, print on the face of each such ticket or other evidence of the right of entry the price charged therefor by such person, firm or corporation.\n Sec. 173.

BODKIN(1925)\nNo. 144\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[267 U.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Susie Wells, in pro. per.\n Mr. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under Judicial Code,  241 (Comp. St.  1218). It was a bill in equity to have Patrick H. Bodkin and Arabella Bodkin, patentees of a quarter section of public land in the county of Riverside, California, declared trustees for the complainant Charles E. Wells. \n1\n In May, 1903, one Geiger made a homestead entry of the land in dispute. In September of that year the land was withdrawn from public entry by the Secretary of the Interior under the Reclamation Act. 32 Stat. 388 (Comp. St.  4700 et seq .). Florence V. Bodkin filed a contest against the entry of Geiger on the 30th of January, 1908, pending this withdrawal. In March, 1908, Geiger filed a relinquishment of his entry, and in July, 1908, the contestant was notified by the local land office that she had a preference right of entry for a period of 30 days after the land should be restored to entry. On April 18, 1910, the land was restored to settlement, and to public entry on May 18, 1910. On the latter date Charles E. Wells after having made a settlement and Florence V. Bodkin, the contestant, each made a homestead application for the land. The applications on the same day were suspended for investigation as to the character of the land by the Surveyor General. On May 22, 1912, the suspension was removed and the land again restored to public entry. On June 3, 1912, the local land office rejected the homestead application of Wells and \n\n[267 U.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n allowed the application of Florence Bodkin, and this decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on November 13, 1912. On May 27, 1913, the Secretary of the Interior reversed the decision of the Commissioner, because it appeared that on the 25th of March, 1912, before the suspension for investigation was removed, Florence Bodkin had died, and held that she had acquired no rights by her application to enter that would descend to her heirs. On August 29, 1913, the Secretary on rehearing overruled this decision and held that the contestant might have acquired rights by her application to enter that would have descended to her heirs, but denied a rehearing to her heirs who were her father and mother, Patrick H. Bodkin and Arabella Bodkin, on the ground that Patrick H. Bodkin had made a homestead entry in his own right on other lands, and this precluded him and his wife from perfecting the application for a homestead as heirs of the contestant. Accordingly the entry of Florence V. Bodkin was cancelled and the application of Wells was allowed. But this was changed on January 3, 1914, when the Secretary of the Interior in the exercise of his supervisory authority decided that Patrick H. Bodkin, the father of the deceased contestant, might elect within 30 days to relinquish his own homestead entry on other lands and make a new entry based on the application of the deceased contestant, his daughter, with his wife as coheir. The father thereupon relinquished his own homestead entry, and upon the entry of himself and his wife of the quarter section here in controversy, the patent issued to him. The District Court dismissed the bill, and this ruling was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Under the decision by this court in the case of McLaren v. Fleischer, \n256 \nU.S. 477\n, 41 S. Ct. 577, Florence V. Bodkin, as the successful contestant of the homestead entry of Geiger pending the withdrawal of the land from public entry \n\n[267 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n under the Reclamation Act, had thirty days after the land was restored to public entry within which to exercise her preference right of entry as a homesteader of the land. Had she lived, therefore, no question would have arisen here. The controversy arises on the effect of the proviso of section 2 of the Act of May 14, 1880, 21 Stat. 141, entitled 'An act for the relief of settlers on public lands,' as amended by the Act of July 26, 1892, c. 251, 27 Stat. 270 (Comp. St.  4537). The second section as amended reads as follows:\n'Sec. 2. In all cases where any person has contested, paid the land office fees, and procured the cancellation of any pre-emption, homestead, or timber-culture entry, he shall be notified by the register of the land office of the district in which such land is situated of such cancellation, and shall be allowed thirty days from date of such notice to enter said lands: Provided, that said register shall be entitled to a fee of one dollar for the giving of such notice, to be paid by the contestant and not to be reported: Provided further, that should any such person who has initiated a contest die before the final termination of the same, said contest shall not abate by reason thereof, but his heirs who are citizens of the United States, may continue the prosecution under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe, and said heirs shall be entitled to the same rights under this act that contestant would have been if his death had not occurred.'\n\n The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the relinquishment of the Geiger entry, upon which the contestant won the contest, was the final termination of it, and that thereafter the contestant had only a mere right to make an application to enter, and that the statute had made no provision for succession or descent with reference to that, because the contest here is not with Geiger, but is with Wells, who, having made a settlement of the land, filed his application on the same day that the contestant did. We think this a very narrow and \n\n[267 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n unwarranted construction of the meaning of the section. We concur in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior when, in discussing this question, he said (42 L. D. 340, 342):\n'To restrict the term used, 'the final termination of the' contest, to the termination thereof as regards the contestee, only, would be contrary to the reason and purpose of the act. No interest of the contestee called for the enactment of such a law. The interest of the contestant, however, based upon a consideration, the payment of the costs of contest on the promise of a prospective right of entry, called for just such an enactment which should secure to such contestant and to his heirs that for which such consideration had been given him, in part if not wholly, as in the present case; and good faith on the part of the United States with such contestant required such an enactment to apply to all cases where the contestant's death intervenes before the right of entry given him inchoately with his privilege of contest is merged into actual entry or otherwise extinguished in some of the ways indicated.'\n\n Further objection is made that the circumstance that Patrick H. Bodkin had himself made a homestead entry in his own right deprived him and his wife, coheirs of the contestant, their daughter, of the capacity to inherit. The only objection to the inheritance was that under the homestead laws an entryman can not perfect title to two homesteads. If he chooses to relinquish one, it removes objection to his perfecting the other, certainly when he does this under the permission granted him by the Secretary of the Interior. As the Circuit Court of Appeals said in this case, the question whether the heir should be required or permitted to relinquish a homestead entry in his own right was one between him and the United States, with which the appellant had no concern.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Charles E.

GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION(1925)\nNo. 209\nArgued: January 20, 1925Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., and Henry C. Peeples, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellant.\n Messrs. W. E. Watkins, of Jackson, Ga., and George M. Napier, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees. \n\n[267 U.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Western & Atlantic Railroad Company, an interstate common carrier, filed this bill in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia against the Georgia Public Service Commission and its members, to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the commission requiring the railroad to furnish switching service on an industrial siding to the National Bonded Warehouse, Inc., of Atlanta, Ga.\n In accordance with the limitations of section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243), an application was made for a temporary injunction to a court consisting of a Circuit and two District Judges. The application was denied and this appeal was taken.\n The industrial siding in question diverges from the main line of the railroad company, and was built many years ago for the convenience of industries then located on it. At the present time J. K. Shippey and the National Bonded Warehouse are the only industries served by it. The siding is all upon the right of way of the railroad company.\n On August 2, 1923, the railroad company notified the warehouse company that, unless it signed a standard form of contract in respect to the side track, its use and maintenance which had been submitted to it, the service would be discontinued after August 15th. The warehouse company made complaint to the Public Service Commission. The commission advised the railroad company that no application from the company had been made to the commission for such authority, which under its rule 14 was necessary before the service could be discontinued. However on August 28th a full hearing was held by the commission, with the parties present, and as a result of such hearing it was ordered that, effective \n\n[267 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n immediately on receipt of the order, the railroad company should restore the service. Thereupon this bill was filed.\n The bill avers that the warehouse company's premises are two city blocks, or 1,600 feet, from the railroad's public team tracks, which are adequate in size and construction conveniently and properly to handle all the public business, including that of the warehouse company, and that since the discontinuance of switching service on August 15th, conformably to the notice given, the railroad has been ready to serve that industry on public team tracks, and that industrial sidings like the one in question have been put in without any care to avoid undue discrimination between interstate shippers in cost of cransportation. It says that of the business done over the side track 85 per cent. is interstate. The railroad company therefore avers that, if it does not continue the service as required by the order, it will be subject to penalty under the Georgia state law, and that if it obeys the order it will be guilty of undue discrimination under the interstate commerce law, and so will be subject to a heavy penalty in the federal jurisdiction.\n The bill further alleges that the side track is out of repair, and that in order to put it in proper condition it will require an expenditure of $440, that the receipts from the switching are but only a small part of the cost of it, and that enforced compliance with the order will thus deprive the company of its property without due process of law.\n The order made by the commission was based on its general order 14, promulgated December 23, 1909, which provided that any and all facilities and privileges enjoyed by shippers to which they were entitled by law or any rule of the commission, whether granted by voluntary action on behalf of the railroad companies or otherwise, should not be discontinued without the consent of the Railroad Commission. \n\n[267 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n The three-judge court refused the application, on the ground that rule 14 had not been complied with. Rule 14 is a reasonable rule, and the commission was fully justified in refusing to sanction a discontinuance of service until a petition had been filed with the commission and a showing made. The doubt which arises in our minds is whether the Public Service Commission by its consent to a full hearing of the issue without a formal petition and an order based on the merits did not waive the defect of a petition. The action of the company in discontinuing the service without a petition was arbitrary and defiant, but the subsequent action of the commission seems to have condoned the fault in such a way as to prevent our making it a reason for not looking farther into the issues now raised by the company in its bill.\n It is said that the requirement of the continuance of the service deprived the company of its property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the service rendered by the side track was much greater in out-of-pocket cost than the compensation. This cannot be sustained. The service has been rendered for years. It was a voluntary arrangement, and under its statutory powers (section 2664, Georgia Civil Code 1910) was made irrevocable by the Public Service Commission under rule 14, except by consent of the commission. The spur track was for a public purpose. Union Lime Co. v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., \n233 \nU.S. 211\n, 34 S. Ct. 522. The requirement that such a service should not be discontinued without notice and hearing was clearly within the police power of the state. Chicago & Northwestern R. R. Co. v. Ochs, \n249 \nU.S. 416\n, 39 S. Ct. 343; Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. State ex rel. Cameron, \n249 \nU.S. 422\n, 39 S. Ct. 345; Railroad Commission v. L. & N. R. R. Co., 148 Ga. 442, 96 S. E. 855. Even if the cost of the switching is more than what is received for it, we cannot determine on any showing made by the company that the switching does not work a benefit \n\n[267 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n in the increased business that the company gets or may get by reason of the added facilities furnished by the switching. The switch is a small part of the whole railway, and the mere fact that the switching may not be profitable by itself cannot be held to be a confiscation of property, even if it involves a loss. See Ft. Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Bourland, \n267 \nU.S. 330\n, 45 S. Ct. 249, 69 L. Ed. --, decided March 2, 1925\n\n\n It seems to be the contention of the company that, since 85 per cent. of the business done on the side track is interstate commerce, the power to order its establishment or abandonment is vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that the state commission is without authority in the premises. Such a claim is in the teeth of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, c. 91,  402, par. 22 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  8563), which provides that the authority of the commission conferred by section 402 over the extension or abandonment of interstate railway lines shall not extend to the construction struction of spur industrial or side tracks. See Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331, 345\n, 44 S. Ct. 376.\n The question whether the continuance of the service on this industrial track violates the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.), as unduly discriminatory, is one that involves issues not primarily for the courts, but is for the Interstate Commerce Commission. It requires a consideration by experts of the benefit of the use of such a siding as compared with that of other sidings in connection with the rates in interstate commerce to determine whether there is undue discrimination between shippers. The railroad company is therefore in no position to appeal to the courts on this ground until it has invoked the investigation and decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon the concrete facts in a proper manner. See Great Northern Railway v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 42 S. Ct. 477, and the cases cited on page 295. If \n\n[267 U.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n and when the commission shall have made such an investigation and have found the existence of undue discrimination, its order may well not be a specific direction against a continuance of service on a particular siding, but an order upon the company to remove the undue discrimination between interstate shippers giving discretion to the company to adopt a satisfactory method of meeting the requirement. Compare Houston East & West Texas Railway v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 360\n, 34 S. Ct. 833; American Express Co. v. State ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 624\n, 37 S. Ct. 656. In any event, relief cannot be had by this bill, on the ground of undue discrimination, at the present stage of the controversy.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN PAC R.

United States ( No. 285) \n268 \nU.S. 263\n, 45 S. Ct. 500, 69 L. Ed. --, just decided, is a similar action brought by the Western Pacific Railroad to recover the difference between the land-grant rates and the full tariff rates for the transportation of passengers carried at the request of the Government. The Court of Claims, on its findings of fact, entered judgment dismissing the petition. 59 Ct. Cl. 67.\n The petition covers claims for transportation services alleged to have been furnished between September 24, \n\n[268 U.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n 1914, and June 18, 1916,1 (a) by the Western Pacific Railway, a predecessor in title of the claimant; (b) by receivers of the property of said Railway appointed in a suit brought against it by a Trustee in a Federal District Court in California; and (c) by the claimant, which became the purchaser of the property of said Railway under a sale made in the said suit.\n The material facts, as found, are as follows: During the period in question the Western Pacific Railway-which had entered into the so-called land-grant equalization agreement2 for the transportation of troops of the United States at land-grant rates-the receivers in the said suit, and the claimant, successively carried as passengers, on Government requests, various discharged and retired soldiers, discharged military prisoners, and other persons. Bills for the transportation of such persons were presented by the Railway, the receivers, and the claimant, respectively on land-grant vouchers, claiming land-grant rates, as in the Southern Pacific Case, supra. In all cases, however, there was typewritten on the vouchers before they were presented, an indorsement in the following form:\n'As United States Government accounting officers claim that they have no authority to allow or pay for the transportation of (here is typewritten the class of travel objected to) more than the fares for troops of the United States, such fares are shown herein but under protest, and the Western Pacific Railway Co., for itself and connecting carriers does not waive (?) of its rights to full publish- tariff fares and payment of any less amount will be accepted as part payment only for the services performed.'\n\n All these vouchers were presented to the Government disbursing officers, and were paid by \n\n[268 U.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n them in the amounts of the land-grant rates, as claimed; and all these payments were accepted by the Railway, the receivers and the claimant, respectively.\n Pursuant to a sale made under a decree in the Trustee's suit in the District Court the claimant acquired by a special master's deed all the property, assets and choses in action belonging to the Western Pacific Railway or to its receivers. In 1920, after payment had been received of all the land-grant vouchers, the claimant presented to the proper accounting officers of the Government supplemental claims covering the balance of the full passenger fares on all the transportation in question. These were disallowed; and the claimant on February 2, 1921, brought the present action.\n\n 1. \nIt is not questioned that in the light of the decision in United States v. United Pacific Railroad, \n249 \nU.S. 354\n, 39 S. Ct. 294, none of the classes of persons here in question can be regarded as troops of the United States, and that the claimant and its predecessors would have been entitled originally to compensation at the full passenger rates. The Government contends, however, that-as was held by the Court of Claims-the action of the claimant and its predecessors in voluntarily presenting their bills at land-grant rates and accepting payment thereof, precludes the recovery of the balance of the full rates to which they would otherwise have been entitled. In this aspect the present case is in all respects similar to the Southern Pacific Case, supra, and is controlled by the decision therein; and on the authority of that decision we hold that the indorsements on the vouchers sufficiently notified the Government officers that the payment of land-grant rates was not accepted in final settlement of the transportation claims, and that the Government has not established an acquiescence in the payment of such rates which discharges the claims for the remainder of the full tariff fares. \n\n[268 U.S. 271, 275]\n\u00a0\n 2. All the claims which accrued more than six years prior to the beginning of the present action are, however, barred by the express provision contained in section 156 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1147). This was recognized by the Court of Claims, and is not here questioned.\n\n 3. \nThe Government further contends that as to the claims for transportation furnished by the Western Pacific Railway and its receivers, which were acquired by the claimant under the special master's deed, a recovery is precluded by section 3477 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6383). This section provides, inter alia, that all transfers and assignments of any claim against the United States, shall be 'absolutely null and void,' unless made after the allowance of such claims and the ascertainment of the amount due. The object of this section is to protect the Government and prevent frauds upon the Treasury. It applies only to cases of voluntary assignment of demands against the Government, and does not embrace cases where there has been a transfer of title by operation of law. United States v. Gillis, \n95 U.S. 407\n, 416; Erwin v. United States, \n97 U.S. 392\n, 397; Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 U.S. 556\n, 560; Price v. Forrest, \n173 \nU.S. 410, 421\n, 19 S. Ct. 434. And see Seaboard Air Line v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 655, 657\n, 41 S. Ct. 611. In Price v. Forrest, supra, p. 422, it was specifically held that this section did not apply to the assignment of a claim to a receiver under the order of a court, this being 'the act of the law.' So here the sale to the claimant of so much of the claims as had accrued to the receivers for transportation furnished by them, was clearly a transfer by operation of law and did not come within the prohibition of the statute.\n As to the claims for the transportation that had been previously furnished by the Western Pacific Railway, the Government relies upon St. Paul Railroad v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 733, 736\n, 5 S. Ct. 366, in which there was a general statement-not necessarily involved in the decision of the \n\n[268 U.S. 271, 276]\n\u00a0\n case-that a voluntary transfer of a claim against the United States, by way of mortgage, finally completed and made absolute by a judicial sale, falls within the prohibition of section 3477. We need not now determine the effect to be given to this general statement, nor whether it could have any application where the mortgage does not specifically transfer existing claims against the United States. In any event it has no application to the present case. The findings of fact do not show that these claims were included in any mortgage executed by the Railway or were acquired by the claimant through its foreclosure, but merely that they were acquired through a judicial sale pursuant to a decree of the court. So far as appears from the findings this was merely a sale of assets of the Railway not covered by a mortgage, bringing the case in this aspect within the doctrine of Price v. Forrest, supra, as a transfer of the claims by operation of law.\n We conclude that on the facts found section 3477 does not preclude the recovery of any of the claims in suit.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On the hearing other claims covering transportation furnished by the claimant after June 18, 1916, the effective date of the so-called 'interterritorial military arrangement,' were withdrawn. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Southern Pacific Co. v.

STATE OF GEORGIA(1925)\nNo. 24\nArgued: October 9, 1925Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n Messrs. John G. Milburn and Francis Raymond Stark, both of New York City, and William L. Clay, of Rochester, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Henry C. Peeples, of Atlanta, Ga., Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., and Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendants in error. \n\n[269 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the State of Georgia and the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway for a decree enjoining the Western Union Telegraph Company from occupying or using any part of the right of way of the Western & Atlantic Railroad, a road built and owned by the State and let by it to the Railway Company that joins with it as a plaintiff in this suit. The Telegraph Company claims a perpetual right of way over the State owned road by virtue of three alleged contracts. The trial Court decided that the Telegraph Company had no right in the premises, ordered it to remove its wires, poles and structures from the plaintiff's right of way within twelve months from the final determination of the cause, and enjoined it from occupying or using the right of way after that time. This decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia by an equally divided Court. 156 Ga. 409, 119 S. E. 649. The case is brought here by writ of error on the ground that the statutes warranting these proceedings impaired the obligation of the alleged contracts. There is also a petition for a writ of certiorari filed out of caution, but the only federal question is that raised by the writ of error and therefore the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n The first, and in this case the only question to be decided is whether the statutes relied upon have been given an effect impairing the obligation of any contract that the Telegraph Company may have. The statutes are an Act of November 30, 1915 (Acts 1915 (Ex. Sess.) p. 119), and one of August 4, 1916 (Acts 1916, p. 146), amending the former. The Act of 1915 provided for the letting of the Western & Atlantic Railroad and created a Commission to determine among other things the extent and character of every use of the right of way by anyone other than the lessee, and the authority for the same. The Commission was to prepare bills for the General Assembly \n\n[269 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n carrying into effect any recommendation that it might make with respect to what steps should be taken to assert the title of the State to any part of the right of way or the road that might be adversely used. By the amendment the Commission was given power to deal with encroachments on the way and to determine whether they should be moved and discontinued and to take such action as it deemed proper to cause the removal, and to that end 'the Commission is authorized and empowered to institute and prosecute, in the name and behalf of the State of Georgia, such suits and other legal proceedings as it may deem appropriate in protection of the State's interest, or the assertion of the State's title.' Acts Ga. 1916, p. 146. Under this statute the Commission, reciting that it was advised by its counsel that the occupation of the way by the Telegraph Company was without lawful authority, resolved that the counsel be instructed to institute suit for the removal of the encroachment in the name of the State provided that the lessees should join in the suit and pay the costs. Thereupon this proceeding was begun.\n This is all, and it is not enough to give the Telegraph Company a standing here. The statutes do not prejudge the Telegraph Company's case, or any case. They do not purport to subject the Company to any prohibition or command, or to determine or qualify the Company's rights; they do not attempt to delegate power to do so to the Commission. They do not even point out the Telegraph Company. So far as material to this case they simply authorize the Commission to inquire, and in case it finds any encroachment that it believes unlawful, to sue. In Columbia Ry. Gas & Electric Co. v. South Carolina, \n261 \nU.S. 236\n, 43 S. Ct. 306, the State law undertook to treat what this Court held to be only a covenant as a condition subsequent and as having entailed a forfeiture. The suit was brought upon this statute and a judgment rendered for the State in its courts was held to have given effect to the \n\n[269 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n statutory attempts to enlarge the obligations of the Railway Company under a grant from the State. The difference between that case and this is plain. A mere authority to test disputed rights by a suit does not impair the obligation of a contract upon which a defendant relies. When a claim is set up under a contract the Constitution does not forbid litigation to decide whether one was made or what it means. St. Paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 149\n, 21 S. Ct. 575; Mercantile Trust & Deposit Co. v. Columbus, \n203 \nU.S. 311, 321\n, 27 S. Ct. 83; Des Moines v. Des Moines City R. Co., \n214 \nU.S. 179\n, 29 S. Ct. 553; South Covington & Cincinnati Street R. Co. v. Newport, \n259 \nU.S. 97, 99\n, 100 S., 42 S. Ct. 418.\n The statutes in question are still more remote from those which while valid on their face are construed by the State Courts to apply to a matter not subject to State control. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Boundurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S. Ct. 106. Here there was no attempt to control otherwise than by the result of a suit in which the Telegraph Company could set up all its alleged contracts and protect all its constitutional rights. The plaintiff in error shows no law impairing the obligation of contracts and therefore no ground for coming here. See Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 32 S.

They were decided under an opinion reported in White v. Securities Corporation General, 55 App. D.

The other two cases, numbers 809 and 810, come here on writs of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted last month by this Court (Hicks v. Mercantile Trust Co., \n269 \nU.S. 549\n, 46 S. Ct. 107, 70 L. Ed. -; United States v. Mercantile Trust Co., Id.) after a decree for the plaintiff in the District Court, but before a decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals, in view of the fact that the questions raised had been presented to it by the above mentioned appeals. Judicial Code,  240, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  1217).\n The suits are bills in equity brought under the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106,  9, 40 Stat. 411, 419, as amended by the Acts of June 5, 1920, c. 241, 41 Stat. 977, and March 4, 1923, c. 285, 42 Stat. 1511 (Comp. St. Supp. 1925,  3115 1\/2 e). They are all brought upon notes issued by the Imperial German Government and alleged to have been recognized by the present German Government. They seek to collect the amounts from funds alleged to have belonged to the Imperial Government and now in the hands of the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States under the above mentioned Act. The defenses relied upon were: (1) that Germany had an interest in the fund and that the suits required a judgment as to the obligations of a foreign sovereign and that therefore the courts had no jurisdiction; (2) that there was no competent evidence that any funds in the hands of either of the defendants had belonged to the German Government and (3) that the United States had claims against Germany, arising out of the war, in excess of the funds and was entitled to satisfaction from those funds either in preference to other claims or at least on an equal footing with them. The last point is reinforced by a suggestion on behalf of the United States in all the cases except number 423 that it has filed notice of its claim \n\n[269 U.S. 283, 300]\n\u00a0\n under oath, that the claims other than its own would more than exhaust the funds on hand, that it is entitled to priority, and that the Court should dismiss the other bills and proceed to establish the claims of the United States. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in a careful opinion overruled the defense, dismissed the suggestion and affirmed decrees for the plaintiffs. We are of opinion that its decision and that of the District Court in Missouri were right.\n The elaborate argument that was made against the jurisdiction of courts over actions against foreign governments or to examine the conduct of such governments is beside the mark. In these cases no judgment is asked against Germany or against property that it is entitled to defend. The funds were seized adversely by the United States in time of war. They are in its hands; it has declared by an Act of Congress what shall be done with them, and that is the end of the matter. There is no question that such a seizure and disposition are within its powers. Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 129; Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268. The Treaty with Germany has recognized their effect. Article 1 according the rights asserted by the Joint Resolution of July 2, 1921,  5 (42 Stat. 106), recited in the Treaty, 42 Stat., part 2, p. 1939. Turning then to the Trading with the Enemy Act we find in section 9 express authority to any person not an enemy to maintain bills like the present for satisfaction of debts owing from an enemy, out of the property that has come from such enemy into the Custodian's hands. By section 2 'enemy' as used in the Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 aa) is defined and stated to include the government of any nation with which the United States is at war. The jurisdiction is complete unless the suggestion of an adverse interest on the part of the United States should induce a different result.\n We will take up the claim of the United States in this connection, as it is the only point that is entitled to any \n\n[269 U.S. 283, 301]\n\u00a0\n serious consideration. The United States seized the property in question from an enemy and of course could do with it what it liked. When it comes into court and seeks to appropriate it there is a natural notion that it has elected to use its power. Its power could not be denied if the Attorney General were the complete mouthpiece of its will. But whatever his authority it is subordinate to Congress; and Congress has more authentically declared the sovereign intent by the statute to which we have referred. The statute gives an absolute right to the suitor who comes within its terms, unqualified by any reservation of a superior lien in case the United States should be a rival creditor. Even assuming, notwithstanding Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315, 318\n, 45 S. Ct. 549, that the United States is a 'person' given the right to sue by section 9, there is no reservation of priority in the Act, or of a right to intermeddle in the private suit of another, or of any advantage that it might have retained as captor of the fund. Whether from magnanimity or forgetfulness it has assumed the position of a trustee for the benefit of claimants and has renounced the power to assert a claim except on the same footing and in the same way as others if at all. There is no doubt an intermittent tendency on the part of governments to be a little less grasping than they have been in the past and it may be that the enactment was intended to exhibit the self-denial that whether intended or not was achieved in the Bankruptcy Act with regard to the priority of liens. Davis v. Pringle, \n268 \nU.S. 315\n, 45 S. Ct. 549. There is more reason for it when as here the competition is between claims imposed by reason of success in war, and those arising out of ordinary business transactions of citizens in time of peace.\n With regard to the evidence, the contention on behalf of the United States does not seem to us to need more than a word of reply. The facts admitted by answer under oath of the Custodian and the Treasurer in one of the cases \n\n[269 U.S. 283, 302]\n\u00a0\n were that the Custodian determined after investigation that $515,575 were owing to the German Government, that he demanded and received them under the Act, paid them to the Treasurer, and holds them in a special trust; that he afterwards collected and paid over to the Treasurer $5,000,000 in a special trust as from an unknown enemy, but later determined that $2,200, 000 of the latter sum were held when he received them from the Imperial German Government, and directed the Treasurer to transfer that amount to a special account to the credit of the Imperial German Government, and that this was done. It was pressed at great length that the Custodian had no authority to determine the fact, especially after the money had been transferred to the treasurer. But it is immaterial whether he had that authority or not. He had authority to answer in his own case and the admission of the two defendants under oath is evidence against them in other cases as it would be conclusive against them in the one where it was filed, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. Pope v. Allis, \n115 \nU.S. 363\n, 6 S. Ct. 69. No evidence to the contrary was given in any of the cases nor was any reason shown to doubt the fact.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] By stipulation of counsel it was agreed that the disposition of the following cases: No. 427, White, Treasurer, et al. v.

Eaton, of Gulfport, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error brought this action to recover the amount of damages awarded against defendant in error by the Interstate Commerce Commission. August 30, 1917, at Lyman, Miss., the Ingram-Day Lumber Company delivered to defendant in error a carload of lath consigned to the V. W. Long Lumber Company at Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The shipment was directed to be moved via a line of the Norfolk & Western Railway Company through Hagerstown, Md. On the day the shipment was made, plaintiff bought the lath, and in due time received the bill of lading. Defendant misrouted the car, and in consequence plaintiff suffered damages. February 14, 1921, after the expiration of the two-year period prescribed for filing claims for damages, plaintiff made complaint for reparation to the Interstate Commerce Commission against defendant and three connecting carriers. May 18, 1922, the commission made its report and order. The contention on the part of the carriers, that plaintiff's right expired before the passage of Transportation Act 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  10071 1\/4 et seq.), and was not revived by section 206(f), was overruled. The Commission's order authorized and directed the defendant, on or before August 2, 1922, to pay $307.15, with interest, to plaintiff as reparation for damages sustained in consequence of the misrouting. Defendant failed to pay the award, and this suit was brought May 7, 1923. The complaint set forth the facts above, \n\n[268 U.S. 633, 635]\n\u00a0\n stated. Defendant demurred on the ground, among others, that section 206(f ), as construed and applied by the Commission, was unconstitutional, and that so to renew or revive the cause of action, which had expired before the passage of the Transportation Act was to take defendant's property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for defendant. The case is here on writ of error. Section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n Plaintiff's cause of action was created and limited by the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.). That act imposes upon the initial and other carriers the duty to route and transport freight in accordance with the shipper's instructions. Section 15(5). And the carrier is liable to any person injured for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of a breach of that duty. Section 8. Any person claiming to be damaged by any carrier may make complaint to the Commission. Section 9, 13. 'All complaints for the recovery of damages shall be filed with the Commission within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after. ...' Section 16(2). 'The period of federal control shall not be computed as a part of the periods of limitation in actions against carriers or in claims for reparation to the Commission for causes of action arising prior to federal control.' Section 206(f). If, after hearing, the Commission shall determine that complainant is entitled to damages under the act, it is required to make an order directing the carrier to pay the amount so awarded on or before a day named. And, if the carrier fails to comply, the person for whose benefit the order was made, within one year from the date of the order, may file petition in the United States District Court, setting forth briefly the causes for which he claims damages and the order of the Commission in the premises, and, subject to some provisions which are not important here, the suit proceeds like other suits for damages. Section 16(2), (3). \n\n[268 U.S. 633, 636]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff's right to file his claim with the Commission had expired several months before the passage of the Transportation Act. But, if the period of federal control is to be excluded, the complaint was filed within time. During the period between such expiration and the passage of the Transportation Act, plaintiff had no right to file a claim with the Commission and had no cause of action. It is settled by the decisions of this court that the lapse of time not only barred the remedy, but also destroyed the liability of defendant to plaintiff. Phillips v. Grand Trunk Ry., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 666\n, 35 S. Ct. 444; Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638, 642\n, 38 S. Ct. 408; Kansas City Southern Ry. v. Wolf, \n261 \nU.S. 133, 139\n, 43 S. Ct. 259. On the expiration of the two-year period, it was as if liability had never existed. And this court, applying the rule of construction that all statutes are to be considered prospective unless the language is express to the contrary, or there is a necessary implication to that effect, recently has held that section 206(f) does not apply to causes of action which were barred by a state statute of limitations before the passage of the Transportation Act. Fullerton Co. v. Northern Pacific, \n266 \nU.S. 435, 437\n, 45 S. Ct. 143.\n Plaintiff suggests that the only period of limitations applicable to claims for reparation is that prescribed by section 16(2), and argues that, as the period of federal control exceeded two years, section 206(f) must be construed retrospectively or given no effect.\n We need not re-examine the doctrine of Campbell v. Holt, \n115 \nU.S. 620\n, 6 S. Ct. 209, as it is plain that case does not apply. That was an action on a contract for the recovery of money. By a state statute of limitations the right of action had been barred. The statute was repealed before the action was commenced. It was held that the action could be maintained, and that such repeal did not deprive the debtor of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision \n\n[268 U.S. 633, 637]\n\u00a0\n rests on the conception that the obligation of the debtor to pay was not destroyed by lapse of time, and that the statute of limitations related to the remedy only, and that the removal of the bar was not unconstitutional. The opinion distinguishes the case from suits to recover real and personal property. That case belonged to the class where statutory provisions fixing the time within which suits must be brought to enforce an existing cause of action are held to apply to the remedy only. But such provisions sometimes constitute a part of the definition of a cause of action created by the same or another provision, and operate as a limitation upon liability. Such, for example, are statutory causes of action for death by wrongful act (The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199, 214\n, 7 S. Ct. 140), and those arising under the federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, c. 149, being Comp. St.  8657-8665 (Central Vermont Ry. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 35 S. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. v. Burnette, \n239 \nU.S. 199, 201\n, 36 S. Ct. 75; Kannellos v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 151 Minn. 157, 160, 186 N. W. 389; Jones v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., 96 N. J. Law, 197, 114 A. 331). See, also, Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451, 454\n, 24 S. Ct. 692. This case belongs to the latter class. Section 206(f) will not be construed retroactively to create liability. To give it that effect would be to deprive defendant of its property without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Levy v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 542, 544\n, 42 S.

UNITED STATES(1925)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 7, 1925Decided: November 16, 1925\n\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. T. Newcomb, of New York City, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, and the Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[269 U.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 26, 1916, the executors of Oswald Ottendorfer of New York City brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the sum of $543, 708.44, voluntarily paid by them on December 10, 1902, for legacy taxes assessed under the Spanish War Revenue Act June 13, 1898, c. 448,  29, 30 Stat. 448, 464, as amended by Act March 2, 1901,  10. Section 29 had been repealed by Act of April 12, 1902, c. 500,  7, 32 Stat. 96, 98, 99, the repeal to take effect July 1, 1902; but by a proviso all taxes theretofore imposed were continued in force. The time for presenting claims for the refunding of any tax under section 29, alleged to have been illegally assessed or to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, was extended by Act of July 27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240. The executors sought recovery of the whole amount paid, on the ground that the tax had not been imposed prior to July 1, 1902. Recovery of part of the amount was sought also on the ground that it was assessed upon legacies which had not vested in possession or enjoyment prior to that date. There is no claim here that the assessment was excessive. The lower court dismissed the petition. 58 Ct. Cl. 410. The case is here on appeal allowed June 25, 1923, under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1219).\n The testator died on December 14, 1900. His will was duly probated, and the executors qualified on March 28, \n\n[269 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n 1901. There were some specific legacies, a residuary bequest which gave the bulk of the estate to three stepdaughters free from any trust, and a provision that all legacy or inheritance taxes should be paid out of the residue. The assets consisted largely of listed securities. On March 7, 1902, schedules were filed in the Surrogate's Court containing a description, and the estimated value of all of the property known by the executors to have been owned by the testator at his death, together with statements of decedent's debt, of the payments for administration expenses, of estimated commissions of the executors, and of further administration expenses. On June 5, 1902, the appraiser appointed by the Surrogate's Court filed his report appraising the property of decedent, but it was not until July 16, 1902, that the surrogate's order assessing thereon the New York inheritance tax was entered. The value of the personal property which passed to the executors was returned by them as $4,371,947.90. The debts and expenses to be set off against that sum were reported as $298,646.12. The assessment of the tax here in question was made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on December 10, 1902, in accordance with the executors' return which had been filed with him on November 7, 1902\n\n\n Under the laws of New York, the time for the presentation of claims against the estate had expired before July 1, 1902, and before that date the legatees were entitled to the full payment of their legacies. Under the laws of the United States (Act of March 2, 1901, c. 806,  11, 31 Stat. 938, 948), the time within which payment of the tax was required to be made had also expired before July 1, 1902. Before that date, all the testators' debts and all the specific legacies had been paid, and each of the residuary legatees had received, on account of the residuary bequest, $ 910,000, partly in cash and partly 'in securities at New York Stock Exchange values' assented to by the legatees. Be- \n\n[269 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n tween that date and the end of the year 1908 each received in cash further sums aggregating $210,953.66. Some of the assets were still undistributed when the evidence was taken in this suit. The reason why no further or complete distribution of the residuary estate was made by the executors prior to July 1, 1902, was that they anticipated that the estate would be liable for payment of a New York estate transfer tax and the federal inheritance tax, for attorneys' fees, and other expenses of administration, and that the exact amount of the residuary estate left for distribution could therefore not be definitely determined prior to July 1, 1902.\n The contention that the taxes had not been imposed prior to July 1, 1902, because no formal assessment had in fact been made by the Treasury Department before that date, is disposed of by Cochran v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 387\n, 41 S. Ct. 166. The contention that the interests of the residuary legatees in that portion of the estate not distributed prior to July 1, 1902, were contingent beneficial interests, not absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment, is disposed of by Kahn v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 244\n, 42 S. Ct. 85, Simpson v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 547\n, 40 S. Ct. 367, and earlier cases. An objection is made to the procedure pursued in the Court of Claims. The government originally demurred to the petition. The demurrer was overruled without prejudice, and it was ordered that the testimony be limited to 'the question of the amount of the residuary legacies not distributed until after July 1, 1902.' Thereafter evidence was taken, and the court made its findings. It is urged that the court erred in making findings of fact upon the entire case, that there are some findings inconsistent with allegations of the petition relating to matters other than those named in the order, and that, as to such other matters, the allegations of the petition must be taken as true. We have not discovered any inconsistency as to any material fact. Moreover, it does not appear that the executors objected \n\n[269 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n below, either to the order restricting the scope of the evidence, or to findings of fact made.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","218":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v. STATE OF LOUISIANA(1925)\n\nArgued: October 6, 1925Decided: November 23, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., and the Attorney General, for appellant. \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 251]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. L. Herold, of Shreveport, La., and F. W. Clements, of Washington, D. C., for the State of Louisiana.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the State of Louisiana against the Secretary of the Interior in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, seeking a restraining order and mandatory injunction relating to its prosecution of a swamp land claim under the Acts of March 2, 1849, c. 87, 9 Stat. 352, and September 28, 1850, c. 84, 9 Stat. 519. A motion by the Secretary to dismiss the bill was overruled; and upon his election to plead no further, a decree was entered awarding an injunction. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District. Fall v. Louisiana 53 App. D. C. 22, 287 F. 999.1 This appeal was allowed in April, 1923\n\n\n By the Act of 1849 (sections 1, 2), there was 'granted' to the State of Louisiana, to aid it in the reclamation of the swamp and overflowed lands therein, 'the whole of those swamp and overflowed lands,2 which may be or are found unfit for cultivation'; and it was provided that, upon the request of the Governor, the Secretary of the Treasury (afterwards the Secretary of the Interior3) should cause an examination of all such lands to be made by deputies of the surveyor general: 'a list of the same to be made out, and certified by the deputies and surveyor general, to the Secretary, ... who shall approve the same, so far as they are not claimed or held by individuals; and on that approval, the fee simple to said lands shall vest in the said State.' \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 252]\n\u00a0\n By the Act of 1850 (sections 1, 2, 4) there was 'granted' to the State of Arkansas, for a like purpose, 'the whole of those swamp and overflowed lands, made unfit thereby for cultivation,' which then remained unsold; and it was provided that the Secretary of the Interior should make out and transmit to the Governor accurate lists and plats of such lands 'and, at the request of said Governor, cause a patent to be issued to the State therefor; and on that patent, that fee simple to said lands shall vest in the said State.' It was further provided that 'the provisions of this Act be extended to, and their benefits be conferred upon, each of the other States of the Union in which such swamp and overflowed lands ... may be situated.' The general provisions of this Act were carried into section 2479 et seq., of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4958 et seq.).\n We assume, without deciding, that, in accordance with the practice of the Land Department, the claims of Louisiana to the swamp and overflowed lands may be allowed under either the special Act of 1849 or the general Act of 1850. See Louisiana v. Garfield, \n211 \nU.S. 70, 76\n, 29 S. Ct. 31; Cross Lake Club v. Louisiana, \n224 \nU.S. 632, 635\n, 32 S. Ct. 577.\n The material facts shown by the bill and exhibits are: The lands in question, with others, were surveyed in 1871 by a deputy surveyor general. They were identified and returned as swamp and overflowed lands by his plat of survey, which was filed and approved by the Surveyor General. At that time they were not known to contain minerals of any character. In 1901 the register of the state land office requested that they be listed and approved to the State as swamp lands. Various homestead entries were thereafter made in the local Land Office; some, if not all, of which were allowed, subject to the swamp land claim of the State. In 1910 they were included in a Petroleum Withdrawal made by a Presidential order under the Pickett Act. \n4\n Finally, in 1919, after \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n various intermediate proceedings, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in an administrative decision, 'found from the field notes of the survey of 1871 that the lands ... are swamp or overflowed, and, if nonmineral in character, inure to the State under its grant, and may be patented pursuant thereto when the record has been cleared of adverse claims.' And he thereupon ruled that unless the State should, within a specified time, apply for a hearing-in which the homestead entrymen might participate-and show that the lands were non-oil and non-gas in character, its claim would be rejected and the lands held for disposition under the public land laws. On an appeal by the State, the Secretary affirmed this decision; and he later denied a motion by the State for a re-hearing the grounds of his decision being that mineral lands did not inure to the State under the swamp land grants; that the mineral character of land claimed as swamp and overflowed was open to investigation until the inchoate title of the State had been perfected by the Secretary's approval under the Act of 1849 or the issue of a patent under the Act of 1850; that these lands had been impressed with a prima facie mineral character by the petroleum withdrawal; and that the State had been accorded due opportunity to show that they were not mineral bearing, failing in which its claim must stand rejected. 48 Land Dec. 201, 203.\n The bill, which was then filed, alleged that the Secretary had exceeded his authority and jurisdiction in making the unlawful requirement imposing upon the State the burden of showing that the lands had no minerals and denying its right to them because it had not undertaken to discharge the burden thus illegally put upon it; and prayed that he be enjoined from taking further action in enforcement of this ruling and be required to vacate and set it aside.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain the bill, upon the grounds that it was \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 254]\n\u00a0\n prematurely brought, before the Secretary had exercised his jurisdiction to determine the character of the lands and while the claim was still in the process of administration; and that both the United States and the homestead entrymen were necessary and indispensable parties. These objections are based upon a misconception of the purpose of the suit. It is not one to establish the tile of the State, as in Louisiana v. Garfield, supra, and New Mexico v. Lane, \n243 \nU.S. 52\n, 37 S. Ct. 348, nor one to quiet its title, as in Minnesota v. Lane, \n247 \nU.S. 243\n, 38 S. Ct. 508. The bill does not seek an adjudication that the lands were swamp and overflowed lands or to restrain the Secretary from hearing and determining this question but merely seeks an adjudication of the right of the State to have this question determined without reference to their mineral character, and to require the Secretary to set aside the order requiring it to establish their nonmineral character or suffer the rejection of its claim. In short, it is merely a suit to restrain the Secretary from rejecting its claim, independently of the merits otherwise, upon an unauthorized ruling of law illegally requiring it, as a condition precedent, to show that the lands are not mineral in character.\n It is clear that if this order exceeds the authority conferred upon the Secretary by law and is an illegal act done under color of his office, he may be enjoined from carrying it into effect. Noble v. Union River Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S., 13 S. Ct. 271; Garfield v. Goldsby, \n211 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 262 S., 29 S. Ct. 62; Lane v. Watts, \n234 \nU.S. 525, 540\n, 34 S.

Toll, \n268 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 45 S. Ct. 505. A suit for such purposes is not one against the United States, even though it still retains the legal title to the lands, and it is not an indispensable party. Garfield v. Goldsby, supra, pages 260, 262 (29 S. Ct. 62); Lane v. Watts, supra, page 540 (34 S. Ct. 965). Neither are the homestead entrymen indispensable parties. Lane v. Watts, supra, pages 537, 540 (34 S. Ct. 965). \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 255]\n\u00a0\n In this latter respect the cases of Litchfield v. The Register, 9 Wall. 575 (19 L. Ed. 681), in which it was sought to enjoin the Department from acting upon pending applications to prove pre-emption rights to the land, New Mexico v. Lane, supra, in which it was sought to set aside an entry made by one who had purchased and paid for the land and to enjoin the issuing of a patent to him, and Brady v. Work, \n263 \nU.S. 435\n, 44 S. Ct. 168, in which it was sought to enjoin the issuing of a patent to a person to whom the Department had adjudged the right to the land, are clearly distinguishable.\n\n 2. \nThis brings us, on the merits, to the consideration of the question whether the order exceeded the authority conferred upon the Secretary, and attached to the prosecution of the claim of the State, without warrant of law, the condition that it must show that the lands are not mineral in character.\n The grants of swamp lands made by the Acts of 1849 and 1950 were in praesenti and gave the States an inchoate title to such lands that became perfect, as of the dates of the Acts, when they had been identified as required and the legal title had passed by the approval of the Secretary under the Act of 1849 or the issuing of a patent under the Act of 1850. This has long been the settled construction of the Act of 1850. Rogers Locomotive Works v. Emigrant Co., \n164 \nU.S. 559, 570\n, 17 S. Ct. 188; Little v. Williams, \n231 \nU.S. 335, 339\n, 34 S. Ct. 68.\n Each of these Acts made a broad and unrestricted grant of the swamp lands. Neither contained any exception or reservation of mineral lands.\n It is urged that such a reservation should be read into the grants by reason of a settled policy of the United States of withholding mineral lands from disposal save under laws specially including them. There was, however, no such settled policy in 1849 and 1850 when the swamp land grants were made. Prior to that time, it is \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 256]\n\u00a0\n true, it had been the policy in providing for the sale of the public lands, to reserve lands containing 'lead mines' and 'salt springs.' United States v. Gratiot, 14 Pet. 526, 538; United States v. Gear, 3 How. 120, 131; and Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall. 660, 668. Such mines and springs appeared upon the surface of the land, and were peculiarly essential to the public needs of the early communities. But there was, at that time, no established public policy of reserving mineral lands generally. This is emphasized by the fact that the general Act of 1841,5 which gave pre-emption rights to settlers on the public lands, merely excepted lands 'on which are situated any known salines or mines.' Section 10. And while the Act of September 27, 1850,6 providing for the disposal of public lands in the Territory of Oregon to settlers, expressly excepted 'mineral lands,' it is manifest that this one local Act, approved the day before the Swamp Land Act of 1850, was insufficient to establish a settled public policy in reference to the reservation of mineral lands prior to the latter Act. And the fact that immediately after the subject of mineral lands had been thus brought to the attention of Congress, it did not except mineral lands from the grant of swamp lands to the several States, indicates that no reservation of such lands was intended.\n It is clear that, as there was no settled public policy in reference to the reservation of mineral lands prior to the Acts of 1849 and 1850, there is no substantial ground for reading such a reservation into the broad and unrestricted grants of swamp and overflowed lands made to the States, in praesenti, by these Acts, especially since such lands were not then generally known to contain valuable minerals, and when unfit for cultivation were commonly regarded as having value only after reclamation- the purpose for which both of these grants were made-the \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 257]\n\u00a0\n discovery of their oil and gas having been made at a much later date.\n This conclusion, even apart from the peculiar character of swamp and overflowed lands, is fortified by the decision in Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 179, 180, in which it was held that a provision in the Michigan Enabling Act of 1836,7 that certain sections of the public land should be granted to the State for the use of schools, became a legal title to such sections when they were surveyed and marked out; and that, no statute prior to the Enabling Act having contained any reservation of mineral lands other than those containing salt springs or lead mines, the later Act of 1847 8 providing for the sale of the mineral lands in the State should be construed as not withdrawing such lands within the school sections from the compact with the State.\n The same conclusion was also reached in an unreported opinion given by the Acting Attorney General (the then Solicitor General) to the Secretary of the Interior in September, 1916, in which, citing Cooper v. Roberts in support of his views, he said:\n'There was no exception of mineral land from the swamp land grant made to the State of Louisiana and prior to that time ... the only reservation of minerals made by the Federal Government in any of its legislation affecting the public lands related to lands containing salt springs, lead mines and contiguous tracts. The policy of reserving minerals generally was not established until after the swamp land grant was made to Louisiana.'\n\n This conclusion is not in conflict with the later decisions relating to school lands in Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., \n102 U.S. 167\n-followed in Mullan v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 271\n, 6 S. Ct. 1041-and United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 562\n, 38 S. Ct. 193. In the Mining Co. Case, in which it was \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 258]\n\u00a0\n held that a provision in the Act of 18539 for the sale of public lands in California, granting certain sections to the State for school purposes, was not intended to cover mineral lands, the decision was not based upon the ground that there was at that time any settled and general policy of reserving mineral lands, but, on the contrary, on the ground that the discovery in 1849 that California was rich in precious metals, bringing its mineral lands to the attention of Congress, had led to the adoption in reference to that State of a local policy, plainly manifested in other provisions of the Act making specific exceptions of mineral lands by which, unlike the ordinary laws for disposing of public lands in agricultural States, the mineral lands in that State were uniformly reserved from sale, pre-emption and grants for public purposes (pages 172-175). In the Sweet Case it was held that the provision of the Utah Enabling Act of 1894, 10 granting to the State certain sections of the public lands for the support of common schools, with no mention of mineral lands, was not intended to embrace land known to be valuable for coal. The grounds of this decision were that long prior to the Act there had been established a settled policy in respect to mineral lands, evidenced by the mining laws and other statutes, by which they were withheld from disposal save under laws especially including them; and that read in the light of such laws and settled public policy the Act did not disclose a purpose to include such lands in the school grant, since, although couched in general terms adequate to embrace them if there were no statute or settled policy to the contrary, it contained no language explicitly withdrawing the school sections, where known to be mineral in character, from the operation of the mining laws, or certainly showing that Congress intended to depart from its long prevailing policy of dispos- \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 259]\n\u00a0\n ing of mineral lands only under laws specially including them; this conclusion being fortified by the further considerations that when the grant was made, Utah was known to be rich in minerals and salines; that while some of the other grants contained in the Act expressly included saline lands, none included mineral lands; that the Committees of Congress upon whose recommendation the Act was passed, construed it as not embracing mineral lands; that the Land Department had uniformly placed the same construction upon it; and that Congress had, by a later Act of 1902, acted upon that construction (pages 567, 572, 573 (38 S. Ct. 193)). Obviously, this decision does not apply to the construction of the swamp land grants made at a time when there was no settled policy as to the reservation of mineral lands, and where the other circumstances upon which the decision was based are lacking.\n There is here no such uniform and long settled departmental construction of the Swamp Land Acts. It is not claimed that the Land Department construed them as excluding mineral lands or considered the question of the mineral character of swamp lands until quite recently. As late as October 1, 1903, the Secretary instructed the Commissioner that all pending selections under the swamp land grants to the State of Louisiana would be approved or patented to the State under the grants of 1849 or 1850, in all cases where the lands were shown by the field notes of survey or by affidavits filed at the time of selection, to have been swamp lands at the date of the grant. 32 Land Dec. 270, 276, 278. The first holding by the Department that mineral lands did not pass under the swamp land grants appears to have been made in 1917, more than sixty years after the passage of the Acts, in an unreported ruling. \n11\n This was followed by like departmental decisions in 1918, 46 Land Dec. 92, and 46 Land Dec. 389, 396-in \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 260]\n\u00a0\n which the contrary view expressed by the Attorney General was put aside as being obiter-and in 1920, 47 Land Dec. 366, shortly before the decision in the present case. We cannot regard these recent decisions of the Department-apparently departing from its previous well-established practice, and rendered, except in one instance, in connection with the long delayed adjustment of the claims of Louisiana-as establishing a settled and uniform course of departmental construction that is persuasive as an aid in the construction of the Acts.\n We conclude that the Swamp Land Acts granted to the States the swamp and overflowed lands, rendered unfit for cultivation, without reference to their mineral character; and that in requiring the State to establish the nonmineral character of the lands in question the Secretary exceeded the authority conferred upon him by the Acts and attached this condition to the prosecution of the claim of the State without warrant of law.\n\n 3. \nA question remains as to the effect of the decree awarding the injunction. This, after commanding the Secretary to vacate the ruling operating to withhold title from the State for many reason dependent upon the mineral character of the lands or to require that their nonmineral character be shown contained the following supplemental clause:\n'And further restraining him, and them12 from making any disposition of said described lands or from taking any action affecting the same save such immediate steps as are necessary to the further and final recognition of plaintiff's rights under the Acts of March 2, 1849 (9 Stat. 352) and September 28, 1850 (9 Stat. 519), to the end that evidence of title may be given to plaintiff as by said acts provided and required.'\n\n If, as urged, the effect of this supplemental clause is to divest the United States of title to the lands and leave the Secretary to do nothing \n\n[269 U.S. 250, 261]\n\u00a0\n but furnish the State evidence of title in final recognition of its asserted rights, the decree in this respect is plainly erroneous, aside from any question as to the scope of the bill or the necessary presence of the United States as a party. The State has not as yet finally established its right to the lands, and the administrative processes necessary thereto are not complete. The Secretary, it appears, has not as yet determined that they were swamp and overflowed lands. The finding of the Commissioner that they were 'swamp or overflowed' was not brought in question before the Secretary, and his decision involved no approval of such finding, but related merely to the ruling of the Commissioner requiring the State, independently of this finding, to establish the nonmineral character of the lands. The Secretary, in the exercise of the administrative duty imposed upon him, is necessarily required, before furnishing evidence of title under either of the Acts, to determine whether the lands claimed were in fact swamp lands; and he may not be restrained from investigating and determining this in any appropriate manner.\n The decree is inartificially framed. We think that the supplemental clause which we have quoted, in effect requires the Secretary to recognize that the State has already established its right to the lands and to do nothing further in reference to them except to furnish it evidence of title in final recognition of such established right, and restrains him from investigation and determining, without reference to the mineral character of the lands, whether they were in fact swamp and overflowed lands, before giving final recognition to such right as the State may establish under either of the Acts and issuing to it any evidence of title. The decree is accordingly modified by striking out this supplemental clause. Thus modified it should stand.\n Decree modified and affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Court of Appeals the present appellant was substituted for his predecessor against whom the suit had been brought. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Except those fronting on rivers, etc., previously surveyed under an Act of 1824. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of March 3, 1849, c. 108, 9 Stat. 395, creating the Department of the Interior. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (Comp.

St. Ann. Supp.  3115 14\/15 e). It presents questions very similar to those heard in Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, \n267 \nU.S. 175\n, 45 S. Ct. 252, 69 L. Ed. --, just decided.\n The relator owned a pyrites mine before the war. In compliance with the request of the government to enlarge its plant to meet the war necessities, it borrowed the sum of $695,000, on which it obligated itself to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. After three hearings before the Secretary of the Interior, it was awarded $693,313.79. In making the award the item of interest claimed of more than $40,000 on the amount borrowed was disallowed. The mandamus herein issued to compel the consideration and allowance of this interest.\n It is sought in this case, as it was in the Rives Case, to avoid the objection that the mandamus would control and restrict the statutory discretion vested in the Secretary by the averment that he had not taken jurisdiction of the claim for interest and had not considered it. This case, like the Rives Case, was heard on demurrer to the answer, and the answer shows clearly that the claim for \n\n[267 U.S. 185, 187]\n\u00a0\n interest was fully considered by two Secretaries of the Interior and denied.\n The only issue is whether the Secretary had discretion under section 5 finally to determine whether interest paid upon the capital borrowed is to be considered as part of the net losses incurred by the relator in preparing for and producing the pyrites. We think he had.\n Great reliance was placed by the courts below on the ruling of this court in United States v. New York, \n160 \nU.S. 598\n, 16 S. Ct. 402. That was an appeal from a decision of the Court of Claims in a case brought by the state of New York against the United States under a statute of the United States, by which the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the governor of any state, the costs, charges and expenses properly incurred by such state for enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, equipping, paying and transporting its troops employed in aiding to suppress the insurrection against the United States. It was held that the state could recover interest on the bonds issued by it to do the things provided for in the act.\n The act did not vest in the Secretary of the Treasury discretion finally to decide the extent of the indebtedness, and the claim was duly transferred to the Court of Claims in order that a judgment might be rendered thereon. The judgment was carried to this court. The issue, therefore, was merely a question of law whether under the statute interest was payable, and it was held that it was.\n The circumstances of the case were different from this, and it is doubtful whether the conclusion as to interest in such case would be applicable to the claim made by the relator, even if we could hear it on its merits. But it is not here on its merits. The question was one for the Secretary of the Interior to decide, and that finally.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","220":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v.

Otis, of St. Joseph, Mo., and the Attorney General, for appellant.\n Mr. Leslie C. Garnett, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 250 of the Judicial Code, par. 6 ( Comp. St.  1227), from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, granting a mandamus compelling the Secretary of the Interior to consider and allow a claim for net losses suffered by Logan Rives, the relator, in producing and preparing to produce manganese at the instance of the government for war purposes, under section 5 of the Dent Act (March 2, 1919, ch. 94, 40 Stat. 1272, being Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923,  3115 14\/15 e).\n Relator's petition shows that he incurred losses aggregating $55,204. 15, but that the Secretary awarded him only $23,047.36, refusing to allow him, among other items, $9.600 which he had to expend in obtaining a release from a contract to buy land containing manganese, after the land had lost most of its value because of the Armistic. The mandamus asked is to compel consideration and allowance of the claim for this particular item.\n The Secretary's answer avers that the relator received and accepted the $23,047.36 awarded March, 1920, but \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n refused to waive any right to further award under any subsequent legislation which might provide for further payment. The answer further denies that the Secretary refused to consider the claim, but avers that he did so fully and rejected it. The relator demurred to the answer and on that demurrer judgment followed and the writ issued.\n Mandamus issues to compel an officer to perform a purely ministerial duty. It cannot be used to compel or control a duty in the discharge of which by law he is given discretion. The duty may be discretionary within limits. He cannot transgress those limits, and if he does so, he may be controlled by injunction or mandamus to keep within them. The power of the court to intervene, if at all, thus depends upon what statutory discretion he has. Under some statutes, the discretion extends to a final construction by the officer of the statute he is executing. No court in such a case can control by mandamus his interpretation, even if it may think it erroneous. The cases range, therefore, from such wide discretion as that just described to cases were the duty is purely ministerial, where the officer can do only one thing which on refusal he may be compelled to do. They begin on one side with Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, in which Congress directed the Postmaster General to make some credit entries in an account found to be just by the Solicitor of the Treasury. This court held that the duty was ministerial with no discretion and required the Postmaster General to make the entries. On the other side is Decatur v. Paulding, Secretary of the Navy, 14 Pet. 497, 599, 609. Congress there provided for general naval pensions by general act, and by resolution of the same day granted a special pension for the widow of Commodore Decatur. She received the pension under the general law and then applied for the special pension, which was refused by the \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n Secretary of the Navy, on the ground that she was given an election of one of two funds and she had elected. She sought by mandamus to compel the Secretary, who under the law administered the Naval Pension fund, to allow the special pension. This court held that Congress intended the Secretary to construe the statutes and to allow the pensions accordingly, and that although the court might, as a matter of legal construction, differ from his conclusion, it could not by mandamus or injunction constrain him in his exercise of his discretion. Between these two early and leading authorities illustrating the extremes are decisions, in which the discretion is greater than in the Kendall Case and less than in the Decatur Case, and its extent and the scope of judicial action in limiting it depend upon a proper interpretation of the particular statute and the congressional purpose.\n The Dent Act was passed by Congress in an effort to do justice and equity to the many persons who could not obtain from the government compensation for supplies or services furnished or losses incurred in helping the government during the war, because of a lack of enforceable contracts or equities. As to supplies and services furnished, there was to be a settlement made by the Secretary of War, and if this did not satisfy the claimant, he was given a right under section 2 to sue in the Court of Claims to recover greater compensation. Section 3 gave the Secretary power to settle fairly and equitably claims of foreign governments and their nationals for supplies and services rendered to the American Expeditionary Forces whether by contract entered into in accordance with applicable statutory provisions or not. By section 4, the Secretary was given power to protect subcontractors in his awards.\n By section 5, provision was made, not to pay for supplies or services rendered directly to the government, but to relieve a class of persons who were invited by the government \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n to invest money in the production and preparing for the production of certain metals or materials difficult to obtain, and needed for the war, and who had thereupon incurred expense therein and had suffered losses because of the coming of the Armistice and the consequent destruction of the market for such metals.\n The said Secretary was to make adjustments and payments in each case as he should determine to be just and equitable; and the decision of the Secretary was to be 'conclusive and final.' There were five provisos: The first imposed a limit of total expenditure under the act. The second limited claims to those filed within three months after the passage of the act.\n The third proviso declared:\n'That no claim shall be allowed ... by said Secretary unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said Secretary that the expenditures so made or obligations so incurred by the claimant were made in good faith for or upon property which contained ... manganese ... in sufficient quantities to be of commercial importance.'\n\n The fourth proviso was:\n'That no claims shall be paid unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of said Secretary that moneys were invested or obligations were incurred subsequent to April 6, 1917, and prior to November 12, 1918, in a legitimate attempt to produce ... manganese ... for the prosecution of the war, and that no profits of any kind shall be included in the allowance of any of said claims, and that no investment for merely speculative purposes shall be recognized in any manner by said Secretary.'\n\n The fifth proviso declared that the settlement of any claim under the section should not bar the government through any authorized agency or any congressional committee thereafter duly appointed from the review of such settlement, nor the right to recover any money paid by the government to any party under the section if the government had been defrauded. \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n The last paragraph of the section declared 'that nothing in this section shall be construed to confer jurisdiction upon any court to entertain a suit against the United States,' and closed with a proviso that in determining the net losses of any claimant, the Secretary should take into consideration and charge to him the then market value of any ores or minerals on hand belonging to him, and the salvage or usable value of his machinery or other appliances claimed to have been purchased to comply with the request of the government.\n On November 23, 1921, after the first award in this case, section 5 was amended (chapter 137, 42 Stat. 322) by adding another proviso that all claimants who in response to the request of any government agency mentioned in the act expended money 'in producing or preparing to produce' managnese, and had mailed their claims in time 'if the proof in support of said claims clearly shows them to be based upon action taken in response to such request ... shall be reimbursed such net losses as they may have incurred and are in justice and equity entitled to from the appropriation in said act. If in claims passed upon under said act awards have been denied or made on rulings contrary to the provisions of this amendment, or through miscalculation, the Secretary of the Interior may award proper amounts or additional amounts.'\n This amendment was brought about on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, because he had felt obliged, under section 5 as it was, to reject some 600 claims for failure within the time limit to show a direct personal request or demand upon the claimant by the government authorities named in the act and a response thereto by the claimant and because the Comptroller had refused to pay any changed award of the Secretary made after a rehearing or to correct miscalculation. \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that the refusal of the Secretary to allow the loss of $9, 600 on the real estate contract is in the teeth of the third proviso, which requires him to allow for expenditures made or obligations incurred 'for and upon property' containing manganese in sufficient quantities to be of commercial importance. The Interior Department had held from the beginning that this proviso did not embrace money spent for real estate or mining rights. The ruling was based in part at least on the legislative history of the bill, which showed that it originally contained an express provision for expenditures for real estate as a proper element in calculating the net losses to be reimbursed, and that this provision was objected to as involving too speculative a subject-matter and it was stricken out. The Department's view was that expenditures 'for and upon' property containing manganese and other metals did not include cost of real estate or mining rights because too speculative under the limitations of the fourth proviso and were intended to be confined to expenditures for construction, equipment and machinery in development of such property.\n We are asked to reject this interpretation as wholly at variance with the natural and necessary meaning of the words and to confirm the courts below in enforcing a view more liberal to the claimant.\n The above summary of section 5 clearly shows that Congress was seeking to save the beneficiaries from losses which it would have been under no legal obligation to make good if a private person. It was a gratuity based on equitable and moral considerations. United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427, 439\n, 16 S. Ct. 1120; Allen v. Smith, \n173 \nU.S. 389, 402\n, 19 S. Ct. 446. Congress did not wish to create a legal claim. It was not dealing with vested rights. It did not, as it did with the claims for supplies and services directly furnished the government under the first and second sections of the act, make the losses recoverable in \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 182]\n\u00a0\n a court, but expressly provided otherwise. It dealt with the subject with the utmost caution. It hedged the granting of the equitable gratuity with limitations to prevent the use of the statute for the recovery of doubtful or fraudulent claims or merely speculative losses. It vested the Secretary with power to reject all losses except as he was satisfied that they were just and equitable and it made his decision conclusive and final. Final against whom? Against the claimant. He could not resort to court to review the Secretary's decision. This was expressly forbidden. By the fifth proviso, however, the government was permitted through any of its agencies or even by a committee of Congress duly authorized, to review the settlement by the Secretary and by necessary implication to reverse it. If the government was defrauded, it was authorized to sue to recover any money paid under the award.\n Congress was occupying toward the proposed beneficiaries of section 5 the attitude rather of a benefactor, than of a debtor at law. Congress intended the Secretary to act for it, and to construe the meaning of the words used to describe the elements of the net losses to be ascertained and to give effect to his interpretation without the intervention of the courts. This statute presents a case of as wide discretion as was held to have been vested in the Secretary of the Navy in the Decatur Case.\n Nor does the amendment of 1921 change the effect of the act in this regard. His counsel insist that it was adopted in order to relieve claimants from previous narrow rulings of the Secretary. There is nothing in the amendment that indicates the congressional purpose to do more than it purports to do, i. e., to enable the Secretary to entertain claims for losses incurred at the instance of any government agencies whether direct and personal or by public invitation, and to enable the Secretary to grant rehearings, correct miscalculation and award additional \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 183]\n\u00a0\n amounts. The amendments still left all claims to his sense of justice and equity.\n Two cases upon which the relator relies do not aid him. They depend on the construction of the particular statute. In Work v. Mosier, \n261 \nU.S. 352\n, 43 S. Ct. 389, we held that the statutory direction that certain income due minors of the Osage Indians be paid was clear and positive and it was not left to the Secretary of the Interior to vary it, i. e., he was not given discretion finally to construe it. In Work v. McAlester, \n262 \nU.S. 200\n, 43 S. Ct. 580, it was held that by virtue of the statute a lessee had a vested right to buy the land at an original appraisement and that the Secretary had no authority to affect that right by ordering another appraisement.\n Ness v. Fisher, \n223 \nU.S. 683\n, 32 S. Ct. 356, Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 \nU.S. 316\n, 23 S. Ct. 698, Alaska Smokeless Co. v. Lane, \n250 \nU.S. 549\n, 40 S. Ct. 33, and Hall v. Payne, \n254 \nU.S. 343\n, 41 S. Ct. 131, were all cases in which it was sought to control and reverse rulings of the Secretary of the Interior, on the ground that he had in the administration of the land laws made a ruling contrary to law against an applicant for action by him. In each case it was held that as the statute intended to vest in the Secretary the discretion to construe the land laws and make such rulings, no court could reverse or control them by mandamus in the absence of anything to show that they were capricious or arbitrary. It was pointed out that a mandamus could not be made to serve the function of a writ of error, and the mere fact that the court might deem the ruling erroneous in law gave it no power to intervene. These cases are supported by earlier authorities to the same effect. United States ex rel. Tucker v. Seaman, 17 How. 225; Gaines v. Thompson, 7 Wall. 347; Litchfield v. The Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575; United States ex rel. Dunlap v. Black, \n128 \nU.S. 40\n, 9 S. Ct. 12. All rest upon the Decatur Case. Compare United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S. Ct. 464. There is \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 184]\n\u00a0\n nothing in the award by the Secretary in the case at bar which would justify characterizing it as arbitrary or capricious or fraudulent or an abuse of discretion. The Secretary's view that it was not just or equitable to include loss by a land purchase within the gratuity of the government as defined by the statute must therefore prevail against mandamus.\n Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 \nU.S. 174\n, 37 S. Ct. 558; Ballinger v. Frost, \n216 \nU.S. 240\n, 30 S. Ct. 338; Garfield v. Goldsby, \n211 \nU.S. 249\n, 29 S. Ct. 62; Roberts v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221\n, 20 S. Ct. 376; Butterworth v. Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50\n, 5 S. Ct. 25; United States v. Schurz, \n102 U.S. 378\n, were all cases in which the court found that all the conditions had been fulfilled upon which the relator in the mandamus was entitled to call upon the officer to do an act beneficial to the relator and that the act was thus a ministerial duty as in the Kendall Case.\n There is a class of cases in which a relator in mandamus has successfully sought to compel action by an officer who has discretion concededly conferred on him by law. The relator in such cases does not ask for a decision any particuar way but only that it be made one way or the other. Such are Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638\n, 38 S. Ct. 408, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humboldt S. S. Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474\n, 32 S. Ct. 556. They follow the decision in Commissioner of Patents v. Whiteley, 4 Wall. 522. They are analogous to Hohorst, Petitioner, \n150 \nU.S. 653\n, 14 S. Ct. 221; Parker, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 221\n, 9 S. Ct. 708; Ex parte Parker, \n120 \nU.S. 737\n, 7 S. Ct. 767, and others which hold that mandamus may issue to an inferior judicial tribunal if it refuses to take jurisdiction when by law it ought to do so, or where, having obtained jurisdiction, it refuses to proceed in its exercise. It is sought to bring the present case within this class by the averment in the petition that the Secretary of the Interior has refused to take jurisdiction of the claim for the loss of $9, 600 through the real estate contract. This averment \n\n[267 U.S. 175, 185]\n\u00a0\n is met by a denial in the answer and the affirmative allegation that the Secretary did consider the claim and disallowed it for cause deemed by him to be good. This mandamus was granted by the courts below on demurrer to the answer. Its allegations must be taken as admitted. Moreover, it is clearly shown by the exhibits to the pleadings that the Secretary decided that on its merits the claim was not for the kind of loss which Congress intended the Secretary to reimburse.\n Our conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the contention of the government that the relator here is estopped to urge the present claim by his acceptance of the award already made.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYEE HEM v.

Breitenstein, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[268 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Donovan, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was convicted in the court below of the offense of concealing a quantity of smoking opium after importation, with knowledge that it had been imported in violation of Act Feb. 9, 1909, c. 100, 35 Stat. 614, as amended by Act Jan. 17, 1914, c. 9, 38 Stat. 275 (Comp. St .  8800-8801f). Sections 2 and 3 of the act as amended (Comp. St.  8801, 8801a) are challenged as unconstitutional, on the ground that they contravene the due process of law and the compulsory self-incrimination clauses of the Fifth Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n Section 1 of the Act (Comp. St.  8800) prohibits the importation into the United States of opium in any form after April 1, 1909, except that opium and preparations and derivatives thereof, other than smoking opium or opium prepared for \n\n[268 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n smoking, may be imported for medicinal purposes only, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 2 provides, among other things, that if any person shall conceal or facilitate the concealment of such opium, etc., after importation, knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law, the offender shall be subject to fine or imprisonment or both. It further provides that whenever the defendant on trial is shown to have, or to have had, possession of such opium, etc., 'such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant shall explain the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.' Section 3 provides that on and after July 1, 1913:\n'All smoking opium or opium prepared for smoking found within the United States shall be presumed to have been imported after the first day of April, nineteen hundred and nine, and the burden of proof shall be on the claimant or the accused to rebut such presumption.'\n\n The plaintiff in error, at the time of his arrest in August, 1923, was found in possession of and concealing a quantity of smoking opium. The lower court overruled a motion for an instructed verdict of not guilty, and, after stating the foregoing statutory presumptions, charged the jury in substance that the burden of proof was on the accused to rebut such presumptions; and that it devolved upon him to explain that he was rightfully in possession of the smoking opium-'at least explain it to the satisfaction of the jury.' The court further charged that the defendant was presumed to be innocent until the government had satisfied the minds of the jurors of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; that the burden to adduce such proof of guilt beyond the existence of a reasonable doubt rested on the government at all times and throughout the trial; and that a conviction could not be had 'while a rational doubt remains in the minds of the jury.' \n\n[268 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n The authority of Congress to prohibit the importation of opium in any form and, as a measure reasonably calculated to aid in the enforcement of the prohibition, to make its concealment with knowledge of its unlawful importation a criminal offense, is not open to doubt. Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216\n, 35 S. Ct. 285; Steinfeldt v. United States, 219 F. 879, 135 C. C. A. 549. The question presented is whether Congress has power to enact the provisions in respect of the presumptions arising from the unexplained possession of such opium and from its presence in this country after the time fixed by the statute.\n In Mobile, etc., R. R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 43 S., 31 S. Ct. 136, 137, 138 (55 L. Ed. 78, 32 L. R. A. [N. S.] 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463 ), this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Lurton, said:\n'The law of evidence is full of presumptions either of fact or law. The former are, of course, disputable, and the strength of any inference of one fact from proof of another depends upon the generality of the experience upon which it is founded. ...\n\n'Legislation providing that proof of one fact shall constitute prima facie evidence of the main fact in issue is but to enact a rule of evidence, and quite within the general power of government. Statutes, national and state, dealing with such methods of proof in both civil and criminal cases abound, and the decisions upholding them are numerous. ...\n\n'That a legislative presumption of one fact from evidence of another may not constitute a denial of due process of law or a denial of the equal protection of the law it is only essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact provided and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate. So, also, it must not, under a guise of regulating the presentation of evidence, operate to preclude the party from the right to present his defense to the main fact thus presumed.' \n\n[268 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n See, also, Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 25\n, 34 S. Ct. 10; State v. Moriarty, 50 Conn. 415, 417; Commonwealth v. Williams, 6 Gray (Mass.) 1, 3; State v. Sheehan, 28 R. I. 160, 66 A. 66.\n\n The legislative provisions here assailed satisfy these requirements in respect of due process. They have been upheld against similar attacks, without exception so far as we are advised, by the lower federal courts. Charley Toy v. United States (C. C. A.) 266 F. 326, 329; Gee Woe v. United States, 250 F. 428, 162 C. C. A. 498; Ng Choy Fong v. United States, 245 F. 305, 157 C. C. A. 497; United States v. Yee Fing (D. C.) 222 F. 154; United States v. Ah Hung (D. C.) 243 F. 762, 764. We think it is not an illogical inference that opium, found in this country more than 4 years ( in the present case, more than 14 years) after its importation had been prohibited, was unlawfully imported. Nor do we think the further provision, that possession of such opium in the absence of a satisfactory explanation shall create a presumption of guilt, is 'so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.' By universal sentiment, and settled policy as evidenced by state and local legislation for more than half a century, opium is an illegitimate commodity, the use of which, except as a medicinal agent, is rigidly condemned. Legitimate possession, unless for medicinal use, is so highly improbable that to say to any person who obtains the outlawed commodity, 'since you are bound to know that it cannot be brought into this country at all, except under regulation for medicinal use, you must at your peril ascertain and be prepared to show the facts and circumstances which rebut, or tend to rebut, the natural inference of unlawful importation, or your knowledge of it,' is not such an unreasonable requirement as to cause it to fall outside the constitutional power of Congress.\n Every accused person, of course, enters upon his trial clothed with the presumption of innocence. But that presumption may be overcome, not only by direct proof, but, in many cases, when the facts standing alone are \n\n[268 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n not enough, by the additional weight of a countervailing legislative presumption. If the effect of the legislative act is to give to the facts from which the presumption is drawn an artificial value to some extent, it is no more than happens in respect of a great variety of presumptions not resting upon statute. See Dunlop v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486, 502\n, 503 S., 17 S. Ct. 375; Wilson v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 613, 619\n, 16 S. Ct. 895. In the Wilson Case the accused, charged with murder, was found, soon after the homicide, in possession of property that had belonged to the dead man. This court upheld a charge of the trial court to the effect that such possession required the accused to account for it, to show that as far as he was concerned the possession was innocent and honest, and that if not so accounted for it became 'the foundation for a presumption of guilt against the defendant.'\n The point that the practical effect of the statute creating the presumption is to compel the accused person to be a witness against himself may be put aside with slight discussion. The statute compels nothing. It does no more than to make possession of the prohibited article prima facie evidence of guilt. It leaves the accused entirely free to testify or not as he chooses. If the accused happens to be the only repository of the facts necessary to negative the presumption arising from his possession, that is a misfortune which the statute under review does not create but which is inherent in the case. The same situation might present itself if there were no statutory presumption and a prima facie case of concealment with knowledge of unlawful importation were made by the evidence. The necessity of an explanation by the accused would be quite as compelling in that case as in this; but the constraint upon him to give testimony would arise there, as it arises here, simply from the force of circumstances and not from any form of compulsion forbidden by the Constitution.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","222":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYEISER v. DYSART(1925)\nNo. 130\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1925\n\n\n\n Mr. John O. Yeiser, of Omaha, Neb., in pro. per\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon a report of the respondents, a committee of members of the bar, the plaintiff in error was ordered to be suspended from the right to practice as attorney unless he should refund to a client a fee received by him of $620 and interest within a time fixed. The ground of the order was that by section 3031, Comp. St. 1922, only such sum could be demanded for services in bringing a suit under the Workmen's Compensation Act of the State as the Court \n\n[267 U.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n should allow, and that a contract for other and further pay was void. The Supreme Court of the State while crediting the plaintiff in error with an honest belief that the statute had a narrower meaning, made the order complained of and the case is brought here on a contention that the statute as construed unreasonably restricts the liberty of contract and contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving the plaintiff in error of his liberty and property without due process of law.\n The plaintiff in error recognizes that this Court is bound by the construction given to the State law by the State Court, yet wastes a good deal of argument in the effort to prove the construction wrong. When the constitutional question is reached late cases are relied upon for the general proposition that unreasonable interference with freedom of contract cannot be sustained. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238; Charles Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630. But the question is specific, whether we can pronounce this law unreasonable, against the opinion of the Legislature and Supreme Court of the State. The Court adverts to the fact that a large proportion of those who come under the statute have to look to it in case of injury and need to be protected against improvident contracts, in the interest not only of themselves and their families but of the public. A somewhat similar principle has been sanctioned by this Court. Calhoun v. Massie, \n253 \nU.S. 170\n, 40 S. Ct. 474. When we add the considerations that an attorney practices under a license from the State and that the subject- matter is a right created by statute it is obvious that the State may attach such conditions to the license in respect of such matters as it believes to be necessary in order to make it a public good. Of course a reasonable time from the issue of the mandate of this Court will be allowed for the plaintiff in error to comply with the judgment affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n"}}
