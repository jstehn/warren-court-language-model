States Supreme Court\nA. MAGNANO CO. v. HAMILTON(1934)\nNo. 589\nArgued: March 7, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington.\n Mr. Otto B. Rupp, of Seattle, Wash., and Mr. J. Craig Peacock, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Messrs. E. P. Donnelly and Philip D. Macbride, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellees. \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 41]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant assails as invalid a statute of the state of Washington which levies an excise tax of 15 cents per pound on all butter substitutes sold within the state (Laws Wash. 1931, p. 77). Every distributor of such butter substitutes is required to file a duly acknowledged certificate with the Director of Agriculture, containing the name under which the distributor is transacting business within the state, and other specified information. Sale of any butter substitute is forbidden until such certificate is furnished. The distributor must render to the Director of Agriculture, on the 15th day of each month, a sworn statement of the \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n number of pounds of butter substitutes sold during the preceding calendar month. Section 10 of the act provides that the tax shall not be imposed on butter substitutes when sold for exportation to any other state, territory, or nation; and any payment or the doing of any act which would constitute an unlawful burden upon the sale or distribution of butter substitutes in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is by section 13 excluded from the operation of the act. Violation of any provision of the act is denounced as a gross misdemeanor.\n Appellant is a Washington corporation, and has for many years been engaged in importing and selling 'Nucoa,' a form of oleomargarine. Prior to the passage of the act, it had derived a large annual net profit from sales made within the state. Since then, claiming the tax to be prohibitive, it has made no intrastate sales and no effort to do so. 'Nucoa' is a nutritious and pure article of food, with a well-established place in the dietary.\n Suit was brought to enjoin the enforcement of the act, on the ground that it violates the Federal Constitution in the following particulars: (1) That the imposition of the tax has the effect of depriving complainant of its property without due process of law and of denying to it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) that the tax is not levied for a public purpose, but for the sole purpose of burdening or prohibiting the manufacture, importation, and sale of oleomargarine, in aid of the dairy industry; (3) that the act imposes an unjust and discriminatory burden upon interstate commerce; and (4) that it interferes with the power of Congress to levy and collect taxes, imposts, and excises, in violation of article 1,  8.\n The case came before a statutory court of three judges, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380), first upon an application for an interlocutory injunction, which was denied (D.C.) 2 F.Supp. 414, and subse- \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n quently for final hearing, at the conclusion of which that court made written findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723), and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. (D.C.) 2 F.Supp. 417.\n First. We put aside at once all of the foregoing contentions, except the one relating to due process of law, as being plainly without merit. (1) In respect of the equal protection clause it is obvious that the differences between butter and oleomargarine are sufficient to justify their separate classification for purposes of taxation. (2) That the tax is for a public purpose is equally clear, since that requirement has regard to the use which is to be made of the revenue derived from the tax, and not to any ulterior motive or purpose which may have influenced the Legislature in passing the act. And a tax designed to be expended for a public purpose does not cease to be one levied for that purpose because it has the effect of imposing a burden upon one class of business enterprises in such a way as to benefit another class. (3) The act, considered as a whole, clearly negatives the idea that a burden is imposed upon interstate commerce, as the court below held. The tax is confined to sales within the state, and (sections 10 and 13, supra) has no application to sales of oleomargarine to be either imported or exported in interstate commerce. (4) The contention that the act interferes with the taxing power of the United States seems to be based upon the supposition that the state tax is so great that it will put an end to the sale of oleomargarine within the state of Washington, and thereby destroy a potential subject of federal taxation. Assuming such a consequence and putting other questions aside, the effect of it upon appellant would be so remote, speculative, and indirect as to afford appellant no basis for invoking the powers of a court of equity. Compare Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 487\n, 43 S. Ct. 597; Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 18 S., 47 S.Ct. 265. \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 44]\n\u00a0\n Second. Except in rare and special instances,1 the due process of law clause contained in the Fifth Amendment is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S.Ct. 236. And no reason exists for applying a different rule against a state in the case of the Fourteenth Amendment. French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324, 329\n, 21 S.Ct. 625; Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 326\n, 52 S. Ct. 358. That clause is applicable to a taxing statute such as the one here assailed only if the act be so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power, as, for example, the confiscation of property. Compare McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423; Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 U.S. 20\n, 37 et seq., 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 60\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R., supra, \n240 \nU.S. 24, 25\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L.R.A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson, \n173 \nU.S. 592, 614\n, 615 S., 19 S.Ct. 553; Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 52 A.L.R. 1081. Collateral purposes or motives of a Legislature in levying a tax of a kind within the reach of its lawful power are matters beyond the scope of judicial inquiry. McCray v. United States, supra, \n195 U.S. 56\n- 59, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561. Nor may a tax within the lawful power of a state be judicially stricken down under the due process clause simply because its enforcement may or will result in restricting or even destroying particular occupations or businesses (Citizens' Sav. & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, 663, 664; McCray v. United States, supra, \n195 U.S. 56\n-58, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561, and authorities cited; Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 49 S., 41 S.Ct. 219; Child Labor Tax Case, supra, \n259 U.S. 38\n, 40- 43, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432), unless, indeed, as already indicated, its neces- \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n sary interpretation and effect be such as plainly to demonstrate that the form of taxation was adopted as a mere disguise, under which there was exercised, in reality, another and different power denied by the Federal Constitution to the state. The present case does not furnish such a demonstration.\n The point may be conceded that the tax is so excessive that it may or will result in destroying the intrastate business of appellant; but that is precisely the point which was made in the attack upon the validity of the 10 per cent. tax imposed upon the notes of state banks involved in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 548. This court there disposed of it by saying that the courts are without authority to prescribe limitations upon the exercise of the acknowledged powers of the legislative departments. 'The power to tax may be exercised oppressively upon persons, but the responsibility of the legislature is not to the courts, but to the people by whom its members are elected.' Again, in the McCray Case, supra, answering a like contention, this court said (page 59 of 195 U.S., 24 S.Ct. 769, 778) that the argument rested upon the proposition 'that, although the tax be within the power, as enforcing it will destroy or restrict the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine, therefore the power to levy the tax did not obtain. This, however, is but to say that the question of power depends, not upon the authority conferred by the Constitution, but upon what may be the consequence arising from the exercise of the lawful authority.' And it was held that if a tax be within the lawful power of the Legislature, the exertion of the power may not be restrained because of the results to arise from its exercise.\n In Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, supra, 255 U.S., 48, 49, 41 S.Ct. 219, 220, a statute of Alaska levying a heavy license tax upon persons manufacturing fish oil, etc., was upheld as constitutional against the contention that it would prohibit and confiscate plain- \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 46]\n\u00a0\n tiff's business. 'Even if the tax,' the court said, 'should destroy a business it would not be made invalid or require compensation upon that ground alone. Those who enter upon a business take that risk. ... The Acts must be judged by their contents not by the allegations as to their purpose in the complaint. We know of no objection to exacting a discouraging rate as the alternative to giving up a business, when the legislature has the full power of taxation.'\n In the Child Labor Tax Case, supra, this court, in holding unconstitutional the provisions of the Revenue Act of February 24, 1919 ( 40 Stat. 1138) imposing a tax upon the employment of child labor, fully recognized the foregoing limitations upon the judicial authority; but declared that the act constituted an attempt to regulate a matter exclusively within the control of the state, and that although the exaction was called a tax it was, in fact, not a tax but a penalty exacted for the violation of the regulation. 'Taxes are occasionally imposed,' it was said (page 38 of 259 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 449, 451), 'in the discretion of the Legislature on proper subjects with the primary motive of obtaining revenue from them and with the incidental motive of discouraging them by making their continuance onerous. They do not lose their character as taxes because of the incidental motive. But there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses its character as such and becomes a mere penalty, with the characteristics of regulation and punishment. Such is the case in the law before us.'\n The statute here under review is in form plainly a taxing act, with nothing in its terms to suggest that it was intended to be anything else. It must be construed, and the intent and meaning of the Legislature ascertained, from the language of the act, and the words used therein \n\n[292 U.S. 40, 47]\n\u00a0\n are to be given their ordinary meaning unless the context shows that they are differently used. Child Labor Tax Case, supra, \n259 \nU.S. 36\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432. If the tax imposed had been 5 cents instead of 15 cents per pound, no one, probably, would have thought of challenging its constitutionality or of suggesting that under the guise of imposing a tax another and different power had in fact been exercised. If a contrary conclusion were reached in the present case, it could rest upon nothing more than the single premise that the amount of the tax is so excessive that it will bring about the destruction of appellant's business, a premise which, standing alone, this court heretofore has uniformly rejected as furnishing no juridical ground for striking down a taxing act. As we have already seen, it was definitely rejected in the Veazie Bank Case, where it was urged that the tax was 'so excessive as to indicate a purpose on the part of Congress to destroy the franchise of the bank'; in the McCray Case, where it was said that the discretion of Congress could not be controlled or limited by the courts because the latter might deem the incidence of the tax oppressive or even destructive; in the Alaska Fish Case, from which we have just quoted; and in the Child Labor Tax Case, where it was held that the intent of Congress must be derived from the language of the act, and that a prohibition instead of a tax was intended might not be inferred solely from its heavy burden.\n From the beginning of our government, the courts have sustained taxes although imposed with the collateral intent of effecting ulterior ends which, considered apart, were beyond the constitutional power of the lawmakers to realize by legislation directly addressed to their accomplishment. Those decisions, as the foregoing discussion discloses, rule the present case.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Brushaber v.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. H.

The first related to the transportation of 2,022,248.41 barrels for Cosden & Co. between November 1, 1917, and March 31, 1919, whereon an additional assessment of $15,066.87 was made and collected. The second related to the transportation of 20,644,020.34 barrels for the same company between April 1, 1919, and March 31, 1921, whereon an additional assessment of $170,946.04 was made and collected, of which sum a refund of $5,793.76 was made pending the suit, thereby reducing the claim to $165,152.289 The third related to the transportation of 3,666,048.39 barrels for the same company between July 1, 1918, and March 31, 1919, whereon an assessment of $36,666.50, was made and collected. The fourth related to the transportation of 99,590.31 barrels for the Pierce Oil Corporation between November 1, 1917, and March 31, 1919, whereon an assessment of $995.90 was made and collected.\n The issues were tried under a written stipulation waiving a jury, and the court made special findings of fact and declarations of law whereon it rendered a judgment awarding the plaintiff the full amount of each of the first two claims, $18,333.25 on the third, and $746.92 on the fourth, with interest on each of these sums.\n The defendant appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which sustained the awards on the first and second claims, wholly rejected the third, reduced the award on the fourth $375.71, and accorded the plaintiff a limited time within which to file a remittitur of the amount awarded on the third claim and of $375.71 of that awarded on the fourth. The remittitur was seasonably filed, and thereupon the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court as modified and reduced by the remittitur. 63 F.(2d) 663.\n The case is here on certiorari. \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n The discussion in the briefs makes it advisable to point out at the outset that we have no occasion to re-examine the third and fourth claims. In the District Court each of these claims was allowed in part and rejected in part. The defendant alone appealed. In the Court of Appeals the third claim was rejected and the award on the fourth reduced. The defendant alone petitioned for a review here. In this situation the plaintiff is not entitled to be heard in opposition to the parts of the decision of the Court of Appeals which were adverse to it, as were the rejection of the third claim and the reduction of the award on the fourth, but only in support of the parts which were in its favor. As to the former, it has acquiesced and become concluded by not seasonably petitioning for a review. \n1\n And the defendant is not entitled to complain of the parts of the decision which were in his favor, as were the rejection of the third claim and the reduction of the award on the fourth, but only of such as were adverse to him,2 as was the refusal wholly to disapprove, or further to reduce, the award on the fourth claim. It is doubtful that the defendant's petition for certiorari contains any \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n real challenge of the ruling of the Court of Appeals on the fourth claim. But, be this as it may, the Solicitor General, speaking for the defendant, in the argument at the bar disclaimed any purpose to ask this Court to re- examine or disturb that ruling. This disclaimer, made on behalf of the only party who then had any semblance of right to ask such a re- examination, eliminated any need for considering the fourth claim just as a like disclaimer in the petition for certiorari would have done. For these reasons it should be understood that the merits of the third and fourth claims are not here under consideration, but are regarded as settled by the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n Another matter bearing on the scope of the present examination needs attention. The defendant asks that the evidence be examined in connection with his motion for judgment thereon which was made and denied in the trial court, and the plaintiff answers that this cannot be done because the evidence has not been brought into the record by a proper bill of exceptions. The objections which the plaintiff makes to the bill are that it does not purport to contain all of the evidence, but only such as is material to the defendant's assignment of errors, and that the evidence, both testimonial and documentary, appearing therein, is set out without any attempt at condensation or narration.\n Rule 10 of the Court of Appeals,3 like rule 8 of this Court,4 provides:\n'Only so much of the evidence shall be embraced in a bill of exceptions as may be necessary to present clearly the questions of law involved in the ruling to which exceptions are reserved, and such evidence as is embraced therein shall be set forth in condensed and narrative form, save as a proper understanding of the questions presented may require that parts of it be set forth otherwise.' \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n The bill, after the usual introductory recitals, contains an agreed statement of particular facts, sets out other evidence produced by the plaintiff and by the defendant, each in turn, and then says, 'This is all the evidence offered and taken at the trial.' Other statements follow to the effect that later on, but before the finding, the court admitted an additional and specified item of evidence to which the parties agreed; that at the close of the evidence the defendant moved for judgment in his favor as to each of the claims because there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding or judgment against him; and that the court denied this motion and the defendant reserved an exception. At the end is a stipulation wherein the parties, through their counsel, agree that the bill contains 'all the evidence material to the defendant's assignment of errors' and all exceptions taken in the course of the trial, and consent that 'the same be settled and filed as the settled bill of exceptions'; and then follows a certificate by the trial judge authenticating and allowing the bill in the same terms that are used in the stipulation. The reference in the stipulation and certificate to 'the defendant's assignment of errors' is explained by the fact that during the period given for the preparation and presentation of the bill the defendant had sought and the trial judge had allowed an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and with his application for the appeal the defendant had presented and filed an assignment of errors showing the rulings and questions which he intended to present on the appeal; one of the rulings being the denial of his motion at the close of the evidence for judgment thereon in his favor.\n\n A survey of the bill from its beginning to its end shows, we think, that it contains all of the evidence. The statement to that effect in the body of the bill is not overcome or qualified by the statement in the concluding stipulation and certificate that it contains all that is 'material to the \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 490]\n\u00a0\n defendant's assignment of errors.' When regard is had to the circumstances in which the later statement was made, there is no room to doubt that it was intended to be, and is, as comprehensive as the first. As the defendant's assignment of errors, to which the stipulation and certificate refer, brought in question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment, the conclusion is unavoidable that counsel when entering into the stipulation and the trial judge when giving the certificate understood that all the evidence was material to the solution of that question, and that they used the terms appearing in the stipulation and certificate as comprehending not merely a part of the evidence, but all of it. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the evidence is set out without any attempt at condensation or narration; but it is also true that the plaintiff expressly consented to the allowance of the bill in this form, and that the Court of Appeals not only made no criticism of the bill, but examined the evidence and rejected the third claim as without necessary evidential support.\n The evidence is not of large volume. Besides five pages of stipulated facts, it includes twenty pages of testimony given by three witnesses and thirty pages of documents. Without doubt much of it could have been condensed and narrated without in any wise affecting its purport or substance,6 but other parts, particularly some of the documents, are of such a nature that a literal reproduction well might have been regarded as essential to a proper understanding of them.\n Of course, the rule relating to condensation and narration should be respected by the bar and by trial judges,7 and should be appropriately enforced by appellate \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 491]\n\u00a0\n courts;8 but we are of opinion that in the circumstances here shown the plaintiff is not in a position where it with good grace can complain of the form in which the evidence is set out, and that the infraction of the rule in this instance is not of such extent or moment as to justify us in now declining to regard the evidence as brought into the record by the bill.\n We come then to a consideration of the first and second claims. The errors assigned as to them involve the sufficiency of the evidence to support any judgment against the defendant and the sufficiency of the special findings to support the particular judgment rendered thereon. Most of the pertinent findings have such support in the evidence that they must be accepted here, but some are without such support. We shall summarize the facts found so far as they are pertinent, and shall refer to the evidence where there is need for it. In this way the evidence and findings will both be reflected sufficiently for present purposes.\n The plaintiff, an Oklahoma corporation, owns pipe lines leading into Tulsa, Okl., from oil fields in that state, and operates its lines in the transportation, intrastate, of crude oil. All of its stock is owned by Cosden & Co., another Oklahoma corporation, which operates an oil refinery at Tulsa. While not stated in the findings, the evidence shows that the two corporations are under substantially the same management, have the same offices, and in part have the same employees.\n The plaintiff is engaged chiefly in carrying oil for Cosden & Co., but it also carries large quantities for others. It does not hold itself out as a common \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 492]\n\u00a0\n carrier, is not required by the state to file or publish rates or tariffs, and does not file or promulgate either. Common carrier pipe lines operating in the vicinity of the plaintiff's lines have both trunk lines and gathering lines, and also tariff stations at which oil is received into the trunk lines. The plaintiff has no tariff stations and receives oil at any place along its lines where it can obtain the oil. Its lines are gathering lines only and comparable only to the gathering lines of the common carriers; and the service which it renders, as compared with that rendered by the common carriers, is a gathering service only. While not appearing in the findings, the stipulated facts included the following:\n'Any pipe line reaching from any point where oil is purchased or produced to the trunk or main line or to storage tanks at or near the main or trunk line or to tank farms is called a gathering line, without regard to its size, the distance, or the amount of oil carried through such line to the trunk or main pipe line, or to the trunk or main pipe line storage tanks, or to a tank farm.\n\n'The gathering charge is a sum paid for the service rendered in moving oil from the point where it is tendered to or received by the carrier, whether it be the working tank at the well or the storage tanks in the field, to the trunk or main line tariff stations, or to a tank farm of the carrier or to main-line storage tanks. And the rate charged for such gathering service is a flat rate, being the same by the same carrier in the same field, whether the distance traversed by the gathering line be twenty-five yards or twenty-five miles.'\n\n All of the matters recited thus far were true during the period of the transportation in question.\n The oil named in the first and second claims was owned by Cosden & Co. and was transported for it by the plaintiff in the latter's pipe line-that in the first claim between November 1, 1917, and March 31, \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 493]\n\u00a0\n 1919, and that in the second between April 1, 1919, and March 31, 1921\n\n\n The plaintiff charged and Cosden & Co. paid 5 cents per barrel for the transportation in the first claim and 10 cents per barrel for that in the second; and the plaintiff collected from Cosden & Co. and paid over to the revenue collector an excise tax on such transportation computed at the statutory rate on the amounts so charged and paid.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue found and ruled that 20 cents per barrel was the proper charge on which to base and compute the excise tax, and he accordingly made the additional assessments involved in the two claims. The plaintiff paid these assessments to the defendant collector, applied unsuccessfully for a refund, and then brought this suit.\n While there is no finding on the point, the evidence shows that the Commissioner, in holding 20 cents the proper charge on which to base and compute the tax, proceeded on the theory that the transportation included both a gathering and a trunk line service, and determined that 12 1\/2 cents was the proper charge for the former and 7 1\/2 cents for the latter.\n The usual and customary charge of common carrier pipe lines in that vicinity for gathering service was from 12 to 12 1\/2 cents per barrel from November 1, 1917, to December 31, 1921.\n The plaintiff's charge to Cosden & Co. during that period varied. From a date several months earlier than November 1, 1917, to July 1, 1918, the charge was 5 cents per barrel; from July 1, 1918, to March 31, 1919, no charge was made, although large quantities of oil were then being carried by the plaintiff for that company; and thereafter the charge was 10 cents. Its charges to others also varied. From November 1, 1917, to December 31, \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 494]\n\u00a0\n 1921, they ranged through 7, 10, 12, 15, and 17 1\/2 cents per barrel; and their average was 13 cents for the first five months of that period and 16. 4 cents for the rest of the time-the average being arrived at in each instance by dividing the total receipts from that transportation by the total number of barrels included therein.\n The plaintiff's 'actual costs and expenses of carrying oil' were 7.8 cents per barrel in 1918, 7.6 cents in 1919, 10.7 cents in 1920, and 8.8 cents in 1921. This finding is supported by uncontradicted evidence based on a definite computation made after the oil was carried and the costs and expenses were incurred. Two other findings are to the effect that the charges for carrying oil for Cosden & Co. were 'sufficient to take care of the actual costs and expenses' of that service. But these findings must be put aside. They rest entirely on a statement by one of the witnesses that the charges were fixed periodically by estimating in advance 'what the expenses of operating the pipe line would be' and 'how much oil would be pumped into the pipe line,' and are inconsistent with uncontradicted evidence showing the amount of oil carried and the actual costs and expenses as definitely computed after the transportation was completed.\n The trial court concluded as matter of law that, where the plaintiff made and collected a charge for carrying oil, that charge became, under the applicable statutes, the sole and exclusive basis for the collection of the transportation tax. It therefore held the additional assessments in the first and second claims wholly invalid, and gave the plaintiff an award for all that had been exacted from it under those assessments. The Court of Appeals sustained that ruling.\n The applicable statutes are sections 500, 501 and 503, of the Revenue Act of 1917,9 which was controlling at the time \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 495]\n\u00a0\n of the transportation in the first claim, and sections 500-502 of the Revenue Act of 1918,10 which was controlling at the time of the transportation in the second claim.\n The act of 1917, in section 500(d), imposed on the 'transportation of oil by pipe line' a tax 'equivalent to five per centum of the amount paid' therefor; in the first paragraph of section 501 declared the tax should be paid by the person 'paying for' the transportation; and in section 503 laid on the carrier a duty to collect the tax from the person paying for the transportation, to make informative monthly returns under oath, and to pay to the collector of internal revenue all taxes so collected by it and 'the taxes imposed upon it' under the second paragraph of section 501, which declared:\n'In case such carrier does not, because of its ownership of the commodity transported, or for any other reason, receive the amount which as a carrier it would otherwise charge, such carrier shall pay a tax equivalent to the tax which would be imposed upon the transportation of such commodity if the carrier received payment for such transportation: Provided, That in case of a carrier which on May first, nineteen hundred and seventeen, had no rates or tariffs on file with the proper Federal or State authority, the tax shall be computed on the basis of the rates or tariffs of other carriers for like services as ascertained and determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.'\n\n The act of 1918, in its sections 500(e), 501(a) and 502, re-enacted these provisions, save that it increased the tax to 8 per centum and substituted for the second paragraph of section 501 the following:\n'Sec. 501. ... (d) The tax imposed by subdivision (e) of section 500 shall apply to all transportation of oil by pipe line. In case no charge for transportation is made, \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 496]\n\u00a0\n by reason of ownership of the commodity transported, or for any other reason, the person transporting by pipe line shall pay a tax equivalent to the tax which would be imposed if such person received payment for such transportation, and if the tax can not be computed from actual bona fide rates or tariffs, it shall be computed (1) on the basis of the rates or tariffs of other pipe lines for like services, as determined by the Commissioner, or (2) if no such rates or tariffs exist, on the basis of a reasonable charge for such transportation, as determined by the Commissioner.'\n\n We cannot assent to the construction which the courts below placed on these statutes. It must be conceded that the statutes are not happily phrased and that some of their provisions separately considered give color to that construction. But the statutes are to be considered, each in its entirety and not as if each of its provisions was independent and unaffected by the others. Although imposing a tax, they are to be construed reasonably and the intent and purpose of each is to be ascertained by examining all of its provisions.\n From such an examination we are of opinion that both statutes disclose-that of 1917 by plain implication and that of 1918 by express declaration-an intent and purpose to impose the tax on all 'transportation' of oil by pipe line, whether the pipe line be a common carrier or a private carrier, and whether it be transporting its own oil or that of others. The Revenue Bureau has so construed them,11 and that construction has received judicial approval. 12 \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 497]\n\u00a0\n Plainly both statutes disclose an intent and purpose to lay the tax equally on all transportation of oil by pipe line and to prevent exceptional relations or conditions from effecting a departure from that standard. In the main both proceed on the assumption that usually carriers will charge and shippers pay the customary commercial rate for the transportation, and therefore that the amount charged and paid will be in most instances a fair basis on which to compute the tax. But neither statute stops there. Both recognize that there may be cases where the carrier, by reason of owning the oil or for other reasons, does not receive the compensation which it otherwise would receive; and both provide, although in somewhat different terms, for using the rates of other carriers for like services as a basis for computing the tax in such cases. We do not overlook the clause 'if the carrier received payment for such transportation' in the provision of the 1917 act, nor the clause 'in case no charge for transportation is made' in the provision of the 1918 act. But we think it apparent from each of the acts as a whole that the words 'payment' and 'charge' in the quoted clauses mean a payment and charge reasonably appropriate for the service rendered. The provisions in which those words are found distinctly reflect the sense in which the words are used, for they make the rates of other carriers for like services-in short, the commercial rates in that vicinity-an alternative or substitute basis for computing the tax. Obviously the provisions do not mean that a merely nominal payment or charge will avoid the tax, for this would render them absurd; and, if that be not their meaning, we perceive no meaning other than that before stated which reasonably can be attributed to them.\n It is said that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has construed the provisions last considered as not including instances where there is an actual payment, even though it be much below the customary charge, and we \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 498]\n\u00a0\n are asked to give effect to that construction. In this the fact is overlooked that it was the Commissioner who made the additional assessments now in question and refused the application for a refund. But it does appear that, while this suit has been pending, the Commissioner in several instances has allowed applications for a refund on the basis of the construction now asserted. Of that construction it suffices to say that it has been neither uniform nor of long standing, and that in these circumstances we would not be justified in yielding to it.\n When the statutes as we construe them are applied to the evidence and the special findings, it is plain that the defendant's motion for judgment in his favor on the evidence is not well taken as to the first and second claims, and that his objection that the special findings do not as to them support the judgment rendered against him is well taken. Under the evidence, and also the findings, the transportation involved in these claims was a gathering service and the proper charge therefor on which to base the tax was 12 1\/2 cents per barrel. The charges of 5 and 10 cents per barrel actually collected by the plaintiff were not appropriate for the service rendered. The plaintiff had been varying its charges without regard to the cost of the service or purpose to make the same charge to one patron as to another, and had no fixed rate that was appropriate. It therefore was necessary to resort to the accustomed rate of other carriers in the same field as a basis for the tax. Their accustomed rate for gathering service was 12 1\/2 cents per barrel. The additional assessments were made on a basis of 20 cents per barrel, and, to the extent that they rested on the difference between a rate of 12 1\/2 cents and a rate of 20 cents, they were excessive and invalid. As the plaintiff had paid the excess, it was entitled to recover it, but the recovery should not have included what was attributable to the gathering charge of 12 1\/2 cents per barrel. \n\n[290 U.S. 484, 499]\n\u00a0\n The judgments of both courts must be reversed as to the first and second claims, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to render judgment on the findings as to these claims in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion and to respect the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the third and fourth claims and the remittitur given thereunder.\n Judgments reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION(1934)\nNo. 363\nArgued: February 8, 1934Decided: March 12, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 587, 588]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Neave, of New York City, Arthur L. Shipman, of Hartford, Conn., Arthur F. Mullen, of Washington, D.C., and Charles Welles Gross and Wallace W. Brown, both of Hartford, Conn., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., Harold M. Stephens, Asst. Atty. Gen., Moses S. Huberman, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., and Robert E. Healy, Chief Counsel, Federal Trade Commission and Everett F. Haycraft, both of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 587, 589]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals1 affirmed an order of the Federal Trade Commission issued pursuant to section 7 of the Clayton Act. \n2\n A writ of certiorari was granted upon the claim of petitioner that the formation of a holding company which acquired all the voting shares of two manufacturing corporations was not in violation of the section, or, if it was, the merger of the two manufacturing corporations and dissolution of the holding company after complaint by the Federal Trade Commission deprived the latter of jurisdiction to make any order against the company formed by the merger. A proper understanding of these contentions requires a somewhat detailed statement of events prior and subsequent to the issuance of the complaint.\n The Arrow Electric Company, hereafter called Arrow, and the Hart & Hegeman Manufacturing Company, hereafter called Hart & Hegeman, were Connecticut corporations engaged in the manufacture and sale in interstate commerce of electric wiring devices. Both were solvent and successful. There was no community of ownership of the stock of the two concerns. Each had valuable trade-names by which its goods were known to consumers. \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 590]\n\u00a0\n Shortly after the death of the principal stockholder, who was also the president, of Hart & Hegeman, the major interests in that company got into touch with those controlling Arrow, and, after some negotiation, it was agreed that economies could be effected if the business of both were brought under common control. In view, however, of the competition between the goods known by the names of the two manufacturing companies, it was thought that the trade-names and the identity of the goods could best be preserved by retaining the separate corporate entities and the sales forces of the two organizations. The plan evolved was therefore that of a holding company which should own all of the common shares of both corporations, under the control of which the manufacturing and sales organizations should be kept separate and distinct and in competition with each other as theretofore. In order to bring about an equitable division of the stock of the proposed holding corporation, Arrow issued to its common stockholders a dividend in preferred stock. The recipients sold the preferred shares to a syndicate, which in turn sold them to the public. Hart & Hegeman increased its common stock and issued the new stock as a stock dividend. It also created an issue of preferred stock, which was sold to the public. Prior to the acquisition of the common stock by the holding company, the capitalization was as follows:\n Arrow-Common stock, $750,000, par $25. Preferred stock, $2,000,000, par $100.\n Hart & Hegeman-Common stock, $500,000, par $25. Preferred stock, $1, 333,300, par $100.\n The holders of preferred stock in each company were without the right to vote for directors except upon default in the payment of six successive dividends, in which case the preferred stockholders were entitled to elect the board. In October, 1927, Arrow-Hart & Hegeman, Incorporated, hereafter called the holding company, was \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 591]\n\u00a0\n organized under the laws of Connecticut. It had only common stock. The owners of all of the common shares of Arrow exchanged them for 120,000 shares of the stock of the holding company, and the owners of all the common shares of Hart & Hegeman exchanged them for 80,000 shares of the same stock.\n On March 3, 1928, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint in which it charged the effect of the holding and voting of all of the common shares of the two operating companies might be to substantially lessen competition between the companies in electrical wiring devices, to restrain commerce in those devices, and to create a monopoly. The holding company filed an answer traversing these allegations. Shortly thereafter counsel advised that the company be dissolved and its assets, consisting of the stock of Arrow and of Hart & Hegeman, be distributed amongst its stockholders, and that thereupon the two latter companies merge into a single corporation under the laws of Connecticut, thus transferring to the new corporation to be formed by merger all of the assets of Arrow and of Hart & Hegeman.\n It was discovered that such a program might cast heavy taxes upon the stockholders, and a modification was suggested to work out the plan in accordance with the reorganization sections of the Revenue Act of 1928. The stockholders of the holding company and the preferred stockholders of both the operating companies were notified of the original plan and of its modification, and proxies were asked so that their votes might be recorded at corporate meetings intended to be held to carry out the proposal. A two- thirds vote of both preferred and common stock is required by the law of Connecticut to authorize a merger.\n In lieu of the original program of distribution of the shares owned by the holding company to its stockholders, the shares of Arrow were transferred to a new company, \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 592]\n\u00a0\n called the Arrow Manufacturing Company, and those of Hart & Hegeman to another new company, known as the H. & H. Electric Company, against the issue of all of the shares of these companies respectively. The stock so to be issued by these two new holding companies was, by the direction of the original holding company, issued directly to its stockholders. As soon as this transfer of all its assets had been made to the two new holding companies by the old one, the latter by corporate action dissolved. Thereafter, pursuant to directors' action, the stockholders, preferred and common, of the four companies having an interest in the assets (Arrow, Hart & Hegeman, Arrow Manufacturing Company, and the H. & H. Electric Company), approved a merger agreement whereby the petitioner, the Arrow- Hart & Hegeman Electric Company, was formed, which directly owned in its own right all of the assets formerly belonging to Arrow and to Hart & Hegeman. These transactions were consummated on or prior to December 31, 1928, except that the dissolution of the first holding company did not become final until April 11, 1929; the law of Connecticut providing that a final certificate of dissolution should not issue until four months after the filing of the resolution for dissolution.\n January 11, 1929, counsel notified the Commission of the dissolution of the holding company and the formation of the petitioner. June 29, 1929, the Commission issued a supplemental complaint, entitled jointly against the holding company (the original respondent) and the petitioner (the corporation formed by the merger). After reciting in greater detail than above set forth the action taken, this complaint asserted that the formation of the petitioner was brought about by the contrivance and at the instigation of the holding company; that the conveyance of the stocks of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman to the two new holding companies failed to restore the assets \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 593]\n\u00a0\n to the ownership and control of separate groups in the manner the shares were held and controlled before the formation of the original holding company; that the result of the whole plan was not a restoration of competition as required by the act of Congress, and that the Commission's jurisdiction having timely attached could not be ousted by the steps subsequently taken.\n Petitioner answered the supplemental complaint, the matter was heard, and the Commission made its findings. In addition to the facts above recited, the Commission found that, at the time of the acquisition of the stocks of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman by the holding company, those corporations were in direct and substantial competition in interstate commerce, and, after the formation of the holding company, competition between them had been substantially curtailed. The Commission concluded: The acquisition by the holding company of the shares of the two manufacturing companies might substantially lessen competition between them, restrain interstate commerce, and create a monopoly; the divestment by the holding company was not a compliance with the Clayton Act; the petitioner was organized by the holding company, and its creation was an artifice to evade the provisions of sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act ( 15 USCA  18, 21); and the effect of the organization of the petitioner and 'the acquisition by it of the common or voting stocks of' Arrow and Hart & Hegeman has been, is, and may be, to suppress competition between the two manufacturing companies, to restrain interstate commerce, and to create a monopoly.\n The Commission entered an order commanding the petitioner to cease and desist from violation of the provision of section 7 of the Clayton Act, and to divest itself 'of all the common stock of' Hart & Hegeman 'so as to include in such divestment' the said company's manufacturing plants and equipment, and all other property necessary to the conduct and operation thereof as a complete \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 594]\n\u00a0\n going concern, and so as neither directly nor indirectly to retain any of the fruits of the acquisition of common stock of Hart & Hegeman; or, in the alternative, to divest itself of 'all the common stock of' Arrow in the same manner. It was further ordered 'that such divestment of the common stock or assets' of Arrow or Hart & Hegeman, as the case might be, should not be made directly or indirectly to the petitioner or any stockholders, officers, employees, or agents of or under the control of the petitioner.\n The findings with respect to the effect of the acquisition and ownership by the holding company of the shares of the two manufacturing corporations are attacked as unsupported in fact and unjustified in law. The record is said to disclose that competition was not in fact diminished but preserved. And it is further argued that, if competition was or might be in some measure curtailed by the device of a holding company, the result is unimportant and insignificant unless the public was injured, and not only is there a total absence of proof of injury to the public, but much affirmative evidence that consumers were benefited by reduction of prices consequent on manufacturing efficiency made possible by unified control.\n It is unnecessary to discuss or to decide the questions thus raised, for we think the Commission lacked authority to issue any order against the petitioner.\n Section 7 of the Clayton Act forbids any corporation to acquire the whole or any part of the share capital of two or more corporations, where the effect of the acquisition or the use of the stock by voting or otherwise may be to substantially lessen competition between such corporations, restrain competition in interstate commerce, or create a monopoly in any line of commerce. Section 113 specifies the remedy which the Commission may apply, \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 595]\n\u00a0\n namely, that it may, after hearing, order the violator to divest itself of the stock held contrary to the terms of the act. The statute does not forbid the acquirement of property, or the merger of corporations pursuant to state laws, nor does it provide any machinery for compelling a divestiture of assets acquired by purchase or otherwise, or the distribution of physical property brought into a single ownership by merger.\n If, instead of resorting to the holding company device, the shareholders of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman had caused a merger, this action would not have been a violation of the act. And if, prior to complaint by the Commission, the holding company, in virtue of its status as sole stockholder of the two operating companies, had caused a conveyance of their assets to it, the Commission would have been without power to set aside the transfers or to compel a reconveyance. Thatcher Mfg. Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, \n272 \nU.S. 554, 560\n, 561 S., 47 S.Ct. 175.\n Clearly, also, if the holding company had, before complaint filed, divested itself of the shares of either or both of the manufacturing companies, the Commission would have been without jurisdiction. And it might with impunity, prior to complaint, have distributed the shares it held pro rata amongst its stockholders. The fact that in such case the same group of stockholders would have owned shares in both companies, whereas theretofore some owned stock in one corporation only, and some held stock solely in the other, would not have operated to give the Commission jurisdiction. For, if the holding corporation had effectually divested itself of the stock, the Commission could not deal with a condition thereafter developing, although thought by it to threaten results contrary to the intent of the act. Compare National Harness, etc., Association v. Federal Trade Commission (C.C.A.) 268 F. 705; Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission (C.C.A.) 280 F. 45. \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 596]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, the holding company could have ousted the Commission's jurisdiction after complaint filed, by divesting itself of the shares, for that was all the Commission could order. And, if it had so divested itself, the transferees of the shares could immediately have brought about a corporate merger without violating the Clayton Act. We think that is precisely the legal effect of what was done in the present case. The holding company divested itself of the shares, and thereafter the owners of these common shares united with the holders of the preferred shares to bring about a merger.\n The Commission apparently was doubtful of its authority to promulgate the order which it entered. This is evidenced by the terms of the findings and the order. In its final conclusion the Commission refers to 'the acquisition by the said new respondent (the petitioner) through merger, of the common or voting stocks of the said Hart & Hegeman Manufacturing Company and Arrow Electric Company, ...' and denominates this a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. This, of course, is in the teeth of the obvious fact that the petitioner never acquired the stock of either Arrow or Hart & Hegeman. In its order the commission directs that the petitioner cease and desist from violation of the provisions of section 7 of the act, and 'divest itself absolutely, in good faith, of all common stock of the Hart & & Hegeman Manufacturing Company acquired by it as a result of the merger'; and then adds that it shall do this so as to include in such divestment the manufacturing plants and assets of Hart & Hegeman; and in the alternative the order applies to the stock and manufacturing plants of Arrow. This is a tacit admission that the Commission is without jurisdiction to act unless the alleged violator holds stocks of other corporations. The Commission's own findings show that the petitioner never held any stock of either company, but the \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 597]\n\u00a0\n order, nevertheless, requires that the petitioner divest itself of those stocks.\n The argument on behalf of the Commission is that, while it is true the petitioner never owned any stock of Arrow or Hart & Hegeman, the holding company, against whom the complaint was originally directed, did hold such stocks in violation of the statute when the proceeding was initiated; and, instead of parting with the shares in good faith, ineffectually attempted to alter the status by initiating and carrying through the merger, the dissolution of which is the aim of the Commission's order.\n We think the Commission's premise with respect to the activities of the holding company in bringing about the merger is without support. When the Commission filed its complaint, those who had previously been the common stockholders of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman, respectively, had become the owners of the shares of the holding company. While those shares represented at two removed the physical assets of the enterprise, they nevertheless evidenced the equity ownership of those assets. At that time Arrow and Hart & Hegeman were still separate corporate entities, and about 73 per cent. of their outstanding capital stock was preferred stock held by the public, in no wise affected by the creation of the holding company. After the holding company had conveyed the Arrow stock to a new holding company, and the Hart & Hegeman stock to another new holding company, the only persons who could bring about a merger and consequent consolidation of assets were the preferred and common stockholders of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman. Under the laws of Connecticut, two-thirds of the outstanding stock of each class had to vote affirmatively to authorize a merger. While the holding company proposed the plan for accomplishing a merger, and sponsored the preliminary steps to that end, obviously that company had no power to consum- \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 598]\n\u00a0\n mate it. That power resided in the equity owners of the assets, the preferred and common stockholders of Arrow and Hart & Hegeman. The common stockholders acted through the two holding companies, but the ultimate decision and action was theirs, through whatever instrumentality effected. Quite as vital to the accomplishment of the plan was the consent of preferred stockholders. It is true the consent was given through execution of proxies; but the shareholders were at liberty to give or to withhold their proxies, and it would be quite beyond reason to hold, as the Commission suggests, that all corporate entities and all stockholder relationship to the property should be disregarded and the original holding company be treated as the sole and efficient agent in the accomplishment of the merger. To do this would be to disregard the actualities, including the fact that the holding company had been effectually dissolved before the merger was voted upon by any of those having an equity interest in the assets.\n But, if we assume that the holding company against which the complaint was originally directed brought about a change in legal status, so that, before the Commission acted, that company ceased to exist, as did the shares it formerly owned, and a corporation formed by merger held all the assets in direct ownership, the respondent's position is no better. The Commission is an administrative body possessing only such powers as are granted by statute. It may make only such orders as the act authorizes; may order a practice to be discontinued and shares held in violation of the act to be disposed of; but, that accomplished, has not the additional powers of a court of equity to grant other and further relief by ordering property of a different sort to be conveyed or distributed, on the theory that this is necessary to render effective the prescribed statutory remedy. Com- \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 599]\n\u00a0\n pare Federal Trade Commission v. Eastman Kodak Co., \n274 \nU.S. 619, 623\n, 47 S.Ct. 688. Where shares acquired in violation of the act are still held by the offending corporation, an order of divestiture may be supplemented by a provision that in the process the offender shall not acquire the property represented by the shares. Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 175. In the present case the stock which had been acquired contrary to the act was no longer owned by the holding company when the Commission made its order. Not only so, but the holding company itself had been dissolved. The petitioner, which came into being as a result of merger, was not in existence when the proceeding against the holding company was initiated by the Commission, and never held any stock contrary to the terms of the statute. If the merger of the two manufacturing corporations and the combination of their assets was in any respect a violation of any anti-trust law, as to which we express no opinion, it was necessarily a violation of statutory prohibitions other than those found in the Clayton Act. And, if any remedy for such violation is afforded, a court and not the Federal Trade Commission is the appropriate forum. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., supra.\n The judgment is reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the decree should be affirmed.\n While this proceeding was pending before the Federal Trade Commission to compel a holding company to divest itself of the controlling common stock of two competing corporations which it had acquired in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  18), that stock was used to effectuate a merger of the competing corporations. It is now declared that, however gross the violation of the Clayton Act, however \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 600]\n\u00a0\n flagrant the flouting of the Commission's authority, the celerity of the offender in ridding itself of the stock before the Commission could complete its hearings and make an order restoring the independence of the competitors leaves the Commission powerless to act against the merged corporation. This is the case, it is said, because the Clayton Act does not, in terms, forbid mergers, which may be formed by the stockholders of independent competing corporations; and, since the holding company was not the 'sole and efficient agent in the accomplishment of the merger,' which was effected upon the consent of the various classes of stockholders of the merged companies, it is concluded that the holding company, by its divestment of the stock, complied with the Clayton Act and in effect did 'all the Commission could order,' so there is no longer any ground for complaint. Further, notwithstanding the authority broadly conferred on the Commission 'to enforce compliance' with section 7 'whenever ... any person ... has violated' its provisions, it is said that, as the statute in terms specifies only a single method by which compliance can be compelled-ordering the offender to divest itself of the stock-the Commission can make no other form of order.\n Apart from the objection that the decision now reached is calculated to encourage hasty and ill-considered action by the Commission in order to avoid defeat of its jurisdiction by the adroit manipulations of offenders against the Clayton Act, I am unable to construe so narrowly a statute designed, as I think, to prevent just such suppression of competition as this case exemplifies.\n\n 1. \nIt is true that the Clayton Act does not forbid corporate mergers, but it does forbid the acquisition by one corporation of the stock of competing corporations so as substantially to lessen competition. It follows that mergers effected, as they commonly are, through such ac- \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 601]\n\u00a0\n quisition of stock, necessarily involve violations of the act, as this one did. Only in rare instances would there be hope of a successful merger of independently owned corporations by securing the consent of their stockholders in advance of the acquisition of a working stock control of them. Hence the establishment of such control by the purchase or pooling of the voting stock, often effected in secrecy, is the normal first step toward consolidation. It is by this process that most corporate consolidations have been brought about, often by adding one consolidation to another through periods of years. Compare Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S. Ct. 632; United States v. United States Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121. See Bonbright and Means, The Holding Company, 30, 50.\n Unless we are to close our eyes to this open chapter in the record of corporate concentration, an examination of the legislative history of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730), and that of the earlier Sherman Anti-Trust Act ( 15 USCA  1-7, 15 note), can leave no doubt that the former was aimed at the acquisition of stock by holding companies, not only as itself a means of suppressing competition, but as the first and usual step in the process of merging competing corporations by which a suppression of competition might be unlawfully perpetuated. Thus one of the evils aimed at, the merger of competing corporations through stock control, was reached in its most usual form by forbidding the first step, the acquisition of the stock of a competing corporation, and by conferring on the Trade Commission authority to deal with the violation. It seems plain, therefore, that the illegality involved in acquiring the common stock of the competing companies, which was the first step toward the merger, was neither lessened nor condoned by taking the next and final steps in completing it. There is, then, no basis for contending that the act has not been violated, or that \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 602]\n\u00a0\n the violation has been excused simply because events were pushed to the very conclusion that section 7 was designed to forestall.\n\n 2. \nIt is also true that the holding company divested itself of the stock of the two competing operating companies before the Commission had an opportunity to make its order; but it does not follow that it had done all that the Commission could command and that thus the statute was satisfied. Mere divestment of the stock is not enough. The manner of divestment is likewise subject to the requirements of the Clayton Act. This Court has recognized that the purpose of the act is to restore the competition suppressed by the acquisition of the stock and has specifically held, over objections such as are now made, that the Commission has power not only to order divestment but to prescribe that it shall be done in a manner that will restore competition. Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., \n272 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 175.\n Here the Commission has held that the divestment was not a compliance with the statute. In determining whether it was right in this conclusion, the manner of divestment and the activity of the holding company after the complaint of the Commission was filed and before the final merger of the two operating companies are of crucial significance.\n When the complaint was filed, the holding company was in complete control of the two operating companies through ownership of their common stock, which alone had voting power. From the moment of the acquisition of the stock it had been, and it continued to be, a violator of the Clayton Act. Promptly after the complaint was filed it took measures to secure the fruits of its violation. It first proposed by letter to its stockholders a consolidation of the two operating companies, and at a special meeting its board of directors formulated a detailed plan for merger. This plan involved the organization of the two \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 603]\n\u00a0\n new holding companies, the transfer to them respectively by the first holding company of its respective holdings of the common stock in the two operating companies in exchange for the distribution by the new holding companies of their stock to the stockholders of the first holding company. Thus for each share in the first holding company owned by its stockholders they were to receive one share in each of the new holding companies. The original holding company was then to be dissolved and the four remaining companies, the two new holding companies and the two operating companies, were to be merged.\n The plan, from the beginning, contemplated that the four companies should be bound by formal agreement to effect the merger. It was adopted at a specially called meeting of the stockholders of the first holding company and was carried into effect under its active direction and control. Before its dissolution, by exercising that control it had created the two new holding companies, committed all four of its subsidiary corporations to the merger both by their corporate action and by binding agreement, and had secured the approval of its action by its own stockholders. It will be observed that the original holding company did not divest itself of the stock of the two competing operating companies in the only manner by which competition could have been restored-by returning the stock to the respective stockholders of the operating companies, from whom it had been secured, or to their successors. Instead, it continued the suppression of competition by placing the stock of the two operating companies respectively in control of the two new holding companies, tied by contract to effect the merger, and by the method of distributing the stock of the new holding companies equally to its own stockholders it lodged common ownership and control of both the new holding companies in the two groups of stockholders of the original operating companies. The first holding company created the two new \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 604]\n\u00a0\n ones and throughout guided their policy, as it did that of the two operating companies. Acting in concert and in accord with the prearranged plan, all co-operated in executing it, and all, together with their creature, the merged company, were conscious beneficiaries of the violation of the statute.\n By thus manipulating its illegally acquired stock control of the operating companies, the first holding company avoided such a distribution of the stock as would have restored competition, and made easy the merger which, if the stock had been returned to those from whom it had originally been acquired, would have been difficult or impossible. Upon these and other facts, which need not now be detailed, the Commission made its finding, abundantly supported by evidence, that the course of action taken by the holding company was not to restore competition between the operating companies, but was 'an artifice and subterfuge designed in an attempt to evade the Clayton Act, to perpetuate the elimination of competition,' which it had brought about by the acquisition of the stock of the operating companies.\n That the stockholders in the successive holding companies, who were the ultimate owners of the operating companies, consented to all this; that two-thirds of the nonvoting preferred stock of the operating companies which had never been lodged in the holding companies consented to it; that the merger might possibly have been effected in some other way, had competitive conditions been restored; all seems without significance. While under local statutes merger could not have been effected without the consent of the preferred stock, equally the consent of the stock acquired through violation of the Clayton Act and its active promotion of the merger were essential to the desired end. A prohibited act is no less illegal because its success involves the co-operation of other actors. It was the suppression ofcompetition \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 605]\n\u00a0\n by the holding company, through the use which it made of the illegally acquired stock of the operating companies, and its manner of disposing of the stock so as to continue that suppression, which were violations of the Clayton Act and in conflict with the authority of the Commission. This was not any the less so because others consented.\n Doubts whether the divestment effected by the first holding company was all that the Commission could have ordered are dissipated by our decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Western Meat Co., supra. There we upheld an order of divestment which directed that in transferring the stock the respondent corporation could not use it to acquire any of the property of the competing corporation, and that none of the stock could be transferred to anyone having any connection with or in any way under the influence of the offending corporation. Here we need not go so far.\n\n 3. \nThere remains the question whether the Commission is now powerless to undo a consummation which, at an earlier stage, it could have prevented. It is said, as a matter of statutory construction, that the grant to the Commission of specific power to command offenders to divest themselves of illegally acquired stock excludes the possibility of its ordering anything more or different, however incidental or necessary it may be to the exercise of the granted power.\n It would seem that this point also had been settled by our decision in the Western Meat Company Case, where the offending company, through stock ownership, had acquired possession of the property and control of the business of a competitor. It wished to be free to divest itself of the stock without restriction, in order that it might acquire ownership of the competitor's property by transferring the stock to hands that would make merger easy. It was argued to us there, as it is here, that the statute \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 606]\n\u00a0\n provides only that the Commission may order divestment of the stock; that it does not say that the Commission can command relinquishment of the power, derived from the stock ownership, to bring the competitor, or its property, under the control of the offending corporation, either directly or through transfer of the stock into friendly hands. But that argument was rejected, and the order directing divestment of both the property and stock by placing both in the hands of those not under the influence or control of the offender was upheld. This Court said (page 559 of 272 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 175, 177):\n'Further violations of the act through continued ownership could be effectively prevented only by requiring the owner wholly to divest itself of the stock and thus render possible once more free play of the competition which had been wrongfully suppressed. The purpose which the lawmakers entertained might be wholly defeated if the stock could be further used for securing the competitor's property. And the same result would follow a transfer to one controlled by or acting for the respondent.'\n\n No more here, than there, should it be said that the purpose of the statute must be defeated because the lawmakers did not attempt to provide with a meticulous precision how the Commission should proceed in every contingency that might arise. The dominating purpose of the statute is to restore to its original state the competition suppressed by the acquisition of the stock, and, just as we rejected a rigid literalism there in order to effect that purpose, and upheld an order which was but incidental, though necessary, to the effective exercise of the power specifically granted, so we should reject it now. Just as in that case we upheld the Commission's order directing the surrender of one of the fruits of the wrongful stock ownership-the power to place a competing unit under the offender's domination-so should we now sus- \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 607]\n\u00a0\n tain the order commanding relinquishment of another of the fruits of that ownership-the accomplished merger.\n Even if the question were a new one in this Court, no plausible reason has been advanced for interpreting this remedial statute as though it were a penal law. The Clayton Act was designed to prevent abuses growing from deficiencies due to the generality of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. It sought to accomplish that end by conferring upon the Commission the power to strike at specific practices. In this, as in most schemes for regulation by administrative bodies, there must be a balance between the general and the particular. When the courts are faced with interpretation of the particular, administration breaks down and the manifest purpose of the Legislature is defeated unless it is recognized that, surrounding granted powers, there must be a penumbra which will give scope for practical operation. In carrying such schemes into operation, the function of courts is constructive, not destructive, to make them, wherever reasonably possible, effective agencies for law enforcement and not to destroy them.\n That the merged corporation is different from the original offender should lead to no different conclusion. It is but the creature and alter ego of the offender, created by the offender's exercise of power over the illegally acquired stock for the very purpose of perpetuating the suppression of competition which the Commission from the start had power to forbid. To declare that an offender, whose cause is pending before the Commission, can effect through its creatures and agents what it may not itself do, nullifies the statute.\n Some scope may be given to the doctrine of lis pendens. It is true that the Commission is an administrative body, and not a court. But it exercises many of the powers conventionally deemed judicial. It is authorized to bring offenders before it to determine whether they are violators of the act and, if so, 'to enforce compliance' by \n\n[291 U.S. 587, 608]\n\u00a0\n commanding that the violation cease. There is as much reason to believe that Congress did not intend to deny to the Commission the authority to exercise effectively the granted power, and thus to preserve its jurisdiction until its function could be executed, as there would be were similar powers extended to a court of inferior jurisdiction. This is the more evident when it is remembered that obedience to the Commission's orders cannot be compelled without first subjecting them to the scrutiny of a court. Recognition of its authority involves neither departure from accepted principles nor any risk of abuse.\n These considerations demand our rejection of the contention that an offender against the Clayton Act, properly brought before the Commission and subject to its order, can evade its authority and defeat the statute by taking refuge behind a cleverly erected screen of corporate dummies.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 65 F.(2d) 336. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323,  7, 38 Stat. 731, U.S.C. title 15 ,  18 (15 USCA  18).

See London Guarantee & Accident Company v. Ladd (Preferred Accident Insurance Co. of New York v. Ladd), 299 F. 562, 565 (C.C.A.6th); AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Davis, 191 F. 343 (C.C.A.8th); Preferred Accident Insurance Co. of New York v. Muir, 126 F. 926 (C.C.A.3d); compare Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York v. Morrison, 129 Ill.App. 360.\n The policy provided for payment of a specified amount in case of loss of life of the insured resulting from accidental bodily injury, and for payment of double that amount 'if such injury is sustained by the insured ( 1) while a passenger in or on a public conveyance (including the platform, steps or running board thereof) provided by a common carrier for passenger service.' The insured, who had in his possession a ticket entitling him to transportation, arrived at the railroad station platform just as the train started to move out of the station. There was testimony from which the jury might have found that, while the train was moving at a speed of seven to ten miles an hour but was still within the station and opposite the platform, with vestibule doors open, the insured jumped onto the lower step of a car, his hand grasping the handrail, and that he continued for a brief time, while the train moved about twenty feet, to stand with both feet upon the step but with a small part of his body or clothing projecting beyond or outside the vestibule until it brushed against a bystander on the platform in a manner causing the insured to lose his hold and fall to his death.\n The trial judge instructed the jury that if the insured held a ticket entitling him to ride as a passenger, and in attempting to board the train while in motion he stood with both feet upon the step, he was a passenger and entitled to recover under the double indemnity clause. The only question which it is necessary to decide here is whether the insured was a 'passenger' at the time of the accident within the meaning of the policy. The Court of \n\n[292 U.S. 80, 83]\n\u00a0\n Appeals ruled that he was not; it reached this conclusion by applying the term as it was said to be defined in the law of common carriers.\n In personal injury suits against common carriers, brought by persons who, intending to be passengers, were injured while endeavoring to mount the steps of a moving train, courts have sometimes said that the implied invitation to board the train is withdrawn when it begins to move, and that the duty of the carrier to exercise a high degree of care toward its passengers does not attach in such circumstances, because one seeking to board a moving train does not become a passenger until he reaches a place of safety. Trapnell v. Hines (C.C.A.) 268 F. 504, 506; Illinois Central R. Co. v. Cotter, 103 S.W. 279, 31 Ky. Law Rep. 679; Kentucky Highlands R. Co. v.

Co., 88 Or. 322, 330, 171 P. 1169, L.R.A. 1918D, 1114. The Court of Appeals thought that the evidence here would have made no case for the jury in a suit against the carrier, and therefore concluded that the trial judge should have directed a verdict for the insurer on the issue of double indemnity.\n No doubt intending passengers who are injured in attempting to board a moving train, unless they were invited to do so, are not usually entitled to recover from the carrier. But it is not clear that such cases turn on the existence or nonexistence of the passenger-carrier relationship. See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Holloway, 71 Kan. 1, 80 P. 31, 114 Am.St.Rep. 462. It has often been recognized that the relationship of carrier and passenger may arise and the duty of the carrier to the passenger attach when the latter comes upon the station platform and before boarding the train. See Warner v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n\n[292 U.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n \n168 \nU.S. 339\n, 18 S.Ct. 68; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Holloway, supra; Wabash, St. Louis & P.R. Co. v. Rector, 104 Ill. 296; Chicago & E.I.R. Co. v. Jennings, 190 Ill. 478, 483, 60 N.E. 818, 54 L.R.A. 827; Michie, Carriers (1915),  2126 et seq. Yet the negligence of a passenger in going into a known place of danger without the inducement or invitation of the carrier may bar his recovery for the resulting injury, even though the passenger-carrier relationship has begun and continues. See Warner v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra; Daley v. Boston, Revere Beach & L.R. Co., 241 Mass. 78, 134 N.E. 376. And in the case of the insured, who had come upon the station platform intending to be a passenger, it may be that negligence in jumping uninvited onto the moving train would bar his recovery from the carrier without resort to the artificial assumption of a hiatus in that relationship during the brief interval required for boarding the train. The notion of such a suspension of the passenger-carrier relationship has been rejected in allowing recovery upon policies insuring against injury while traveling as a 'passenger' on a railway train, both where the passenger alighted from the train at an intermediate stop and was injured in attempting to return to the train after it started to move again, Wharton v. New York Life Insurance Co., 178 N.C. 135, 138, 100 S.E. 266, and where the insured, in beginning his journey, was injured in attempting to board a moving train. Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York v. Morrison, 129 Ill.App. 360.\n But it is unnecessary here to follow the niceties of legal reasoning and terminology applied in negligence suits against common carriers, for we are interpreting a contract and are concerned only with the sense in which its words were used. Farber v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 250 Mass. 250, 254, 145 N.E. 535, 36 A.L.R. 806; Boyd v. Royal Indemnity Co., 120 Ohio St. 515, 517, 166 N.E. 580. The phraseology of contracts of insurance is that chosen by the insurer and the contract in fixed form is tendered to the prospective policyholder who is often without technical training, and \n\n[292 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n who rarely accepts it with a lawyer at his elbow. So if its language is reasonably open to two constructions, that more favorable to the insured will be adopted, Stipcich v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., \n277 \nU.S. 311, 322\n, 48 S.Ct. 512; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hurni Packing Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 44 S.Ct. 90, 31 A.L.R. 102; and unless it is obvious that the words are intended to be used in their technical connotation they will be given the meaning that common speech imports. Neighbors v. Life & Casualty Ins. Co., 182 Ark. 356, 31 S.W.(2d) 418; Tupper v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 156 Minn. 65, 194 N.W. 99; Anderson v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 228 N.Y. 475, 483, 127 N.E. 584, 9 A. L.R. 1544\n\n\n We think the word 'passenger' cannot be restricted to the technical meaning which may be assigned to it by the law of common carriers, for it also has a common or popular meaning which would at least include the insured who, with a ticket in his possession, was riding on the steps of the train. In its usual popular significance the term, when applied to one riding a train, indicates a traveler, intending to be transported for hire or upon contract with the carrier, and distinguishes him from those employed to render service in connection with the journey. See Wood v. General Accident Insurance Co. of Phila. (C.C.A.) 160 F. 926; Travelers' Insurance Co. v. Austin, 116 Ga. 264, 42 S.E. 522, 59 L.R.A. 107, 94 Am.St. Rep. 125; Ward v. North American Accident Insurance Co., 182 Ill.App. 317; compare Continental Life Ins. Co. v. Newman, 219 Ala. 311, 123 So. 93; United States Casualty Co. v. Ellison, 65 Colo. 252, 176 P. 279. None of the standard dictionaries defines the term in a fashion suggesting that its meaning is to be limited in terms of the legal liability of the carrier. While for the purposes of judicial decision dictionary definitions often are not controlling, they are at least persuasive that meanings which they do not embrace are not common.\n That the stipulation to be construed is one for double indemnity calls for no different conclusion. It has been \n\n[292 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n argued that such a provision contemplates a risk which is comparatively slight, and that therefore it should be strictly construed. It may be that the insurer assumes little additional risk; but the terms of the clause disclose an inducement to insure set forth in attractive detail. \n1\n The policy contains no exceptions exempting the insurer from liability if the injury is caused by negligence of the insured, or restricting the liability to accidents occurring only after a point of safety has been reached, and the steps of a car are specifically included in the place where injury insured against may occur. Nothing in the policy gives any hint that words in this clause are used more narrowly than those in any other. The insurer has chosen the terms, and it must be held to their full measure in this clause, as in any other, whether its promise be for more or less. London Guarantee & Accident Co. v. Ladd (C.C.A.) 299 F. 562, 564; Cedergren v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 292 F. 5, 8; Dolge v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 211 App.Div. 112, 207 N.Y.S. 42; Stewart v.

The practice was without exception that no stockholder, whether employee or officer, should receive his check before the first business day of the month following the month in which the dividend was made payable.\n Petitioner kept his accounts on the cash receipts and disbursements and calendar year basis.\n The Commissioner assessed the dividends above described as part of the petitioner's income for the years 1924 and 1929. The Board of Tax Appeals approved; and the court below affirmed this action. The facts are not in dispute. The only queston for our determination is when, within intendment of the statutes, the dividends were 'received' by petitioner.\n He maintains that under the plain language of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1928 the dividends-like other assessable items-should be treated as income for the taxable years during which they were actually received- 1925 and 1930. The Commissioner claims that, under Treasury Regulations promulgated in 1921 and in effect ever since, the dividends constituted income for the years in which they were declared and made payable. \n1\n The regulation specially important here (No. 65, art. 1541) follows:\n'Dividends ... A taxable distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders shall be included in the gross income of the distributees when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly made subject to their demands.' \n\n[292 U.S. 210, 213]\n\u00a0\n The Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253,  212(b), 213(a), 1001, 26 USCA  953(b), 954(a), 1245 and note, provides:\n\n'Sec. 212. (b) The net income shall be computed upon the basis of the taxpayer's annual accounting period (fiscal year or calendar year, as the case may be) in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made in accordance with such method as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income. If the taxpayer's annual accounting period is other than a fiscal year as defined in section 200 (section 931) or if the taxpayer has no annual accounting period or does not keep books, the net income shall be computed on the basis of the calendar year.\n\n'Sec. 213. For the purposes of this chapter-...\n\n'(a) The term 'gross income' includes gains, profits, and income . ... The amount of all such items shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless, under methods of accounting permitted under subdivision (b) of section 212 ( section 953), any such amounts are to be properly accounted for as of a different period.\n\n'Sec. 1001. The Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, is authorized to prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this Act.'\n\n Sections 41, 42, and 62, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791 ( 26 USCA  2041, 2042, 2062), are substantially like corresponding ones quoted from the 1924 act. Similar provisions appear in the Revenue Act of 1918 and all subsequent ones.\n The Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 228, 229, is peculiar, in that it makes distinction between dividends and other income items by the following provision which does not appear in subsequent acts:\n'Sec. 201. (e) For the purposes of this Act, a taxable distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders of \n\n[292 U.S. 210, 214]\n\u00a0\n members shall be included in the gross income of the distributees as of the date when the cash or other property is unqualifiedly made subject to their demands.'\n\n If we give the words of the statutes their ordinary meaning, clearly the dividends under consideration were not actually received by the taxpayer during 1924 and 1929. Certainly they were not received when declared. They did not come into the taxpayer's hands on December 31st simply because payable on that day. And, unless Congress has definitely indicated an intention that the words should be construed otherwise, we must apply them according to their usual acceptation.\n The petitioner insists that the word 'receive' is free from ambiguity and admits of no interpretation; the statute furnishes the sole measure as to when dividends are to be reported.\n In behalf of the Commissioner it is said:\n The Revenue Act directs that the amount of all such (specified) items shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer. The word 'received,' as applied to dividends, is not entirely clear, since there are different times at which it reasonably may be claimed the taxpayer receives them. To meet this situation, the Commissioner promulgated the regulation that dividends are taxable when unqualifiedly made subject to the stockholder's demand. This provision has been included in all Treasury Regulations since 1918, and has been approved and accepted by Congress through subsequent re-enactments of the statute. When a dividend unqualifiedly becomes subject to a taxpayer's demand is essentially a question of fact. Here the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals agree that the dividends were subject to the taxpayer's demand on December 31st.\n It is unnecessary for us to determine how far the quoted Treasury Regulation was incorporated into the Revenue Acts of \n\n[292 U.S. 210, 215]\n\u00a0\n 1924 and 1928. If we assume that the regulation, in effect, became part of those enactments, nevertheless we think the Commissioner's action was erroneous. In the disclosed circumstances the dividends cannot properly be considered as cash or other property unqualifiedly subject to the petitioner's demand on December 31st. It was the practice of the company to pay all dividends by checks not intended to reach stockholders until the first business day of January; there is nothing to show that petitioner could have obtained payment on December 31st, he did not expect this, and the practice shows the company had no intention to make actual payment on that day. Nothing indicates that it recognized an unrestricted right of stockholders to demand payment except through checks sent out in the usual way. The checks did not constitute payments prior to their actual receipt. The mere promise or obligation of the corporation to pay on a given date was not enough to subject to petitioner's unqualified demand 'cash or other property'; and none of the parties understood that it was.\n This subject has been considered with varying results in Commissioner v. Bingham (C.C.A. 1929) 35 F.(2d) 503; Hadley v. Commissioner (1929) 59 App.D.C. 139, 36 F.(2d) 543; Commissioner v. Adams (C.C.A. 1931) 54 F.(2d) 228, 230; Shearman v. Commission (C.C.A. 1933) 66 F.(2d) 256. The facts here disclose a situation substantially like that in Adams Case; and we agree with the conclusion of the court therein, stated as follows: 'We are also of the opinion that, on the facts found, the dividends were not 'unqualifiedly made subject to the demand of the stockholder,' in the year 1924, if article 52 of the Department Regulations can be said to be valid and not in conflict with the express language of section 213(a).'\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Treasury Regulations, No. (62 (1921), arts. 53 and 1541; No. 65 ( 1924), arts. 52 and 1541; No. 69 (1926), arts. 52 and 1541; Nos. 74 and 77 ( 1928-32), arts. 333 and 621. \n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBENSON v.

Lynch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner's intestate, a child 5 years of age, while playing on a wharf belonging to the District of Columbia, fell through a hole in the wharf and was drowned. This action was for damages for the alleged negligence of the District. After a jury had been impaneled, an opening statement was made by plaintiff's counsel, and thereupon the court, on motion of the defendant and without taking testimony, directed a verdict in defendant's favor upon the ground that no cause of action had been stated. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (62 App.D.C. 271, 66 F.( 2d) 797), and this Court granted certiorari. \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n The opening statement by plaintiff's counsel was as follows:\n'This is a case against the District of Columbia filed by Mr. Best as administrator for the estate of his son. The facts that we will show you, briefly, are these, that Mr. Best's son was a child of five years of age and that on the day in question he and other children were playing down at a wharf close to where the Norfolk boats leave for Norfolk, and this wharf was operated and controlled by the District of Columbia; that they had there on this wharf some boards which extended over the water and they had in the wharf, as several witnesses will testify, from ten to thirteen holes of various and varying sizes; that one of the holes was quite large, approximately 3 feet in diameter; that this place was not fenced off; that it did have some sort of a barrier close to the street. There was no sidewalk, but the side portion was down and that the children went in and out at their pleasure, and that this son of Mr. Best went in there on this morning and while in there fell through one of the holes in this wharf.\n\n'That there was no one that at the time to keep the children away, and that the watchman who was stationed arrived some time after this occurrence; that the children used this place to play on and play in; and that the District having maintained it in a condition such that it was dangerous to the life and limb of these children it is responsible for the child having been attracted there, going in and falling through this hole. Of course the child died, having been drowned; and the damages that the plaintiff has suffered as representing the estate of the child will be determined by you in your verdict if you are convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that we have established our case.\n\n'That this wharf is not part of the public highway but is on private property of the District of Columbia, and \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n is not a place to which the public is admitted, but is a place where the boats dock and unload sand which is taken out and used by the District.'\n\n There is no question as to the power of the trial court to direct a verdict for the defendant upon the opening statement of plaintiff's counsel where that statement establishes that the plaintiff has no right to recover. The power of the court to act upon facts conceded by counsel is as plain as its power to act upon evidence produced. Oscanyan v. Arms Company, \n103 U.S. 261\n, 263. The exercise of this power in a proper case is not only not objectionable, but is convenient in saving time and expense by shortening trials. Liverpool, N.Y. & P. Staeamship Co. v. Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 5 S.Ct. 352. But the power is not properly exercised if the opening statement leaves doubt as to the facts or permits conflicting inferences. Where uncertainty arises either from a conflict of testimony or because the facts being undisputed, fair-minded men may honestly draw different conclusions from them, the question is not one of law, but of fact to be settled by the jury. Richmond & Danville Railroad Co. v. Powers, \n149 \nU.S. 43, 45\n, 13 S.Ct. 748; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Harvey, \n228 \nU.S. 319, 324\n, 33 S.Ct. 518; Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 94\n, 50 S.Ct. 231. The opening statement of counsel is ordinarily intended to do no more than to inform the jury in a general way of the nature of the action and defense so that they may better be prepared to understand the evidence. 'If a doubt exists,' said the Court in the Oscanyan Case, supra, 'as to the statement of counsel, the court will withhold its directions, as where the evidence is conflicting, and leave the matter to the determination of the jury.' Plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of all inferences that may be drawn from his counsel's statement. To warrant the court in directing a verdict for defendant upon that statement, it is not enough that the statement be lacking in definiteness, but it must clearly appear, after resolving all doubts in plaintiff's favor, that \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n no cause of action exists. See Illinois Power & Light Corporation v. Hurley (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 681, 684; Stuthman v. United States (D.C.) 67 F.( 2d) 521, 523.\n The controversy in this case largely turns upon a difference of view as to the inferences to be drawn from the opening statement. Thus respondent argues that there was a failure to show that 'the wharf could be seen from the public space'; that 'the child was attracted by the presence of the wharf itself, or any article or thing which may have been upon the wharf'; that 'there was any latent or hidden danger at the place' where the child met his death; that 'there was ever a prior accident to children at or near this wharf'; that 'respondent invited or permitted petitioner's intestate or other children to enter or play on its wharf.' But with respect to each of these circumstances (with a single unimportant exception) the opening statement of counsel permitted an inference in petitioner's favor. Thus his counsel stated that 'this place was not fenced off; that it did have some sort of a barrier close to the street. There was no sidewalk, but the side portion was down.' From this it was not inadmissible to infer that the wharf, without a fence and close to the street, with the side portion of the barrier down, 'could be seen from the public space' and readily entered. According to the statement, the wharf was a place where boats unloaded sand which was taken out and used by the District. The inference might be drawn that the wharf had sand piles which would be highly attractive to children. Counsel stated that there were 'ten to thirteen holes' in the wharf, of varying sizes, one of them being about three feet in diameter. The existence of these holes manifestly constituted a danger, and the statement does not require the conclusion that the danger would be obvious to young children playing in the sand on the wharf. The fact that the opening statement did not refer to any prior accident to children is inconsequen- \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n tial. On the question whether the District permitted children to enter and play on the wharf, counsel's statement gave basis for an inference that children had this permission. While counsel conceded that the wharf was 'not part of the public highway' but 'was on private property of the District' and was 'not a place to which the public was admitted,' he also stated that 'the children went in and out at their pleasure' and that 'the children used this place to play on and play in.' He said that at the time of the accident there was no one 'to keep the children away,' as 'the watchman who was stationed arrived some time after this occurrence.' The statement permitted the inference that, while a watchman was customarily there, still the place was used as a playground by children, going in and out as they pleased.\n In view of the fair import of the opening statement, it was error for the trial court to refuse to take testimony and to direct a verdict for respondent. None of the decisions of this Court bearing upon the liability of the District warranted that course. The case of United Zinc Company v. Britt, \n258 \nU.S. 268\n, 42 S.Ct. 299, 300, 36 A.L.R. 28, which respondent cites as controlling authority, dealt with a situation materially different. There children were fatally injured by going into a pool of water, poisoned by acids, which had accumulated in the lower part of a dismantled chemical factory, about 100 or 200 feet distant from a traveled way. The Court stressed the facts that it was 'at least doubtful whether the water could be seen from any place where the children lawfully were,' that there was 'no evidence that it was what led them to enter the land,' and that it did not appear 'that children were in the habit of going to the place.' The decision did not overrule Sioux City & P. Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, or Union Pacific Railway Company v. McDonald, \n152 \nU.S. 262\n, 14 S.Ct. 619, although both were distinguished in the light of their particular facts. The Court said that the case of Stout, \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n where the child was injured on a turntable 'near a road without visible separation' and where it appeared that children had played there before to the knowledge of employees of the railroad, was perhaps 'as strong a case as would be likely to occur of maintaining a known temptation, where temptation takes the place of invitation.' The Court added that in the very similar case of Cooke v. Midland Great Western Ry. of Ireland, (1909) A.C. 229, a license was implied. Also distinguishing the case of McDonald, where a boy had fallen into burning coal slack 'close by the side of a path on which he was running homeward from other boys who had frightened him,' the Court said that 'it hardly appears that he was a trespasser and the path suggests an invitation; at all events boys habitually resorted to the place where he was. Also the defendant was under a statutory duty to fence the place sufficiently to keep out cattle.' The decision permitting recovery in those circumstances was said to be very far from establishing liability 'for poisoned water not bordering a road' where it was 'not shown to have been the inducement that led the children to trespass' and 'not shown to have been the indirect inducement because known to the children to be frequented by others.'\n In New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co. v. Fruchter, \n260 \nU.S. 141\n, 43 S.Ct. 38, where a boy, climbing to the topmost girder of a municipal bridge and thence up a latticed tower, touched a live electric wire and was injured, the Court was unable to find any sufficient evidence from which a jury could properly conclude that the railroad company either directly or by implication 'invited or licensed' him to climb to a point from which he could touch the bare wire thirty feet above the street. The cases of Erie Railroad Company v. Hilt, \n247 \nU.S. 97\n, 38 S.Ct. 435, and Erie Railroad Company v. Duplak, \n286 \nU.S. 440\n, 52 S.Ct. 610, turned upon the application of a statute of New Jersey as construed by the state court. \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n The question is one of negligence-whether particular circumstances gave rise to a duty which had not been performed. Discussing general principles, the Court observed in the Britt Case that infants had no greater right to go upon other people's land than adults, and that the mere fact that they were infants imposed no duty upon landowners to expect them and to prepare for their safety. On the other hand, it was said that, while 'temptation is not invitation, it may be held that knowingly to establish and expose, unfenced, to children of an age when they follow a bait as mechanically as a fish, something that is certain to attract them, has the legal effect of an invitation to them although not to an adult.' The Court said that the principle, if accepted, should be very cautiously applied. We think that the present case falls within that appropriate application. Were the case merely one of an accessible wharf, it could not be said that the District would be subject to liability from the fact, without more, that a child strayed there and fell from the wharf into the water. The duty must find its source in special circumstances in which, by reason of the inducement and of the fact that visits of children to the place would naturally be anticipated, and because of the character of the danger to which they would unwittingly be exposed, reasonable prudence would require that precautions be taken for their protection. Here, on the face of the opening statement, the location of the wharf, unfenced, close to the street with the barrier partly down, taken with the use of the wharf for unloading sand, made it a likely place for children to play. Sand piles close at hand would constitute 'a bait' they would inevitably follow. According to the statement, they did follow it, and they used the wharf as a playground at their pleasure. As the authorities of the District had reason to anticipate that use, there was a duty to take reasonable precautions either to \n\n[291 U.S. 411, 420]\n\u00a0\n prevent it or to keep the wharf in such a proper state of repair that children would not be exposed to the danger of falling through holes.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOOTH v.

Does a United States District or Circuit Judge who, having served continuously for ten years and attained the age of seventy years, does not resign but retires under the provisions of section 260 of the Judicial Code, as amended, continue in office within the meaning of section 1 of article III of the Constitution which forbids diminution of the compensation of Judges during their continuance in office?\n\n'2. Where the salary of a United States District or Circuit Judge is increased by law after his appointment and he has subsequently retired in full compliance with the provisions of section 260 of the Judicial Code, as amended; is a reduction of his compensation as a retired Judge to an amount not below that fixed by law as his salary at the time of his appointment a diminution of his compensation within the meaning of section 1 of article III of the Constitution?'\n\n We are informed by the certificate in No. 656 that Wilbur F. Booth was appointed United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Judicial Circuit on March 18, 1925, and qualified March 27, 1925. For many years prior to and up to the time of this appointment he had held the office of judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and on November 28, 1931, he had served continuously as District or Circuit Judge for more than seventeen years. January 1, 1932, having attained the age of seventy, he retired, pursuant to the provisions of section 260 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 USCA  375). Since his retirement he has continued to perform the duties of a \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 347]\n\u00a0\n retired United States Circuit Judge in the manner provided by law, and has participated in the hearing and decision of many cases pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n At the time of Judge Booth's appointment as Circuit Judge, the annual compensation was fixed by law at $8,500 per annum, and was subsequently increased to $12,500 per annum, at which figure it stood when he retired. By section 13 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of June 16, 1933 (Public No. 78), it was provided: 'For the period of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, remaining after the date of the enactment of this Act, and during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, the retired pay of judges (whose compensation, prior to retirement or resignation, could not, under the Constitution, have been diminished) is reduced by 15 per centum.'\n By reason of this act the plaintiff was paid during the period from June 15, 1933, to October 1, 1933, at the rate of $10,625 per annum. The amount withheld from him during that period was $697.93. He duly protested against the reduction, and brought suit in the Court of Claims, asserting that the act violates the provision of the Constitution which forbids diminution of the compensation of federal judges during their continuance in office. The government demurred to the petition.\n The relevant facts certified in No. 657 are that Charles F. Amidon was appointed Judge of the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota on February 18, 1897, and qualified on February 27, 1897. From the date last mentioned to June 2, 1928, he served continuously in that capacity. Having attained the age of seventy years he retired June 2, 1928, pursuant to section 260 of the Judicial Code as amended, and has ever since continued to perform the duties of a retired United States District Judge in the manner required by law, and has, as conditions permitted and the business of the \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 348]\n\u00a0\n court demanded, performed judicial acts as such retired judge.\n At the date of his appointment the salary of the office was fixed by law at the rate of $5,000 per annum. It has been increased from time to time and at the date of plaintiff's retirement was at the rate of $10,000 per annum. Pursuant to section 13 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, supra, he received, during the period from June 15, 1933, to October 31, 1933, compensation at the rate of $8,500 per annum. He protested against the reduction and brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the sum of $558.34, the amount withheld during the period mentioned. The government demurred to the petition.\n The pertinent portion of section 1 of article 3 of the Constitution is: 'The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.'\n\n 1. \nThe first question asks, in effect, whether a United States Judge, upon retirement, relinquishes or retains his office. The answer is to be found in the act of Congress authorizing retirement. \n1\n That act provides for resigna- \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 349]\n\u00a0\n tion and for retirement. In referring to the former it uses the expression 'When any judge ... resigns his office ...,' and provides for continuance of compensation after resignation. In contrast it declares, 'But, \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 350]\n\u00a0\n instead of resigning, any judge ... who is qualified to resign under the foregoing provisions, may retire, upon the salary of which he is then in receipt, from regular active service on the bench, ...' not, be it noted, from office. The retiring judge may be called upon by the senior circuit judge to perform judicial duties in his own circuit or by the Chief Justice to perform them in another circuit, and be authorized to perform such as he may be willing to undertake. There is provision for appointment by the President of an additional judge for the circuit or district court where a sitting judge is found unable efficiently to discharge all his duties by reason of mental or physical infirmity of a permanent character. In that case the sitting judge unquestionably retains his office; and it is significant that the act declares either a retired judge, or one whose mental or physical condition has caused the President to appoint an additional judge, shall be treated as junior to the remaining judges of the court.\n By retiring pursuant to the statute a judge does not relinquish his office. The language is that he may retire from regular active service. The purpose is, however, that he shall continue, so far as his age and his health permit, to perform judicial service, and it is common knowledge that retired judges have, in fact, discharged a large measure of the duties which would be incumbent on them, if still in regular active service. It is scarcely necessary to say that a retired judge's judicial acts would be illegal unless he who performed them held the office of judge. It is a contradiction in terms to assert that one who has retired in accordance with the statute may continue to function as a federal judge and yet not hold the office of a judge. The act does not, and indeed could not, endue him with a new office, different from but embracing the duties of the office of judge. He does not \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 351]\n\u00a0\n surrender his commission, but continues to act under it. He loses his seniority in office, but that fact, in itself, attests that he remains in office. A retired District Judge need not be assigned to sit in his own district. Maxwell v. United States (C.C.A.) 3 F.(2d) 906, affirmed \n271 \nU.S. 647\n, 46 S.Ct. 487. And if a retired judge is called upon by the Chief Justice or a Senior Circuit Judge to sit in another district or circuit, and he responds and serves there, his status is the same as that of any active judge, so called. McDonough v. United States (C.C.A.) 1 F.( 2d) 147. It is impossible that this should be true, and that at the same time the judge should hold no office under the United States.\n The government argues that the holding of an office involves the performance of duties, and since no duties are obligatory on one who has retired under the act, he cannot be said to hold any office. But Congress may lighten judicial duties, though it is without power to abolish the office or to diminish the compensation appertaining to it. This was the evident purpose; and the statements made by the member in charge of the bill on the floor of the House show that it was expected, as has proved to be the case, that retired judges would render valuable judicial service.

It is too late to contend that services so performed were extra-legal and unconstitutional.\n Some reference is made to the fact that under the act a successor to the retiring judge is to be appointed, and it is claimed the direction is inconsistent with his retention of office. The phraseology may not be well chosen, but it cannot be construed to vacate the office of the retiring judge, in the light of the evident purpose that he shall continue to hold office and perform official duties. \n\n[291 U.S. 339, 352]\n\u00a0\n 2. Does the Constitution prohibit reduction of the compensation which was fixed by law at the time of appointment or that to which the judge was entitled at the date of retirement?\n In other words, is a diminution after an increase banned, if the compensation notwithstanding the reduction remains in excess of that payable when the incumbent took office' The answer must be in the affirmative. Several courts, in well-considered decisions, have so interpreted analogous provisions of state Constitutions (Commonwealth ex rel. Hepburn v. Mann, 5 Watts & S. (Pa.) 403; City of New Orleans v. Lea, 14 La.Ann. 197; Long v. Watts, 183 N.C. 99, 110 S.E. 765, 22 A.L.R. 277), and the Solicitor General with commendable candor admits that a contrary construction would be subversive of the purpose of section 1 of article 3.\n Question 1 answered: Yes.\n Question 2 answered: Yes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judicial Code,  260, as amended by the Act of February 25, 1919, c. 29,  6, 40 Stat. 1157, U.S.C. title 28,  375, and the Act of March 1, 1929, c. 419, 45 Stat. 1422 (Supp. III, title 28,  375 (28 USCA  375)):\n'When any judge of any court of the United States, appointed to hold his office during good behavior, resigns his office after having held a commission or commissions as judge of any such court or courts at least ten years continuously (or otherwise), and having attained the age of seventy years, he shall, during the residue of his natural life receive the salary which is payable at the time of his resignation for the office that he held at the time of his resignation.

BALDWIN(1934)\nNo. 296\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter E. Hope and Timothy N. Pfeiffer, both of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellees.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The New York milk control law of April 10, 1933,1 in authorizing the Milk Control Board to fix minimum prices for sales of fluid milk in bottles by milk dealers to stores in a city of more than one million inhabitants, established a differential of one cent a quart in favor of dealers not having a 'well advertised trade name.' \n2\n The Milk Control Board determined that the phrase 'well advertised trade name' referred to four dealers, of which the complainant, Borden's Farm Products Company, Inc., is one. \n3\n The authority of the Board terminated on March 31, 1934. An amended act was passed to take effect April 1, 1934,4 which placed the milk control in a division of the Department of Agriculture and Markets. This act continues the differential of one cent a quart in sales of fluid milk in bottles by dealers to stores, in favor of dealers not hav- \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n ing a well advertised trade name, and provides that the lower price shall also apply on sales from stores to consumers. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Complaining that the fixing of this differential, in respect to sales of the same commodity, was an invasion of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, plaintiff brought this suit to enjoin enforcement. An interlocutory injunction was sought and a court of three judges was convened. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds that it failed to state a cause of action in equity and that the provision of the statute was constitutional. Affidavits were presented on both sides and the case was heard on the motion for injunction and the motion to dismiss. In view of the cumulative penalties provided, the court had no doubt of its jurisdiction to pass upon the question of constitutionality. Dealing with the case in that aspect, the court held that the complaint did not state a cause of suit and dismissed it for that reason. The court regarded the application for an interlocutory injunction as necessarily falling with the complaint and hence made no findings of fact. (D.C.) 7 F. Supp. 352, 354. The plaintiff appeals.\n We turn to the allegations of the complaint. Plaintiff sets forth the full text of the acts of 1933 and 1934 and of the applicable orders. By the order of the Commissioner \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n of Agriculture and Markets the minimum prices for the sale of fluid milk in bottles by dealers to consumers and to stores, and by stores to consumers, are fixed for the city of New York. The order determining the four dealers who have a 'well advertised trade name' is continued in effect. Plaintiff alleges that for many years it has been continuously engaged in purchasing and selling milk in bottles in the city of New York and has built up a large business under its trade name 'Borden's' for sales both to consumers and to the stores described in the statute;6 that it operates nine retail stores in the city at which it has an extensive business in the sale of bottled milk to consumers under its trade name; that it has obtained from the Board of Health of the city all the necessary licenses and permits and has observed all the regulations of the Sanitary Code; that it has expended large sums in advertising its trade name and has thus created a valuable good will. Plaintiff alleges that it is in direct and active competition with numerous individuals, corporations and associations which are selling bottled milk to stores in the city but are not within the official determination of those having a 'well advertised trade name'; that these competitors are permitted to sell to stores bottled milk at a price one cent per quart below the minimum price at which plaintiff is permitted to sell its bottled milk to stores under its trade name; and that stores are permitted to sell to consumers the bottled milk of these competitors with the same differential as compared with the minimum price at which plaintiff's milk may be sold by stores, and thus plaintiff is deprived of a large part of the market for its milk and the value of its property and good will are seriously impaired. Plaintiff \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n states that the loss in trade it thus suffers amounts to not less than 25, 000 quarts of bottled milk daily.\n Plaintiff alleges that the maintenance of this differential, with the consequent privilege to its competitors and restraint upon itself, is 'arbitrary, oppressive and discriminatory' and has 'no relation to the protection of the public health or the public welfare or to any of the objects or purposes' for which the statute was enacted, and upon this ground plaintiff charges that the statutory provision violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Inability to obtain a license, unless plaintiff agrees in writing to comply with the statute and orders, and the prohibitive character of the penalties prescribed, are assigned as affording the basis of equitable jurisdiction.\n We have frequently said, especially in confiscation cases, that a mere general allegation of repugnance to the Fourteenth Amendment is not enough to state a cause of action to restrain the enforcement of a statute or administrative order. See AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174; Public Service Commission v. Great Northern Utilities Co., \n289 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S., 53 S.Ct. 546; Hegeman Farms Corporation v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n, 55 S.Ct. 7, decided November 5, 1934. But in determining the sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint we cannot fail to take note of the nature and effect of the legislative action which is assailed. Both nature and effect are apparent. We have here a novel, if not a unique, provision. The legislature does not purport to exercise an authority merely to fix prices, or minimum prices, or to make different prices for different grades of milk, but attempts to establish for the respective dealers different minimum prices for the same grade of milk, bought and sold at the same time and place and under precisely the same conditions aside from the use of a well advertised trade name. There is no uncertainty as to the effect of \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n the discrimination. As the court below said, the statute seeks to take away from dealers, who have well advertised trade names, 'economic advantages which were not only theretofore lawful, but which have generally been commended and fostered.' It strikes at the advantage acquired by dealers through the reputation of their brands and the consequent disposition of the public to buy them. In view of the peculiar nature and effect of this provision, and of the novel and important constitutional question that it presents, we think that the complaint should not have been dismissed for insufficiency upon its face and that the plaintiff is entitled to have the case heard and decided with appropriate findings by the trial court, unless it satisfactorily appears, upon facts of common knowledge or otherwise plainly subject to judicial notice, that the provision should be sustained as resting upon a rational basis consistent with constitutional right. Accordingly, we pass to the consideration of the various grounds that are suggested as adequate support for the legislative action.\n In this inquiry, we again observe the limited operation of the provision. It is restricted to the city of New York, and to sales of bottled milk to and by stores. It does not apply to retail delivery direct to consumers and not through stores. It relates solely to minimum prices. It is not addressed to any practice in the industry, or trade in relation to production, handling or selling, apart from the trade name employed. As to all such matters, a dealer with a well advertised trade name is subject to the same strict requirements as are all other dealers. The price to the producer, the farmer, is not affected by the differential. He receives the same price for his milk whether it is sold by dealers with well advertised trade names or otherwise. We have had occasion to note that 'Save the conduct of railroads, no business has been so \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n thoroughly regimented and regulated by the State of New York as the milk industry.' For many years, it has been 'progressively subjected to a larger measure of control.' Nebbia v. New York, supra, pages 521, 522 of 291 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 505, 509. This control has been in the interest of sanitary precautions and proper methods of production and trade. But because of the serious condition of the industry by reason of decline in prices and demoralizing practices, as reported by a legislative committee after an elaborate examination, and upon the committee's recommendations, the legislature has now proceeded to price control. The legislative committee did not, however, recommend the fixing of the differential here in question, and hence did not state grounds in support of such a discrimination. \n7\n But in considering possible grounds, we are aided by the suggestions which the Attorney General of the State and the counsel for the Department of Agriculture and Markets, with their special experience, have been able to bring forward.\n The ground chiefly urged is that the provision is intended as a precaution against monopoly. We turn to the expressed criterion of the statute. That criterion does not refer to restraint of trade in any of its connotations, or to any coercive action or unfair practice, or to any combination or concert. The provision for the differential is silent as to the use of any monopolizing methods or as to any monopolistic achievement. While dealers having well advertised trade names are grouped for the purpose of the differential, the statute is directed not at concerted action, but at the individual members of the group which are not shown to be, or, for the application \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 206]\n\u00a0\n of the differential, need not be, in any sort of combination or acting otherwise than in lawful competition with each other as well as with other dealers. The differential hits each dealer having a well advertised trade name regardless of the extent of that dealer's trade. That may be large or small. The court below said in its opinion that the four distributors determined by the department to have well advertised trade names sell about 35 per cent. of the bottled milk that is sold to stores in the city of New York and this is also stated in appellant's brief. That appears to be the amount of the described trade of the entire group, which are united only by the common characteristic that each member has a well advertised trade name. How much of the trade each of the four distributors may have, does not appear. \n8\n So far as the criterion of the statute is concerned, that makes no difference. If the statutory provision is sustained as to Borden's, on the simple showing of a well advertised trade name, without more, it must also be sustained as to every other dealer with a well advertised trade name-those now on the list and those which the state authority may hereafter place there-no matter how small a part of the trade the dealer may have, or how independent of any connection with anyone else, or how free from any improper trade practice or lacking in monopolistic opportunity, such a dealer may be.\n The suggestion has been made that the provision for the differential may find support in a supposed policy to increase the sales of milk,-that more milk may be sold than if the price were uniformly maintained. This suggestion does not appear to be sponsored by the Attorney \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 207]\n\u00a0\n General and the counsel for the Department of Agriculture and Markets. The answer is made that whatever opportunity there may be for increased sales lies in the lower price and not in the differential. If it be assumed that the lower price is a reasonable minimum and that it favors sales, the maintenance of the differential prevents the plaintiff and others in like case from resort to it.\n Putting aside fanciful considerations, the argument at the bar has presented the case in its essential features. It is shown that the legislature was inspired by the fear that in a competitive market, under strict regulation and with a scheme of minimum prices, dealers without well advertised brands, the so-called independent dealers, would be at a disadvantage. The aim was not at advertising but at its natural result. 'Well advertised' means well known. In setting up the differential, the legislature did not deal with monopoly in the ordinary sense of the term, but with an aggregate of economic advantages, lawfully and severally acquired, and possessed in varying degrees by the separate concerns having well known brands. The legislature put all these in one class and placed it under a handicap. For this discrimination, a special justification is urged. Respondents' counsel contend that the fixing of the differential was an effort to continue a condition which had obtained before the milk control law was enacted; that, previously, milk of the independent dealers had sold at lower prices than the milk of the well known brands; that in establishing price control, the legislature sought to preserve opportunities in competition which in actual practice the independent dealers had thus enjoyed and to prevent their trade from being destroyed by the operation of a scheme of uniform prices. The argument is that the legislature was confronted with a 'practical situation'; that 'the independents were to be deprived \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 208]\n\u00a0\n of their buying advantage by compelling all dealers to buy from producers at prices fixed according to utilization of the milk'; that this regulation involved 'a stern readjustment of former competitive conditions,' and the question was whether the independents should also be deprived of their selling advantage. The point is also made that the milk control law purports to be an emergency measure and that the legislature was entitled to protect existing opportunities of the independent dealers so that, if the emergency ceased and price control were abandoned, there could be a return to competitive conditions without such an elimination of dealers as might be caused by a temporary period of compulsory minimum prices on a uniform scale.\n The factual basis of this contention is disputed and there are no findings disclosing it. Appellant asserts that there was not at any time any customary or accepted difference in price between the milk sold by it under its trade name and the milk of its competitors who are now favored by the fixed differential. And reference is made to the disturbed state of the trade, preceding the enactment of the milk control law, and to the effect of the ban imposed by local ordinance upon the sale of 'loose milk,' which led to changes in methods of distribution and to price adjustments from time to time in order to meet competition.\n For the present purpose, it is sufficient to say that these arguments are addressed to particular trade conditions in the city of New York, which largely lie outside the range of judicial notice. Counsel refer to the affidavits submitted on the motion for injunction. And we are asked to extract from various tables and statements in the reports of the legislative committee, which were not addressed to the fixing of the differential here in question, sufficient data upon which to predicate a judgment. But, \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 209]\n\u00a0\n the case is not before us upon evidence, or upon determinations of fact based on evidence, as the complaint was dismissed solely in the view that it failed to state a cause of action and the motion for injunction accordingly fell without findings being made. As we have said, we may read the complaint in the light of facts of which we may take judicial notice, but if, so read, it may be regarded as sufficient, the decision of this appeal should not turn on other facts which are the proper subjects of evidence and of determinations of fact by the trial court. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents invoke the presumption which attaches to the legislative action. But that is a presumption of fact of the existence of factual conditions supporting the legislation. As such it is a rebuttable presumption. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 78-80, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 U.S. 164\n, 170-172, 48 S.Ct. 66; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 U.S. 251\n, 256-258, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163. It is not a conclusive presumption, or a rule of law which makes legislative action invulnerable to constitutional assault. Nor is such an immunity achieved by treating any fanciful conjecture as enough to repel attack. When the classification made by the legislature is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing by a resort to common knowledge or other matters which may be judicially noticed, or to other legitimate proof, that the action is arbitrary. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., supra; State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S.Ct. 630; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A. L.R. 374. The \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 210]\n\u00a0\n principle that the State has a broad discretion in classification, in the exercise of its power of regulation, is constantly recognized by this Court. Still, the statute may show on its face that the classification is arbitrary (Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 567\n, 51 S.Ct. 582) or that may appear by facts admitted or proved. Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 417\n, 30 S.Ct. 287, 17 Ann.Cas. 1247; Air-Way Electric Appliance Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 45 S.Ct. 12; Concordia Fire Insurance Co. v. Illinois, \n292 \nU.S. 535, 549\n, 54 S.Ct. 830. Or, after a full showing of facts, or opportunity to show them, it may be found that the burden of establishing that the classification is without rational basis has not been sustained. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., supra; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Radice v. People of State of New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292\n, 44 S.Ct. 325; Clarke v. Deckebach, supra; Ohio Oil Company v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146\n, 50 S.Ct. 310; State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. But where the legislative action is suitably challenged, and a rational basis for it is predicated upon the particular economic facts of a given trade or industry, which are outside the sphere of judicial notice, these facts are properly the subject of evidence and of findings. With the notable expansion of the scope of governmental regulation, and the consequent assertion of violation of constitutional rights, it is increasingly important that when it becomes necessary for the Court to deal with the facts relating to particular commercial or industrial conditions, they should be presented concretely with appropriate determinations upon evidence, so that conclusions shall not be reached without adequate factual support.\n Respondents' counsel, referring to the difficulties of price regulation, say that 'Apparently the fixing of prices by government discovered as many troubles as were loosed from Pandora's box.' This complexity of problems, however, makes it the more imperative that the Court in discharging its duty, in sustaining governmental \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 211]\n\u00a0\n authority within its sphere and in enforcing individual rights, shall not proceed upon false assumptions.\n As the court below said, no precedents come very close to the instant case. In Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., supra, the facts were fully disclosed (pages 345-347 of 240 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 370), and it was held that the use of profit-sharing coupons and trading stamps constituted a distinct method of doing business justifying license taxes (page 357 of 240 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 370). The Court pointed out that the complainants' schemes did not rest with mere advertising, with 'identification and description, apprising of quality and place,' where the 'acquisition of the article to be sold constitutes the only inducement to its purchase' according to the 'practice of old and familiar transactions,' but that those schemes tempted by a promise of a value greater than the article sold and hence might be thought to be a 'lure to improvidence' (page 365 of 240 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 370, 377). See, also, Tanner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369\n, 36 S.Ct. 379. In State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, where a license tax with respect to chain store operation was upheld, evidence had been received and considered by the District Court, but that court did not go beyond a partial summary of the facts and general conclusions of law. We said that had Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723) been in force at the time of the trial, we should feel constrained to remand the case with directions to make findings of fact (page 533 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 540); but in the circumstances the Court proceeded to summarize the proofs, and, on a full examination of the factual differences between chain stores and individually owned units, reached the conclusion that these differences afforded a basis for the tax assailed ( pages 534-536, 541 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 540). See, also, Liggett Co. v. Lee, \n288 \nU.S. 518, 532\n, 53 S.Ct. 481, 85 A.L.R. 699.\n The importance of adequate findings of fact in relation to controlling economic conditions was emphasized in Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n, 44 S.Ct. 405. The suit had \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 212]\n\u00a0\n been brought to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Rent Commission of the District of Columbia cutting down rents for apartments. Plaintiff alleged that the emergency which had been held to justify the rent measures (sustained in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165), had ceased. We said that the plaintiff's allegations could not 'be declared offhand to be unmaintainable' and that it was not impossible 'that a full development of the facts' would show them to be true, and in that case the operation of the statute would be at an end (page 548 of 264 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 405, 406). Before deciding the question, we found that it was 'material to know the condition of Washington at different dates in the past' and that 'obviously the facts should be accurately ascertained and carefully weighed.' We said that this could be done more conveniently in the Supreme Court of the District than here, and, for this reason, the judgment below, dismissing the bill, was reversed and the cause was remanded for appropriate ascertainment of the facts (page 549 of 264 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 405).\n Another illustration is found in Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, supra, involving the validity of a city ordinance regulating motor traffic in designated parts of the city's streets. The lower courts had not made findings upon crucial questions of fact. There were affidavits below, which, we said, 'are silent as to some facts of legal significance, lack definiteness as to some matters, and present serious conflicts on issues of facts that may be decisive.' We held that before the questions of constitutional law, both novel and of far reaching importance, were passed upon by this Court, 'the facts essential to their decision should be definitely found by the lower courts upon adequate evidence.' Pages 171, 172 of 275 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 66, 69. Concluding that the case had not been appropriately prepared for final disposition, we remanded it for proceedings in the District Court, 'with liberty, among other things, to allow amendment of the pleadings.' This procedure was in accordance \n\n[293 U.S. 194, 213]\n\u00a0\n with well-established precedents. See Estho v. Lear, 7 Pet. 130; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 20 S.Ct. 336; United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n184 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 22 S.Ct. 428; Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co. v. Lincoln, \n223 \nU.S. 349, 364\n, 32 S.Ct. 271.\n A similar course should be taken here. While the complaint is lacking in the specific and definite allegations as to trade conditions which would be appropriate to the plaintiff's assertions in supporting its attack on the statute, we think that the plaintiff should not be refused standing in court upon the allegations made. As we do not approve the procedure adopted below, we do not pass upon the ultimate question of the constitutionality of the statute. The plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with the cause; the motion for preliminary injunction should be heard and decided, and the cause should proceed to final hearing upon pleadings and proofs; the facts should be found and conclusions of law stated as required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result in the following memorandum:\n We are in accord with the view that it is inexpedient to determine grave constitutional questions upon a demurrer to a complaint, or upon an equivalent motion, if there is a reasonable likelihood that the production of evidence will make the answer to the questions clearer.\n Since our brethren find that likelihood to be present in this case, and are content to postpone an adjudication of the merits, we refrain from any discussion of the validity of the statute on the basis of facts within the range of judicial notice, and assent to the judgment recommended in the opinion of the court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws N.Y. 1933, c. 158 (Agriculture and Markets Law N.Y.

The provision is as follows: 'It shall not be unlawful for any milk dealer who since April tenth, nineteen hundred thirty-three has been engaged continuously in the business of purchasing and handling milk not having a well advertised trade name in a city of more than one million inhabitants to sell fluid milk in bottles to stores in such city at a price not more than one cent per quart below the price of such milk sold to stores under a well advertised trade name, and such lower price shall also apply on sales from stores to consumers; provided that in no event shall the price of such milk not having a well advertised trade name, be more than one cent per quart below the minimum price fixed for such sales to stores in such a city.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The act of 1934, like the preceding act (section 301), defines 'store' as meaning 'a grocery store, hotel, restaurant, soda fountain, dairy products store and similar mercantile establishment.' Section 253 ( as added by Laws N.Y. 1934, c. 126,  1). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] It appears that in the case of both the acts of 1933 and 1934, the provision in question was added in the course of legislative consideration of proposed measures and at the instance of dealers described as independents. 7 F.Supp., page 353. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Thus it does not appear how much of the 'store' trade in bottled milk is that of the Borden Company or of the Sheffield Company or of the Dairymen's League Company or of the Renken Dairy Company, the four distributors found to have well advertised trade names. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] How hazardous it is to assume that particular trade facts are of common knowledge is shown by the various estimates of the number of 'stores' at which milk is sold in the city of New York, these estimates apparently varying from 25,000 to 60,000. \n\n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRITISH-AMERICAN TOBACCO CO. v.

PINKSTON(1934)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas Stevenson, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioners.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James R. Garfield, of Cleveland, Ohio, and W. L. Bryan, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen is an unincorporated voluntary association with headquarters in Ohio. It has a department known as the Widows' Pension Department, created in order to provide a monthly income for the widows or widowed mothers of deceased members. The widow of a member, upon his death, is to receive a pension of $ 35 per month during her lifetime. In the event of her remarriage, the \n\n[293 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n pension is to cease. The respondent, widow of a deceased member, became entitled to this pension. Thereafter, the association, following an investigation of the financial condition of the department and upon an actuarial report, determined to abolish the department and distribute the assets after making a lump-sum settlement not to exceed $1,500 with each widow then on the pension roll. Widows refusing to settle were to have their names erased from the roll, and be provisionally relegated to another fund. Payment of monthly installments on pensions was discontinued, beginning September 1, 1931\n\n\n Complainant thereupon brought suit in a federal District Court, on behalf of herself and other beneficiaries similarly situated, for an accounting, determination of priorities, and a proper liquidation and administration of the funds of the department. The federal jurisdiction was invoked on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The District Court, after a hearing, dismissed the bill on the ground that the requisite amount to confer jurisdiction (over $3,000) was not involved. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (69 F.(2d) 600) upon the authority of Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551\n, 33 S.Ct. 129. Whether that court rightly held that the jurisdictional amount was involved is the only question for consideration.\n The entire fund is nearly $300,000. The bill proceeds on the theory that this constitutes a trust fund, and seeks its administration under judicial orders. Respondent urges that the jurisdiction may well be tested by the value of the whole fund. But we put that question aside, since we are of opinion that the value of respondent's own interest in the fund exceeds the jurisdictional amount.\n This, it will be seen, is not an action at law to recover overdue installments, but a suit in equity to preserve and protect a right to future participation in the fund. If \n\n[293 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n the value of that right exceeds $3,000, the District Court has jurisdiction.\n In the Thompson Case, a decree had been entered by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in favor of a wife against her husband, for support and maintenance at the rate of $75 a month, together with $500 for counsel fees. The decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District (35 App. D.C. 14). On an appeal to this court, our jurisdiction was challenged upon the ground that a sum in excess of $5,000 was not involved, as the statute at that time required. While the installments already accrued amounted to much less than that, it was held that the expectancy of life of the parties was clearly sufficient to make up the balance, and jurisdiction was upheld. Mr. Justice Pitney, who delivered the opinion, said (page 560 of 226 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 129, 130): 'The future payments are not in any proper sense contingent or speculative, although they are subject to be increased, decreased, or even cut off, as just indicated.'\n The situation there and that here fairly cannot be distinguished. The life expectancy of respondent, as shown by the mortality tables, is enough to bring the value of the future pension installments, as of the date of the suit, to a sum much in excess of $3,000; and as to that no point is made. The jurisdictional defect said to exist is that the payments are to cease in the event of respondent's remarriage; and this condition, petitioners say, makes future payments depend entirely upon the volition of the widow, and whether they may accrue is, therefore, a matter of pure speculation. Indeed, the happening of the event does not depend (if that would matter) upon the widow's volition alone, but equally upon the willingness of another to marry her. Continuance of payments during the life of the respondent is fixed by contract quite as definitely as continuance of payments for maintenance in the Thompson Case was fixed by decree, and subject to substantially like conditions subsequent. In the Thomp- \n\n[293 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n son Case the payments were subject to be cut off entirely, not only by death but, the court said, 'in the event of a change in the circumstances of the parties.' The same is true here. In no respect are we able to see any difference in principle between the two cases. The occurrence of the specified event which would put an end to the obligation is no more uncertain in the one case than in the other.\n Moreover, the evidence discloses that the expectancy of remarriage and its effect upon the value of the pension is capable of actuarial determination. The law of averages applies in respect of that event, as it does in respect of death and of other events. Mr. Pipe, an actuary called as a witness by petitioners, testified that the value of respondent's right to receive $35 a month so long as she remained unmarried was, in round figures, $6,000 as of August 1, 1931. A report made to the Brotherhood, filed June 2, 1932, by its Committee on Constitution, which seems to have been made after careful study, contains the statement:\n'The 'present value' can be determined if we know the average ages of widows corresponding to the ages at the death of members, and we know the proportion of widows who remarry. This information is available from the records of Pension Funds. For example, if we know that the average age of the widows of members who die at age 40, is 36, then the value of the benefit in event of death at 40, is the present value of a pension of $420 per annum on the life of a woman aged 36, taking into account the chances of remarriage. The benefit has a definite 'lump sum' value on the death of the member. ...'\n\n Counsel upon both sides have cited and discussed decisions of this and other courts bearing upon the general subject. We have examined these decisions, but find it unnecessary to review or distinguish them. We agree with the court below that the question of jurisdiction here \n\n[293 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n under consideration is the same in substance as that involved in the Thompson Case; and, that being so, the decree of the court below must be affirmed.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n293 U.S. 632\n 55 S.Ct. 211, 79 L.Ed. --.[ Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen v.

HELVERING(1934)\nNo. 187\nArgued: Decided: January 15, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 193, 194]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur B. Dunne and Peter F. Dunne, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An unincorporated concern known as Edward Brown & Sons, of San Francisco, has since 1896 acted as Pacific \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 195]\n\u00a0\n Coast General Agent for fire insurance companies. 1 In 1923, Arthur M. Brown conducted the concern alone. In 1925 and 1926, he and his son Arthur M. Brown, Jr., conducted it as partners. The general agent receives as compensation from its principals, among other things, a so-called 'overriding commission' on the net premiums derived from business written through the local agents. The question for decision is, how the income of the petitioner, Arthur M. Brown, derived from overriding commissions during the years 1923, 1925, and 1926 should be calculated for purposes of the federal income tax. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that, in determining income, the gross overriding commissions on business written during the year should not be subjected to any deduction on account of cancellations expected to occur in later years. The taxpayer contends that either the gross overriding commissions should be subjected to such a deduction of that parts of the gross overriding commissions should be allocated as earnings of future years. \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 196]\n\u00a0\n The term 'net premium' as used in providing for overriding commissions means the gross premium on the business written less the return premium and the net cost of any reinsurance. Fire insurance policies are written for periods of one, three, or five years, with the right of cancellation by either party at stipulated rates of premium return. Premiums being payable in advance (subject to the 60-day grace period), a return premium is paid to the policyholder in case of cancellation; and the general agent, who receives the premium, pays the return premium. The company writing a policy frequently reinsures in another company a part of its contingent liability; and the general agent, who makes the payments for reinsurance, receives, in case of cancellation, a return of a proportionate part of the cost of the canceled reinsurance. The general agent makes to each principal remittances on monthly balances, crediting itself, among other things, with the overriding commissions on premiums receivable, with the return premiums paid and with the net amount paid for reinsurance; and charging itself, among other things, with a proportionate part of any overriding commissions previously credited in respect of any business which has been canceled during the month. Thus, whenever there is a cancellation and a return or credit of a portion of the premium and of the cost of any reinsurance, the general agent returns to the company or charges itself with a corresponding portion of the overriding commission.\n Prior to 1923, overriding commissions on new business were accounted income of the year in which the business was written; and refunds of overriding commission on account of cancellations were accounted expenses of the year of cancellation. The books of the general agent have at all times been kept on the accrual basis. Although no change was made in the method of accounting between the general agent and its principals, there was \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 197]\n\u00a0\n set up on the books of the concern at the close of 1923, for the first time, a liability account entitled 'Return Commission.' In it was recorded an estimate of the liability expected to arise out of the general agent's obligations to refund to the companies a proportionate part of the overriding commission received because of cancellations which it was expected would occur in future years. The estimate was based on the experience of the preceding five years. Thus, on the books, the year's income from overriding commissions was reduced by the amount of refunds which, it was estimated, would have to be made in future years. This changed method of accounting has been followed ever since; and the difference in the method of calculating the general agent's income has been reflected in the returns made by Brown of his taxable income.\n The ratio of cancellations to premiums receivable having been 22.38 per cent. for the five years ending in 1923, the gross income from overriding commissions on business written in 1923, amounting to $236,693. 31, was subjected on the books to a deduction of $52,971.96; and this amount was credited to the 'Return Commission' account. Similarly, at the close of each of the years 1924, 1925, and 1926, the credit balance in the 'Return Commission' account was adjusted so that it bore the same relation to the overriding commissions on business written during the year as the total fire insurance premiums canceled in the preceding five-year period bore to the gross premiums on business written during those years. The ratio of cancellations for the five years ending in 1925 having been 21.55 per cent., and the total overriding commissions $244,597.88, a deduction of $3,292.98 was made, representing the net addition to the 'Return Commission' account in 1925. The ratio of cancellations to premiums for the five-year period ending in 1926 having been 21.13 per cent., and the total overriding commissions \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 198]\n\u00a0\n $258,677.57, a deduction was made of $1,947.77 representing the net addition to the 'Return Commission' account in 1926.2\n In making his federal income tax return for the years 1923, 1925, and 1926, Brown claimed as deductions the benefit of the credits so made to the 'Return Commission' account. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed these deductions; and accordingly assessed to Brown for 1923 a deficiency of $17,923.03; for 1925 a deficiency of $1,520.19; and for 1926 a deficiency of $944.30.3 The Commission's determinations were sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals, 22 B.T.A. 678; and its order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 63 F.(2d) 66. Certiorari was granted by this Court (\n290 \nU.S. 607\n, 54 S.Ct. 61, 78 L.Ed. --) because of alleged conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia-Lincoln Furniture Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 56 F.(2d) 1028, and other cases.\n First. The Commissioner properly disallowed the deduction on account of the credits to the 'Return Com- \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 199]\n\u00a0\n mission' account. Under the Revenue Acts, taxable income is computed for annual periods. If the accounts are kept on the accrual basis, the income is to be accounted for in the year in which it is realized, even if not then actually received; and the deductions are to be taken in the year in which the deductible items are incurred. What is taxable as income is provided by the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 237, 239.4 Section 212(a) declares: 'That in the case of an individual the term 'net income' means the gross income as defined in section 213, less the deductions allowed by section 214.' Section 214(a) declares: 'That in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: 1. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.' The only relevant deductions allowable by law are those provided for in section 214; and the burden rests upon the taxpayer to show that he was entitled to the deduction claimed. Reinecke v. Spalding, \n280 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 50 S.Ct. 96.\n The overriding commissions were gross income of the year in which they were receivable. As to each such commission there arose the obligation-a contingent liability-to return a proportionate part in case of cancellation. But the mere fact that some portion of it might have to be refunded in some future year in the event of cancellation or reinsurance did not affect its quality as income. Compare American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99\n, 47 S.Ct. 520 71 L.Ed. 946. When received, the general agent's right to it was absolute. It was under no restriction, contractual or otherwise, as to its disposition, use, or enjoyment. Compare North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U.S. \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 200]\n\u00a0\n 417, 424, 52 S.Ct. 613.5 The refunds during the tax year of those portions of the overriding commissions which represented cancellations during the tax year had, prior to the tax return for 1923, always been claimed as deductions; and they were apparently allowed as 'necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year.' The right to such deductions is not now questioned. Those which the taxpayer claims now are of a very different character. They are obviously not 'expenses paid during the taxable year.' They are bookkeeping changes representing credits to a reserve account.\n These charges on account of credits to the 'Return Commission' reserve account are claimed as deductions on the ground that they are expenses 'incurred,' 'during the taxable year.' It is true that, where a liability has 'accrued during the taxable year,' it may be treated as an expense incurred; and hence as the basis for a deduction, although payment is not presently due, United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 440\n, 441 S., 46 S.Ct. 131; American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99\n, 47 S.Ct. 520; Aluminum Castings Co. v. Routzahn, \n282 \nU.S. 92\n, 51 S.Ct. 11, and although the amount of the liability has not been definitely ascertained. United States v. Anderson, supra. \n6\n Compare Continental Tie & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 290, 296\n, 52 S.Ct. 529. But no liability accrues during the taxable year on account of cancellations which it is expected may occur in future years, since the events necessary to create the liability do not occur during the taxable year. Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a liability does not accrue as long as it remains contingent. Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 335\n, 49 S.Ct. 337; Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 450\n, 452 S., 50 S.Ct. 202; compare New York Life Ins. Co. \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 201]\n\u00a0\n v. Edwards, \n271 \nU.S. 109, 116\n, 46 S.Ct. 436; Ewing Thomas Converting Co. v. McCaughn (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 503; Highland Milk Condensing Co. v. Phillips (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 777.\n The liability of Edward Brown & Sons arising from expected future cancellations was not deductible from gross income because it was not fixed and absolute. In respect to no particular policy written within the year could it be known that it would be canceled in a future year. Nor could it be known that a definite percentage of all the policies will be canceled in the future years. Experience taught that there is a strong probability that many of the policies written during the taxable year will be so canceled. But experience taught also that we are not dealing here with certainties. This is shown by the variations in the percentages in the several five-year periods of the aggregate of refunds to the aggregate of overriding commissions. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Brown argues that, since insurance companies are allowed to deduct reserves for unearned premiums which may have to be refunded, he should be allowed to make the deductions claimed as being similar in character. The simple answer is that the general agent is not an insurance company; and that the deductions allowed for additions to the reserves of insurance companies are technical in character and are specifically provided for in the Revenue Acts. These technical reserves are required to be made by the insurance laws of the several states. See Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342, 350\n, 40 S.Ct. 155; United States v. Boston Insurance Co., \n269 \nU.S. 197\n, 46 S.Ct. 97; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Edwards, \n271 \nU.S. 109\n, 46 S.Ct. 436. The 'Return Commission' reserve here in question was voluntarily established. Only a few reserves voluntarily established \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 202]\n\u00a0\n as a matter of conservative accounting are authorized by the Revenue Acts. Section 214 mentions only the reserve for bad debts (in the discretion of the Commissioner), provided for in paragraph 7; those for depreciation and depletion, provided for in paragraphs 8 and 10; and the special provision concerning future expenses in connection with casual sales of real property, provided for in paragraph 11 of section 214(a) as amended by the Revenue Act of 1926. 26 U.S.C.  955 (26 USCA  955(a)(11). Many reserves set up by prudent business men are not allowable as deductions. See Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 452\n, 50 S.Ct. 202.8\n Brown argues also that the Revenue Acts required him to make his return 'in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books;'9 and that in making the deductions based on the credits to 'Return Commission' account he complied with this requirement. The Commissioner's oft-quoted10 instruction of January 8, 1917 (No. 2433, 19 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 5) is relied upon:\n'In cases wherein, pursuant to the consistent practice of accounting of the corporation ... corporations set up and maintain reserves to meet liabilities, the amount of which and the date of payment or maturity of which is not definitely determined or determinable at the time the liability is incurred, it will be permissible for the corpora- \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 203]\n\u00a0\n tions to deduct from their gross income the amounts credited to such reserves each year, provided that the amounts deductible on account of the reserve shall approximate as nearly as can be determined the actual amounts which experience has demonstrated would be necessary to discharge the liabilities incurred during the year and for the payment of which additions to the reserves were made.'\n\n The accrual method of accounting had been regularly employed by Edward Brown & Sons before 1923, but no 'Return Commission' account had been set up. Moreover, the method employed by the taxpayer is never conclusive. If in the opinion of the Commissioner it does not clearly reflect the income, 'the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner' as will, in his opinion, do so. United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 439\n, 46 S.Ct. 131; Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 50 S.Ct. 202; Lucas v. Ox Fibre Brush Co., \n281 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 50 S.Ct. 273; compare Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S.Ct. 587; Lucas v. Structural Steel Co., \n281 \nU.S. 264\n, 50 S.Ct. 263.11 In assessing the deficiencies, the Commissioner required in effect that the taxpayer continue to follow the method of accounting which had been in use prior to the change made in 1923. To so require was within his administrative discretion. Compare Bent v. Com'r Int. Rev. (C.C.A.) 56 F.( 2d) 99.\n Second. The Board of Tax Appeals did not err in refusing to allocate to future years part of the overriding commissions on business written during the taxable year. Brown urges that the overriding commission is compensation for services rendered throughout the life of the policy; that the compensation to be rendered in later years cannot be considered as earned until the required services have been performed; and that the Revenue Acts con- \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 204]\n\u00a0\n template that, where books are kept on the accrual basis, the income shall be accounted for as it is earned. He suggests, therefore, as an alternative method of ascertaining the income, that the commissions on each year's writing be prorated over the life of the policies.\n Under this alternative proposal, the practice of making deductions prevailing prior to 1923 would remain unchanged; but the method of ascertaining the gross income of the taxable year would be subjected to a farreaching change. The proposal is that all policies be deemed to have been written on July 1; that, of the overriding commission on one-year policies, one-half should be returned as income of the year in which the policy was written, the other half as income of the next year; that, of the commissions on three-year policies, one-sixth should be returned as income of the year in which the policy was written, one-third as the income of each of the next two years, and one-sixth as income of the fourth year; and that, of the commission on five-year policies, one-tenth should be returned as income of the first year, one-fifth as income of each of the next four years, and one-tenth as income of the sixth year.\n This proposed alternative method of computing the income from overriding commissions was not employed by Edward Brown & Sons either before or after 1923. Moreover, the Board concluded that there 'is no proof that the overriding commissions contain any element of compensation for services to be rendered in future years.' The whole of the overriding commissions has at all times been treated as income of the year in which the policy was written. The Commissioner was of opinion that the method of accounting consistently applied prior to 1923 accurately reflected the income. He was vested with a wide discretion in deciding whether to permit or to forbid a change. Compare Bent v. Com'r Int. Rev. (C.C.A.) 56 F.(2d) 99. It is not the province of the court to weigh and determine \n\n[291 U.S. 193, 205]\n\u00a0\n the relative merits of systems of accounting. Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 50 S.Ct. 202.\n The deductions here claimed, not being authorized specifically either by the Revenue Acts, or by any regulation applying them, were properly disallowed. So far as the decision in Virginia-Lincoln Furniture Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 56 F.(2d) 1028, may be inconsistent with this opinion, it is disapproved.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The duties required of and performed by the general agent are described by the Board of Tax Appeals as follows: The firm appointed and removed local agents; accepted service of process; adjusted losses under policies; received and acknowledged service of proof of loss; issued, countersigned, and canceled policies; received and receipted for premiums, surveyed all risks offered, and accepted or rejected the same; represented its principals on the Pacific Board of Underwriters; computed and paid commissions due local agents; ceded or reinsured certain lines of business with treaty or other companies; computed and paid return premiums on canceled policies; secured return of premium on canceled reinsurance; rendered all reports required of its principals by the authorities of political subdivisions in the territory in which it operated; attended to the payment of all license fees and taxes; furnished all necessary printed matter, except policy blanks, to local agents; transferred insurance by indorsement, determined whether its principals should participate in special pools; and generally attended to all the affairs of its principals in the territory in which it operated. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For the year 1923, the deduction of $52,971.96, the entire amount set up as a reserve, is in dispute. Similar figures were set up for the years 1924, 1925, and 1926; but actual cancellations for each of these later years were charged, not against overriding commissions, but against the return commission account as set up and carried over from the preceding year. Thus the amount in dispute for each of the years 1925 and 1926 is not the entire deduction from overriding commissions as made by the general agent, but the difference between that figure and the amounts charged to the 'Return Commission' account; or, in other words, the net adjustment or addition to the account. (There was no addition for 1924.)\n Judge Wilbur concurred specially below, taking the ground, among others, that the result of this method was a claim in 1923 for deductions both of the entire reserve and of actual cancellations during the year. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The amount of the deficiency for each year was affected by an additional claim as a deduction of $3,000, which was disallowed. It is not here in question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sections 212, 213, and 214 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253 (26 USCA  953-955 and notes), 267-270, and the corresponding sections of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 23-27 (26 USCA  953-955) contain provisions identical with those quoted above, except that section 206 of those acts is also referred to as defining deductions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See, also, Vang v.

FRIED(1934)\nNo. 786\nArgued: May 3, 1934Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sigmund H. Steinberg, of Philadelphia, Pa., and John P. Stokes, of Miami, Fla., for plaintiff.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John C. Noonan, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings here for review a judgment entered by the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania in an action on six instruments, each promising the payment of $1,000, all of even date and like tenor. They were executed and delivered by the respondent at Miami, Fla., and were there payable to Golden Isles Corporation at intervals of six months, the first falling due six months from August 28, 1925, and the last three years from that date. Prior to maturity the payee indorsed and delivered them to one Williamson, who, after refusal of payment at maturity, transferred them by delivery to the petitioner. In response to the petitioner's statement of claim the respondent filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a statutory demurrer, asserting that, as the writings did not embody a promise to pay a sum certain, they were not negotiable notes.\n The District Judge followed the decisions of the Pennsylvania courts to the effect that the holder of negotiable paper, whether he obtained title before or after dishonor, may sue in his own name,1 but a holder must sue as use plaintiff in the name of the obligee if the instrument is not \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n negotiable. \n2\n Concluding that the notes were not negotiable and consequently the petitioner could sue only in the name of Golden Isles Corporation, he sustained the affidavit of defense, and, as the petitioner refused to amend, entered judgment for the respondent. The Court of Appeals affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The provisions held to create the uncertainty which deprived the notes of negotiability, were: 'With interest thereon (the principal sum) at the rate of 7 per cent per annum from date until fully paid. Interest payable semi-annually. ... Deferred interest payments to bear interest from maturity at ten per cent per annum, payable semi-annually.'\n The petitioner urged that, as Florida had adopted the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, the federal courts were bound to decide the issue according to that statute as interpreted by the Florida court of last resort; the respondent insisted as the action was in the District Court sitting in Pennsylvania, which had also adopted the Uniform Act, the statute as interpreted by the courts of that state must be applied. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that it need not adopt the construction of the act by the courts of either state, but should decide the case upon the general principles of the law merchant. From these it concluded the quoted provi ions rendered the instruments uncertain as to the amount payable and therefore nonnegotiable.\n\n 1. \nThe Conformity Act4 required the trial court to apply the local law in matters of procedure. The form of action and the right in which it must be brought were therefore governed by the Pennsylvania practice. But the procedural question turned on another of substance, namely, whether the instruments were negotiable. \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n 2. The negotiable quality of the notes is to be ascertained by reference to the law of Florida. \n5\n The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law adopted in that state provides6 (section 1) that:\n'An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements: ...\n\n'(2) Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money.'\n\n And by section 2 it is declared:\n'The sum payable is a sum certain within the meaning of this act, although it is to be paid: (1) With interest; or (2) By stated instalments; or (3) By stated instalments, with a provision that upon default in payment of any instalment or of interest, the whole shall become due. ...'\n\n Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 directs that the laws of the several states, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. \n7\n The applicable state statute furnishes the rule of decision for a federal court sitting in the state8 or outside its borders. \n9\n And in that court the law \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n must be given the meaning and effect attributed to it by the highest court of the state, as if the state court's decision were literally incorporated into the enactment, whatever the federal tribunal's opinion as to the correctness of the state court's views. \n10\n The petitioner says the Supreme Court of Florida has construed the pertinent sections of the Negotiable Instrument Law as declaring writings of the tenor of those in suit to be negotiable, and the courts below were, therefore, bound so to rule. The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, held that the construction by a state court of last resort of a state statute which is merely declaratory of the common law or law merchant does not bind federal courts. It ascribed that character to the Uniform Act and refused to consider as conclusive the Florida decision upon which the petitioner relied. The court referred to several opinions which sustain this position. \n11\n It recognized that the opposing view also finds support in other decisions of the federal courts. 12 Because of this contrariety of opinion we granted the writ of certiorari. \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 495]\n\u00a0\n We think the better view is that there is no valid distinction in this respect between an act which alters the common law and one which codifies or declares it. Both are within the letter of section 34 of the Judiciary Act (supra). And a declaratory act is no less an expression of the legislative will because the rule it prescribes is the same as that announced in prior decisions of the courts of the state. Nor is there a difference in this respect between a statute prescribing rules of commercial law and one concerned with some other subject of narrower scope. The contention of the respondent that this court announced a contrary view in Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, is not sustained by a careful reading of the opinion in that case. \n13\n We are referred to certain expressions found in Watson v. Tarpley, 18 How. 517, at page 521. What was there said on the subject was unnecessary to the decision, and has not been followed in later cases. The Florida Negotiable Instruments Law, as construed by the Supreme Court of the state, furnishes the rule of decision by which the negotiable character of the notes is to be determined.\n\n 3. \nThe petitioner asserts that in Taylor v. American National Bank of Pensacola, 63 Fla. 631, 57 So. 678, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 309, the Supreme Court of that state construed the statute so as to make negotiable an instrument of the tenor of those in suit. The note involved in that case was payable two years after date with interest from date at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, interest payable quarter-annually, and was held to be negotiable, section 2 of the Uniform Act being quoted. The decision is a clear authority that under the act the provision for periodical payment of \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 496]\n\u00a0\n interest before the due date of the principal does not destroy negotiability. As the note did not provide for interest on deferred interest payments, either at the same or a different rate from that named as payable upon principal, the effect of such a stipulation was not decided. Upon this matter, therefore, the case cannot be said to be an authority by which the Circuit Court of Appeals was bound.\n\n 4. \nThe absence of a decision by the Supreme Court of the state did not relieve the courts below from applying the Florida statute. Lacking such authoritative construction, their duty was to determine the question according to the accepted canons and in the light of the decisions of the courts of other states with respect to the same sections of the Negotiable Instruments Law. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n If, as is admitted, the court of last resort of the state, holds that provision for payment of interest in installments prior to maturity of principal does not render the sum payable so uncertain as to destroy negotiability, we think an added stipulation that overdue interest shall bear interest at a named rate until paid would not call for a different decision. Courts which have had occasion to consider the effect of the act upon instruments of like tenor have uniformly pronounced them negotiable. 15 And cases decided prior to the adoption of the act are to the same effect. \n16\n No contrary decision has been brought \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 497]\n\u00a0\n to our notice. Until the Supreme Court of Florida holds otherwise, we are justified in construing the act in accordance with what we think its intent, especially as this construction accords with the views of the courts of other states.\n\n 5. \nThe respondent urges that the notes are so ambiguous with respect to the rate of interest that they do not call for the payment of a sum certain, and must therefore be held not to be negotiable. First National Bank of Miami v. Bosler, 297 Pa. 353, 147 A. 74, is cited as sustaining this position. The note there under consideration stipulated for 8 per cent. per annum upon the principal, 'from date until fully paid. Interest payable semi-annually. ... Deferred payments are to bear interest from maturity at ten per cent per annum semi-annually.' The decision against negotiability rested upon the proposition that the two interest provisions were so inconsistent that one reading the note could not ascertain at which rate interest was payable on overdue principal. The decision has been criticized, Lessen v. Lindsey, 238 App.Div. 262, 264 N.Y.S. 391, on the ground that ambiguity alone does not destroy negotiability, but requires merely a construction of the instrument and a determination of which of two inconsistent clauses shall control. But, be this as it may, the notes in the present case are, we think, free from ambiguity. They provide for interest on the principal sum at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum from date until fully paid, for interest payable semiannually, and add that deferred interest payments shall bear interest from maturity at 10 per cent. per annum, payable semiannually. While, therefore, the principal is to bear interest at 7 per cent., overdue interest is to be paid with interest at 10 per cent. The word 'maturity' seems obviously to refer to the due dates of interest and not to the date for payment of principal. \n\n[292 U.S. 487, 498]\n\u00a0\n The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rankin v.

UNITED STATES(1934)\nNo. 434\nArgued: December 5, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 534, 536]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert H. McNeill, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment returned by a grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia charges petitioners, in ten counts, with violations of the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of February 28, 1925, c. 368, title 3, 43 Stat. 1053, 1070; U.S.C. title 2,  241, et seq. (2 USCA  241 et seq.). The pertinent provisions of the act are contained in sections 241, 242, and 243, reproduced in the margin,1 and in sections 244 and 252. Section 241 de- \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n fines the term, 'political committee,' as including any organization which accepts contributions for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the election of presidential and vice presidential electors in two or more states. Every political committee is required to have a chairman and a treasurer before any contribution may be accepted. One of the duties of the treasurer is to keep a detailed and exact account of all contributions made to \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n or for the committee. Every person who receives a contribution for a political committee is required to render to the treasurer a detailed account thereof, with specified particulars. By section 244, the treasurer is required to file with the clerk of the House of Representatives, at designated times, a statement containing the name and address of each contributor, date and amount of each contribution, and other particulars, complete as of the day next preceding the date of filing. By section 252(a ), penalties of fine and imprisonment are imposed upon any person who violates any of the provisions of the chapter; and, by subdivision (b), increased penalties are imposed upon any person who willfully violates any of those provisions.\n The first eight counts of the indictment purport to charge petitioners with substantive violations of the act, and the ninth and tenth counts, with conspiracy to violate it-four of the eight counts charging willful violations; the other four merely charging violations, that is to say, unlawful violations.\n In the Supreme Court of the District, a demurrer was interposed to the indictment on the grounds (1) that each count of the indictment failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States, and (2) that the Federal Corrupt Practices Act contravenes section 1, art. 2, of the Federal Constitution, providing for the appointment by each state of electors. The District Supreme Court sustained the demurrer upon the first ground, rendering unnecessary any ruling as to the second. Upon appeal to the District Court of Appeals the judgment was reversed. That court ruled each of the ten counts sufficient, and upheld the constitutionality of the act. 62 App.D.C. 163, 65 F.(2d) 796. The case is here on certiorari.\n First. We do not stop to describe the eight substantive counts. In the opinion of a majority of the court, there is a failure in each count to charge an offense under the \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n statute. The conspiracy counts we hold are sufficient. The ninth count charges with particularity that the petitioner Burroughs was the treasurer of a designated political committee from July 22, 1928, to and including March 16, 1929, which committee during that period accepted contributions and made expenditures for the purpose of influencing and attempting to influence the election of presidential and vice presidential electors in two states. The several amounts of certain contributions made for the committee are set forth, together with the dates when made and the name of the contributor. The count recites the duty of Burroughs under the statute to make the statements therein prescribed in respect of these contributions, and charges that both petitioners, one as treasurer and the other as chairman of the committee, 'then well knowing all the premises aforesaid,' unlawfully and feloniously did conspire together and with other persons to commit 'the four willfully committed offenses' charged against Burroughs as treasurer in the first, third, fifth, and seventh counts of the indictment, namely, willful failure to file the statements of such contributions required by section 244, the allegations of those counts being incorporated by reference as fully as if repeated. The count further alleges certain overt acts committed in pursuance of the conspiracy.\n The tenth count charges in substantially identical language a conspiracy to commit the four offenses not designated as willful, charged in the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts of the indictment, namely, unlawful failure to file the required statements, the allegations of those counts being likewise incorporated by reference as fully as if repeated.\n We are of opinion that these allegations are sufficient in each count to charge a conspiracy to violate the pertinent provisions of the act. Knowledge of the facts constituting the contemplated substantive offenses is suffi- \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n ciently alleged by the phrase, 'well knowing all the premises aforesaid.' Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432, 439\n, 440 S., 45 S.Ct. 345, 37 A.L.R. 1407. And intent unlawfully, or unlawfully and willfully, to evade performance of the statutory duty is clearly enough alleged by the statement that the accused conspired to do so. Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 204, 209\n, 39 S.Ct. 249. Moreover, quite apart from the question of their legal sufficiency to charge substantive offenses, the eight counts which are incorporated by description set forth the pertinent facts, and may be considered in determining the adequacy of the conspiracy counts. Crain v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 625, 633\n, 16 S.Ct. 952; Blitz v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 308, 317\n, 14 S.Ct. 924. These facts are narrated by the court below and need not be repeated here.\n Second. The only point of the constitutional objection necessary to be considered is that the power of appointment of presidential electors and the manner of their appointment are expressly committed by section 1, art. 2, of the Constitution to the states, and that the congressional authority is thereby limited to determining 'the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.' So narrow a view of the powers of Congress in respect of the matter is without warrant.\n The congressional act under review seeks to preserve the purity of presidential and vice presidential elections. Neither in purpose nor in effect does it interfere with the power of a state to appoint electors or the manner in which their appointment shall be made. It deals with political committees organized for the purpose of influencing elections in two or more states, and with branches or subsidiaries of national committees, and excludes from its operation state or local committees. Its operation, therefore, is confined to situations which, if not beyond the power of the state to deal with at all, are beyond its \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n power to deal with adequately. It in no sense invades any exclusive state power.\n While presidential electors are not officers or agents of the federal government (In re Green, \n134 \nU.S. 377, 379\n, 10 S.Ct. 586), they exercise federal functions under, and discharge duties in virtue of authority conferred by, the Constitution of the United States. The President is vested with the executive power of the nation. The importance of his election and the vital character of its relationship to and effect upon the welfare and safety of the whole people cannot be too strongly stated. To say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard such an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self-protection. Congress, undoubtedly, possesses that power, as it possesses every other power essential to preserve the departments and institutions of the general government from impairment or destruction, whether threatened by force or by corruption.\n In Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651\n, 4 S.Ct. 152, this court sustained the validity of section 5508 of the Revised Statutes, which denounced as an offense a conspiracy to interfere in certain specified ways with any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States; and of section 5520, which denounced as an offense any conspiracy to prevent by force, etc., any citizen lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support, etc., toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a member of Congress. The indictments there under consideration charged Yarbrough and others with conspiracies in violation of these sections. The court held, against the contention of the accused, that both sections were constitutional. It is true that, while section 5520 includes interferences with persons in \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n giving their support to the election of presidential and vice presidential electors, the indictments related only to the election of a member of Congress. The court in its opinion, however, made no distinction between the two, and the principles announced, as well as the language employed, are broad enough to include the former as well as the latter. The court said (pages 657, 658 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 152, 155):\n'That a government whose essential character is republican, whose executive head and legislative body are both elective, whose most numerous and powerful branch of the legislature is elected by the people directly, has no power by appropriate laws to secure this election from the influence of violence, of corruption, and of fraud, is a proposition so startling as to arrest attention and demand the gravest consideration.\n\n'If this government is anything more than a mere aggregation of delegated agents of other states and governments, each of which is superior to the general government, it must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends, from violence and corruption.\n\n'If it has not this power, it is left helpless before the two great natural and historical enemies of all republics, open violence and insidious corruption.'\n\n And, answering the objection that the right to vote for a member of Congress is not dependent upon the Constitution or laws of the United States, but is governed by state law, the court further said (page 663 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 152, 158):\n'If this were conceded, the importance to the general government of having the actual election-the voting for those members-free from force and fraud is not diminished by the circumstance that the qualification of the voter is determined by the law of the state where he votes. It equally affects the government; it is as indispensable to the proper discharge of the great function of legislating \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 547]\n\u00a0\n for that government, that those who are to control this legislation shall not owe their election to bribery or violence, whether the class of persons who shall vote is determined by the law of the state, or by the laws of the United States, or by their united result.'\n\n And finally (pages 666, 667 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 152, 159):\n'In a republican government, like ours, where political power is reposed in representatives of the entire body of the people, chosen at short intervals by popular elections, the temptations to control these elections by violence and by corruption is a constant source of danger . ...\n\n'If the recurrence of such acts as these prisoners stand convicted of are too common in one quarter of the country, and give omen of danger from lawless violence, the free use of money in elections, arising from the vast growth of recent wealth in other quarters, presents equal cause for anxiety.\n\n'If the government of the United States has within its constitutional domain no authority to provide against these evils,-if the very sources of power may be poisoned by corruption or controlled by violence and outrage, without legal restraint,-then, indeed, is the country in danger, and its best powers, its highest purposes, the hopes which it inspires, and the love which enshrines it, are at the mercy of the combinations of those who respect no right but brute force on the one hand, and unprincipled corruptionists on the other.'\n\n These excerpts are enough to control the present case. To pursue the subject further would be merely to repeat their substance in other and less impressive words.\n The power of Congress to protect the election of President and Vice President from corruption being clear, the choice of means to that end presents a question primarily addressed to the judgment of Congress. If it can be seen \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 548]\n\u00a0\n that the means adopted are really calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship between the means adopted, and the end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone. Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 272\n, 53 S.Ct. 181. Congress reached the conclusion that public disclosure of political contributions, together with the names of contributors and other details, would tend to prevent the corrupt use of money to affect elections. The verity of this conclusion reasonably cannot be denied. When to this is added the requirement contained in section 244, that the treasurer's statement shall include full particulars in respect of expenditures, it seems plain that the statute as a whole is calculated to discourage the making and use of contributions for purposes of corruption.\n The judgment of the court below will be affirmed in respect of the ninth and tenth counts or the indictment only, and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of the District for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting in part).\n To me it seems sufficiently clear that the trial judge rightly sustained the demurrer to the entire indictment.\n Since counts 1 to 8 fail to charge any offense under the statute, but are nevertheless incorporated by reference in the conspiracy counts (9 and 10), we must carefully consider the exact language by which the latter undertake to describe the conspiracy.\n Count 9-with italics supplied-alleges:\n And the grand jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present, that said Ada L. Burroughs and \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 549]\n\u00a0\n James Cannon, Jr., hereinafter called defendants, said James Cannon, Jr., throughout said period of time being the chairman of said political committee, continuously throughout said period of time, and while said Ada L. Burroughs was such treasurer of said political committee and said James Cannon, Jr., was chairman thereof as aforesaid, each of said defendants then well knowing all the premises aforesaid, unlawfully and feloniously did conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together, and with divers other persons to said grand jurors unknown, to commit divers, to wit, four, offenses against the United States, that is to say, the four wilfully committed offenses on the part of said Ada L. Burroughs, as treasurer of said political committee, charged against her in the first, third, fifth, and seventh counts of this indictment, the allegations of which said counts descriptive of said offenses respectively, and of the circumstances and conditions under which they were so committed, are incorporated in this count, by reference to said first, third, fifth, and seventh counts, as fully as if they were here repeated.\n Count 10-with italics supplied-alleges:\n And the grand jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do further present that said Ada L. Burroughs and James Cannon, Jr., hereinafter called defendants, said James Cannon, Jr., throughout said period of time being the chairman of said political committee, continuously throughout said period of time, and while said Ada L. Burroughs was such treasurer of said political committee and said James Cannon, Jr., was chairman thereof as aforesaid, each of said defendants then well knowing all the premises aforesaid, unlawfully and feloniously did conspire, combine, confederate, and agree together, and with divers other persons to said grand jurors unknown, \n\n[290 U.S. 534, 550]\n\u00a0\n to commit divers, to wit, four, other offenses against the United States, that is to say, the four offenses on the part of said Ada L. Burroughs, as treasurer of said political committee, charged against her in the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts of this indictment, the allegations of which said counts descriptive of said offenses respectively, and of the circumstances and conditions under which they were so committed, are incorporated in this count, by reference to said second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts, as fully as if they were here repeated.\n Interpreted with proper regard to the defendants' rights, count 9, also count 10, undertakes to describe a conspiracy to commit crimes said to be charged against Burroughs in other counts. But this court now affirms that those counts fail adequately to specify any offense whatsoever.\n Thus, we have allegations of what are called conspiracies to commit crimes which are nowhere adequately described. And I cannot think that such pleading should find toleration in any criminal action.\n An indictment ought to set out with fair certainty the charge to which the accused must respond. If crime has been committed, a fairly capable prosecuting officer can definitely describe it.\n Here, we have an example of what seems to me inordinate difficulty unnecessarily thrust upon the accused. An experienced trial judge was unable to find proper description of crime in any of the ten counts of the indictment. The Court of Appeals, with a judge of long service dissenting, ruled that every count was sufficient. This court, being divided, now declares eight of the counts bad, but holds that two are sufficient.\n Surely, such contrariety of opinion concerning allegations of the indictment indicates plainly enough that no man should be required to go to trial under it. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 241.

HERNANDEZ(1934)\nNo. 579\nArgued: March 8, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 62, 63]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. T. Hannett, of Albuquerque, N.M., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1917 petitioner purchased all the capital stock of the Springer Trading Company for $40,000 and in 1920 all that of the Roy Trading Company for $50,000. It held these shares until late in 1929 when both companies were dissolved. In that period it advanced the Springer Company sums amounting to $69,030.27, and the Roy Company $9,782.22. Nothing having been paid it on account of these advances, petitioner had an investment in the \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n former of $109,030.27 and in the latter of $59,782.22. It made consolidated returns which took into account the gains and losses of each subsidiary. Operations of the Springer Company resulted in losses in all but two of the years and those of the Roy Company in all but four. The losses of the former exceeded its gains by $118,510.53, and those of the latter by $57,127.85. In 1929, before the end of November, the subsidiaries sold all their property to outside interests. After paying debts to others, each had a balance-the Springer Company, $22.914.22, and the Roy Company, $15,106.16-which it paid petitioner on December 23. Both subsidiaries were dissolved December 30 in that year.\n Petitioner made a consolidated return for 1929 based on the results of operation and the liquidation of each subsidiary but made no deduction of losses resulting to itself from the liquidations. The return showed a tax of $20,836.20 which was duly paid. In May, 1931, petitioner filed an amended return and claimed a refund of $14,406.43. This return does not take into account profits or losses of subsidiaries in that year but deducts the losses above shown to have resulted to petitioner from its investments in them.* The commissioner rejected the claim. Petitioner brought this action in the Federal district court for New Mexico against the collector to recover the amount of its claim. A jury was waived, the court made special findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n and gave petitioner judgment as prayed. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 66 F.(2d) 236. 67 F.(2d) 236.\n The question is whether petitioner is entitled to deduct from its 1929 income any part of the losses resulting from its investments in the subsidiaries.\n The Revenue Act of 1928 and Regulations 75 made under section 141(b), 26 USCA  2141(b) govern. Section 141(a), 26 USCA  2141(a), gives to groups of affiliated corporations the privilege of making consolidated returns, in lieu of separate ones, for 1929 or in subsequent years upon condition that all members consent to the regulations prescribed prior to the return. And, in view of the many difficult problems arising in the administration of earlier provisions authorizing consolidated returns, the Congress deemed it desirable to delegate by section 141(b) the power 'to prescribe regulations legislative in character.' Senate Report No. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 15. That subsection authorizes the commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, to make such regulations as he may deem necessary in order that the tax liability of an affiliated group and of each member 'may be determined, computed, assessed, collected, and adjusted in such manner as clearly to reflect the income and to prevent avoidance of tax liability.'\n The making of the consolidated return constituted acceptance by petitioner and its subsidiaries of the regulations that had been prescribed. No question as to validity is raised. The brief substance of the regulations here involved follows:\n Article 37(a) provides: Gains or losses shall not be recognized upon a distribution during a consolidated return period by one member to another in cancelation or redemption of its stock; 'and any such distribution shall be considered an intercompany transaction.' And subdivision (b) requires that any such distribution after a \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n consolidated return period shall be treated as a sale, and directs adjustments to be made in accordance with articles 34, 35, and 36.\n Article 34(a) prescribes the basis for determination of gain or loss upon a sale by a member of stock issued by another member and 'during any part of the consolidated return period' held by the seller. Subdivision (c) applies to sales which break affiliation and which are made during the period that the selling corporation is a member of the affiliated group.\n Article 40(a) directs that intercompany accounts receivable or other obligations which are the result of intercompany transactions during a consolidated return period shall not 'during a consolidated return period' be deducted as bad debts. Subdivision (c) governs deductions after the consolidated return period on account of such transactions during the period.\n\n 1. \nIn the absence of a provision in the Act or regulations that fairly may be read to authorize it, the deduction claimed is not allowable. Brown v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 193\n, 54 S.Ct. 356; Burnet v. Houston, \n283 \nU.S. 223, 227\n, 51 S.Ct. 413. Cf. Wolford Realty Co. v. Rose, \n286 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 52 S.Ct. 568. Petitioner contends that Articles 37(b) and 34(c) cover the case. We are unable so to construe them. Article 37 relates to dissolutions. Subdivision (b) deals with distributions made after a consolidated return period. The record conclusively shows that each subsidiary handed over the balance before the dissolution was consummated and during the consolidated return period. Article 34 relates exclusively to the sale of stock. No sale of stock was involved. The parent and subsidiary corporations were the only parties. Neither subsidiary acquired stock of the other or that issued by itself. The petitioner retained all the shares of each and at the end voted dissolutions that operated to cancel them. \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n 2. Respondent, relying on Articles 37(a) and 40(a), maintains that the losses petitioner seeks to deduct arose from intercompany transactions during the consolidated return period and therefore may not be allowed.\n Article 37(a) forbids the recognition of losses upon distribution during the consolidated return period and declares that such distributions shall be considered intercompany transactions. Article 40(a) forbids during that period the deduction as bad debts of obligations which are the result of intercompany transactions. The payment of the liquidating dividends was made during the return period and was the last step leading up to the action of directors and stockholders for the dissolution of the subsidiaries. The amount handed over by the Springer Company was less than petitioner's advances to it, but the amount paid by the Roy Company was greater than the advances to it. Undoubtedly the obligation of the subsidiaries in respect of the advances would be held to be intercompany accounts receivable quite independently of the regulations.\n But a word is necessary as to the subsidiaries' obligations to the petitioner as stockholder. The record does not disclose whether the latter obtained the stock directly from the issuing corporations or purchased from others. Without regard to the manner of acquisition, the amount paid constituted investment in the subsidiaries. And, as it was the owner of all the shares of the subsidiaries, petitioner will be deemed to have directed all their activities in the unitary business and as well the steps taken for their liquidation and dissolution. They were liable to it alone for the balances remaining after payment of the amounts owed others, and it was equally entitled whether claiming as lender or shareholder. Under the circumstances, it reasonably may be held that their obligation in respect of petitioner's stock ownership resulted \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 68]\n\u00a0\n from intercompany transactions within the meaning of Article 40(a). Petitioner rightly says, as does respondent, that the amounts paid for the stock and the advances later made to the subsidiaries stand on the same footing. But its contention that the transactions out of which the claimed losses arose did not occur during the consolidated return period cannot be sustained. Petitioner is therefore not entitled to deduct them from its 1929 income.\n\n 3. \nThe allowance claimed would permit petitioner twice to use the subsidiaries' losses for the reduction of its taxable income. By means of the consolidated returns in earlier years it was enabled to deduct them. And now it claims for 1929 deductions for diminution of assets resulting from the same losses. If allowed, this would be the practical equivalent of double deduction. In the absence of a provision of the Act definitely requiring it, a purpose so opposed to precedent and equality of treatment of taxpayers will not be attributed to lawmakers. Cf. Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Co., \n287 \nU.S. 544, 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 227. United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 301\n, 47 S.Ct. 608. There is nothing in the Act that purports to authorize double deduction of losses or in the regulations to suggest that the commissioner construed any of its provisions to empower him to prescribe a regulation that would permit consolidated returns to be made on the basis now claimed by petitioner.\n In Remington Rand, Inc., v. Commissioner, 33 F.(2d) 77, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held a subsidiary company's accumulated earnings on stock sold to a parent company could not be added to the cost of the stock in determining taxable gain arising on the latter's sale to outsiders. In United Publishers' Corporation v. Anderson, 42 F.(2d) 781, a District Court in the same circuit, deeming the Remington Rand Case applicable, held that a parent corporation filing consolidated returns showing losses of a subsidiary during earlier years could nevertheless deduct loss on the sale of the subsidiary's stock. \n\n[292 U.S. 62, 69]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner insists that same principle governs both decisions and that therefore the deduction should be allowed. But the analogy is not good. Where all the members gain, total taxable income is the same on a consolidated return as upon separate ones. But where as in the case before us the subsidiaries lose and the parent gains, the losses of the former go in reduction of the taxable income of the latter. Considerations that justify inclusion of the profits made by all the members do not support the double deduction claimed.\n The weight of authority is against petitioner's contention. Burnet v. Riggs Nat. Bank (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 980; Commissioner v. Apartment Corp. (C. C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 3; Summerfield Co. v. Commissioner, 29 B.T.A. 77; National Casket Co. v. Commissioner, 29 B.T.A. 139. No decision other than that of the district court in United Publishers' Corporation v. Anderson, supra, gives any support to its claim. Cf. Burnet v. Imperial Elevator Co. (C.C.A .) 66 F.(2d) 643. McLaughlin v. Pacific Lumber Co. (C.C.A.) 66 F.(2d) 895.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Operating losses claimed and deducted prior to Springer Co. Roy Co.

Ray Craig, of Norwalk, Ohio, and H. C. Laughlin and Walter A. Eversman, both of Toledo, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, \n290 \nU.S. 614\n, 54 S.Ct. 73, 78 L.Ed. --. Whether the injunction granted in this cause by the federal court for northern Ohio stays a judgment of ouster rendered by the Court of Appeals of the state in violation of Judicial Code  265 (28 USCA  379) is the main question requiring decision. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n In May, 1925, the Ohio Electric Power Company acquired the electric light and heating system then serv- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 433]\n\u00a0\n ing a part of the residents of the city of Norwalk, Ohio; and by a duly recorded mortgage deed of trust, transferred the property to a trustee to secure an issue of bonds. In March, 1926, the city council passed a resolution in terms requiring the Power Company to remove from the streets, alleys and other public places within 30 days, its poles, wires and other electric equipment. These had been erected and were being maintained pursuant to an ordinance of the city, dated October 7, 1890. The city claimed that the Power Company had no right so to occupy the streets, alleys and public places, because the franchise granted by the ordinance was for a limited term and that term had expired without extension or renewal. The Power Company refused to comply with the city's demand, claiming that it had, under legislation of the state, acquired a perpetual franchise.\n In May, 1926, the state brought, in the Court of Appeals of Ohio, at the relation of the prosecuting attorney for Huron county, an action in quo warranto against the Power Company to oust it from such use of the streets, alleys, and public places. That court, holding that the franchise granted had expired, entered a judgment of ouster. State ex rel. Martin v. Ohio Electric Power Co., 35 Ohio App. 481, 172 N.E. 615; and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. Ohio Electric Power Co. v. State ex rel. Martin, 121 Ohio St. 235, 167 N.E. 877. The action had been instituted at the request, and had been prosecuted with the aid, of the city; but it was not a party thereto. The mortgage given by the Power Company and the bonds thereby secured were then (and still are) outstanding. But the state did not make the trustee a party respondent; and the trustee did not intervene, or seek to intervene, in the action. Neither the state nor the Power Company made mention of the existence of the mortgage either in its plead- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 434]\n\u00a0\n ings or otherwise. Whether the state, the relator, or the city knew of the mortgage, and whether the trustee knew of the action in quo warranto, does not appear.\n Before any step had been taken by the state to enforce the judgment of ouster, the then trustee under the mortgage deed of trust, a citizen and resident of New York, brought this suit in the federal district court for northern Ohio. The Chase National Bank, likewise a citizen and resident of New York, has since been substituted as trustee and plaintiff. The city of Norwalk alone was made defendant. The bill set forth in addition to the facts stated above, that the plaintiff as such trustee is entitled to the continued use of the poles, wires, and electrical equipment by the Power Company; that the judgment of ouster has not yet been executed; that the Power Company is still serving the Norwalk public; that the city is threatening to destroy, or forcibly remove, the poles, wires, and equipment from the streets, alleys, and public places and to prevent the operation of the system or to seek to have enforced the judgment of ouster; and that such acts would result in irreparable injury to the plaintiff.\n The District Court held that the plaintiff has as mortgagee a good and valid lien upon the poles, wires, and electrical equipment, and the rights and franchises to use the streets, alleys, and public places therefor; that 'for the purpose of protecting, preserving and enforcing the lien of the mortgage' the Power Company 'is and was at the time of the filing of the bill of complaint herein the owner'; that these rights were granted 'in perpetuity as against any right or power of the City of Norwalk with reference thereto ...'; and that the 'franchises, rights and physical properties will be destroyed and rendered worthless' unless a permanent injunction issues. The decree enjoined the city, its officers, agents, and employees, 'and all persons whomsoever to whom notice of this order shall come,' from destroying, or interfering with the con- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n tinued operation by the Power Company of, the plant and distribution system; 'from taking any steps or action of any kind whatever to cause the enforcement or carrying out by the Sheriff of Huron County, Ohio, ... of the judgment of ouster'; and 'from applying to any of the courts of the State of Ohio for any writ, process or order of any kind whatever for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out said judgment of ouster.' The injunction was granted to continue only as long as the plaintiff or its successor, or holders of bonds under the mortgage, should have any interest in or lien upon the properties and franchises of the Power Company in the city of Norwalk.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals did not pass upon the question whether the plaintiff has, as mortgagee, an interest in or lien upon the alleged property and rights; nor upon the question whether the Power Company retains for the protection of the mortgagee, an existing right to use the streets, alleys, and public places as claimed; nor specifically upon the question whether the franchises granted had expired. It held, one judge dissenting, that, although the District Court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, that court ws not justified in granting an injunction; and it reversed the decree with directions to dismiss the bill, 63 F.(2d) 911, for the following reasons:\n\n\n (a)\n That the proceedings in the District Court came within the inhibitions of Judicial Code,  265 (28 USCA  379) in that the effect of the decree was to stay the quo warranto proceeding in the state courts.\n\n\n (b)\n That the case does not fall within the exceptions which permit a federal court to interfere with the judgment of a state court, because there was no showing that the judgment in the action in quo warranto was void for lack of jurisdiction, or was based upon fraud or upon such accident or mistake as made its enforcement unconscionable. \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 436]\n\u00a0\n (c) That because the plaintiff has not shown that it lacked knowledge of the action in quo warranto, or that it could not have intervened therein as mortgagee, and have asserted therein the claim which it presents now as the basis of the relief sought, it has failed to make the necessary showing of diligence.\n There was error in the decree entered by the District Court; but the Circuit Court of Appeals was not justified in ordering that the bill be dismissed.\n First. Independently of the prohibition of Judicial Code,  265, the decree entered by the District Court was clearly erroneous in so far as it enjoined 'all persons to whom notice of the order of injunction should come from taking any steps or action of any kind to cause the enforcement of the ouster in the state court.' The city alone was named as defendant. No person other than the city was served with process. None came otherwise before the court. The prayer of the bill sought relief solely against the city and 'its officers, officials, agents, employees and representatives.' 2 It is true that persons not technically agents or employees may be specifically enjoined from knowingly aiding a defendant in performing a prohibited act if their relation is that of associate or confederate. Since such persons are legally identified with the defendant and privy to his contempt, the privi- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n sion merely makes explicit as to them that which the law already implies. See Ex parte Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S.Ct. 658. But by extending the injunction to 'all persons to whom notice of the injunction should come,' the District Court assumed to make punishable as a contempt the conduct of persons who act independently and whose rights have not been adjudged according to law. \n3\n See Alemite Mfg. Co. v. Staff (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 832. Under the clause inserted in the decree, officials of the state of Ohio might be proceeded against for contempt, if they should apply to the state court to enforce its judgment, although acting solely in the performance of their official duty. To subject them to such peril violates established principles of equity jurisdiction and procedure. Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 107, 117\n, 17 S.Ct. 262; Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 \nU.S. 229, 234\n, 38 S.Ct. 65, L.R.A. 1918C, 497, Ann.Cas. 1918B, 461.4 Those principles require that the clause be limited to confederates or associates of the defendant.\n Second. On the other hand, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was clearly erroneous in so far as it refused to enjoin the 'city and its agents from forcibly removing the wires and poles without state warrant.' The trustee claimed that it had a valid mortgage lien upon the poles, wires, and electrical equipment, and upon the right and franchise in perpetuity to use them on the streets, alleys, and public places; and the bill alleged that removal by the city of the poles and wires would result in irreparable injury to the trustee. Neither the trustee nor the city had been a party, or privy, to the litigation in the state courts. These courts did not purport to pass \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n upon the validity of the trustee's claim; and in no state court was that claim in litigation. However broad the scope of the prohibition prescribed by Judicial Code  265 (28 USCA  379), it could not preclude the federal court from protecting the trustee's alleged property from wanton destruction by one not a party or privy to the judgment of ouster.\n The contention is that in essence this 'is a suit by a mortgagee to obtain a readjudication of the law and facts adjudicated by a state court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding to which the mortgagor was a party'; and that, since the controlling question is one of the construction and application of statutes of Ohio, a federal court would, in any event, follow the decision of the highest court of the state. It is true that, in the absence of special circumstances, federal courts consider themselves bound by the construction theretofore given by the highest court of a state to its statutes. But, under well settled principles of jurisdiction, governing all courts, a decree against a mortgagor with respect to property does not bind a mortgagee whose interest was acquired before the commencement of the suit, unless he was made a party to the proceedings. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 \nU.S. 100, 122\n, 33 S.Ct. 967.5 For in every case where a mortgage was given before the litigation against the mortgagor was instituted, the mortgagee is entitled to have a decision determining his rights rendered on the basis of the facts and considerations adduced by him. Obviously, the facts and considerations affecting the trustee's rights may be differ- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 439]\n\u00a0\n ent from those presented to the state court on behalf of the Power Company. Because there is diversity of citizenship, the trustee under the mortgage is entitled to have the adjudication of his alleged rights made in the federal court. Compare Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469. As a decree enjoining the city 'from removing the wires and poles without state warrant' would not interfere with the proceedings in the state court, that part of the injunction was not within the prohibition of Judicial Code  265. Louisville Trust Co. v. Cincinnati (C.C.A.) 76 F. 296, 300, 317.\n Third. The contention that the decree violates Judicial Code  265, is rested mainly upon the clause which enjoins the city, its officers and attorneys 'from taking any steps or action of any kind whatever to cause the enforcement or carrying out by the sheriff of Huron County, Ohio, or any of his deputies, or by any other officer of any of the courts in the State of Ohio of the judgment of ouster' and 'from applying to any of the courts of the State of Ohio for any writ or process of any kind whatever for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out said judgment of ouster.'\n To enjoin the city from taking steps to enforce the judgment of ouster obviously does not stay that judgment. The city was not, and could not have been a party to the action in quo warranto.6 The city's argu- \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 440]\n\u00a0\n ment is that the decree can have no effect unless it acts directly upon the Court of Appeals of Huron County itself, and upon the state of Ohio, which was the moving party in the quo warranto proceeding, and that hence, this action is an attempt to do so; that 'the incidental effect of the decree upon the possible unauthorized action of the city officials is too negligible to be given consideration in determining its character'; and that the real purpose for which the decree was sought is to stay the proceeding in the state court. It may be assumed that in seeking an injunction from the federal court, the trustee's purpose-its hope-was to induce the officials of the state of Ohio to refrain from enforcing the judgment of ouster until adjudication of the trustee's rights should have been had in the federal court. That purpose or hope is not of legal significance in this connection. Full control of the ouster proceeding rests with the law officers of the state, subject to the control of the state court. See Thompson v. Watson, 48 Ohio St. 552, 31 N.E. 742. The injunction, when limited as we hold it must be, is directed only to the city, its attorneys, agents, and confederates. It prohibits them from attempting to induce the state to enforce the judgment of ouster. So limited, the decree will leave the state and the relator free to act; and the injunction will not stay the operation of the judgment.\n Fourth. The contention is also made that the Circuit Court of Appeals properly ordered the bill dismissed because the trustee failed to allege, or prove, that it did not have knowledge of the proceeding in the state court or that it could not have intervened therein, as mortgagee, and asserted there the claims that it now makes as the basis of the relief sought. Where equitable relief is sought on the ground that a judgment entered upon proper service in a court of competent jurisdiction was obtained \n\n[291 U.S. 431, 441]\n\u00a0\n through fraud or mistake, or is being used fraudulently, such a showing of diligence is ordinarily required. Crim v. Handley, \n94 U.S. 652\n; Brown v. Buena Vista County, \n95 U.S. 157\n; Knox County v. Harshman, \n133 \nU.S. 152\n, 10 S.Ct. 257; Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589\n, 12 S.Ct. 62.7 Compare Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175\n, 41 S.Ct. 93. But here the injunction is sought on the ground that the judgment is inoperative as against the plaintiff because it was neither party nor privy thereto. Compare Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469; Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S.Ct. 255; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 \nU.S. 100\n, 33 S.Ct. 967.8 The law does not impose upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger. Whether under the Ohio practice it would have been possible for the trustee to intervene, we have no occasion to determine. \n9\n Unless duly summoned to appear in a legal proceeding, a person not a privy may rest assured that a judgment recovered therein will not affect his legal rights.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed. As it did not pass upon the merits of the trustee's claim, the cause is remanded to that court for further proceeding in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 265.

CITY OF GREENWOOD, MISS.(1934)\nNo. 428\nArgued: February 6, 1934Decided: March 12, 1934\n\n\n\n On Appeal from Supreme Court of Mississippi. \n\n[291 U.S. 584, 585]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward W.

Lauderdale, of Jackson, Miss., and A. H. Bell, W. S. Vardaman, Jr., and J. A. Tyson, all of Greenwood, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Greenwood, Miss., laid by ordinance, in 1931 and in 1932, a tax 'upon every person engaged in the business of buying or selling cotton for himself' within the city. In each year a tax of $50 was assessed to Chassaniol. He paid it under protest; and duly applied for refund to the city council, claiming that the tax was illegal, and that the ordinances and the statutes (Laws Miss. 1930, c. 88,  55, 56, 58; Laws Miss. 1932, c. 89,  61, 62, 64) authorizing it as construed and applied were void, because they violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). The city council refused the refund. Its action in denying this claim under the Constitution was sustained by both the circuit court of Leflore county and by the Supreme Court of the state. 166 Miss. 848, 148 So. 781, 786. Whether they erred in so holding is the only question presented for decision by this appeal.\n Greenwood is a concentration point for long staple cotton and an active market for its purchase and sale. All of the cotton there dealt in is grown and ginned in Mississippi. It reaches the Greenwood warehouses, about 70 per cent. by rail, the rest by automobile, truck, or wagon. There, it is compressed substantially as described in Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17\n, 54 S.Ct. 267. \n\n[291 U.S. 584, 586]\n\u00a0\n Purchases and sales are made upon the market by transfer and delivery of receipts issued by the local warehouses under the United States Warehouse Act (7 USCA  241 et seq.). The prices are governed largely by transactions on the cotton exchanges of New York, Chicago, New Orleans, and Liverpool.\n There are at Greenwood about 25 cotton buyers, each of whom, like Chassaniol, purchases and sells cotton for himself. The buyer becomes the absolute owner. He makes the profit or bears the loss. But when he buys he customarily has in hand and in mind orders or contracts for that particular grade, for immediate or future delivery in other states or countries to the extent of about 90 per cent., on the average, of all cotton purchased by him. The remaining 10 per cent. he buys because, as often happens, growers of cotton refuse to sell less than their whole lot; and the lot may include a quantity greater than, or some bales of a grade different from, that for which the buyer has orders or contracts. The supluses so bought are called 'overs.' Sometimes the 'over' is held by the buyer until he gets an order or contract on which it can be placed. Sometimes the 'over' is sold to another buyer at Greenwood. And some of the cotton bought as an 'over' changes ownership several times within the state. But eventually the 'overs,' like the rest of the cotton, are shipped in interstate or foreign commerce.\n Chassaniol contends that all the cotton is in interstate or foreign commerce from the moment it leaves the gin for Greenwood, or at least from the moment it is purchased at Greenwood by the buyer. The argument is that already at that time the cotton is destined for ultimate shipment to some other state or country; and that to tax the occupation of the cotton buyer burdens interstate commerce, since the buyer at Greenwood is the instrumentality by which the interstate transaction is initiated. The business involved is substantially like that described in \n\n[291 U.S. 584, 587]\n\u00a0\n Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean; and the rule there declared must govern here. Ginning cotton, transporting it to Greenwood, and warehousing, buying, and compressing it there, are each, like the growing of it, steps in preparation for the sale and shipment in interstate or foreign commerce. But each step prior to the sale and shipment is a transaction local to Mississippi, a transaction in intrastate commerce. Hence those engaged in performing any such local function may be subjected to an occupation tax, just as the property used, or processed, by them may be subjected to a property tax.\n There is nothing in Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, or in Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S.Ct. 244, inconsistent with this conclusion. The regulations involved in those cases were found to impose a direct burden upon interstate commerce itself. Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229, is also in harmony with the rule here applied. See Minnesota v.

Schnader, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees. \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Pennsylvania inheritance tax law imposes a tax upon the transfer by will or intestate laws of personal property within the commonwealth when the decedent is a nonresident at the time of his death. \n1\n Thomas B. Clarke, a resident of New York, loaned paintings to a museum in Pennsylvania and died testate while they were on exhibition there. His will was admitted to probate in New York, and letters testamentary issued to appellant to which, as trustee, the residuary clause transferred the pictures. The appellees, acting respectively as Attorney General and secretary of revenue of Pennsylvania, proceeded to appraise and assess the pictures for the purpose of collecting the inheritance tax.\n Appellant, maintaining that when the owner died the paintings had no actual situs within Pennsylvania because only temporarily there, brought this suit to enjoin enforcement on the ground that, if the statute be construed to tax the transfer by the death of the nonresident owner, it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the transfer cannot be subjected to taxes imposed by more than one state ( Frick v. \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania, \n268 U.S. 473\n, 488-492, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316; Safe Deposit & T.

The New York tax commission as amicus curiae filed briefs below and also in this court supporting the claim that the transfer is subject to the New York tax.\n The District Court, consisting of three judges, section 266, Jud. Code (28 USCA  380) dismissed the suit on the ground that appellant had an adequate remedy at law. This court reversed and remanded the case, with instructions to reinstate the bill and proceed to a hearing upon the merits. City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24\n, 54 S.Ct. 259. Then the case was submitted and tried on the facts alleged in the bill and answer and additional ones that were stipulated by the parties. Upon the circumstances detailed in its findings, the court concluded that 79 portraits belonging to Clarke that were included in the collection on exhibition in the Pennsylvania museum at the time of his death then had an actual situs in that state, and held the transfer subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax.\n The material substance of the findings follows:\n In March, 1928, Clarke, at the request of the director of the Pennsylvania museum, loaned to it the 79 pictures, together with 85 others owned by a corporation of which he was sole stockholder. At the time of the loan, they were, and long had been kept, in New York City; 5 were at his residence, 10 were on exhibition, and the remaining 64 were in storage. When the pictures were sent to Pennsylvania, Clarke surrendered his lease for the storage space, and thereafter did nothing to secure another place in which to put them. But suitable space was always readily available in New York. \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n The arrangement with the museum was oral; no consideration was to be paid; and it was understood that at any time on Clarke's request the pictures would be returned to him. In the spring of 1929, Clarke wrote the director, at the latter's solicitation, that he would sell the entire collection at a stated price to any one who would present it to the museum; it being understood that he would allow the pictures to remain at the museum for a reasonable time for the director to find such a donor. In May, 1930, he stated that this arrangement would terminate June 17, 1930. But at the director's request he permitted the pictures to remain, upon the understanding that, whenever he so requested, they would be returned to him in New York. Thereafter, he was willing to sell the collection as a whole for presentation to the Pennsylvania museum or to a substantially similar institution.\n Clarke made no definite plans or request for the return to New York of the paintings. None was ever removed from the museum except 4, which, at his request, were sent to Virginia in April, 1929, for exhibition and were returned in May. When he died, January 18, 1931, all the paintings were at the museum.\n The museum was not conducted for profit. It secured through voluntary loans from nonresidents a substantial portion of the works of art which it displayed. None of these was regarded or intended as a permanent loan. It is customary for public museums to secure pictures for exhibition in this manner. The period elapsing until Clarke's death was shorter than the usual period of such loans.\n The power to regulate the transmission, administration, and distribution of tangible personal property rests exclusively in the state in which the property has an actual situs, regardless of the domicile of the owner. If at the time of his death the actual situs of Clarke's pictures was in Pennsylvania, they were wholly under the jurisdiction \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n of that state. The fact that, being a resident of New York, he, by will probated in that state, disposed of the pictures, detracted nothing from the exclusive jurisdiction of Pennsylvania to tax the transfer effected by his death. New York laws had no bearing other than that attributable to their implied adoption by Pennsylvania. Assuming actual situs in Pennsylvania, the paintings there on exhibition when the owner died are not to be distinguished, so far as concerns the imposition of the inheritance tax, from land located within that state. Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, pages 489-493 of 268 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 603.\n We regard as unimportant and negligible Clarke's suggestions that the pictures be returned because on each occasion he acceded to opposing suggestions of the director and continued his consent that they remain temporarily at the museum subject to his orders. Mere floating intention that some time in the future the pictures would be returned to New York was not sufficient to retain them within the jurisdiction of that state and to keep them without the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. Cf. Story, Conflict of Laws (8th Ed.)  46. And obviously without weight are the facts that Clarke made the loan without pay, gave up the warehouse in which he had kept some of the pictures, and died without providing a place for them in New York.\n The significant features of the transaction are these: Prior to the loan, the pictures that went to make up the collection had an actual situs in New York. The loan was not made for a short and definite period, and it was subject to the right of the owner to have the pictures returned to New York at any time. He did not call for their return, but with his consent they were kept in Pennsylvania and there exhibited until he died two years and ten months after the loan. With the exception of the 4 pictures temporarily sent to Virginia, none was taken from Pennsylvania. For nearly two years next preced- \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n ing his death Clarke was willing-indeed, he authorized the director-to sell the collection to any one who would buy at the specified price and donate them to the Pennsylvania museum. And during the last six months of his life he was willing to sell to any purchaser that would give them to any institution similar to the Pennsylvania museum. It does not appear that Clarke ever intended to have the pictures returned to New York at any definite date or upon the happening of any event or at all. Until his death he permitted the pictures to be kept and used in the Pennsylvania museum merely subject to his right at any time to order them taken to New York or elsewhere.\n In respect of situs for taxation, the collection of portraits is quite unlike vessels and railway rolling stock that in fulfilling the purpose for which they are created move from place to place and into different states. Cf. Hays v. Pacific Mail Steamship Company, 17 How. 596, 599; Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158, 161\n, 54 S.Ct. 152. Before the loan was made, the pictures had an actual situs in New York, so as to be within the taxing power of that state, though it cannot be said that they were there permanently located in the sense of that phrase when used in respect of land, buildings, or other items of fixed real property. The location of the portraits in Pennsylvania was not merely transient, transitory, or temporary, but it was fixed in an established abiding place in which they remained for a long time. Undoubtedly, they became subject to the taxing power of the state. Cf. Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622, 632\n, 633 S., 5 S.Ct. 1091; Pittsburgh, etc., Coal Co. v.

By sending them into Pennsylvania and by his omission to have them returned to New York and his lack of definite intention ever so to do, Clarke failed to \n\n[293 U.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n maintain an actual situs in New York and created one for them in Pennsylvania.

SCHNADER(1934)\nNo. 84\nArgued: November 9, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Drinker, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Wm. A. Schnader, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, by a bill filed in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania, sought to enjoin the appellees, who are officials of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, from attempting to impose and collect an inheritance tax. Diversity of citizenship and an amount in controversy exceeding, exclusive of interest, $3,000, were averred. The bill sets forth that Thomas B. Clarke, a citizen and resident of the state of New York, died there in 1931 leaving a will under which appellant qualified as executor; that at and before the time of Clarke's death there was on exhibition in Pennsylvania a collection of paintings owned by him, of the estimated market value at the date of his death of $714,750; that these paintings had been loaned \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n to the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, a nonprofit corporation, so that they might be exhibited in the museum of that institution; that the loan was negotiated orally and was for an indeterminate period, but the pictures were to be returned to Clarke at any time upon his request. The bill then quotes he act of Assembly of Pennsylvania1 whereby a transfer inheritance tax of a specified percentage of value is laid upon transfers, by will or the intestate laws, or property located within the commonwealth, from a decedent not a resident of the commonwealth at the time of his death; describes the procedure for the collection of the tax, namely, that the department of revenue, whenever occasion may require, shall appoint an appraiser to appraise the value of the property, if subject to tax; appraisement shall be made after notice to the interested parties; the appraiser shall report his valuation in writing to the department of revenue; whereupon that department is required to give notice to all interested parties, and any person not satisfied with the appraisement may appeal to the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, which may determine all questions of valuation and the liability of the appraised estate for the tax. The bill recites the appointment of an appraiser who duly notified the appellant of the proposed date of his appraisement; the making of a return, under protest, pursuant to instructions of the appellee Schnader, enumerating as property within the commonwealth at the decedent's death the seventy-nine portraits in question, and denying taxable situs or taxability of the property in Pennsylvania; a hearing by the appraiser, who referred the question of taxability to the department of justice, of which the appellee Schnader is the head, and, pending a decision by him, postponed the appraisement indefinitely; and re- \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n peated requests for an immediate determination of tax liability in response to which the appellee Schnader orally advised the appellant its claim of nontaxability in Pennsylvania would be denied. The bill charges that, if the statute be construed to impose an inheritance tax upon the paintings merely because they were temporarily within the commonwealth at the time of the decedent's death, it is unconstitutional as depriving the appellant of property without due process and denying equal protection of the laws, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment; and, if the statute be construed as not applying to the property, the threatened appraisal, assessment, and collection by the defendants will unconstitutionally deprive the appellant of property without due process and deny it equal protection. It further charges that the threat of appraisement, assessment, and collection, and the unlawful failure and refusal of the appellee Metzger to issue a waiver of taxes on behalf of the commonwealth, have caused and are causing irreparable injury by interfering with the administration of the estate in the Surrogate's Court of New York, preventing distribution, compelling the executor to maintain large cash reserves at a low rate of interest to cover a possible Pennsylvania tax and costs of litigation, and also that the threatened tax constitutes a possible lien and a cloud upon the title of the plaintiff, interfering with the sale of the paintings as directed by the will. The bill avers the absence of any adequate remedy at law.\n A temporary injunction was issued, an answer was filed admitting the facts stated, and a statutory court of three judges was convened and heard the case on the pleadings and an agreed statement which is immaterial to the questions presented.\n The answer asserted, and the court found, that the appellant had an adequate remedy at law, as it could appeal from the appraisement, when made, to the Dauphin \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n county court, which has jurisdiction to pass on both the amount of the tax and the legality of its imposition. The bill was therefore dismissed for want of equity.\n\n 1. \nIt is conceded that neither the statutes of Pennsylvania nor the decisions of its courts permit an action at law for the recovery of a tax paid under protest. If that procedure were permissible in the state courts, the appellant could pursue the same remedy in a federal court; there being the requisite diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy. Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. Under the state law, the only remedy afforded one who has paid a tax is an application for refund to the board of finance and revenue, an administrative body; but the action upon the claim is final and no court may review or set aside the board's decision. \n2\n The District Court, however, was of opinion that the taxpayer's right of appeal from the appraisal to the court of common pleas of Dauphin county constituted such a remedy at law as ousted the jurisdiction of a federal court of equity. The act of Assembly3 requires the appointment of an appraiser whose duty is to report his appraisement in writing to the department of revenue, which must then give immediate notice to all parties interested, and continues: 'Any person not satisfied with the appraisement ... may appeal within thirty days to the court of common pleas of Dauphin County, on paying or giving security to pay all costs together with whatever tax shall be fixed by the court. Upon such appeal, the court may determine all questions of valuation, and the liability of the appraised estate for such tax, subject to the right of appeal to the Supreme or Superior Court.' \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n The appeal must be entered in a state court specifically designated by the statute, and is thus not an ordinary action at law, but a statutory proceeding. The commonwealth has conditioned the right to implead it, upon resort to a forum of its choice. The taxpayer cannot, therefore, though a nonresident, appeal from the appraisement to a federal court. Moreover, in such cases, upon the perfecting of an appeal, the commonwealth becomes the adverse party to the litigation in the common pleas court (Comm. v. Taylor, 29A Dauph. Co. Rep. (Pa.) 102; Comm. v. Taylor, 32 Dauph. Co. Rep. (Pa.) 207); and this fact would prevent removal of the case from the Dauphin county court to a federal court (Judicial Code,  24(1), as amended; 28 U. S.C.  41(1), 28 USCA  41(1); Judicial Code,  28, as amended; 28 U.S.C.  71, 28 USCA  71), for the state is not a citizen within the purview of these statutes which define the jurisdiction of the federal courts and permit a removal to them (Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 \nU.S. 430\n, 6 S.Ct. 799; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Alabama, \n155 \nU.S. 482\n, 15 S.Ct. 192; Arkansas v. Kansas & Texas Coal Co., \n183 \nU.S. 185\n, 22 S.Ct. 47), nor is the controversy one arising under the laws of the United States (Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 \nU.S. 454\n, 14 S.Ct. 654; Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Nebraska (C. C.A.) 251 F. 279). As the statutory remedy, if it be treated as an action at law, would lie only in the state court and is not cognizable by the federal courts, either as an original action or by removal, its existence cannot oust federal equity jurisdiction. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 516\n, 18 S.Ct. 418; Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. Co. v. Osborne, \n265 \nU.S. 14, 16\n, 44 S.Ct. 431; Risty v. Chicago, R.I. & Pac. Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378, 388\n, 46 S.Ct. 236; Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, page 526 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 217.\n\n 2. \nSince the Dauphin county court is empowered, upon appeal from the action of the appraiser, to determine all questions, including both valuation and liability for the tax, the contention is made that its function is at \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n least in part administrative, and a suit for injunction may not be entertained by a federal court prior to the decision of the state court. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210\n, 29 S.Ct. 67; Porter v. Investors Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461\n, 52 S.Ct. 617. The statutes under consideration in those cases delegated legislative power of regulation to an administrative body and vested a revisory power in a court. As has repeatedly been held, the action of the court in such a matter is legislative rather than judicial, so that one who has not pursued the legislative process to a conclusion cannot turn to a court of equity for relief from a regulatory order which is not the final word of the constituted state authority. But other decisions make it clear that, while the action of the appraiser in a case like the present is purely administrative, the function of the court upon appeal is judicial in character, if, when the case is brought into the court, the commonwealth becomes plaintiff and the taxpayer defendant, and the action is tried as an ordinary action, resulting in a judgment which is final and binding on the parties, subject only to appeal to a higher state court, as permitted by the act. This renders the proceeding judicial, and gives it the character of a suit or action at law.\n In Mississippi & R. River Boom Company v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, it appeared that the state law authorized the Boom Company to exercise the right of eminent domain. The statutes required an application to a court for the appointment of commissioners to appraise the value of the land to be taken. Should the award of the commissioners prove unsatisfactory to the company or to the landowner, an appeal lay to the district court, where the cause was to be entered by the clerk as a case upon the docket, the owner of the land being designated plaintiff and the corporation seeking condemnation defendant. The act required the court to proceed to 'hear and determine said case in the same \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n manner as other cases are heard and determined in said court.' Of this procedure it was said (page 406 of 98 U.S.):\n'The proceeding in the present cese before the commissioners appointed to appraise the land was in the nature of an inquest to ascertain its value, and not a suit at law in the ordinary sense of those terms. But when it was transferred to the District Court by appeal from the award of the commissioners, it took, under the statute of the State, the form of a suit at law, and was thenceforth subject to its ordinary rules and incidents. The point in issue was the compensation to be made to the owner of the land; in other words, the value of the property taken. No other question was open to contestation in the District Court.'\n\n To the same effect see Searl v. School District No. 2, \n124 \nU.S. 197\n, 8 S.Ct. 460; Mason City R.R. Co. v. Boynton, \n204 \nU.S. 570\n, 27 S.Ct. 321.\n In Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co., \n133 \nU.S. 473\n, 10 S.Ct. 399, the question was as to a proceeding for the collection of a claim against the county. The statute directed that any person having a claim against a county should file it with the county auditor, who should present it to the board of commissioners, and they were required to examine the claim and allow it in whole or in part. No court was to have original jurisdiction of any claim against a county, but, if the claimant felt aggrieved by the decision of the commissioners, he might appeal to the circuit court of the county. Thereupon the auditor was to make a transcript of the proceedings before the board and deliver it to the clerk of the court. The appeal was to be docketed like other cases pending in the court, heard, and tried as an original cause. This court said (page 486 of 133 U.S., 10 S.Ct. 399, 403) that, although the proceedings of the county commissioners are in some respects assimilated to proceedings before a court, and the commissioners' decision, if not appealed from, is not \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n subject to collateral attack, yet the proceedings are in the nature not of a trial inter partes, but of an allowance of disallowance, by officers of the county, of a claim against it. The court added that 'the trial in the circuit court of the county was 'the trial' of the case, at any time before which it might be removed into the circuit court of the United States. ...'\n Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529\n, 13 S.Ct. 695, involved procedure for the collection of county bonds. State legislation declared that a county could not be sued or proceeded against in any court except as in the act provided. Demands against the county were to be presented to the county court for allowance or rejection. From the order of that court appeals were allowed as provided by law. If in any such appeal the judgment of the county court was reversed, the reversal was to be certified by the superior court to the county court which was required to enter it as its own judgment. This court said (page 532 of 148 U.S., 13 S.Ct. 695, 697):\n'If, however, the presentation of a demand against the county, duly verified according to law, to the county court thereof, 'for allowance or rejection,' is not the beginning of a suit, or does not involve a trial inter partes, it is then only a preliminary proceeding to a suit or controversy which, by the appeal of either side, is or may be carried to an appellate court, before which there is an actual trial between the parties interested. The right to maintain this revisory trial in the state court ... will be sufficient to maintain a like suit by original process in a federal court where the requisite diverse citizenship exists.'\n\n In Smith v. Douglas County, Neb. (C.C.A.) 254 F. 244, it appeared that a Nebraska statute imposed a tax on inheritances for the benefit of the county of the decedent's residence, at a stipulated rate upon the appraised value of the property. The method of levying the tax was that the county judge appointed an appraiser to report the valuation to the \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n judge, who then fixed the value and the amount of tax and gave notice to all interested parties. Any one dissatisfied with the judge's finding might appeal within sixty days to the county court upon filing bond to cover costs and the tax which might be fixed by the court. The statute ( Rev. St. Nob. 1913,  6634) provided that county ourts should have jurisdiction 'to hear and determine all questions in relation to all taxes arising under this article.' It will be noted how closely the procedure resembles that prescribed with respect to the tax in controversy. It was held that the proceeding was ex parte until it reached the county court; but thereafter became a controversy inter partes, and the court's action in determining all questions in relation to the tax was not merely administrative, but judicial.\n If the Dauphin county court were by the act of Assembly granted only the right to revise the valuation of the appraiser and precluded from considering any other question, its proceedings would be purely administrative, and the contention that the appellant had failed to pursue to the end its administrative remedy would be sound (Upshur County v. Rich, \n135 \nU.S. 467\n, 10 S.Ct. 651) at all events where the valuation is a subject of controversy.\n The court below relied upon Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Salm, \n258 \nU.S. 122\n, 42 S.Ct. 207, where a bill to enjoin collection of a state tax was held to lack equity. That case, is, however, distinguished by the fact that before resorting to any court the taxpayer could have appealed to the board of review to correct the assessment of which he complained, and the record failed to show that he had pursued the administrative remedy so afforded him (page 125 of 258 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 207, 208).\n The acts of Assembly of Pennsylvania direct the department of revenue to collect and the Attorney General to bring suit for the amount of the tax, if it is not paid within one year of assessment. If, therefore, the appel- \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n lant should omit to take an appeal to the Dauphin county common pleas court, the assessment would become final and the appellant liable to suit for the amount of the tax. 4 As the commonwealth is the plaintiff in the action, the cause could not be removed for reasons already stated.\n We are of opinion that upon the making of the appraisement the administrative procedure is at an end and the appellant can thereafter resort to a federal court of equity to restrain further action by the state officers if in violation of constitutional rights.\n\n 3. \nThe question then is whether the bill was prematurely filed. In view of what has been said, the appellant's cause of action in equity will not, strictly speaking, arise until an appraisement is made and certified to the department of revenue and notice of the fact is given appellant. However, in view of the allegations of the bill, we are not inclined to hold the suit premature. The bill charges that the secretary of revenue has refused to issue a waiver of tax, and that the Attorney General has notified the appellant and the state's appraiser the property is subject to the tax, and the appellant's claim for exemption will be denied. The commonwealth's law officers plainly intend to perform what they consider their duty, and will, unless restrained, cause the assessment and imposition of the tax. The action, the legality of which is challenged, thus appears sufficiently imminent and certain to justify the intervention of a court of equity. Compare Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 592\n, 43 S.Ct. 658, 32 A.L.R. 300. Moreover, no purpose would be served by dismissing the bill, if, as we hold, the moment the proposed assessment is made another suit may be instituted in the federal court. \n\n[291 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded, with instructions to reinstate the bill and proceed to a hearing upon the merits.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 20, 1919, P.L. 521 (72 Purdon's Penna.

Richard Mayer, of Chicago, Ill., H. F. Driemeyer, of East St. Louis, Ill.,David F. Rosenthal and Carl Meyer, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners. \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 263]\n\u00a0\n Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C.,\n\n\n[291 U.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. V. Ferrell and John Hay, both of Marion, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of June 25, 1930, c. 604, 46 Stat. 809 (12 USCA  90), amends section 45 of the National Bank Act of 18641 by adding thereto the following:\n'Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof, give security for the safe- keeping and prompt payment of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State.'\n\n The controlling question is whether Illinois has conferred upon banks organized under its laws power to pledge assets as security for deposits of public moneys of political subdivisions of the state.\n In 1931, the city of Marion, Ill., was operating under the 'Commission Form of Government.' Smith-Hurd Rev. St. 1931, c. 24,  265- 326, 358k, 358l, Cahill's 1931 Rev. Stat. chap. 24, pars. 323-384. That statute \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 267]\n\u00a0\n required the treasurer of a city to give a bond; and to-\n'make his daily deposits of such sums of money as shall be received by him from all sources of revenue whatsoever, to his credit as treasurer of said city ... in one or more banks ... to be selected by the president of said council, the commissioner of accounts and finance, and the treasurer of such city ... or by any two of them, and any such bank, before any such deposit is made therein ... shall also execute a good ( and) sufficient bond with sureties to be approved by the president of the said council, and conditioned that such bank will safely keep and account for, and pay over said money. ...' Section 316 (paragraph 374).\n\n Carroll having been appointed treasurer of Marion, applied to the Fidelity & Casualty Company of New York to become surety on his official bond. Although Marion has a population of 9,000, it was then without a bank. The Fidelity Company agreed to become surety on Carroll's bond provided he would get elsewhere a bank which would give satisfactory collateral security for the repayment of his deposits of the public moneys. The City National Bank of Herrin agreed to do this. Thereafter, it delivered to the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Company of Chicago, as escrow agent, negotiable bonds of the par value of $23,000, under an agreement so to secure the city's deposit; the Fidelity Company executed Carroll's official bond; and he made his initial deposit in the Herrin bank of the city's moneys. That bank was then solvent. On October 31, 1931, it failed and a receiver was appointed. At the time of the failure the city's deposit was $16,430.00.\n Ben Sneeden, the receiver, brought, in the federal court for eastern Illinois, this suit against the city, its treasurer, the surety, and the escrow agent. Setting forth the above facts, he prayed that the pledge be declared ultra vires and void; that the bonds be delivered to him as receiver; and that, meanwhile, the defendants be enjoined from dis- \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 268]\n\u00a0\n posing of them. The District Court dismissed the bill. 58 F.(2d) 341. Its decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting. 64 F.(2d) 721. This Court granted certiorari, \n290 \nU.S. 617\n, 54 S.Ct. 91, 78 L.Ed. --.\n The petitioners contend that the pledge is valid because the act of 1864, as originally enacted, conferred upon national banks, as a necessary incident of the business of deposit banking, the power to pledge assets to secure deposits; and that the amendment of June 25, 1930, did not limit the power so originally conferred. They contend further that even if the 1930 amendment be construed as denying to a national bank power to make such a pledge unless it is located in a state which grants the power to its state banks, the pledge here challenged is valid, because in Illinois, state banks have the power to pledge assets as security for deposits of public moneys of any political subdivision of the state. The petitioners contend also that even if the pledge was without authority in law, the bill was properly dismissed by the District Court, because the bank could not have required return of the bonds without repaying the deposit and that it would be inequitable to permit the receiver to do so. We think these contentions are unsound.\n First. For the reasons stated in Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, decided this day, we are of opinion that the Act of 1864 did not confer the power to pledge assets to secure and public deposits except those made under section 45 by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. The power conferred by each later act, except that of 1930, was limited to securing specific federal funds. \n2\n A national bank could not legally pledge assets to secure funds of a state, or of a political subdivision thereof, prior to the 1930 amendment; and since then it \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 269]\n\u00a0\n can do so legally only if it is located in a state in which state banks are so authorized. In some states national banks had, prior to the 1930 amendment, frequently pledged assets to secure public deposits of the state or of a political subdivision thereof; comptrollers of the currency knew that this was being done; and they assumed that the banks had the power so to do. But the assumption was erroneous. The contention that such power is generally necessary in the business of deposit banking has not been sustained.\n Second. Banks organized under the laws of Illinois do not appear to possess the power of pledging assets to secure the deposit of public moneys of a political subdivision of the state. Illinois corporations have only such powers as are conferred by statute either expressly or by implication; and only those powers are conferred by implication which are reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted, People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 Ill. 268, 22 N.E. 798, 8 L.R.A. 497, 17 Am. St. Rep. 319; Calumet, etc., Dock Co. v. Conkling, 273 Ill. 318, 112 N.E. 982, L.R.A. 1917B, 814. No Illinois statute confers in express terms upon banks organized under its laws either the general power to pledge assets to secure a deposit; or the general power to pledge assets to secure public deposits. A statute confers in terms the power to pledge assets to secure deposits of the States but there is none which so confers the power to pledge assets to secure public deposits of a political subdivision of the state. \n3\n No \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 270]\n\u00a0\n reported decision rendered by any Illinois court since the enactment of the General Banking Law of 1887 holds that the alleged power exists as one incidental to the business of deposit banking. Nor is there any evidence that in Illinois such power is necessary in the conduct of the business of deposit banking.\n Ward v. Johnson, 95 Ill. 215, 217, decided in 1880, is relied upon as authority for the proposition that Illinois banks have power to pledge assets to secure deposits. That case arose under the charter of 'The Merchants, Farmers and Mechanics' Savings Bank,' which was granted long before the General Banking Act of 1887. The pledge involved therein was given to secure a transaction which appears to have been a loan as distinguished from a deposit. The transaction dealt with private funds. The statement was there made that banks have authority to pledge assets to secure deposits. If that statement expresses the law of the state, Illinois banks have had for more than half a century power to pledge their assets to secure private deposits as well as deposits of public moneys of its political subdivisions. But the case has never been referred to since on this point in any reported opinion of any Illinois court. \n4\n During that period, many state \n\n[291 U.S. 262, 271]\n\u00a0\n banks have failed;5 and there must have been much litigation arising therefrom; but no exertion of the alleged power on the part of any state bank has been shown.\n An authoritative determination of the question whether Illinois banks have power to pledge assets to secure the deposit of public moneys of a political subdivision of the state can be given only by its highest court. The District Court discussed, but did not decide, that question. Its decision dismissing the bill was rested on the ground that the National Bank Act as enacted in 1864 had conferred the general power to pledge assets to secure deposits; and that the power so granted had not been lessened by the later legislation. The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals being of opinion that national banks lacked the power to pledge assets to secure deposits (except so far as conferred by the 1930 amendment) necessarily passed upon the applicable Illinois law. After careful consideration, it reached the conclusion that Illinois had not conferred upon its banks the power to pledge assets to secure deposits of political subdivisions of the state.

FIDELITY & GUARANTY CO.(1934)\n\nArgued: October 9, 1934Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 140, 141]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John McGlasson and J. Walter Cocke, both of Waco, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Gerome B. Rogers, of Waco, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Curtis Boggs, a citizen of Texas, brought suit in a state court against Combs & Glade, contractors, citizens of Texas, and the City of Waco, Texas, for damages asserted to have been caused by collision with a street obstruction. The City by cross-action vouched in the Fidelity Company, respondent, a citizen of Maryland, surety on a bond of Combs & Glade, alleging that company was liable under the bond to pay whatever amount might be adjudged due by the City by reason of the fault of the contractors. The City prayed that if, upon the trial, the plaintiff should recover against it, judgment over should be rendered against the company for a like amount. The company removed the cause to the federal court on the ground that as to it a separable controversy existed.\n The plaintiff, after removal, presented a motion in the District Court in which he asserted that no separable controversy existed, since the Fidelity Company was not an original party, but was brought into the case by cross-complaint; that the company was improperly joined under state law and such joinder could not give the fed- \n\n[293 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n eral court jurisdiction; that the cross-action and the removal proceeding were collusively filed to deprive the state court of jurisdiction; that no separable controversy was presented, as the cause of action set up by the cross-complaint could not proceed to trial separately from the main action, but was ancillary thereto, judgment against Combs & Glade being a prerequisite to any judgment against the company. The prayer was 'that this entire cause be remanded to the said State Court of the State of Texas, and in the alternative that the suit of this plaintiff against the defendants Combs and Glade and the City of Waco be remanded to said court, and also in the alternative that the suit as against the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company by the City of Waco, as evidenced by the cross complaint of the City of Waco, be dismissed and the balance of this action be remanded to the said State Court.'\n The District Court entered a single decree embodying three separate orders: First, being of the opinion that the record presented a separable controversy between the City and the Fidelity Company, it overruled the motion to remand. Secondly, reciting that the motion to dismiss the cross- complaint had come on to be heard, it found that as to the plaintiff's cause of action the Fidelity Company was an unnecessary and improper party, and granted the motion. Thirdly, since, upon that dismissal, there was no diversity of citizenship of the remaining parties, the court held it lacked jurisdiction, and remanded the cause to the state court.\n The City appealed, not from the order of remand, but from that dismissing its action against the Fidelity Company, alleging this was contrary to the law of Texas. The Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal holding that, as no appeal lies from an order of remand, the cause was irrevocably out of the District Court, the action of that court in dismissing the city's cross-action was \n\n[293 U.S. 140, 143]\n\u00a0\n moot, and its propriety could not be reviewed. The petitioner complains that this action leaves it in an anomalous position, for, whereas the Circuit Court in its opinion states, 'the City by cross action, as permitted by the Texas practice,' vouched in the Fidelity Company, the order of dismissal of the cross-action is outstanding, with the result that in the further proceedings in the state court, the District Court's order will be treated as conclusive upon the question of the City's right to maintain its cross-action. Evidently this result was not intended by the Circuit Court of Appeals. In its opinion it says: 'all matters concerning the entire controversy, both those presented by the cross bill, and those presented by the main suit are now, because of the remand, pending in the State court and for its action, unaffected by the attempt of the Federal court to dismiss the City's cross action ....'\n The record contradicts this statement. If the District Court's order stands the cross-action will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court. Indeed, if the District Court was right, the cause could not have been remanded except for the exclusion of the Fidelity Company as a party. True, no appeal lies from the order of remand; but in logic and in fact the decree of dismissal preceded that of remand and was made by the District Court while it had control of the cause. Indisputably this order is the subject of an appeal; and, if not reversed or set aside, is conclusive upon the petitioner.\n We are of opinion that the petitioner was entitled to have the Circuit Court of Appeals determine whether the dismissal of its cross- action against the Fidelity Company was proper. If the District Court erred on this point, which we do not decide, its action should be reversed. A reversal cannot affect the order of remand, but it will at least, if the dismissal of the petitioner's complaint was erroneous, remit the entire controversy, with the Fidelity \n\n[293 U.S. 140, 144]\n\u00a0\n Company still a party, to the state court for such further proceedings as may be in accordance with law.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with instructions to reinstate the appeal and to proceed therein in conformity with law.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLARK v.

United States Constitution, art. 4 ,  1.\n The petitioner, the official liquidator of an Iowa insurance company, declares himself the universal successor of the corporation (Keatley v. Furey, \n226 \nU.S. 399, 403\n, 404 S., 33 S.Ct. 121), the representative of its personality and powers after its life has been extinguished. (Relfe v. Rundle, \n103 U.S. 222\n; Martyne v. American Union Fire Insurance Co., 216 N.Y. 183, 110 N.E. 502; Deschenes v. Tallman, 248 N.Y. 33, 37, 161 N.E. 321.) The Supreme Court of Montana has held that his title to the assets, if he has any, is derived, not from any statute, but from an involuntary assignment under a judgment of a foreign court. A title traced to such a source is subject in Montana to attachment and execution at the suit of local creditors. The question has been left unanswered whether attachments and executions are enforceable to the same extent in derogation of the title of a statutory successor.\n Federal Surety Company was organized as an insurance corporation under the laws of Iowa, and thereafter received authority to do business in Montana. In September, 1931, the state of Iowa sued it, alleging its insolvency and praying for a decree of dissolution and the distribution of the assets. A statute of Iowa provides that 'the commissioner of insurance henceforth shall be the receiver and\/or liquidating officer for any insurance company, association or insurance carrier, and shall serve without compensation other than his stated compensation as commissioner of insurance, but he shall be alowed clerical and other expenses necessary for the conduct of such receivership.' Code of Iowa 1931,  8613-c 1. See, also, Code of Iowa, 1931,  8402, 8964. On September 25, 1931, a decree in favor of the state was entered by default, and an amended decree on December 22 of the same year. By these decrees the corporation was adjudged to have been dissolved on September 25, 1931; \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n the commissioner of insurance, E. W. Clark, as adjudged to be 'the successor to said corporation,' and as such to hold 'title to all property owned by Federal Surety Company at the time it so ceased to exist;' and liquidation was decreed in accordance with the statute.\n We have said that the corporation had authority to do business in Montana. The grant was subject to conditions. A statute of Montana provides that the dissolution of a corporation does not 'take away or impair any remedy given against any such corporation, its stockholders or officers, for any liability which has been previously incurred.' Section 6013, Montana Revised Codes of 1921. The preservation of existing remedies is not confined to domestic corporations. It applies to foreign corporations also. This results, in the view of the Montana court, from a provision of the state Constitution as well as from a supplementary statute. By article 15,  11, of the Montana Constitution, 'no company or corporation formed under the laws of any other country, state or territory, shall have, or be allowed to exercise, or enjoy within this state any greater rights or privileges than those possessed or enjoyed by corporations of the same or similar character created under the laws of the state.' And by a supplementary statute (section 6659, Revised Codes, 1921): 'All foreign corporations licensed to do business in the state of Montana shall be subject to all the liabilities, restrictions, and duties which are or may be imposed upon corporations of like character organized under the laws of this state, and shall have no other or greater powers.' Construing that statute, the Supreme Court of Montana has written in the case now under review: 'Suits against domestic corporations do not abate upon the entry of a decree of dissolution, and the same rule, by virtue of this statutory provision, must apply to a foreign corporation.' Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959, 963.\n Long before the dissolution of the Federal Surety Company, the respondents Williard and Wheaton, as trustees \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n of a syndicate, brought suit in a Montana court to recover from the surety company the damages due upon a bond. The first trial resulted in a nonsuit, which was reversed upon appeal. Williard v. Federal Surety Co., 91 Mont. 465, 8 P.(2d) 633. After the decree of dissolution, the case came on for a second trial, and on May 10, 1932, judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was enterd by default. The Supreme Court of Montana has held that the dissolution of the surety company did not abate the suit. There was thus a final judgment, valid under the Montana practice and effective according to that practice to liquidate the claim.\n To say that there was such a judgment is not to dispose of the whole case. A judgment existing, the remedies available to enforce it are still to be determined. Before the respondents were in a position to issue execution, the situation had been complicated by a suit for the appointment of a receiver begun in a Montana District Court. On March 25, 1932, Mieyr, a simple contract creditor, brought suit against the surety company and Clark, the foreign liquidator, praying an ancillary receivership to preserve the local assets. A temporary receiver (Crichton) was appointed the same day. While that suit was pending, the respondents filed a petition on May 24, 1932, for leave to issue an execution against securities and moneys which had been discovered in Montana, the levy to have the same effect as if no receiver had been appointed. An order to that effect was granted, subject, however, to a later motion to vacate it. Within due time thereafter, Clark filed a cross-petition and an answer, asserting his title as successor to the dissolved corporation, opposing the demands of the judgment creditors, and setting up his rights and privileges under article 4,  1, of the Federal Constitution. On August 25, 1932, the District Court of Montana entered a final decree adjudging that Clark was the successor to the personality and title of the Iowa corporation; that the assets should be liqui- \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n dated and ratably distributed, subject only to the liens existing at the date of dissolution; that Crichton should be continued as an ancillary receiver to assist the foreign liquidator; that the assets in Montana should be retained in that state until local creditors had received their ratable proportion of assets there and elsewhere; and that the execution upon the respondents' judgment and any preference thereby created, as well as the earlier order sanctioning the levy, should be set aside and canceled.\n From that decree, and from an order denying a motion to vacate or modify it, the judgment creditors, who are the respondents in this court, appealed to the Supreme Court of Montana. After argument and reargument, the decree and order were there reversed, two members of the court dissenting. Mieyr v. Federal Surety Company, 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959. The court held that the respondents' judgment had been lawfully recovered, though the defendant was dissolved; that the ancillary receivership was void for the reason that a simple contract creditor (Mieyr) was without standing to maintain the suit; that Clark, the foreign liquidator, was not the successor to the corporate personality with a title derived from the statutes of the domicile, but was a chancery receiver with a title (if any) created by the Iowa decree; that, as against such a receiver, creditors in Montana were at liberty to levy attachments and executions, irrespective of their right to enforce such a levy against a statutory successor; and hence that the respondents' execution should be reinstated, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accord with the opinion. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n Our jurisdiction to issue the writ is challenged on the ground that the decree to be reviewed is without the requisite fanality. Judicial Code  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 USCA  344). The challenge should not prevail. The decree of the Montana court is final to the extent that it confirms the respondents' \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n execution and permits a levy that will override the liquidator's title. A final order results where a court denies a petition by an intervening creditor to establish a prior lien (Gumbel v. Pitkin, \n113 \nU.S. 545, 548\n, 5 S.Ct. 616), or a petition by a municipal corporation intervening in a foreclosure suit to enforce a lien for taxes superior to the mortgage (Savannah v. Jesup, \n106 \nU.S. 563, 564\n, 565 S., 1 S.Ct. 512), or one by a chancery receiver appointed by a state court for the delivery of property in the possession of another court (Ex parte Tiffany, \n252 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, 40 S.Ct. 239. Cf. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 3 S.Ct. 136; Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 689\n, 4 S.Ct. 638; United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 414\n, 46 S.Ct. 144; Dexter Horton National Bank of Seattle v. Hawkins (C.C.A.) 190 F. 924, 927). The doctrine of those cases is applicable here. Further judicial proceedings may be necessary between the liquidator and others not before us. As between the liquidator and the respondents claiming as judgment creditors, the suit is at an end. They came into court pro interesse suo with a petition to establish the priority of their judgment. The petition has been granted and priority decreed. Not only that, but an order vacating the execution has been reversed, and the levy reinstated. So far as these respondents are concerned, there is nothing more to be decided. 'The property of the Federal Surety Company within the state of Montana at the time of the levy of the execution by Williard et al., not being in possession of the Iowa receiver, was subject to levy, and the levy made under the execution in May, 1932, is good and valid.' Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959, 964, By that opinion, which by reference was incororated in the judgment (Metropolitan Water Co. v. Kaw Valley District, \n223 \nU.S. 519, 523\n, 32 S.Ct. 246; Gulf Refining Co. v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 125, 135\n, 46 S.Ct. 52), nothing was left to the discretion of the trial court in respect of the priority of the execution or of the respondents' rights thereunder. The intervening petition has been finally disposed of, and no longer is a pending proceeding, whatever may be said \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n of the suit in which the claimants intervened. Cf. Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 202, 203; United States v. River Rouge Co., supra.\n Jurisdiction being here, the case will be considered on the merits.\n We assume in accordance with the decision of the Montana court that the respondents' action against the surety company did not abate on dissolution, but was lawfully pursued to judgment. McGoon v. Scales, 9 Wall. 23; cf. Sinnott v. Hanan, 214 N.Y. 454, 458, 459, 108 N.E. 858; Marstaller v. Mills, 143 N.Y. 398, 400, 38 N.E. 370. Cases such as Remington & Sons v. Samana Bay Co., 140 Mass. 494, 5 N.E. 292, and others cited in the margin1 are not at war with this conclusion. They express the rule to be applied when there is no statute or public policy to the contrary in the state where the foreign corporation has been licensed to do business. They do not delimit the capacity of a state, when granting such a license, to subject it to conditions. Complications might exist if there had been no one within the state upon whom process could be served. Here the action as begun, and the company had appeared and answered, before the date of dissolution. Moreover, a power of attorney was on file, pursuant to the Montana law (Revised Codes, 1921,  6212), whereby process might be served on the insurance commissioner of the state, the power to remain in force so long as any policy or liability of the company was outstanding in Montana. Cf. American Railway Express Co. v. Kentucky, \n273 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 47 S.Ct. 353; Washington v. Superior Court, \n289 \nU.S. 361, 364\n, 365 S., 53 S.Ct. 624. Complications also might exist if there were no one \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n in being with authority to continue the defense. Here there had been the designation of a liquidator who was competent to represent the corporation if he had chosen to intervene. Cf. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, \n273 \nU.S. 257\n, 47 S.Ct. 391. We are not to be understood as intimating that such complications would be fatal if they existed, but merely to exclude them. In such circumstances, the judgment is at least effectual to liquidate the claim as a charge upon the local assets. But this, as we have seen, is only a partial statement of the problem. To ascertain the procedure by which the charge is to be enforced, whether by the levy of execution or by a ratable division, other considerations must be weighed. In particular, it must be known whether superior interests or titles have developed between the summons and the judgment, and whether the qualify or operation of those interests affects the method of distribution. Something did intervene here, the appointment of a liquidator under the statutes of the domicile. That much is undisputed. Did the Supreme Court of Montana misjudge the quality and operation of this intervening interest, and in so doing did it deny to the statutes and decrees of Iowa the faith and credit owing to them under the Constitution of the United States?\n In our judgment, the statutes of Iowa have made the official liquidator the successor to the corporation, and not a mere receiver. State ex rel. Attorney-General v. Fidelity Loan & Trust Co., 113 Iowa, 439, 85 N.W. 638. His title is not the consequence of a decree of a court whereby a corporation still in being has made a compulsory assignment of its assets with a view to liquidation. Sterrett v. Second National Bank of Cincinnati, \n248 \nU.S. 73\n, 39 S.Ct. 27;2 Lion Bonding Company v. \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 43 S.Ct. 480; Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561, 575\n, 25 S.Ct. 770; Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322. His title is the consequence of a succession established for the corporation by the law of its creation. Relfe v. Rundle, supra; Keatley v. Furey, supra; Sterrett v. Second National Bank of Cincinnati, supra, page 77 of 248 U.S., 39 S.Ct. 27; cf. Bockover v. Life Ass'n of America, 77 Va. 85; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 257\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 534\n, 27 S.Ct. 755. So the lawmakers have plainly said. So the Iowa court adjudged in decreeing dissolution.\n We think the Supreme Court of Montana denied full faith and credit to the statutes and judicial proceedings of Iowa in holding, as it did, that the petitioner was a receiver deriving title through a judicial proceeding, and not through the charter of its being and the succession there prescribed. 'When the transfer of a debtor's property,' said the court, 'is the result of a judicial proceeding, there is no provision of the Constitution which requires the courts of another state to carry it into effect, and as a general rule no state court will do this to the prejudice of the citizens of its own state,' Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959, 964, citing Reynolds v. Adden, \n136 \nU.S. 348\n, 10 S.Ct. 843, a case of insolvency proceedings in invitum against a natural person, and Zacher v. Fidelity Trust Co. (C.C.A.) 106 F. 593, an enforced assignment to the receiver of a corporation which retained its corporate life. Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, whether the debtor is a natural or a juristic person, confer upon the receiver or assignee a title which, generally speaking, is without recognition outside of the state of his appointment except in subordination to the claims of local creditors. Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., \n173 \nU.S. 624\n, 19 S.Ct. 545; Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S.Ct. 269; Oakey v. Bennett, 11 How. 33, 44; Barth v. Backus, 140 N.Y. 230, 35 N.E. 425, 23 L.R.A. 47, 37 Am.StRep. 545; Ward v. Connecticut Pipe Mfg. Co., 71 Conn. 345, 41 A. 1057, 42 L.R.A. 706, 71 Am.St.Rep. 207; Gilbert v. Hewetson, 79 Minn. 326, 82 N.W. \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n 655, 79 Am.St.Rep. 486. Upon the strength of these and like decisions, the Montana court has refused recognition to a receiver or liquidator who in truth is a statutory successor. Whether it would have favored that conclusion of it had correctly interpreted his standing, its opinion does not tell us. The case should go back to the end that the priority of the execution may be determined with understanding of the title displaced and overridden.\n In thus holding we do not say that there is an invariable rule by which the title of a statutory liquidator must prevail over executions and attachments outside of the state of his appointment. The subject is involved in confusion, with decisions pro and con. There are cases which lay down the rule that the title of such a liquidator will have recognition and enforcement everywhere without affirming or denying the possibility of exceptions. Kinsler v. Casualty Company of America, 103 Neb. 382, 172 N.W. 33; U.S. Truck Co. v. Pennsylvania Surety Corp., 259 Mich. 422, 243 N.W. 311; Bockover v. Life Association of America, supra; Parsons v.

Taggart (C.C.A.) 87 F. 94; Southern Building & Loan Association v. Miller (C.C.A.) 118 F. 369. Other cases add a dictum (Martyne v. American Union Fire Insurance Co., supra) that the state in which the title is assailed may declare a contrary policy by statute or decision. Cf. The Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, \n208 \nU.S. 570, 579\n, 580 S., 25 S.Ct. 337. Still others take the view that the claims of local creditors are entitled to precedence. Schloss v. Surety Co., 149 Iowa, 382, 128 N.W. 384; Lackmann v. Supreme Council, 142 Cal. 22, 75 P. 583. The position of a claimant who has the standing of a statutory successor is more closely analogous to that of a trustee under a voluntary general assignment for the benefit of creditors (Ockerman v. Cross, 54 N.Y. 29; Warner v. Jaffray, 96 N.Y. 248, 255, 48 Am.Rep. 616; Hervey Co. v. R.I. Locomotive Works, 93 U.S. \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 123]\n\u00a0\n 664) than to one deriving title under a decree in insolvency proceedings (Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., supra, page 628 of 173 U.S., 19 S.Ct. 545), yet it is stronger than either in that for many purposes the corporation under which he claims has passed out of existence.\n Whether there is in Montana a local policy, expressed in statute or decision, whereby judgments and attachments have a preference over the title of a charter liquidator, is a question as to which the Supreme Court of that state will speak with ultimate authority. It has not spoken yet. The tendency in most of the states is to give priority to the title unless a contrary policy is expressed pressed with reasonable clarity. Martyne v. American Union Fire Insurance Co., supra; Kinsler v. Casualty Co., supra; Bockover v. Life Association of America, supra. Cf. Cogliano v. Ferguson, 245 Mass. 364, 139 N.E. 527. No statute or decision brought to our notice from Montana removes the question from the field of doubt. True, there are the statutes heretofore referred to whereby suit may be maintained against foreign corporations after dissolution on the same basis as against domestic ones. Nothing in those provisions declares the existence of a policy to allow the assets of an insolvent corporation to be torn to pieces at the suit of rival creditors when they could be distributed equally and without sacrifice at the hands of a receiver. At all events, the policy, if it exists, is indicated too obscurely to permit us to accept it until so instructed by the Montana court. The drastic consequences of acceptance attest the need of caution. Partnerships and individuals, if hard pressed, may resort to a court of bankruptcy and thus conserve their assets. Business corporations may have their assets equally distributed through involuntary proceedings. But insurance corporations, like banks, are excluded from bankruptcy altogether (11 U.S.C.  22 b), and must submit to dismemberment, however great the waste or inequality, unles receivers are \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 124]\n\u00a0\n appointed. The respondents would have us say that submission to such consequences is exacted by an unbending rule of law.\n We have no thought to impose our reading of the local statutes and decisions upon the courts of the locality. What we are about to say as to their meaning does no more than explain the grounds for our understanding that the courts of Montana have left the question open. If the law were clear beyond debate, as counsel for the respondents has contended that it is, our duty might be to dispose of the entire controversy now instead of remanding it to the state court for further action there. We are mindful of the practice whereby domestic corporations dissolved by the Montana law may be wound up by the directors as trustees in dissolution. Revised Codes ,  6011, formerly Civil Code 1895,  561. We understand also that, while the assets are so held, claims may be reduced to judgment, and attachments and executions levied. This is doubtless the prevailing practice when the corporation is solvent, or when insolvency is not so gross as to lead to sacrifice or hardship. Inability to discharge liabilities as they mature, or even impairment of the capital prescribed by the articles of association, may not mean that the assets will be insufficient when put up at public sale. But administration by the directors, subject to attachment and execution, is not the only form of distribution that is known to the local law. In appropriate cases a dissolved corporation may be wound up by a receiver as an officer of the court. By section 9303 of the Revised Codes of 1921, a creditor of a dissolved corporation (presumably a judgment creditor) may apply for a receiver to liquidate the assets,3 and after \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 125]\n\u00a0\n such appointment executions are forbidden. Gardner v. Caldwell, 16 Mont. 221, 40 P. 590; cf. Barker v. Edwards (C.C.A.) 259 F. 484, 488; Rohr v. Stanton Trust & Savings Bank, 76 Mont. 248, 251, 253, 245 P. 947; Berryman v. Billings Mutual Heating Co., 44 Mont. 517, 521, 121 P. 280. The decisions are obscure as to the circumstances in which that statute will be applied. The vast majority of the Montana cases on the subject of receivers are grounded on another section (9301), under which the tests are very different. There is hardly a word in any of them as to the meaning of section 9303 and the remedy there- \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 126]\n\u00a0\n under. Thus, in Forsell v. Pittsburg & Montana Copper Co., 42 Mont. 412, 113 P. 479, a creditor obtained a judgment against a foreign corporation, not dissolved, and execution was issued and returned unsatisfied. The creditor then applied for a receiver, but without alleging that there was any property within the state. The court held that no case was made out by the allegations of the bill. In Berryman v. Billings Heating Co., 44 Mont. 517, 525, 121 P. 280, a temporary receiver was appointed in an action against a domestic corporation not dissolved. In aid of this appointment the plaintiff, a simple contract creditor, alleged that the defendant was insolvent. On appeal the court held that this without more did not make the appointment necessary, and vacated the receivership. In Prudential Securities Co. v. Three Forks, etc., R. Co., 49 Mont. 567, 572, 144 P. 158, and again in Scholefield v. Merrill Mortuaries, Inc., 93 Mont. 192, 17 P.( 2d) 1081, the situation was the same as in the suit by Berryman, supra; the applicants for the receiver being simple contract creditors suing to collect a debt. What was said as to the trust fund doctrine when invokved by a creditor so situated (49 Mont. at page 572, 144 P. 158) is in full accord with the doctrine prevailing in this court. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371\n, 14 S.Ct. 127. The case at hand is barely grazed by Ferrell v. Evans, 25 Mont. 444, 454, 65 P. 714, 718. There the suit was for the appointment of a receiver to wind up a building and loan company whose charter had expired. The court held that there was no need of superseding the directors who were statutory trustees under section 6011 of the Revised Codes. The opinion states: 'No exception is made is case of insolvency,' but this is supplemented by the statement that in fact 'the association was not insolvent.' The dictum quoted does not amount to a decision that a receiver will never be appointed under section 9303 in a case where a corporation has been dissolved and multiplying executions threaten a dispersion of the assets. No such question was involved. \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 127]\n\u00a0\n The situation was much the same in Merges v. Altenbrand, 45 Mont. 355, 123 P. 21. The charter of a solvent corporation had expired, and there was no sufficient ground for superseding the directors through the appointment of receivers. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n We do not read these decisions as holding in any clear or final way that the directors of a dissolved corporation will never be required to give place to a receiver, no matter how great the danger of inequality or waste. Indeed, it is uncertain whether such a holding would be possible without denying any function to section 9303 of the Montana Code. Inequality and waste are to be avoided in special measure when banks or insurance companies, unable, as we have seen, to have the protection of courts of bankruptcy, are in course of liquidation. The Supreme Court of Montana has been mindful of this need, at all events in respect of banks, and has stated it with force and clarity. Thus, in Rohr v. Stanton Trust & Savings Bank, supra, a creditor brought suit in the hope of gaining a preference for his deposit out of the assets of a bank in the hands of a receiver. The court said (page 251 of 76 Mont., 245 P. 947, 948), 'the general principle of equity that the assets of an insolvent are to be distributed ratably among general creditors applies with full force to the distribution of the assets of a bank,' and again (page 253 of 76 Mont., 245 P. 947, 949), 'The available assets' are to be 'so \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 128]\n\u00a0\n conserved that each depositor or other creditor shall receive payment or dividend according to the amount of his debt, and that none of equal class shall receive any advantage or preference over another.' Cf. AEtna Accident & Liability Co. v. Miller, 54 Mont. 377, 389, 170 P. 760, L.R.A. 1918C, 954. It would seem that conservation of assets and equality of distribution are goods no less important in the winding up of insurance companies and of other moneyed corporations than in the winding up to banks.\n From this survey of the decisions in Montana there results this truth, if nothing more, that there has been no definitive pronouncement as to the circumstances justifying a receivership for an insolvent corporation, and that the question is left open whether receivers of such a corporation will be appointed after dissolution to prevent waste or inequality. If that is so, it results also that the question is still open whether executions may be subordinated to the title of a foreign liquidator without a forbidden discrimination between corporations organized in Montana and those from other states. A statute preserving remedies after a decree of dissolution does not mean that for every purpose a corporation, though dissolved, is still a juristic person, or that equity is indifferent as to the mode of marshaling the assets. All that it means is that suits shall not abate, but may be prosecuted to judgment as if the corporation were in being. What will be done afterwards in the enforcement of a jdugment will vary with the circumstances. When a charter liquidator whose standing is recognized in Montana is decreed to have an interest superior to the lien of later executions, as if his position were that of a receiver appointed by the local courts, there is no resulting inequality between foreign and domestic corporations, no favoring of the one class in hostility to the other. So, at least, the Montana court may not unreasonably decide. By hypothesis the domestic corporation after dissolution may be placed, \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 129]\n\u00a0\n upon a proper showing, in the hands of a receiver, and its assets ratably distributed. The foreign corporation, represented by a foreign liquidator, may be subjected to the same restraints. If supplementary directions are thought to be appropriate to the end that local assets may be kept within in Montana till local creditors are paid their share of all the assets everywhere, there is power in a court of equity to assure the requisite equality. Sands v. E. S. Greeley & Co. (C.C.A.) 88 F. 130; Receivers Middlesex Banking Co. v. Realty Investment Co., 104 Conn. 206, 132 A. 390; Buswell v. Supreme Sitting of Order of Iron Hall, 161 Mass. 224, 36 N.E. 1065, 23 L.R.A. 846; Fawcett v. Supreme Sitting of Order of Iron Hall, 64 Conn. 170, 29 A. 614, 24 L.R.A. 815; People v. Granite State Provident Association, 161 N.Y. 492, 55 N.E. 1053\n\n\n To resume: The Supreme Court of Montana will determine whether there is any local policy whereby an insolvent foreign corporation in the hands of a liquidator with title must submit to the sacrifice of its assets or to their unequal distribution by writs of execution.\n If such a policy exists and the foreign liquidator is thus displaced, other questions may remain as to the power of the state which there is no occasion to consider in advance of the event.\n The decree should be vacated in so far as it adjudges the validity and priority of the respondents' execution (cf. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 291\n, 44 S.Ct. 323; Missouri v. Public Service Commission, \n273 \nU.S. 126, 131\n, 47 S.Ct. 311), and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Montana for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Separate opinion by Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This cause has been much obscured by verbiage. The practical problems incident to administering the affairs of insolvent insurance companies are often complex; but \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 130]\n\u00a0\n the issues presently presented for determination are narrow and ought to cabin our discussion.\n In 1931 an Iowa court, proceeding under local statutes, adjudged that the corporate existence of the Federal Surety Company organized in that state had terminated; that E. W. Clark, receiver and liquidating officer, is its successor and holds title to all corporate property for the purposes of liquidation, etc.\n January 31, 1928, the surety company being then authorized to transact business in Montana, respondents here-Williard, Wheaton, and Hay- duly asked for judgment against it in the district court of Fergus county. May 20, 1932, judgment went in their favor. Clark, the Iowa receiver, did not enter his appearance in the cause, made no effort to prevent the judgment. Execution issued and was levied, May --, 1932, upon property of the company found in Montana.\n In March, 1932, one John Mieyr brought suit against the Federal Surety Company in the district court, Cascade county, Mont. He alleged indebtedness to himself upon an unliquidated claim, also indebtedness to other citizens of Montana for considerable sums, and that the company had much property within the state. He described the Iowa court proceedings wherein the corporation was declared dissolved and Clark designated as receiver and averred that Clark was then attempting to obtain possession of the company's property within Montana with intent to remove it. He asked for judgment for the amount of his claim; and that a local receiver be appointed to take possession of the company's assets in Montana and hold them subject to further order, etc. Thereupon the court appointed D. A. Crichton receiver of the Montana assets, with powers as prayed: he duly qualified. Clark appeared specially and asked that Crichton's appointment be annulled because the court lacked jurisdiction. This motion was denied May 24th. \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 131]\n\u00a0\n On the same day Williard, Wheaton, and Hay, appearing by petition, asked and received approval of their action in procuring levy of the Fergus county execution upon the corporation's property.\n July 25, 1932, Receiver Crichton moved to annul the order of May 24, 1932, which approved the levy of the Fergus county execution.\n August 3, 1932, Clark appeared and answered Mieyr's complaint. He set out proceedings in the Iowa court and his designation as receiver; he asked an order confirming his title to the company's assets, also for confirmation of Crichton's appointment as ancillary receiver.\n August 25th the court authorized an order reciting that the corporate existence of the surety company was terminated by the Iowa proceedings and that title to all of its property passed to Clark as receiver. This order also confirmed the appointment of Crichton as receiver of Montana assets; directed all creditors in that state to file their claims, and that corporate assets should be delivered to him. And further that the order of May 24th permitting the Fergus county execution be set aside.\n August 31, 1932, Williard, Wheaton, and Hay asked the Cascade county district court to vacate the order of August 25th upon the ground that the facts disclosed were not sufficient to justify appointment of the receiver; also because the court acted without jurisdiction. In the alternative, they asked that the order be so modified as to release all property seized under any Montana execution or attachment. This motion was denied the same day.\n On September 18, 1932, Williard, Wheaton, and Hay appealed from the judgment and order of August 25th confirming Crichton's appointment as receiver, etc. and revoking the May 24th order which granted permission for levy of the Fergus county execution. Also, from the order of August 31st which denied their motion to vacate the one entered August 25th. The issues were thus lim- \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 132]\n\u00a0\n ited. The opinion of the Supreme Court came down April 1, 1933 (Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959, 961). It said:\n'The appeal presents the question whether appellants have the right to be paid the amount of their claim from the Montana property before any part of such property is transmitted to the Iowa receiver for administration through the Iowa receivership, when, as shown, their claim has been reduced to judgment and execution levied after the proceedings in the Iowa court designed to accomplish the dissolution of the corporation. Solution of the problem presented makes it necessary to determine the effect of the proceedings in the Iowa court upon the corporate life of the surety company.'\n\n Upon review of the Montana statutes, the court declared that the suit against the surety company in Fergus County did not abate upon entry of the Iowa decree and that the judgment of May 20th therein was valid. It then came to consider whether levy under the Fergus county execution was good, and said this 'depends upon the effect of the order appointing Crichton receiver.' It ultimately and definitely declared: 'The petition of Mieyr for the appointment of a receiver was insufficient, in that he, being a general creditor, had no right to the appointment of a receiver and had an adequate remedy by which he could be fully protected; namely, the issuance and levy of a writ of attachment. The property of the Federal Surety Company within the state of Montana at the time of the levy of the execution by Williard et al., not being in possession of the Iowa receiver, was subject to levy, and the levy made under the execution in May, 1932, is good and valid. The judgment and orders appealed from are reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in the district court in accordance with the views herein expressed.' \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 133]\n\u00a0\n The opinion definitely approved the claim of the appellants that the district court of Cascade county was acting without authority and beyond its jurisdiction.\n Upon the sole petition of Clark, receiver, a writ of certiorari issued from this court. We have no jurisdiction unless the judgment of the state court was final; and only federal questions are open for our consideration.\n The formal judgment of the Supreme Court directed: 'For reasons stated in the opinion the judgment and orders appealed from are reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion.' Upon its face this is not final within the meaning of the statute governing our jurisdiction. And 'in matters of this kind we may not disregard the face of the record and treat the judgment as something other than it appears to be. So to do probably would lead to much confusion and uncertainty.' Hartford Acc. Co. v. Bunn, \n285 \nU.S. 169, 178\n, 52 S.Ct. 354, 356; McComb, Executor, v. Commissioners of Knox County, \n91 U.S. 1\n; Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, \n106 \nU.S. 3, 4\n, 1 S.Ct. 15, 16; Haseltine v. Central Bank, \n183 \nU.S. 130\n, 22 S.Ct. 49, 50; Schlosser v.

United States, \n269 \nU.S. 125, 135\n, 136 S., 46 S.Ct. 52, 53.\n Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff. 'The rule is well settled and of long standing that a judgment or decree to be final, within the meaning of that term as used in the acts of Congress giving this court jurisdiction on appeals and writs of error, must terminate the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, so that if there should be an affirmance here, the court below would have nothing to do but to execute the judgment or decree it had already rendered. ... If the judgment is not one which disposes of the whole case on its merits, it is not final. Con- \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 134]\n\u00a0\n sequently it has been uniformly held that a judgment of reversal with leave for further proceedings in the court below cannot be brought here on writ of error.'\n Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield. 'We have frequently held that a judgment reversing that of the court below, and remanding the case for further proceedings, is not one to which a writ of error will lie . ... While the judgment may dispose of the case as presented, it is impossible to anticipate its ultimate disposition. It may be voluntarily discontinued, or it may happen that the defeated party may amend his pleading by supplying some discovered defect, and go to trial upon new evidence. To determine whether, in a particular case, this may or may not be done, might involve an examination, not only of the record, but even of the evidence in the court of original jurisdiction, and lead to inquiries with regard to the actual final disposition of the case by the supreme court, which it might be difficult to answer. We have, therefore, always made the face of the judgment the test of its finality, and refused to inquire whether, in case of a new trial, the defeated party would stand in a position to make a better case. The plaintiffs in the case under consideration could have secured an immediate review by this court, if the court as a part of its judgment of reversal had ordered the circuit court to dismiss their petition, when, under Mower v. Fletcher (\n114 \nU.S. 127\n, 5 S.Ct. 799), they might have sued out a writ of error at once.'\n Schlosser v. Hemphill-an action in equity to quiet title. 'By its judgment the supreme court of Iowa (118 Iowa, 452, 90 N.W. 842) reversed the decree of the trial court, and remanded the cause 'for further proceedings in harmony with the opinion of this court.' We have heretofore held that a judgment couched in such terms is not final in such a sense as to sustain a writ of error from this court. ... Doubtless the conclusions arrived at by the state supreme court, \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 135]\n\u00a0\n and expressed in its opinion, furnish the grounds on which the court below must proceed when the case goes to a decree there, if no change in pleadings or proof takes place, but we cannot say what action might nevertheless be taken, and as no decree was entered in the supreme court, and no specific instruction was given to the court below, we think the writ of error cannot be maintained. Assuming, without deciding, that a Federal question was so raised as otherwise to have justified the exercise of our jurisdiction, we can but repeat what we said in Haseltine's Case: 'The plaintiffs in the case under consideration could have secured an immediate review by this court if the court, as a part of its judgment of reversal, had ordered the circuit court to dismiss their petition; when, under Mower v. Fletcher, \n114 \nU.S. 127\n, 5 S.Ct. 799, they might have sued out a writ of error at once.\"\n Louisiana Navigation Company v. Oyster Commission. Writ of error to Louisiana Supreme Court (125 La. 740, 51 So. 706) dismissed, judgment not final. 'The contention, however, is that the judgment below is final for the purpose of review by this court, because, when the opinion of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is carefully weighed, it will be found that that court practically finally disposed adversely to the title of the plaintiff of the substantial part of the lands involved in the suit, and hence that the court, in remanding the cause for further proceedings, did so only as to other lands. But conceding this to be true, it does not justify the claim based on it. In the first place, it is settled that this court may not be called upon to review by piecemeal the action of a state court which otherwise would be within its jurisdiction, and in the second place, the rule established by the authorities to which we have referred is that, on the question of finality, the form of the judgment is controlling, and hence that this court cannot, for the purpose of determining whether its reviewing \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 136]\n\u00a0\n power exists, be called upon to disregard the form of the judgment in order to ascertain whether a judgment which is in form not final might, by applying the state law, be treated as final in character. Indeed, it has been pointed out that the confusion and contradiction which inevitably arose from resorting to the state law for the purpose of converting a judgment not on its fact final into one final in character was the dominating reason leading to the establishment of the principle that the form of the judgment was controlling for the purpose of ascertaining its finality.'\n Georgia Ry. Co. v. Town of Decatur-error to Georgia Supreme Court ( 153 Ga. 329, 111 S.E. 911) in proceeding for injunction. 'The rule is established that in order to give this court appellate jurisdiction the judgment or decree 'must terminate the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, so that if there should be an affirmance here, the court below would have nothing to do but to execute the judgment or decree it had ... rendered.\"\n Gulf Refining Co. v. United States-appeal from Circuit Court of Appeals (U.S. v. Norvell, 298 F. 281). The challenged judgment was held final. 'The general rule established by many decisions, of which Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield (No. 1), \n183 \nU.S. 130\n, 22 S.Ct. 49, is an example, is that the face of the judgment is the test of its finality, and that by this test a judgment of reversal, remanding the cause for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of the court, ordinarily is not final. But the direction to proceed consistently with the opinion of the court has the effect of making the opinion a part of the mandate, as though it had been therein set out at length. Metropolitan Co. v. Kaw Valley District, \n223 \nU.S. 519, 523\n, 32 S.Ct. 246. Under the stipulations above recited, the trial court was bound to enter decrees for the government for the stated sums of money if that court found that the government was entitled to \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 137]\n\u00a0\n recover the net value of the oil produced. The trial court found that the government was not so entitled and the decrees went accordingly. Turning to the opinion, it will be seen that the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the trial court erred 'in entering the decrees denying the complainant the right to recover the net value of the oil,' etc. The instruction for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion, therefore, was equivalent to a direction to render judgment for the net value-that is, for the exact sums set forth in the stipulations. See Moody v. Century Bank, \n239 \nU.S. 374, 376\n, 36 S.Ct. 111; Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238, 241\n, 22 S.Ct. 881. There was no evidence to be taken or considered, and no change in the issue was possible; nothing remained but the ministerial duty of entering a decree for the precise sums which had been fixed beyond the power of alteration. It follows that the jurisdictional objection is without merit.'\n The judgment of the Supreme Court now before us is not final in form, and I think inspection of the opinion does not definitely indicate the action which the district court of Cascade county would have been bound to take. In his original petition against the surety company as sole defendant, Mieyr prayed for judgment upon his claim, for appointment of a local receiver to take charge of company assets, etc. And during the progress of the cause sundry questions were interposed by interveners. Others may appear and amendments may be offered. We have no jurisdiction.\n If, however, the judgment below be treated as final, then we must ascertain, if possible, what was actually determined. Our function is to review adjudications, not mere expressions of opinion or unnecessary statements.\n Apparently, the Supreme Court definitely adjudged that the trial court lacked power to appoint a receiver for the corporate assets within the state at the instance \n\n[292 U.S. 112, 138]\n\u00a0\n of Mieyr, a mere general creditor. Consequently the particular orders complained of by Williard and others were invalid as they had claimed. Determination of that question of state law gave adequate basis for disposition of the cause. It is enough to support the judgment and is not reviewable here. Discussion of federal questions was unnecessary, and views of the court in respect of them are not presently important.\n In any event, it seems reasonably clear that the only federal question before the Supreme Court of Montana which may be open for our consideration concerns the effect of the Iowa statutes and court decree under which Clark became receiver. It accepted the view that his appointment or designation did not operate to vest him with adequate title to the property of the defunct company wherever situated, that 'such (an) involuntary assignment in aid of a statutory judicial proceeding will not be recognized outside of the jurisdiction of the appointment, where the rights of domestic creditors are involved, if the receiver has not obtained possession of the property and where the creditors have obtained rights or liens upon the property even after the appointment in the foreign jurisdiction.' Probably this conclusion was erroneous. It involved a federal question. At the most we should announce the correct rule with the reasons therefor and send the cause back to the Supreme Court of Montana for further proceedings not in conflict with our determination. But this Court is neither called upon nor can it, without impropriety, discuss mere questions of state law which may hereafter be presented for decision by the courts of Montana. It is not our function to suggest to state courts how they should interpret their own laws. Theirs is the duty of deciding such matters, ours requires forbearance from tendering advice in that regard.\n The writ of certiorari should be dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] National Surety Co. v.

COMM'N(1934)\nNo. 274\nArgued: January 18, 1934Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Ross Hull, of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellant.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. Everett Mather, Jr., and John Fox Weiss, both of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed (as modified) an order of the Public Service Commission of that state prescribing a tariff of tolls to be charged on the bridge of the Clark's Ferry Bridge Company over the Susquehanna river, 108 Pa.Super.Ct. 49, 165 A. 261, 265. The company brings this appeal.\n In its review of the facts the Superior Court states that the bridge is comparatively new, having been completed in May, 1925. The bridge replaced and was con- \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n structed near the site of a wooden bridge which had been acquired by the incorporators of the present company. In August, 1925, a complaint was filed with the Public Service Commission alleging that the rates in effect were unreasonable. By its order of June 8, 1926, the commission found the fair value of appellant's property to be $767,800, and that appellant was entitled to receive a gross annual revenue of $85,905 on the basis of a return of 7 per cent. on that fair value, after allowing operating expenses, taxes, an annual depreciation allowance, and amortization of bond discount. An appeal from the commission's order was taken to the Superior Court, but was withdrawn, and in February, 1927, the company filed a new tariff. The rates thus fixed were continued in effect until July, 1929, when the company made a voluntary reduction. In January, 1930, the commission began the present proceeding on its own motion and, after hearings, determined that the fair value of the appellants' property, as of February 2, 1932, was still $767,800, and that the annual gross revenue which should be allowed was $84,124 on the basis of a return of 7 per cent. on that fair value, after allowing expenses and annual depreciation. 11 Pa. P.S.C. 222.1 In this calculation, an item of $1,331 for annual bond amortization was omitted. The Superior Court held that it should be included and modified the commission's order accordingly, that is, so as to provide that the allowable gross revenue should be $85,455. \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n First. Appellant contends that the commission and the court treated the valuation in the commission's decision of 1926 as res judicata in the present proceeding. We do not so construe the commission's report or the court's opinion. The commission received evidence as to alleged changes in value and estimates of the cost of reproducing the property. The commission determined that 'cost conditions' had not 'changed materially' since 1926, and, 'upon a complete examination of the entire record in both proceedings,' the commission found that the fair value of the property was $ 767,800 as of February, 1932. 11 Pa. P.S.C. at page 231. The Superior Court, in construing the action of the commission, said: 'When the subsequent complaints were filed, the commission evidently did not consider its previous findings as barring appellant from raising the question of the fair value of its property in 1930 and the proper allowances to be made for operating expenses and depreciation, but instituted an investigation, and, as already stated, admitted in evidence appellant's reproduction cost estimate and its supporting testimony, and put in evidence the reproduction cost esti- \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n mate of one of its engineering staff, and the report of the result of an examination of appellant's books and records.' The court acted upon what it stated to be 'the legislative mandate of the amendment of June 12, 1931, P.L. 530 (section 1 (66 PS  836)), that, in an appeal of this character, we shall consider the record and 'on (our) own independent judgment ... determine whether or not the findings made and the valuations and rates fixed by the commission are reasonable and proper.\" It was in this view that the court examined the 'main controversies' between the parties. 108 Pa. Super. Ct. at page 63, 165 A. 261, 266.\n Appellant attacks the finding of fair value upon the grounds that it was based solely on the original cost of the bridge property and that the amount paid by the appellant for the bridge was less than its fair value at that time and less than its fair value in 1930. It is not open to question that the reasonable cost of the bridge is good evidence of its value at the time of construction. And we have said that 'such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as there is no change in the level of applicable prices.' McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 411\n, 47 S.Ct. 144, 148; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 306\n, 53 S.Ct. 637. In this instance, as the state court observed, the utility is not 'a complicated system which has taken years to construct and enlarge, like a waterworks, or gas works, or electric light plant, or street railway system,' but is 'one structure, a reenforced concrete bridge, built, as it now is, without additions or improvements.' It appears that the bridge was built under a contract awarded in June, 1924, after competitive bidding, and was open to traffic in May, 1925. It is manifest that, when the commission made its first decision in June, 1926, the reasonable cost of the structure furnished a proper basis for determining its fair value. Of \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n the amount of the total valuation, at that time, of $767,800, the sum of $ 592,253 was taken as the construction cost on the basis of the actual outlay which included $566,301 paid to the contractor for the bridge and approaches. Appellant then insisted, and still insists, and it was shown, that the contractor sustained a loss. This was said to amount to about $ 143,000, that is, on labor and material, with overhead and depreciation of plant, as distinguished from a loss of profits. The evidence as to this was given by the contractor's auditor who attributed the loss to an unusual flood. He said: 'We would have made money probably if things would have gone alone smoothly without any high water.' The court accepted this explanation-the only one given-stating that 'a sudden rise in the Susquehanna river during the course of the work was responsible for the loss; without it there would have been a fair profit.' The court estimated that $20,000 additional, 'spent on the cofferdam construction,' would probably have obviated the loss, adding, 'We have increased the cofferdam expense to cover this amount.' Appellant complains that this statement was based on speculation and has no support in the record. But appellant's case is no stronger. The evidence gives no adequate ground for a conclusion that with reasonable care the loss could not have been prevented. The outstanding fact is that the contract was let in the usual way to the lowest bidder and the contractor received a substantial bonus ($ 22,050) for finishing the work before the stipulated date. To sustain the contention that the actual cost of the structure was less than a reasonable cost at the time, it was necessary for the appellant to give convicing proof. But such proof is lacking. We find no satisfactory basis for holding that the fair value of the property in June, 1926, was greater than $767,800 as it was then determined to be. \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 236]\n\u00a0\n The question is whether the proof shows that the value was greater in 1932. Appellant relies upon the estimate of engineers as to the cost of reproduction new of the physical property, as of September 1, 1929, together with 'all additional expenditures required over and above the bare cost of the physical property, to put the bridge in operation as an income-producing property.' This estimate gave a total cost of reproduction new less depreciation (the estimate being exclusive of two other elements of alleged intangible value described as 'attached business value' and 'location value') of $875,644.30. The commission's engineer made a similar estimate based upon prices prevailing during the last three months of 1930, which gave the cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, as $741,871. There were also charts showing the price trends for labor and materials for 1924 to 1930, inclusive. As summarized by the court, the evidence shows 'that in 1924, when the contract for the construction of the bridge was awarded, construction prices were reported as being 215% of the 1913 level; that in September, 1929, when appellant's reproduction cost estimate was made, they were 208% of the 1913 level; and that during the last three months of 1930 they fell to about 198%.' It would serve no useful purpose to review the details of the estimates of reproduction cost. The court carefully considered them and properly concluded that the trend in prices from 1924-5, when the bridge was built, to 1931-2, when the commission determined its present fair value, was 'downward rather than upward,' and that 'in the absence of proof that the prices paid for the construction of the bridge were abnormally low, there is no reason why in the short period of six years after its completion, with the tendency of prices for both material and labor being downward, there should be a radical increase in the fair value of the bridge for rate-making purposes.' We agree with this conclusion. \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 237]\n\u00a0\n It does not appear that the court made any deduction from the amount of the fair value as determined in 1926 by reason of the depreciation accrued during the succeeding years. There was controversy as to the extent of that depreciation. Appellant's engineers allowed for the four and one-half years which had elapsed to the time of their survey the sum of $16,282. The commission's engineer estimated the accrued depreciation for six years at $41,403. The court thought that the latter figure was 'nearer the actual accrued depreciation than the estimate of the company,' but the court apparently treated such accrued depreciation as largely offset by the 'extra allowance, over the contractor's bid, for concrete and cofferdams.' The court decided that no harm was done the appellant by leaving the fair value at $767,800.\n A distinct question is raised by a claim for what is called 'the special value of location,' in addition to the value of the bridge property thus far considered. This 'special value' was put at $100,000. It was based, according to appellant's engineers, upon the advantage that the location of the bridge has over any other point for miles in either direction because the river is narrower and the conditions of the river bed are more favorable. The engineers made their estimate upon what they thought one would be willing to pay for the present site, in preference to other sites in the vicinity, because of the additional cost of building a bridge elsewhere. It appears that the bridge is located in a rural area. It was originally constructed as a part of an extensive transportation system built by the commonwealth in the first half of the last century. As the court pointed out, the right to operate a toll bridge across the river at this point or elsewhere 'is fundamentally the gift of the Commonwealth, contained in appellant's franchise, and to attach a value \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 238]\n\u00a0\n to it would be to capitalize the franchise contrary to the provisions of the statute and the frequent decisions of the courts.' In building its new bridge, appellant took advantage of the traffic customs which had already been established. In the determination of the value of its property appellant was entitled to be allowed the fair market value of its real estate for all its available uses and purposes, which would include any element of value that it might have by reason of special adaptation to particular uses. But it was not entitled to an increase over this fair market value by virtue of the public use. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 451, et seq., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. The evidence, so far as it was properly addressed to the question of the fair market value of appellant's real estate, tended to support the amount allowed in the estimate of fair value reached by the commission and the court, and afforded no basis for a higher valuation. There is no warrant for an increase of fair market value by reason of opinions as to what it would cost to build a bridge elsewhere.\n We conclude that appellant has failed to show confiscation because of the amount used as a rate base.\n Second. Appellant complains that the amount prescribed for gross revenue is inadequate. Appellant contests the annual allowance for depreciation and the rate at which the fair return is calculated.\n The commission fixed the annual depreciation allowance at $7,678 and the court approved it. This amount equals 1 per cent. of the fair value. Appellant contends that the allowance should be 2 1\/2 per cent. of the value of the depreciable property on the straight line basis. The difference-on appellant's calculation of the fair value-amounts to $13,434. The court approved the ruling of the commission.\n There is no question as to the fact of depreciation. It was established, as respondent admits, that concrete \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 239]\n\u00a0\n bridges deteriorate from the moment of their completion; that there are chemical changes in their structure, absorptions of moisture and oxidation, both within the concrete and in the reenforcing iron covered by it, which cannot be stopped in their process or their effects removed. With this understanding, the question is as to the amount which should annually be allowed which will serve adequately to protect the investment from impairment due to age and use. Testimony was given by one of appellant's engineers that the average life of a concrete bridge was from 30 to 50 years; by another, that the period for which this bridge might be expected to remain useful was 'from 40 to 80 years,' he 'would not figure on over 40.' Another testified that physically the bridge 'might have a life of 50 to 100 years.' The commission's engineer estimated its life at from 40 to 50 years; for his computation he took an expectancy of 45 years. Respondent urges that the annual allowance asked by appellant was plainly too large and contrasts it with appellant's claim for accrued depreciation; that is, as the court stated, appellant's engineers 'allow an accrued depreciation for the four and a half years elapsing to the time of their survey of $16,282, but claim a yearly depreciation allowance thereafter of $ 21,210.' While it is recognized that accrued depreciation, as it may be observed and estimated at a given time, and an appropriate allowance of depreciation according to good accounting practice, need not be the same, there is no rule which requires an allowance to be made or continued which in the light of experience is shown to be extravagant. Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 158\n, 51 S.Ct. 65. After reviewing the testimony, and the methods of calculation which the parties respectively advocated, the court thus stated its conclusion: 'It (the commission) allowed $7,678 annually. This sum set aside each year, with 4 per cent. simple interest will \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 240]\n\u00a0\n in fifty years produce approximately $767,800, sufficient to rebuild the bridge as now valued. The straight line method advocated by the company will in fifty years with 4 per cent. simple interest produce a fund twice as great as that necessary to replace the bridge. The straight line method is often used for short-lived structures, or plants of a character that they can be restored from time to time to the original condition of efficiency. ... It is not so fair or equitable when applied to a long- lived structure or one that is disintegrating gradually and continuously and not capable of being restored to its original condition. The company may not be required to apply the income received from the depreciation fund to make up any deficit of operation (Board of Public Utility Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23\n, 46 S.Ct. 363), but it is not entitled to an allowance which, exclusive of interest earned on the fund, will be sufficient to rebuild the bridge, when its life is done, but only to such an allowance as will with reasonable interest added make a fund sufficient to replace the bridge, when it requires replacement.' In this view, the court thought the amount allowed by the commission to be 'fair and reasonable in the circumstances.' The court added that the commission had included in its allowance for operating expenses an item of $1,800 for 'maintenance.'\n The question of the amount which should be allowed annually for depreciation is a question of fact. Georgia Railway & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 633\n, 43 S.Ct. 680. In reviewing the findings of the state court we are not required to enter a debatable field of fact and to choose and prescribe an invariable method of computation. To justify the overruling of the determination of the state court we must be able to see that what has been done will produce the result which the Constitution forbids. Considering the nature of the property, and upon facts shown by the evidence, the state court has allowed \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 241]\n\u00a0\n appellant to reserve annually, and use for its own purposes, an amount which according to common experience may be expected to produce a sum adequate to replace the property on the expiration of its life. We find it impossible to say, from a constitutional standpoint, that another method should have been employed or a greater amount allowed.\n Appellant also insists that it is entitled to a rate of return of 9 per cent. upon the fair value of its property. The commission and the court decided that 7 per cent. was sufficient. We perceive no constitutional ground for complaint on that score. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488, 502\n, 53 S.Ct. 234; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 319\n, 320 S., 53 S.Ct. 637\n\n\n Third. The final attack is on the form of the commission's order. The commission fixed the amount of the annual gross revenue and then prescribed a tentative schedule of rates. \n2\n Appellant says that it is obvious that no one can tell in advance how many vehicles of different tariff classifications will pass over the bridge in a year and what annual gross revenue will be produced by a given schedule of rates. But, as the prescribed rates are expressly stated to be tentative, there is no ground for assuming that the commission will reject an application to make such changes in the schedule as experience may show to be necessary in order to produce the stipulated revenue. There is nothing in the order which requires that the test period should be a year or any definite time. From the statements at the bar it appears that appellant has not put the tentative schedule in effect and has made no application to the commission for a change in the schedule. If the allowance of gross revenue is adequate, as it has been found to be, there is no basis for complaint \n\n[291 U.S. 227, 242]\n\u00a0\n because of a schedule of rates which on application may be appropriately modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The order of the Public Service Commission, of February 2, 1932, is as follows:\n'That Clark's Ferry Bridge Company file, post and publish, effective thirty (30) days from date hereof, upon not less than one (1) day's notice to the public and this Commission, a new tariff calculated to produce an annual gross revenue of not more than $84,125.\n\n'It is further ordered: That said tariff contains as tentative rates intended to produce said gross annual revenue of $84,125, and effective until further action by this Commission or the Company in conformity with said determination of allowable gross revenue the following charges:\n\n'(1) A rate of 8 cents cash toll for all ordinary passenger automobiles and wagons now paying 10 cents.\n\n'(2) A ticket without time limit salable at the rate of two for 15 cents for all such automobiles and wagons.\n\n'(3) A 20-trip ticket non-transferable as between vehicles good any time within thirty (30) days from date of issue and salable for one dollar ($1) for all such automobiles and wagons.\n\n'(4) Rates for all other types of vehicles as are now provided in tariff P.S.C., Pa.

The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) became a law on February 24, 1919, with retroactive provisions as of January 1, 1918. Thereafter the petitioner filed an additional return in accordance with Treasury Decision 2797 (approved March 11, 1919, and quoted in our opinion in Nos. 37 to 39), showing an additional tax of $50,638.75. The Act of 1918 provides (section 250(d) that except in the case of fraud, 'the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made.' See, also, section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921. A deficiency assessment was imposed in May, 1921, which is admitted to have been timely, and another on May 26, 1926, which is contested as too late. There is also a contest in respect of both deficiencies growing out of delay in the collection. True, written waivers were in existence, adequate in form, which extended the date for assessment and collection until December 31, 1926. The taxpayer asserts, however, that they were procured by misrepresentation and signed without authority, and must therefore be ignored. \n\n[293 U.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n In an action to recover the tax paid by the petitioner under the two assessments in controversy, the District Court held (1) that irrespective of any waiver the term of limitation ran from the date of the additional return, and (2) that the waivers were valid and binding. 3 F.Supp. 508. On the authority of decisions in the Ninth Circuit (Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering (National Paper Products Co. v.

The second ruling we do not consider, the question of the validity of the waivers being still open for determination in the court below.\n The decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLUMBUS GAS & FUEL CO. v.

Calland, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. John L. Davies and James W. Huffman, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An ordinance of the city of Columbus, Ohio, approved by the electors at a referendum vote, provides that for five years from November 12, 1929, the price to be charged for natural gas shall be at the rate of 48 cents per thousand cubic feet with a minimum charge of 75 cents per month.\n The appellant, the Columbus Gas & Fuel Company, supplies gas to consumers in the city of Columbus, purchasing the gas from the Ohio Fuel Gas Company, an \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n affiliated corporation. Part of the gas so supplied is produced by the Ohio Fuel Gas Company in its own gas fields, part is bought by it from another affiliated corporation, the United Fuel Gas Company, and part from independent producers. The three affiliated corporations, i.e., the appellant, the Ohio, and the United, are subsidiaries of one parent company, the Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation.\n On December 31, 1929, the Columbus Gas & Fuel Company filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio in which it prayed that the rate prescribed by the ordinance be declared to be inadequate, and that such other rate be substituted as might be found to be just and reasonable. To dispose of that complaint there was need of an inquiry into the value of the complainant's property and into its operating expenses, which in turn necessitated an inquiry into the property and expenses of its affiliated corporations. Until some time in 1929, there had been a contract between the Columbus Company and the Ohio Fuel Gas Company whereby for gas delivered at the city gateway Columbus was to pay to Ohio 65 per cent. of the local retail rate, retaining 35 per cent. for itself as distributor. On the basis of a 48-cent retail rate, the gate rate would thus have amounted to 31.2 cents, and 16.8 cents would have been the return to the distributor. By consent, this agreement was canceled in 1929, and a gate rate of 45 cents was substituted. Most of this voluminous record grows out of a controversy as to the fairness of that charge. The Columbus Company and the Ohio being parts of a single affiliated system, their intercorporate agreement does not control the price to be paid by consumers if the rate thereby established is higher than a fair return.

The process of ascertaining that return di not end with an inquiry into the property and expenses of the affiliated seller. \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n It became necessary to examine the property and expenses of a second affiliated company, the United Fuel Gas Company, which produces gas in West Virginia and sells to the Ohio Company; delivery being made at the Ohio river. The price charged for this gas, which was afterwards mingled with the gas from other fields, is known as the 'river rate,' and is so described in the record. What was fairly due from Columbus for gas delivered at the gateway is not susceptible of ascertainment without tracing the supply to its sources far away.\n The commission followed these inquiries through all their elusive ramifications. Its members were in agreement as to the value of the appellant's property to be included in the base. They were also substantially in agreement as to all the items of operating expenses with the exception of the price to be paid to the affiliated seller. If that item was laid aside, a rate of 16 cents plus per thousand cubic feet would assure to the appellant the enjoyment of a fair return. Division of opinion came in estimating the price at the gateway and the river. As to that item of expense a majority held the view that a fair price to be paid to the affiliated seller was 39.02 cents per thousand cubic feet, which, added to a rate of 16.02 cents to be retained for distribution, would make the retail price in Columbus 55.04 cents, or 7.02 cents in excess of the rate established by the ordinance. A minority opinion fixed the price at the gateway at 31.70 cents per thousand cubic feet, and the total retail price at 47.95 cents. An order was made, in accordance with the report of the majority, whereby the ordinance rate of 48 cents was declared to be inadequate, and a rate of 55 cents, with an additional charge of 5 cents per thousand cubic feet if monthly bills were not paid within a fixed time, and a monthly minimum charge of 75 cents without discount, became a substituted schedule. \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n Cross-appeals followed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The city of Columbus, which had intervened in the proceeding, appealed upon the ground that the ordinance rate should have been upheld as adopted by the city and approved by the electors. The Columbus Gas & Fuel Company appealed upon the ground that the substituted schedule was too low, and that nothing less than 69.59 cents per thousand cubic feet would yield a fair return. United States Constitution, Amendment 14. The Supreme Court of Ohio held in favor of the city, adopting for the most part the conclusions of the minority commissioner, though going in some respects beyond them. It held that an adequate price at the gateway would be 31.70 cents or less. In arriving at that conclusion, it set aside the finding of the commission that the operating expenses of the affiliated seller should include a yearly allowance of $4,158,954, to amortize the depletion of the gas fields and appurtenant equipment. It held also that the 'river price' paid by the Ohio Company to the United, which had been fixed by the majority commissioners at 22 cents, was too high to the extent of 4.21 cents; thus reducing that item to 17.79 cents per thousand cubic feet. Going farther, it held that all the members of the commission had erred in appraising the gas fields known as class No. 11 at $25 an acre, and that the valuation of the leases should have been made on the basis of book cost, excluding all leases acquired as a reserve and not presently in use. Cf. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra. It held also that in fixing the price of gas delivered at the gateway there should have been an additional reduction that would make appropriate allowance for the lower cost of transmission to Columbus as compared with points more distant, though the opinion does not furnish us with any workable formula whereby to put the precept into force. \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n As the upshot of the whole matter, the court arrived at the concl sion that the ordinance rate was valid, and remanded the proceeding. 127 Ohio St. 109, 187 N.E. 7. There was an appeal to this court, which was dismissed upon the ground that the order was not final. March 19, 1934, \n291 \nU.S. 651\n, 54 S.Ct. 559, 78 L.Ed. --. Thereupon the Supreme Court of Ohio amended its decree by striking out the remand, and substituting a direction that the rate be established in accordance with the ordinance. Upon an appeal from the decree as thus amended the cause is here again.\n Many of the questions urged on this appeal have been considered very recently by this court in disposing of an appeal by an affiliated company. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio (April 30, 1934) \n292 \nU.S. 290\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 653, 78 L.Ed. --. In so far as the cases overlap, we refer to that opinion without repetition of its reasoning. But along with many features of identity there are important points of difference. The issue in the Dayton Case was one as to the right of the gas company to put into effect a new schedule higher than the rate level previously prevailing. The issue in this case is one as to the right of the municipality to establish a new schedule lower than any level accepted by the company. All that the state court had to do in order to uphold the determination in the Dayton Case was to reach the conclusion that adherence to the old rates would not result in confiscation. What it said as to the possibility of excluding an amortization allowance and several other contested items did not determine the result. 'If the evidence would have been adequate to uphold a lower rate, a fortiori it was adequate to uphold the rate prescribed.' Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra. Here, on the other hand, the decision of the state court reverses the determination of the commission, and in so doing excludes important items, such as an amortization charge and others, which had received allowance there. Not a little that was put aside in the Dayton Case as unrelated to the re- \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n sult must have consideration and decision now. To those items we turn first, postponing for the moment what will have to be said later as to items less contentious.\n\n 1. \nAmortization, Depletion, and Unoperated Leases.\n We have seen in the Dayton Case that, in determining the price to be paid for gas delivered at the gateway, the commission included among the operating expenses of the affiliated seller an annual allowance of $4,158, 954, to amortize the value of leaseholds No. 1 (the only leaseholds then in use) and of the well-structures and equipment used in connection therewith, and thus provide a fund that would restore the depleted capital when the gas had been exhausted. The same allowance was made here.\n Upon the appeal by the city of Columbus to the Supreme Court of Ohio, the item thus allowed was excluded altogether. The court did not deny that without the creation of a fund to replenish wasting assets the affiliated seller would be left with only a salvage value for leases, wells, and fittings after the exhaustion of the gas. It put its judgment upon the ground that the statute of Ohio defining the powers of the commission and the method of appraisal makes no provision for depletion (Gen. Code Ohio ,  499-9 to 499-13), and that the statute, and nothing else, gives the applicable rule. We may assume in submission to the holding of that court that the amortization allowance must be rejected if the rate-making process is to conform to the rule prescribed by statute, irrespective of any other. That assumption being made, the conclusion does not follow that the statutory procedure may set at naught restrictions imposed upon the states and upon all their governmental organs by the Constitution of the nation.\n To withhold from a public utility the privilege of including a depletion allowance among its operating expenses, while confining t to a return of 6 1\/2 per cent. upon the value of its wasting assets, is to take its property away \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n from it without due process of law, at least where the waste is inevitable and rapid. The commission has found that the life expectancy of the operated gas fields is only there years and two months. If that holding is correct, the owner of the exhausted fields will find itself in a brief time with wells and leases that are worthless and with no opportunity in the interval to protect itself against the impending danger of exhaustion. Plainly the state must either surrender the power to limit the return or else concede to the business a compensating privilege to preserve its capital intact. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 29 S.Ct. 148, 152. Cf. Helvering v. Falk, \n291 \nU.S. 183\n, 54 S.Ct. 353. There is nothing to the contrary of this in cases such as Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 108 S., 53 S.Ct. 74; Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399\n, 34 S.Ct. 136, and Goldfield Consolidated Mines Co. v. Scott, \n247 \nU.S. 126\n, 38 S. Ct. 465. The profits of a mine may be treated as income rather than as capital if the state chooses so to classify them and to tax them on that basis. This is far from saying that in the process of rate making depletion of the capital may be disregarded by the agencies of government in figuring the interest returned on the investment. 'Before coming to the question of profit at all the company is entitled to earn a sufficient sum annually to provide not only for current repairs, but for making good the depreciation and replacing the parts of the property when they come to the end of their life.' Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., supra; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co. (April 30, 1934) \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, 54 S.Ct. 658, 78 L.Ed. --. It is idle to argue that a company using up its capital in the operations of the year will have received the same return as one that at the end of the year has its capital intact and interest besides.\n We hold that a fair price for gas delivered at the gateway includes a reasonable allowance for the depletion of the operated gas fields and the concomitant depreciation of the wells and their equipment. What that allowance shall be has not yet been considered by the \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Ohio, invested with jurisdiction to review the law and facts. Hocking Valley R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 100 Ohio St. 321, 326, 126 N.E. 397. The court will have to say in the light of all the circumstances whether the amount to be allowed shall be the same as that fixed by the commission ($4,158,954), or something less or greater. It may disagree with the commission either as to the value of the fields or as to the life expectancy of the supply of gas. There will be power, we assume, to direct another hearing if the basis for an intelligent judgment is lacking in the record. When the allowance has been fixed nd has been charged to operating expenses, it will supply the answer to other questions in controversy now. There will be no need, when that is done, to include in operating expenses a separate provision for the payment of 'delay rentals' upon leases in reserve. This is so for reasons that were explained in the Dayton Case. 'Operating expenses are magnified unduly if they cover both the fund and the payments that are made out of it.' Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra. There will be no need in the computation of the rate base to include the market or the book value of fields not presently in use, unless the time for using them is so near that they may be said, at least by analogy, to have the quality of working capital. The arrival of that time cannot be known in advance through the application of a formula, but within the margin of a fair discretion must be determined for every producer by the triers of the facts in the light of all the circumstances. \n2\n The burden is on the gas company to supply whatever estimony \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n may be necessary to enable court or board to make the requisite division. Leases bought with income, the proceeds of the sale of gas, and thus paid for in last analysis through the contributions of consumers, ought not in fairness to be capitalized until present or imminent need for use as sources of supply shall have brought them into the base upon which profits must be earned. To capitalize them sooner is to build the rate structure of the business upon assets held in idleness to abide the uses of the future. At times the immediate purpose of buying up extensive tracts is to forestall or stifle competition that might bring the prices down. There is adequate compensation for investment so remotely beneficial when the cost of renewing fields in present operation, and thus replenishing the capital, is paid out of gross earnings as an expense of operation, with a proportionate increase of the prices to be charged for gas thereafter. Cf. Natural Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 95 W.Va. 557, 569, 570, 121 S.E. 716; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm. (D.C.) 14 F.(2d) 209, 221; Erie City v. Public Service Comm., 278 Pa. 512, 531, 123 A. 471. Postponement of other profit until the stage of imminent or present use is not an act of confiscation, but a legitimate exercise of legislative judgment. Certainly that is so when the amortization fund has been computed with reasonable liberality, and is large enough to make provision for adequate reserves. If the company is not satisfied to have the depletion allowance thus applied in renewal of its life, it may divide the fund among the stockholders and wind the business up. It cannot get its capital back at the expense of the consuming public and also at the same expense provide itself with a fresh supply to keep the business going.\n\n 2. \nThe River Rate.\n We have seen that the Ohio Company, when buying gas from the United Company, an affiliated corporation, \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 408]\n\u00a0\n paid an agreed rate (26 1\/2 cents per thousand cubic feet) for delivery at the river.\n A majority of Ohio commission, following in substance a decision of the commission for West Virginia, fixed the reasonable price for gas so delivered at 22 cents per thousand cubic feet, and computed operating expenses accordingly.\n The West Virginia commission, with the approval of the Supreme Court of that state (City of Charleston v. Public Service Comm., 110 W.Va. 245, 159 S.E. 38), had permitted an annual depreciation allowance of 1.12 per cent. and a depletion or amortization allowance of 4.15 per cent.\n The Supreme Court of Ohio struck out these allowances, thereby reducing the rate payable at the river from 22 cents to 17.79 cents. In so doing it adhered to the ruling, announced elsewhere in the same opinion, that under the statutes of Ohio amortization is not permissible to replenish wasting assets. For reasons already stated, these items should be restored with such modification in amount as may be found to be appropriate upon a survey of the evidence.\n The claim is made by the appellant that the river price remains inadequate after adding the excluded items for depreciation and depletion, and that the price should be fixed in accordance with the contract. There is nothing to show that the Supreme Court of Ohio held itself bound by the determination of the West Virginia commission, or failed to exercise an independent judgment upon the evidence before it. The testimony and exhibits in West Virginia had been read into the record. We must presume they were considered. Nothing now before us justifies a finding that they fail, with the exceptions already noted, to sustain what has been done.\n\n 3. \nAllocation.\n Upon the hearing before the commission, the city made the claim that, in the appraisal of the property of \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n the Ohio Fuel Gas Company, the production property should be allocated between Columbus and other municipalities upon the basis of the sales, but that transmission property should be allocated upon the basis of mileage, multiplied by the peak demand at the place of distribution. In opposition, the appellant contended that allocation on the basis of mileage was impracticable, and so the commission unanimously held.\n The opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio, though giving its approval to the principle of mileage allocation favored by the city, does not furnish us with any formula that would make the principle a working one when applied to the Ohio system. If such a formula can be discovered, it may reduce the price at the Columbus gateway by an amount as yet unknown. Enough for present purposes that it is not discovered yet.\n The formula proposed by the city, and, it seems, sanctioned by the court, would estimate the mileage by starting from a place described as the last point of major compression, and thence proceeding to the town or city where distribution is to be made. In its application to the Ohio system, such a measurement of mileage is unrelated to realities. In the first place, the compressor, wherever situated, is not the source of the supply. Gas may have traveled hundreds of miles before the process of compression starts. Conceivably these inequalities might be corrected by the aid of some law of averages. There has been no endeavor to correct them here. In the second place, no one municipality is served by any one compressor unaided by another. The system of transmission maintained by the Ohio Company with its 38 compressors scattered through the state is organized as a unit, and mileage from any single point would be an arbitrary measure of the value of the property devoted to transmission without including in the reckoning the mileage embraced in the system as a whole. \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 410]\n\u00a0\n Nothing to the contrary was held in Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488\n, 53 S.Ct. 234, or in United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm. of Kentucky (D.C.) 13 F.(2d) 510, 522. A municipality may be treated as the unit for determining the rates to be charged to its inhabitants. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, supra. This does not mean that allocation of values may be made by recourse to an arbitrary formula. The value of the property devoted to transmission may be measured upon the basis of mileage multiplied by demand. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm. of Kentucky, supra, where the experts are stated to have agreed upon the method of division. This does not mean that a like basis will be approved when mileage contributing to the supply is omitted from the reckoning.\n\n 4. \nWhat has been said exhausts the points of difference between the decree and the report.\n Other objections have been urged in respect of other points as to which the commission and the court concurred. What has been said as to the points in respect of which they differed has brought us to the conclusion that the rate as fixed by the ordinance must be supplemented by an allowance for amortization or depletion. The appellant insists, however, that even this addition will not serve, and that confiscation will result unless there is an allowance of other items which the court and the commission have united in rejecting. Whether that contention may be upheld is the question next before us.\n Objection is made that the annual depreciation allowance ($667,612) for depreciable property other than well structures and equipment is less than is necessary to maintain the property intact.\n We considered this objection in the Dayton Case and overruled it. In this case, however, the appellant submits a computation which is intended to prove that in \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 411]\n\u00a0\n measuring depreciation certain items of property, such as land and rights of way, have been omitted altogether. The re ord tells us nothing as to the location of this property or its present or prospective uses. Whether it has relation to the operated fields or the fields to be opened in the future there is nothing to inform us. Certainly land and rights of way may not be characterized as wasting assets in the absence of explanation that would stamp that quality upon them. In saying this we do not forget that an abandonment of the business might bring about a sharp reduction in the value of the plant, aside from well structures and equipment. There is nothing to show, however, that any such abandonment is planned or even reasonably probable. On the contrary, the course of business makes it clear that, when the fields in use shall be exhausted, the business will extend to others, and this for an indefinite future, or certainly a future not susceptible of accurate estimation. We find no reason for a revision of our conclusion that the depreciation reserve has not been proved to be inadequate.\n Objection is made also as to the disallowance of a going value for the affiliated companies. Going value was excluded both by court any by commission as an item of property to be separately appraised and separately reported. The record justifies a holding that it was reflected in the other items and particularly in the appraisal of the physical assets as part of an assembled whole. Cf. Hardin-Wyandot Lighting Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 118 Ohio St. 592, 603, 162 N.E. 262.3 This, we think, was adequate. \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 412]\n\u00a0\n The going value of the Columbus property must have been small, if not nominal, for the business, though broader in its beginnings, had been narrowed in the course of years to one of distribution only. Cf. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., supra.\n The going value of the Ohio Fuel Gas Company was placed by the appellant's witness at a figure so high ($12,000,000) as to be excessive almost on its face, and the impression of exaggeration is confirmed when the appraisal as a whole is resolved into its elements.\n Thus, some of the appellant's experts have included interest or return unearned during the business development period as a factor contributing to going value; one witness placing this factor as high as $6, 300,000. Their method of computation was condemned by this Court in Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 394\n, 42 S.Ct. 351, 354, in very similar conditions. No evidence was offered by the appellant that expenses had been incurred 'in overcoming initial difficulties incident to operation and in securing patronage.' Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra. On the contrary, there is evidence as to the business in Columbus that customers were clamoring for an extension of the service to such an extent that a suit was begun for a mandatory injunction. The sales by the Ohio Company and the United to the extent of more than half in value were made to their own affiliates. In such circumstances, the base value is not greater because of losses at the beginning than it is where there is no development cost because the success of the business has been 'instant and continuous.' Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, page 396 of 258 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 351, 355.\n Other experts, who reject the factor of interest unearned during the period of development, build their estimates of going value upon the cost of attaching new customers to the business, a cost not taken from the \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 413]\n\u00a0\n books, but merely presumed or estimated at widely variant amounts. So far as such expenses had been actually incurred by any affiliated company, they had already been included as part of the cost of operation. So far as value had been ad ed above the moneys thus expended, there was not even approximate precision in measuring its amount. The burden of building up patronage may be negligible where there is little competition with any other producer or with other kinds of fuel. City of Charleston v. Public Service Comm., supra.\n Other experts, testifying to an aggregate, without assigning a proportion to the contributory factors, give estimates so vague as to be little more than guesses, one of them, for illustration, holding to the opinion that ten would be a fair percentage, yet unable to give a reason why the amount should not be less or greater.\n From the testimony as a whole, one gains a definite impression that the opinions are derived for the most part from a professed experience and understanding of business conditions generally, and very little from any knowledge of the 'history and circumstances of the particular enterprise.' Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Comm., supra. Cf. City of Houston v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., \n259 \nU.S. 318, 325\n, 42 S.Ct. 486.\n We cannot find that the commission and the court went beyond the bounds of a legitimate discretion in putting aside these estimates as too uncertain to be followed.\n Objection is made that there was an inadequate allowance ($68,196) for the annual depreciation of the physical assets in Columbus.\n The value of those assets, together with general overheads, as fixed by the commission, was $3,927,647. The depreciation reserve at the end of 1929 was $1,166,762.30, and at the end of 1930 $1,251,886.77. On the other hand, the accrued depreciation (which was taken at the com- \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 414]\n\u00a0\n pany's own figures) was only $710,659 as compared with a reproduction cost new of $4,638,326.\n The commission determined that, in view of the large reserve and the good condition of the plant, the allowance asked for by the company ($174, 880.24) was too high, and that $68,196 was adequate.\n This is slightly less, it is true, than the amount ($88,695.03) suggested by a witness for the city, but the commission was at liberty to form its own judgment. In any event, the rule of de minimis is applicable where the difference is so trivial in its effect upon the rate. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., supra.\n Other objections not covered by the opinion in the Dayton Case are concerned almost wholly with inferences of fact as to which the concurrent conclusions of the court and the commission must be accepted as conclusive.\n We have not been unmindful in what has been written that the affiliated sellers (the Ohio and the United) are not parties to this proceeding nor bound by our decree. None the less, under the law of Ohio, they must serve their affiliated buyers at reasonable rates. Ohio Mining Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 106 Ohio St. 138, 146, 150, 140 N.E. 143. In so far as a reasonable rate is something other or higher than one not strictly confiscatory (Banton v. Belt Line R. Co., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 423\n, 45 S. Ct. 534), the difference, if any, is determined with finality by the appointed officers of the state. The only question for us in these intercorporate relations is whether the rejection of the contract as a measure of the appellant's operating expenses was a wholly arbitrary act, and thus equivalent in its effect to an act of confiscation. Neither our judgment nor that of the state court operates directly upon the contract by destroying its obligation. The measure \n\n[292 U.S. 398, 415]\n\u00a0\n of judicial power, in the absence of the affiliated sellers, is the determination of the expenses to be borne by the consuming public.\n There being error in the reduction of the appellant's operating expenses by the refusal to make provision for replenishing the wasting assets of its affiliated companies, the decree is reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Ohio for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This classification is explained in Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The state court will be in a position to determine the unoperated acreage analogous to working capital when it has ascertained the life expectancy of present sources of supply.\n If there is a change in the allowance for annual depreciation, there may be need for a corresponding change in accrued depreciation. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Going value, of course, is not to be confused with good will (Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Comm., \n289 \nU.S. 287, 314\n, 53 S.Ct. 637, 647), and is not to be 'read into every balance sheet as a perfunctory addition' (Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., supra). \n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA v.

The taxes were assailed under the commerce clause (art. 1,  8, cl. 3) and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of the trial court, holding the taxes to be invalid, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals. 161 Va. 718, 736, 167 S.E. 268, 270, 172 S.E. 927. This Court granted certiorari. \n292 \nU.S. 619\n, 54 S.Ct. 773\n\n\n The tax on income was held to be invalid upon the nonfederal ground that it was unauthorized by the state law. But, in dealing with the capital tax, the state court concluded that it was 'unnecessary to pass upon the construction of section 73 of the Tax Code (Code Va. 1930, appendix, p. 2147) under which the assessment was made.' While observing 'a strong leaning and intent on the part of the lawmakers to exclude such corporations as the sales company from state tax action,' the court did not put its decision upon a nonfederal ground, but based it explicitly upon the ground that the tax was invalid under the Federal Constitution. The court said: 'We prefer to rest the decision of the validity of the capital tax here considered upon the broad proposition that it is invalid because it is a burden upon interstate commerce and forbidden by the Constitution of the United States.' As the decision was thus expressly rested, not upon the inapplicability of the state law, but upon a determination of the federal \n\n[293 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n question, by which the bar of the Federal Constitution was erected against the levy of the tax, this Court has jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. 344(b); Henderson Bridge Co. v.

No coal of any consequence is sold in Virginia, and none of the coal is located in Virginia at the time of sale. Nor does respondent own or operate warehouses or coal storage yards in Virginia. It does not retail, buy, or own coal, but sells coal for its foreign principals in carload lots f.o.b. mines for a continuous journey between points outside of Virginia. When coal is sold through the Cincinnati office, contracts are forwarded to the Lynchburg office for approval, and orders are sent to the mines for shipment. The record of sales and an account with the mines from which the coal is shipped are kept in the office at Lynchburg. Purchasers agree to pay monthly. Respondent collects the money and deposits it in bank in Lynchburg, and from these proceeds the mines are paid for the coal, less respondent's commissions.\n The state court held that, while respondent was doing business in Virginia, that business 'arises out of, is inseparable from and incidental only to, the principal business of selling coal in interstate commerce.' The court said that a corporation engaged in interstate commerce \n\n[293 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n 'may be taxed by a state on (1) its real estate and tangible personal property situated in the taxing state, and (2) upon its intangible personal property, if in the taxing state it does intrastate business or has any appreciable real or tangible property. But if it has no real or tangible property and does no intrastate business in the taxing state, it cannot be taxed by that state.'\n\n 1. \nThe tax in question, styled a 'capital tax,' is an ad valorem property tax. It is a state tax of 'seventy-five cents on every one hundred dollars of the actual value' of the capital of any trade or business except that otherwise specifically taxed or exempted from taxation. Section 73, Tax Code of Virginia (Code 1930, appendix p. 2147). By 'capital' is meant the property described. The property which is subject to the tax consists of (1) the inventory of stock on hand; (2) the excess of all bills and accounts receivable over bills and accounts payable; (3) all money on hand and on deposit; and (4) all other taxable personal property of any kind whatever, including all choses in action, equities, demands, and claims, but excluding certain property specifically mentioned in the statute. Real estate used in trade or business is not held to be capital under the statute, but is to be listed and taxed as other real estate; and tangible personal property used in trades and business mentioned in the statute is to be listed exclusively for local taxation.\n In the instant case, no property was assessed under the first and fourth categories of the statute, for respondent had none. The assessment, as the state court found, was based 'on the money on hand, plus the excess of the bills and accounts receivable over the bills and accounts payable.' The state court treated the tax as a property tax, saying that 'it must be borne in mind that the tax sought to be imposed is one upon property which is entirely intangible and which is used wholly and exclusively in interstate commerce.' \n\n[293 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n 2. Respondent's ownership of the property assessed is not disputed. No question is presented on this point merely because of the conduct of its business as a sales agency. The ownership of the property was the subject of a stipulation in the trial court, and it was agreed 'that the property constituting the basis of the assessment on capital was, on the dates in question, the property of the sales company.'\n\n 3. \nThe money on hand, and the bills and accounts receivable, the excess of which over bills and accounts payable was assessed, had their situs in Virginia. Respondent is a domestic corporation with its principal office in that state where the proceeds of its accounts receivable are collected and deposited in bank. Such credits and accounts are regarded as situated at the domicile of the creditor, and that domicile establishes a basis for taxation. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n, 498; Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S.Ct. 40, L.R.A. 1918C, 124; Maguire v. Trefry, \n253 \nU.S. 12, 16\n, 40 S. Ct. 417; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 48 S.Ct. 410; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 591\n, 592 S., 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; Beidler v. Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S.Ct. 54; Lawrence v. Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 280 S., 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374.\n\n 4. \nProperty having its situs within the taxing state is not exempt from a nondiscriminatory property tax merely because the property is used in interstate commerce. Corporations engaged in interstate commerce should bear their property share of the burdens of the government under whose protection they conduct their operations, and nondiscriminatory taxation of their property, although used in interstate commerce, as this Court has frequently said, affects that commerce only incidentally and is not inconsistent with the constitutional immunity from the imposition of direct burdens. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 696\n, 15 S.Ct. 360; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 220\n, 17 S.Ct. 305; Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 \nU.S. 160, 163\n, 23 S.Ct. 817; United \n\n[293 U.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 344\n, 32 S.Ct. 211; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S.Ct. 373; Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165, 166\n, 167 S., 39 S.Ct. 62; Eastern Air Transport v. Tax Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 147, 152\n, 52 S.Ct. 340.\n Such taxation may embrace intangible as well as tangible property. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n166 \nU.S. 185, 218\n, 219 S., 17 S.Ct. 604; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra; Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, supra. It is not the character of the property that makes it subject to such a tax, but the fact that the property has its situs within the state and that the owner should give appropriate support to the government that protects it. That duty is not less when the property is intangible than when it is tangible. Nor are we able to perceive any sound reason for holding that the owner must have real estate or tangible property within the state in order to subject its intangible property within the state to taxation.\n We are dealing, as we have said, with an ad valorem property tax, and not with a privilege tax. Respondent is not taxed upon the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, and decisions, cited by the state court, holding such taxes to be invalid, are not apposite. Thus, in Ozark Pipe Line Corporation v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.Ct. 184, the tax was held to be bad as one imposed 'upon the privilege or right to do business' of a corporation engaged only in interstate commerce. Id., page 562 of 266 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 184, 185. The same principle of protection was applicable in Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203, 216\n, 45 S.Ct. 477, 44 A.L.R. 1219. Compare Anglo-Chilean Corporation v. Alabama, \n288 \nU.S. 218\n, 53 S.Ct. 373. Decisions holding invalid license fees or excise taxes measured in such a manner as to burden interstate commerce and to attempt to exert the taxing authority with respect to business and property beyond the jurisdiction of the state are also inapplicable. Cf. Air-Way Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 45 S.Ct. 12. Nor are we here concerned \n\n[293 U.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n with the question which has been discussed in cases dealing with the effect of the taxation of gross receipts derived from interstate commerce. 1 Without going into that question, it is sufficient again to point out that the tax is not laid upon gross receipts but upon the 'excess of all bills and accounts receivable over bills and accounts payable.' The effect upon interstate commerce, as in other instances of nondiscriminatory property taxation, is at most indirect and incidental. See United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 329\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S.Ct. 221.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 \nU.S. 230\n, 7 S.Ct. 857; Philadelphia & Southern Mail Steamship Co. v.

PEOPLE(1934)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Frederick D. Silver, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hiram T. Gilbert and Harris F. Williams, both of Chicago, Ill ., for the People of Illinois.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action of debt brought by the state of Illinois, in a court of that state, against the Concordia Fire Insurance Company, to recover taxes levied on the net receipts of the latter from its insurance agencies in Cook county, Illinois, during annual periods ending April 30 in each of the years 1923-1927. The defendant interposed a plea of nil debet. The cause was heard by the court without a jury under a stipulation entitling the defendant to introduce any evidence which would be admissible in equity under appropriate pleadings, and enabling the court to give effect to equitable principles and render judgment in conformity to the evidence. The court found the issues for the defendant and gave judgment accordingly. The Supreme Court of the state disapproved that judgment and in its stead entered one awarding the plaintiff a recovery of smaller taxes than were claimed for the years ending April 30 in 1923-1926 and of the full tax claimed for the year ending April 30 in 1927. 350 Ill. 365, 183 N.E. 241. The defendant then sought and was allowed an appeal to this Court; the ground for the appeal being that the state court overruled the defendant's claim that the state statute, under which the taxes were levied, when construed and applied as sustaining them (it was so construed and applied by that court), conflicts with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The defendant is a Wisconsin insurance corporation and, conformably to its charter and to licenses from Illi- \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n nois, has been engaged for several years in conducting in Cook county in the latter state the business of insuring against fire, marine, and inland navigation risks and various so-called casualty risks. Its receipts from that business consisted only of premiums received on policies issued.\n The taxes in question were levied under section 30 of a statute of March 11, 1869,1 entitled 'An Act to incorporate and to govern fire, marine and inland navigation insurance companies doing business in the state of Illinois.' Several sections of the act relate to the creation and regulation of domestic corporations, and others relate to the licensing, taxing, etc., of foreign corporations. Section 30 provides in respect of foreign corporations doing business in the state that in the month of May, annually, 'the amount of the net receipts' of their local agencies shall be entered on the local tax lists and be 'subject to the same rate of taxation, for all purposes,-state, county, town and municipal-that other personal property is subject to at the place where located.'\n Throughout the years 1923-1927, and before, it was the uniform practice of officers and boards engaged in listing and assessing personal property for taxation to treat and list 60 per cent. of the fair cash value as the 'full value'; and in the years 1923-1926 these officers and boards, pursuant to the direction of a statute of 1919,2 treated and listed one-half of such 'full value' as the 'assessed value.' By these processes 30 per cent. of the fair cash value uniformly was made the basis of personal property taxes in 1923-1926.3 The same processes were applied in respect of real property. In 1927, before the \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n assessments of that year were completed, the statute directing that 50 per cent. of the listed 'full value' be taken as the assessed value was repealed,4 and therefore was not applied in making assessments in that year. But the practice of taking 60 per cent. of the fair cash value as the true value was continued and applied in the assessments of that year as it had been in those of earlier years.\n In the years 1923-1926 the defendant made returns of its net receipts from fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance. The amounts so returned were accepted by the assessing officers as correct, but were not scaled down to 60 per cent. or further reduced to one-half of 60 per cent., as was done in the assessment of other property. On the contrary, taxes were levied on the full amounts reported in the returns.\n In 1927 the defendant made a return of its net receipts from fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance, the amount reported being $76,291. It arrived at this amount by deducting operating expenses from gross receipts, the former being treated in the computation as 54 per cent. of the latter. On this basis its gross receipts were $165,850.5 The amount returned as net receipts was accepted as correct by the board of assessors of the county and 50 per cent. thereof was listed by that body as the assessed value. But that assessment, as will appear presently, was not approved by the next superior body, the board of review of the county.\n In November, 1927, the defendant was cited by the board of review to appear before it on December 15 at a hearing on a proposed reassessment of the net receipts in the years covered by the returns of 1923-1926, and also on a review of the assessment by the board of assessors \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n of the net receipts in the year covered by the return of 1927. The defendant appeared in response to the citation, and in view of the importance which has been given to the hearing it will be described at some length.\n At the hearing the defendant had full opportunity to support and supplement its returns by a further showing respecting its gross receipts and the deductions rightly to be made in determining the net receipts. But it chose to stand on its returns and made no additional showing. It freely conceded that the returns included receipts from fire, marine and inland navigation insurance but not from casualty insurance. And it also conceded that the deductions made by it in computing the net receipts included some items, such as overhead expenses and reinsurance costs, the deduction of which had been and still was the subject of diverging opinions.\n A full report of the hearing before the board was produced in evidence at the trial of this cause and is set forth in the record. The report shows that-apart from a controversy over the construction and constitutional validity of the taxing statute-the matters brought to the board's attention were: (1) Defendant's failure to include and state separately in its returns the receipts from casualty insurance; (2) defendant's failure to specify with greater particularity the expenses deducted by it in computing the net receipts; (3) a contention that the receipts from casualty insurance should be included in the computation of the taxable net receipts; and (4) a contention that the deductions made for operating expenses were excessive.\n One participant in the hearing, who had investigated and studied the matter, made evidential statements to the board tending to show that the defendant's receipts from fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance were about 75 per cent. of its total receipts, the remainder coming from casualty insurance, and that the operating expenses of an \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 541]\n\u00a0\n insurance business like that of the defendant in Cook county averaged about 30 per cent. of the gross receipts. These statements, although informal, were of such a nature that, under repeated rulings of the Supreme Court of the state, the board could consider them and give some weight to them-particularly as the defendant presented no showing to the contrary beyond referring to its returns which were meager and practically silent on the points to which the statements were directed.\n Because of a contention which will be noticed later on it should be stated in this connection that in the hearing before the board the defendant neither claimed that losses paid to policy holders should be deducted in determining net receipts nor presented any showing or statement of the amount of such losses.\n After the hearing the board made corrected assessments of the net receipts for the years covered by the returns of 1923-1926; but as the Supreme Court of the state held this action of the board was of no effect, save as it brought the original assessments forward and attached them to the 1927 roll without affecting their original validity or force, the corrected assessments do not require further notice.\n Coming to the net receipts for the year ending April 30, 1927, the board fixed their amount at $121,550, instead of $76,291 as stated in the return; and without scaling or debasing the amount so fixed the board listed it as their assessed value.\n The record makes it plain that the board in fixing the net receipts for that year at an amount much larger than was stated in the return proceeded on the theory and conviction that the receipts from casualty insurance, which were omitted from the return, should be included in computing the taxable net receipts, and that the deductible operating expenses, which the defendant had regarded as 54 per cent. of the gross receipts, were only about 30 per cent. of such receipts. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 542]\n\u00a0\n In Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, 327 Ill. 590, 158 N.E. 849, 6 which preceded the decision in the present case about five years, the Supreme Court of the state in considering and applying section 30 now in question ruled that the reductions, by scaling and debasement, applied in the assessment of other personal property should be applied to net receipts of foreign insurance corporations; and on that ground the court condemned a tax of $7,184.18, where such reductions were not made, and awarded a recovery of $2,155.24, which would have been the tax had the net receipts been reduced like the value of other personal property. In stating the reason for its ruling the court said (pages 601-602 of 327 Ill ., 158 N.E. 849, 853): 'Section 30 provides that: 'Net receipts ... shall be ... subject to the same rate of taxation, ... that other personal property is subject to at the place where located.' The use of the word 'other' indicates that the net receipts were to be considered as personal property and treated the same as other personal property. Clearly, this provision means that not only the percentage of the rate, but the basis of the valuation shall be the same. Taxing by a uniform rule requires uniformity, not only in the rate of taxation, but also uniformi y in the mode of the assessment upon the taxable valuation. Uniformity in taxing implies equality in the burden of taxation, and this equality of burden cannot exist without uniformity in the mode of the assessment as well as in the rate per cent. of taxation. Greene v. L. & I.R.R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S.Ct. 673, Ann.Cas. 1917E, 88; Boyer v. Boyer, \n113 \nU.S. 689\n, 5 S.Ct. 706; Cummings v. National Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n; Exchange Bank v. Hines, 3 Ohio St. 1. Section 30 and the law of 18987 should be construed together, and \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 543]\n\u00a0\n when the net receipts are placed upon the tax list they are to be treated as personal property valuation, and are to be scaled, debased, and treated the same as other personal property by the taxing officials.'\n In that connection the court approvingly quoted from its decision in People v. Cosmopolitan Fire Insurance Co., 246 Ill. 442, 448, 92 N.E. 922, 925, as follows: 'The net receipts are personal property, and are to be listed by the board of assessors and board of review and taxed the same as other property.'\n In the present case that court in dealing with the original assessments made in 1923-1926, after the returns in those years were received, said (350 Ill. 372, 183 N.E. 241, 244): 'Such returns were received and accepted as correct by the assessor, acted upon by the taxing bodies, and the taxes extended thereon. The taxes extended were not legal, for the reason that the amounts returned as net receipts were not scaled and debased as the returns of other personal property were in the extension of the taxes.'\n But while the court ruled that the taxes so extended were not legal, it referred to the stipulation whereby judgment was to be rendered in conformity with the evidence and equitable principles, and held that the plaintiff, while not entitled to recover all that was extended, was entitled to a judgment for what would have been due had the net receipts been 'scaled and debased in conformity with the assessments on other personal property' and had the taxes been computed and extended on the resulting assessments.\n Respecting the tax on net receipts for the year ending April 30, 1927, that court considered several objections, \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 544]\n\u00a0\n not material here, which were urged against the action of the board of review and pronounced them not well grounded. It then sustained the assessment as a valid one, held that equity and good conscience required that the tax be paid, and included the full amount in the recovery awarded the plaintiff. Nothing was said in the opinion about the failure of the board of review to scale the net receipts down to 60 per cent. of their value, as was done in assessing other property, nor was there mention of anything which could cure that departure from the general practice or render it of no significance. The matter was plainly presented on the record, and the full tax could not have been sustained without resolving it against the defendant. So the conclusion is unavoidable that it was so resolved, Although not given distinct mention.\n From the outset the defendant has insisted as part of its defense that the taxing act, if construed and applied as sustaining the taxes in question, denies to it the equal protection of the laws contrary to the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment. This appears in the stipulation under which the case was tried, in the opening statement of counsel at the trial, and elsewhere in the record. The Supreme Court, in the opinion, recites that this contention was made, and disposes of it by saying that a like contention was considered and overruled in Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, 327 Ill. 590, 158 N.E. 849, and People v. Franklin National Insurance Co., 343 Ill. 336, 175 N.E. 431.\n Of course the question in this Court is whether the act as applied by the state court in this case arbitrarily and prejudicially discriminates against the defendant and in favor of others in circumstances fairly admitting of equal treatment. The particulars in which it is claimed that the act works such a discrimination will be taken up separately. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 545]\n\u00a0\n 1. It is said that the act as it was applied to the net receipts of 1927 subjects the personal property of a foreign fire insurance corporation to a tax based on its full actual value whereas other personal property is taxed on a basis of 60 per cent. of its value. The complaint is not that the net receipts were valued excessively, but that the value when determined was not debased like that of other personal property. The tax, as extended on the full actual value fixed by the board of review, was $5,895.19. Had that value been debased to 60 per cent., as was the value of other personal property, the tax would have been $3,537.11, making a difference of $2,358.08. The act deals specially and only with the taxation of net receipts of foreign fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance corporations. The assessing officers acted in virtue of it and the state court held their action was valid under it. Thus both applied it, and they applied it as subjecting the net receipts of a foreign fire insurance company, by reason of being such, to a tax burden 66 2\/3 per cent. greater than that laid on other personal property. No reasonable basis for such a discrimination is suggested and none is perceived. It is essentially the same character of arbitrary and prejudicial discrimination that was condemned as a denial of the equal protection of the laws in Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713.\n Whether a state statute is valid or invalid under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment often depends on how the statute is construed and applied. It may be valid when given a particular application and invalid when given another. Here the application which was made of section 30 in respect of the taxation of the net receipts of 1927, i.e., the application made by the assessing officers and sustained by the Supreme Court, brought the section into conflict with the prohibition of that clause. This means that as so applied it is invalid, notwithstanding its validity in some different applications. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 546]\n\u00a0\n By way of excusing the failure to debase it is said that something else was done which was a paractical equivalent. But careful consideration of the asserted excusing action shows that it neither did nor could operate as a practical equivalent or rectify the material omission sought to be excused. Effect must be given to the board's recorded action in fixing the net receipts at $121,550. This is the amount which should have been debased to 60 per cent. to put the net receipts on a plane with other property.\n\n 2. \nIt is said that section 30 works an unreasonable discrimination against the foreigh corporations named therein in that it taxes their net receipts without permitting in the computation of such receipts a deduction of paid insurance losses, whereas competing domestic corporations are taxed only on what remains of their receipts on April 1 of each year after insurance losses, as well as operating expenses, are paid. But the defendant is not in a position to press this claim. Neither in its return nor in the hearing before the board of review did it make any showing respecting paid insurance losses or ask that such losses be deducted in arriving at its net receipts. The amount of these receipts- whether one sum or another-was primarily, at least, to be determined by the assessing officers. And as the matter was not presented to them it was not admissible, according to the decision of the Supreme Court, for the defendant to make it a ground for asking the court to reject or revise their finding respecting the amount of the receipts.\n\n 3. \nIt is said that section 30 arbitrarily discriminates against foreign fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance corporations and in favor of competing domestic corporations, in that it taxes the net receipts of the former, while the latter are not subjected to such a tax or to any equivalent tax. It appears to be conceded that no tax is laid directly on the net receipts of the domestic corporations; but it is denied that those corporations are not subjected to an equivalent tax. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 547]\n\u00a0\n For a long period the Supreme Court of the state ruled that the tax imposed by section 30 was a property tax; later on it ruled that the tax was an occupation or privilege tax; and still later it returned to its first ruling. In Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713, this court in sustaining a claim that the section, when applied according to the second ruling, was in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment said ( page 516 of 272 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 179, 185): 'Under the previous decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, when the net receipts were treated as personal property and the assessment thereon as a personal property tax subjected to the same reductions for equalization and debasement, it might well have been said that there was no substantial inequality as between domestic corporations and foreign corporations, in that the net receipts were personal property acquired during the year and removed by foreign companies out of the state, and could be required justly to yield a tax fairly equivalent to that which the domestic companies would have to pay on all their personal property including their net receipts or what they were invested in.'\n Counsel differ as to whether that statement was necessary to the decision of the case in hand. Be this as it may, the statement recognizes that substantial equality and fair equivalence are important factors in determining the presence or absence of arbitrary discrimination in such situations; and in this respect the statement is in accord with repeated decisions of this Court. Mathematical equivalence is neither required nor attainable; nor is identity in mere modes of taxation of importance where there is substantial equality in the resulting burdens.\n By reason of the presumption of validity which attends legislative and official action one who alleges unreasonable discrimination must carry the burden of showing it. This has not been done as respects the claim now being considered. The defendant recognizes that the domestic \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 548]\n\u00a0\n corporations are subjected to some taxes not laid on the foreign corporations, a capital stock tax apparently being one. But the full situation is not shown; nor is it reflected in the opinion of the Supreme Court or the cases there cited. For aught that appears it may be that taxes not applied to the foreign corporations are laid on the domestic corporations which are the substantial equivalent of the net receipts tax. For these reasons this claim of discrimination must fail.\n\n 4. \nIt is said that section 30 requires foreign fire insurance corporations to pay the tax not alone on their net receipts from fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance but also on their net receipts from casualty insurance, whereas foreign casualty insurance corporations severally conducting a casualty insurance business in direct competition with the foreign fire insurance corporations are not required to pay a tax on their net receipts or any equivalent tax. The factual premises of this claim are stipulated. The Supreme Court of the state has constru d section 30 as taxing the foreign fire insurance companies on their net receipts from casualty insurance,8 and has held that foreign casualty insurance companies conducting a casualty insurance business are not taxable on their net receipts under section 30 or any other statute. \n9\n The stipulation shows that all of these foreign corporations are lawfully entitled by reason of licenses, etc., to conduct their respective businesses within the state; that the casualty corporations are conducting the 'same character' of casualty insurance business as the fire insurance corporations; that these businesses are competitive; and that the casualty corporations are taxed on such real and tangible personal property as they hold within the state, \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 549]\n\u00a0\n while the fire insurance companies are taxed not only on their real and tangible personal property but also on their net receipts from casualty insurance.\n This statement shows that section 30, as the state court construes and applies it, works a very real and prejudicial discrimination against the fire insurance companies and in favor of the casualty companies in respect of competitive casualty businesses of the same character, conducted in the same way and in the same territory. The companies are all foreign corporations, and all are for present purposes equally within the jurisdiction of the state and subject to her power to tax. There is no basis or reason for making a distinction between them that has any pertinence to the imposition of a property tax such as is in question. The net receipts which are taxes are not different from those which are not taxed; and both come from the same source. Such a discrimination in respect of the taxation of real or tangible personal property obviously would be essentially arbitrary. In principle it is not different with the net receipts. They are property and the tax which section 30 imposes is, as the state court holds, a property tax. It follows that the section, when construed and applied in the way just described, is in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Full support for this conclusion is found in prior decisions. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n When the views expressed in this opinion are applied to the judgment under review the result, shortly stated, is as follows: The taxes of 1923- 1926, as reduced by the Supreme Court, were only on net receipts from fire, \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 550]\n\u00a0\n marine, and inland navigation insurance, and were computed on amounts obtained by proper scaling and debasement. None of the constitutional objections urged against the taxes of those years is well taken. Therefore as to those taxes the judgment must be affirmed. The tax of 1927 was partly on net receipts from casualty insurance and was also laid on the full amount of the net receipts of that year without first debasing them to 60% as was done with other property. In both of these particulars there was a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Therefore as to that tax the judgment must be reversed. And incidentally the cause must be remanded to the Supreme Court of the state for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision o this case.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting in part.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court to the extent of its holding that the tax upon the net receipts of premiums for casualty insurance is a denial to the appellant of the equal protection of the laws.\n The validity of a tax depends upon its nature, and not upon its name. St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S.Ct. 125; Federal Land Bank of New Orleans v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374, 378\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1; Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 38\n, 48 S.Ct. 423; Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226\n\n\n In the State of Illinois there has long been a usage, reinforced by statute until 1927, whereby property subject to an ad valorem tax is to be assessed at 30 per cent. or later 60 per cent. of its value, and no more. The highest court of that state held for many years that within the meaning of this rule of debasement, the tax upon the net receipts \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 551]\n\u00a0\n of foreign fire and inland navigation companies was a tax upon property, or at least was to be assessed in the same way. Chicago v. Phoenix Insurance Co., 126 Ill. 276, 18 N.E. 668; National Fire Insurance Co. v. Hanberg, 215 Ill. 378, 380, 74 N.E. 377; People v. Cosmopolitan Fire Insurance Co., 246 Ill. 442, 448, 92 N.E. 922. This continued to be the practice till 1921. In that year and for a time afterwards, the Court determined that the tax did not come within the rule of debasement, but was a tax upon a privilege. People v. Kent, 300 Ill. 324, 133 N.E. 276; People v. Barrett, 309 Ill. 53, 139 N.E. 903; Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Carr, 317 Ill. 366, 148 N.E. 23. The companies affected by the new ruling attacked the discrimination as unconstitutional, and brought the controversy here. In 1926, this court held that the denial of the 30 per cent. debasement to foreign corporations brought about an inequality so gross in comparison with the burdens of domestic corporations as to vitiate the tax and the statute that imposed it. Hanover Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713. Following that decision, the Supreme Court of Illinois receded from the position that it had taken in 1921, and held that there must be a debasement of value as in the case of taxes upon property. Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Harding, 327 Ill. 590, 601, 158 N.E. 849; People v. Franklin National Insurance Co., 343 Ill. 336, 175 N.E. 431.\n No descriptive epithet applied to the tax by the Illinois court or any other can transform the essential nature of the tax into something other than it is. St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, supra; Federal Land Bank of New Orleans v. Crosland, supra; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra. No descriptive epithet can make a tax upon the net receipts of the business of the whole year the same as one upon the property located on a particular day of the year within the area of the taxing district, or the same as one upon the capital or income of investments. If the foreign corpo- \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 552]\n\u00a0\n rations subjected to this tax on net receipts had taken the gross receipts out of the state at once after collection, or had placed them in an insolvent bank with the result that nothing remained when the assessment day arrived, the tax would still have been due without the abatement of a dollar. Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Board of Review of Cook County, 264 Ill. 14, 105 N.E. 704. On the other hand, nothing would have been due if no premiums had been collected during the year, though the profits of earlier years were still within the county. The tax, whatever its label, is upon the operations of a business. Generally in the United States, though perhaps not abroad, a tax so imposed is spoken of as an excise. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 108, 145\n, 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; cf. Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, vol. V, article 'Excise'; Seligman, Essays in Taxation (9th Ed.) pp. 161, 165, 169. It is what it is, no matter what one calls it. It is a tax on net receipts.\n This court did not hold in Hanover Insurance Co. v. Harding, supra, that if the tax was an excise, it would be void for that reason, though the assessment were to be debased. All that was held was that calling it an excise would not save it if the benefit of debasement was withheld in a discriminatory way. By the same token, calling it a property tax does not condemn if it debasement is allowed. The Illinois court did not hold, in retracting the description of a tax upon a privilege, that a tax upon investments is identical with a tax upon the net receipts of the business of the year. Things so essentially different would not become the same even if a court were to confuse them and speak of them as one. The Illinois court held no more than this, that whatever the differences between the taxes, the two would be viewed as if they were taxes upon property for the purpose of applying the prescribed percentage of debasement. If the tax upon net receipts, including casualty insurance premiums, would not effect a denial of the equal protection of the laws in the event that the \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 553]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Illinois, while debasing the assessment, had described the tax as an excise, it does not effect such a denial because the court, rightly or wrongly, has described it as something else. People of State of New York ex rel. New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584, 596\n, 26 S.Ct. 714. The question still is, what kind of classification is permissible when the yearly net receipts are the subject matter of the tax and the measure of the burden?\n Now, plainly, a tax on the net receipts of a business of a particular kind is not condemned as void for the reason that a like tax or an equal one is not laid on the net receipts of every other kind of business. Bell's Gap R.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533, 535; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339, 351\n, 353 S., 12 S. Ct. 250; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio (Sanford v. Poe), \n165 \nU.S. 223, 228\n, 17 S.Ct. 305; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114\n, 30 S.Ct. 496; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526; Stebbins v. Reilly, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 44 A.L.R. 1454; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S.Ct. 310; Union Bank v. Phelps, \n288 \nU.S. 181\n, 53 S.Ct. 321. Not even the appellant makes any contention to the contrary. If it did, it would be driven to maintain that the whole statute must fall, and not merely so much as affects the casualty premiums. To say that a tax on the net receipts of one kind of business is void because a like tax is not laid on different forms of business would mean that the net receipts of insurance companies may not be taxed without laying a like tax on manufacturers and merchants. The cases above cited make it clear to the point of demonstration that this is not the law. The state 'may tax real estate and personal property in a different manner.' Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, supra. 'It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions, and may vary the rates of excise upon various products.' Id. Nowhere is it intimated that what was approved would have been condemned if there had been in the statute a glossary that gave the tax another name. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 554]\n\u00a0\n With the aid of this analysis the path is cleared to a conclusion. A tax upon the receipts of a business is not invalid as of course because some forms of business are hit and others are exempt. To bring about that result the assailant of the tax must be able to satisfy the court that the classification had its origin in nothing better than whim and fantasy, a tyrannical exercise of arbitrary power. Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, supra, page 160 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 310; Stebbins v. Reilly, supra; Lindsley v. Natural Carbo ic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160. This is the heavy burden that the appellant must sustain. Is it a whimsical and fantastic act to tax foreign fire insurance companies upon all their net receipts, including those derived from casualty premiums, when no such tax is imposed upon the receipts of insurance companies that do a casualty business only? If so, the arbitrary quality of the division must have its origin in the fact that the activities of the one class overlap to some extent the activities of the other. But plainly there is no rule that overlapping classes can never be established in the realm of taxation except at the price of an infringement of the Federal Constitution. The recognition of such a rule means that a department store may not be taxed on the net receipts of its business unless all the many activities thus brought under a single roof are taxed in the same way when separately conducted. Cf. State Board of Tax Commissioners of Indiana v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464; Liggett Co. v. Lee, \n288 \nU.S. 517, 532\n, 53 S.Ct. 481, 85 A.L.R. 699. There must be a tax on the business of the draper, the jeweler, the shoemaker, the hatter, the carpet dealer, and what not. For the same reason, the proprietor of a retail market dealing in meats and groceries and vegetables and fruits will then escape, at least proportionately, a tax upon receipts if the statute does not cover the business of the shopkeeper who derives a modest income from the sale of peanuts and bananas. There are few taxes upon earnings that would pass so fine a sieve. The rule, if \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 555]\n\u00a0\n there is any, against the creation of overlapping classes for purposes of taxation is manifestly not one of general validity. The range of its application must depend upon the facts.\n Fire insurance companies in Illinois, though organized in other states, have never been allowed to do a general casualty business. It is misleading to argue about them on the assumption that they are appropriately described as casualty insurers. For a long time they were restricted to the risks of fire, lightning, and tornadoes, and those of inland navigation and transportation. Act of March 11, 1869, p. 209; Act of May 31, 1879, p. 179; Act of June 30, 1885, p. 209. Then in 1905 (Act of May 16, 1905, p. 290), they were permitted to insure against the leakage of sprinklers, pumps, and other apparatus of that order. In 1912 ( Act of June 11, 1912 (2d Sp. Sess. 1911-12 p. 45)), the list was increased by adding the risk of damage to property through the use of motor vehicles, but not the risk of liability for damage to the person. In 1925 (Act of June 30, 1925, p. 451), there was a revision of the form of the then existing statutes, but with little change of substance. After the revision just as formerly the casualty policies written by the fire companies were confined with negligible exceptions to liability for loss through the use of pumps and sprinklers, and liability for damage to property through the use of motor vehicles. The occupied only a small part of the total casualty business.\n The accuracy of this statement is perceived upon a survey of the activities of the casualty companies. These companies insure against bodily injury, disability, or death as a consequence of accident. They indemnify merchants and other business men against loss by reason of giving credit to customers. They guarantee against loss by burglary or theft or the breakage of glass. They insure against any hazard resulting from the maintenance or use of automobiles or other vehicles, whether there is \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 556]\n\u00a0\n personal injury or death or only damage to property. Act of April 21, 1899, p. 237, as amended by Acts of January 30, 1919, p. 601, and June 28, 1921, p. 473.\n A study of the reports to the Insurance Department of Illinois exposes the overlapping segments in their comparative dimensions. Thus, in 1927, the foreign fire stock-companies of Illinois received p emiums from all sources of $68,741,901.34, of which $48,266,624.47 came from fire policies, $680,645.43 from ocean marine insurance, $4,018,503.22 from inland navigation and transportation, $7,866.42 from insurance against earthquakes, $5,743,891.81 from tornado policies, $171,833.15 from insurance against damage by hail, $327,933.61 from riot insurance, $48,414. 68 from miscellaneous policies, and $9,476,188.55 from the two fields where the business of fire companies and casualty companies overlap, i.e., motor vehicle property damage and sprinkler leakage ($9,207,980.43 for the one and $268,208.12 for the other). 60th Annual Insurance Report, part I, pp. 96-105. During the same year the foreign casualty companies received premiums of $7,384,454.72 from accident and health policies, $12,728,070 from workmen's compensation insurance, $3,274,293.63 from fidelity insurance premiums, $7,879,541.48 from automobile liability insurance, exclusive of property damage, $3,047,350.53 from liability insurance not connected with automobiles, $3,957,757.69 from insurance against burglary and theft, $4,371,869.46 from surety bonds, $1,961,445.08 from plate glass insurance, $442,020.20 from steam boiler insurance, $161,862.91 from engine and machinery insurance, $370,040.02 from credit insurance, $111, 164.20 from property damage not connected with motor vehicles, $22,676.10 from insurance of live stock, $794,119.43 from miscellaneous policies, and finally $3, 199,397.92 from motor vehicle policies covering damage to property and $44,267.48 from sprink- \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 557]\n\u00a0\n ler damage insurance. The total premiums from all sources were $50,679,141. 98. 60th Annual Insurance Report, part III, pp. 79-92.\n This comparison makes it clear that the business of fire insurance companies as carried on in Illinois is essentially a different one from the business generally known as that of casualty insurance, though the spheres coincide for the space of a small segment. A phase or department of one business may be akin to a phase or department of another, and still the kindred branches may bear unequal taxes. Coincidence of some of the parts is not enough unless the parts are so many as to determine the identity of the whole. The vice of any different principle may be known from its consequences. The drug store of today supplies many things besides medicines and surgical appliances. It has a counter where sandwiches and salads and ice cream and many other edibles are furnished to its customers. If a tax were to be laid upon the earnings of a drug store, the acceptance of the appellant's argument would drive us to a holding that the receipts from the sale of edibles must be excluded from the reckoning in the absence of a like tax upon the proprietors of restaurants. Dealers of ready made clothing have a department of their business in which clothes are made to order. The appellant would have us say that the earnings from that department are exempt under the constitution from a tax upon receipts unless a like tax is laid upon the earnings of the merchant tailor. The legislature in that view may no longer classify the forms of business with an eye to a composite group of uniformities and differences. There must be a segregation of forms of business into their constituent activities, which, to the extent that there is identity, must be taxed for any one group as they are taxed for any other. Immunity from tax laws of unequal operation has never \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 558]\n\u00a0\n until now been pressed to that extreme. Armour & Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 38 S.Ct. 267; Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 \nU.S. 226\n, 26 S.Ct. 232; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; American Sugar Refining Co. v.

Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, 78 L.Ed. --.\n By the very law of their being, companies whose principal business is to provide insurance against fire, but who provide casualty insurance in a very narrow field, are in a class of their own, with capacities and opportunities essentially diverse from those of companies who are incompetent to provide insurance against fire, but who do insure against almost every other imaginable risk. The state is not called upon to explain the reasons for taxing the members of the one class more heavily than it does the members of the other. The burden is on the appellant who would strike the statute down, and not on the state which invokes the presumption of validity. Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 402, 410\n, 46 S.Ct. 320; Detroit Bridge Co. v. Tax Board of Michigan, \n287 \nU.S. 295, 297\n, 53 S.Ct. 137, 'As underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute.'

Here the foundation fails, and with it the assault.\n Nothing that was determined in Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S.Ct. 55o, is at war with this conclusion. There the business done by the taxpayer was the same as that done by others to whom an exemption was allowed. Here they are not the same, though at places they overlap. \n\n[292 U.S. 535, 559]\n\u00a0\n For many years the fire insurance companies in Illinois were without power to write a policy unless the hazards were those of fire or of inland navigation. When the power was conferred upon them to cover risks of other kinds, a statute gave them notice that they must pay taxes to the county upon the net earnings of their business from whatever source derived. They were free to use the new privilege or to reject it as they pleased. They accepted it cum onere if they accepted it at all.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws Ill. 1869, pp. 209, 228, as amended by Laws Ill. 1879, p. 179, Smith-Hurd Rev.

Ed. --, to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota involving the application of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA). The respondent, a creditor of petitioner Connell, brought suit in the district court of Remsey county, N.D., to set aside, as in fraud of creditors, a conveyance by Connell to the other petitioners of land located in the state. The suit was begun by attachment of the land, and while it was pending in the trial court the petitioners, by a motion for stay of proceedings and by their amended answer, set up that within four months after the attachment petitioner Connell had filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the District Court for Southern California, which had resulted in an adjudication of bankruptcy. It was not shown whether a trustee had been selected. The county court, upon the trial, found that the conveyance was in fraud of creditors and gave judgment for the respondent, which the Supreme Court of the state affirmed ((N.D.) 249 N.W. 726), directing that the land be sold and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of the indebtedness to respondent. The relief granted was restricted to the sale of the attached land by a provision of the judgment that it should not be deemed to establish the personal liability of any of the petitioners. \n\n[291 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners argue here, as they did in the state courts, that under section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA,  107(f), the lien of the attachment upon which the judgment was founded was a nullity because procured when the bankrupt was insolvent and within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, so that no judgment could be given or enforced against the attached property, and they insist that in any event the state court should have stayed the action until the termination of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n We may assume, for present purposes, that the trustee in bankruptcy, if there is one, could have taken and may still take appropriate proceedings to set aside the attachment as invalid under section 67f, 11 USCA  107(f),1 either by intervention in the action in the state court, as authorized by section 11b, 11 USCA  29(b), see Lehman, Stern & Co., Ltd. v. S. Gumbel & Co., Ltd., \n236 \nU.S. 448\n, 35 S.Ct. 307; Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734\n, 51 S.Ct. 270, or by procuring an order of the bankruptcy court staying any further proceedings by the state court to secure the \n\n[291 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n benefit of the attachment, Clarke v. Larremore, \n188 \nU.S. 486\n, 23 S.Ct. 363, see Globe Bank & Trust Co. v. Martin, \n236 \nU.S. 288\n, 35 S.Ct. 377; compare Metcalf v. Barker, \n187 \nU.S. 165\n, 23 S.Ct. 67; Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318\n, 51 S.Ct. 465, or that he might have avoided the attachment by the assertion of dominion over the property inconsistent with the continued existence of the lien, Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v. Hall, \n229 \nU.S. 511\n, 33 S.Ct. 885. But section 67f, 11 USCA  107(f), also extends to the trustee the privilege of procuring an order of the bankruptcy court directing that the right under the lien of attachment, be preserved for the benefit of the bankrupt's estate, and to secure its benefits he may, as provided in section 67c, 11 USCA  107(c), be subrogated to all the rights of the lienor. See Rock Island Plow Co. v. Reardon, \n222 \nU.S. 354\n, 32 S.Ct. 164; Miller v. New Orleans Acid & Fertilizer Co., \n211 \nU.S. 496, 505\n, 29 S.Ct. 176; First National Bank v. Staake, \n202 \nU.S. 141\n, 26 S.Ct. 580.\n Here the trustee, if any, is not a party to the suit and he is not shown to have made the election with respect to the attachment lien for which section 67f provides. This privilege is one of substance, see Rock Island Plow Co. v. Reardon, supra, and the statute gives it to the trustee, not to the bankrupt or his creditors. A judgment of dismissal, as prayed by the petitioners, would have dissolved the attachment and thus would have enabled the bankrupt to cut off the privilege reserved to the trustee to preserve it. We do not think the statute can be construed to require that result.\n Petitioners place reliance upon the language of the opinions in Lehman, Stern & Co., Ltd. v. Gumbel & Co., Ltd., supra, and in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v. Hall, supra, which state in the broad words of the statute that liens acquired within four months of the filing of the petition are 'void.' But in the one case the receiver, by his intervention in the action in the state court, and in the other the trustee, by appropriate action taken in the bankruptcy court, had asserted the invalidity of the lien acquired by the local suit. In neither does the decision militate against the \n\n[291 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n conclusion which we reach here that the bankrupt alone cannot invoke a judgment which would preclude the exercise of the privilege reserved to the trustee to assert rights under the lien.\n Bankruptcy proceedings do not, merely by virtue of their maintenance, terminate an action already pending in a nonbankruptcy court, to which the bankrupt is a party. Pickens v. Roy, \n187 \nU.S. 177\n, 23 S.Ct. 78; Jones v. Springer, \n226 \nU.S. 148\n, 33 S.Ct. 64; Straton v. New, supra. This is obviously the case where the suit like the present one is brought by a creditor to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of the bankrupt, made more than four months before the petition in bankruptcy. The right asserted is one given the creditor by state law which the Bankruptcy Act withdraws from him only upon the election of the trustee to assert the rights of the creditor, as he is privileged to do by section 70e, 11 USCA  110(e), an election, which, in this case, does not appear to have been made Compare Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 \nU.S. 1\n, 12 S.Ct. 104; Dushane v. Beall, \n161 \nU.S. 513\n, 16 S.Ct. 637; First National Bank v. Lasater, \n196 \nU.S. 115\n, 25 S.Ct. 206; American Exchange Bank v. Goetz (C.C.A.) 283 F. 900; Laughlin v. Calumet & Chicago Canal & Dock Co. (C.C.A.) 65 F. 441; and cf. Thomas v. Sugarman, \n218 \nU.S. 129\n, 30 S.Ct. 650, 29 L.R.A. (N.S.) 250. Upon this record no case is made entitling the petitioners, under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act, to a judgment of dismissal.\n The question remains whether, the trustee having failed to assert any rights with respect to the pending action, the state court was required to stay it by any provision or necessary implication of the Bankruptcy Act. We find it unnecessary to decide whether section 11a, 11 USCA  29(a), authorizing a stay of certain suits pending against a bankrupt,2 lays down a rule for nonbankruptcy \n\n[291 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n as well as bankruptcy courts,3 or whether it is applicable to suits like the present one4 or whether the bankrupt may invoke its provisions. \n5\n For, if applicable here, the authority given by that section to stay pending suits after adjudication, which has taken place here, is not mandatory, but permissive, to be exercised in the sound discretion of the court. There is no suggestion that there was any abuse of discretion by the state court in refusing to stay its hand on the bare showing by the fraudulent bankrupt that there had been an adjudication in bankruptcy. It does not appear that there is any creditor other than respondent, or that the trustee had not been advised of the suit, or that the bankrupt could not, by giving notice to the trustee, have afforded the trustee ample opportunity to assert his rights if there were other creditors to protect. On the other hand, if section 11a does not apply, but if it be assumed that the general scheme of the Act implies some duty of the state court to preserve the estate until opportunity is given the bankruptcy court to assert its jurisdiction, see Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 32 S.Ct. 96; In re Moore (D.C.) 42 F.(2d) 475, 478, still the petitioners have failed to show that there has been no such opportunity.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 67f.

AETNA ACCEPTANCE CO.(1934)\nNo. 68\nArgued: November 9, 1934Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Franklin D. Trueblood and Edward A. Zimmerman, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. S. Kleinman, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A discharge in bankruptcy, pleaded as a defense to a declaration in trover for the conversion of a chattel, has been ruled by the courts below not to constitute a bar. The question is whether upon the evidence and the findings the bar should have been upheld. \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner was a dealer in automobiles, selling them at retail and maintaining a salesroom where his wares were displayed. To put himself in funds for the acquisition of the cars, he obtained loans from the respondent, the AEtna Acceptance Company, in thirty-five or more transactions. In particular he borrowed $1,181.87 on July 10, 1929, procuring title thereby to an Auburn sedan. This was 90 per cent. of the cost of the car; the residue of the price being paid out of his own money. At once upon receipt of the sedan he delivered to the respondent a set of four papers: A promissory note for $1,181.87 to the order of the respondent payable in sixty days; a chattel mortgage covering the automobile and securing payment of the note; a trust receipt, acknowledging receipt of the automobile, and agreeing to hold it as the property of the respondent for the purpose of storage, and not to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of it except upon consent in writing; and finally a bill of sale, absolute in form.\n On August 3, 1929, the automobile, then on exhibit in the petitioner's showroom, was sold by one of his salesmen, and thereupon or soon afterwards petitioner received the price. There is a stipulation that the sale was made without concealment and in the ordinary course of business, though without written consent. According to the petitioner's testimony, notice of the transaction was given the same day to one of the respondent's officers. There is also testimony tending to support the inference that on many other occasions cars held upon like terms had been sold without express consent and the proceeds accounted for thereafter. On this occasion the petitioner promised to make prompt remittance of a check, subject to an offset or credit growing out of other dealings. He did not keep his promise. Instead, he filed a petition in bankruptcy on September 13, 1929, obtaining later his discharge after duly listing the respondent in his schedule of creditors. \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n The filing of that petition was followed by this action for conversion. The trial judge, overruling the special plea of a discharge, gave judgment in favor of the respondent for damages and costs. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed. There was a refusal of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of the state; permission being requisite because of the amount involved. The case is here on certiorari.\n The effect of a discharge in bankruptcy is to 'release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts,' with excepted liabilities enumerated in the statute. Bankruptcy Act  17, 11 U.S.C.  35 (11 USCA  35). There is no dispute that the respondent had a provable debt. It might have proved upon the note, 'a fixed liability, as evidenced by ... an instrument in writing.' Bankruptcy Act  63a(1), 11 U.S.C.  103(a)(1), 11 USCA  103(a)( 1). If its grievance was the sale, it might have proved 'upon a contract express or implied' (section 63a(4), 11 USCA  103(a)(4), waiving the tort and standing upon the implied assumpsit. Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 193\n, 25 S.Ct. 9; Tindle v. Birkett, \n205 \nU.S. 183\n, 27 S.Ct. 493. What it did is not decisive. Crawford v. Burke, supra; Tindle v. Birkett, supra. Enough that a method of proof had been provided to be used at its election.\n The debt being provable, the next inquiry must be whether the liability back of it is within one of the excepted classes. For present purposes, only two of the exceptions (section 17, subds. (2) and (4), of the act (11 USCA  35(2, 4) will have to be considered. The others by concession have no relation to this case. Subdivision 2 excludes from the release 'liabilities for ... willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another.' Subdivision 4 excludes the liabilities of a bankrupt 'created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.'\n\n 1. \nThe respondent contends that the petitioner was liable for a willful and malicious injury to the property \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n of another as the result of the sale and conversion of the car in his possession. There is no doubt that an act of conversion, if willful and malicious, is an injury to property within the scope of this exception. Such a case was McIntyre v. Kavanaugh, \n242 \nU.S. 138\n, 37 S.Ct. 38, where the wrong was unexcused and wanton. But a willful and malicious injury does not follow as of course from every act of conversion, without reference to the circumstances. There may be a conversion which is innocent or technical, an unauthorized assumption of dominion without willfulness or malice. Boyce v. Brockway, 31 N.Y. 490, 493; Laverty v. Snethen, 68 N.Y. 522, 527, 23 Am.Rep. 184; Wood v. Fisk, 215 N.Y. 233, 239, 109 N.E. 177; Stanley v. Gaylord, 1 Cush.(Mass.) 536, 550, 48 Am.Dec. 643; Campau v. Bemis, 35 Ill.App. 37; In re De Lauro (D.C.) 1 F.Supp. 678, 679. There may be an honest but mistaken belief, engendered by a course of dealing, that powers have been enlarged or incapacities removed. In these and like cases, what is done is a tort, but not a willful and malicious one. Turning to the findings here, we see that willfulness and malice have been unmistakably excluded. Cf. In re Dixon (D.C.) 21 F.(2d) 565, 566; In re Burchfield (D.C.) 31 F.(2d) 118, 119. The trial court made a special finding as follows: 'The court finds that the defendant in this case was not actuated by willful, malicious or criminal intent in disposing of the car in question.' In these circumstances the respondent is not helped by the later and general finding that the petitioner was 'guilty of legal conversion of the property, as described in the count in trover.' The special controls the general, just as upon the verdict of a jury. Walker v. New Mexico & S.P.R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 593, 598\n, 17 S.Ct. 421; Victor American Fuel Co. v. Peccarich (C.C.A.) 209 F. 568, 571.\n Nothing in the judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is at war with the exculpatory finding made upon the trial. The Appellate Court repeats the words of the \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n trial judge without hint of disapproval. Its only comment is that under the law of Illinois malice and wrongful intent are not necessary constituents of a cause of action in trover. This, of course, is true, but, though true, it is beside the mark. The discharge will prevail as against a showing of conversion without aggravated features.\n\n 2. \nThe respondent contends that, irrespective of willfulness or malice, the petitioner is within the exception declared by subdivision 4; his liability arising, it is said, from his fraud or misappropriation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. The meaning of these words has been fixed by judicial construction for very nearly a century. Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 How. 202, decided in 1844, is a decision to the effect that, within the meaning of a like provision in the Act of 1841 (5 Stat. 440), a factor does not act in a fiduciary capacity; the statute 'speaks of technical trusts, and not those which the law implies from the contract.' 2 How. at page 208. The scope of the exception was to be limited accordingly. Through the intervening years that precept has been applied by this court in varied situations with unbroken continuity. Neal v. Clark, \n95 U.S. 704\n; Hennequin v. Clews, \n111 \nU.S. 676, 682\n, 4 S.Ct. 576; Noble v. Hammond, \n129 \nU.S. 65, 68\n, 9 S.Ct. 235; Upshur v. Briscoe, \n138 \nU.S. 365\n, 11 S. Ct. 313; Crawford v. Burke, supra; Tindle v. Birkett, supra. Cf. Cronan v. Cotting, 104 Mass. 245, 6 Am.Rep. 232; Clair v. Colmes, 245 Mass. 281, 139 N.E. 519. It is not enough that, by the very act of wrongdoing out of which the contested debt arose, the bankrupt has become chargeable as a trustee ex maleficio. He must have been a trustee before the wrong and without reference thereto. In the words of Blatchford, J.: 'The language would seem to apply only to a debt created by a person who was already a fiduciary when the debt was created.' Upshur v. Briscoe, supra, at page 378 of 138 U.S., 11 S.Ct. 313, 318. Was petitioner a trustee in that strict and narrow sense? \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n We think plainly he was not, though multiplicity of documents may obscure his relation if the probe is superficial. The only writing at all suggestive of a trust is the one that is characterized as a trust receipt. What effect would be given to it if it stood alone there is no occasion to consider. It does not stand alone, but is a member of a group which must be read with a collective meaning. The note, the chattel mortgage, the trust receipt, and the bill of sale were made at the same time. We must view them all together. Clearly the respondent's only interest in the car was as security for the debt; this is the central fact, the co-ordinating element, that unifies the whole transaction. The bill of sale may seem to make the creditor a purchaser; whatever its recitals, it is a mortgage in another form. Whittemore v. Fisher, 132 Ill. 243, 24 N.E. 636. The trust receipt may state that the debtor holds the car as the property of the creditor; in truth, it is his own property, subject to a lien. Barchard v. Kohn, 157 Ill. 579, 585, 586, 41 N.E. 902, 29 L.R.A. 803. The substance of the transaction is this, and nothing more, that the mortgagor, a debtor, has bound himself by covenant not to sell the mortgaged chattel without the mortgagee's approval. The resulting obligation is not turned into one arising from a trust because the parties to one of the documents have chosen to speak of it as a trust. Cf. In re Butts (D.C.) 120 F. 966, 971; Bloomingdale v. Dreher (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 93. The relation would be no different if the duty had been stated in terms of covenant alone without descriptive epithet. A mortgagor in possession before condition broken is not a trustee for the mortgagee within the meaning of this statute, though he has charged himself with a duty to keep the security intact. Cf. Ten Eyck v. Craig, 62 N.Y. 406, 422.\n No question as to a cause of action arising from a conversion of the proceeds of the sale with willfulness and \n\n[293 U.S. 328, 335]\n\u00a0\n malice as distinguished from one arising from the conversion of the car itself is before us on this record.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAYTON POWER & LIGHT CO. v. PUBLIC UTILITIES COM'N(1934)\nNo. 609\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1934\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio.[ Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Com'n \n292 U.S. 290\n (1934) ]\n\n\n[292 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John E. Mullin, of Kane, Pa., and Edwin P. Matthews, of Dayton, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. Donald C. Power, and John W. Bricker, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Dayton Power & Light Company, an Ohio corporation, is here as appellant challenging the validity of an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, affirmed by the Supreme Court of that state, which prescribes the rates chargeable to consumers of natural gas.\n The appellant is a distributing company, producing no gas and owning no wells. The gas that it distributes it buys from the Ohio Fuel Gas Company, an affiliated corporation, delivery being made to it by the seller at the \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n gateways of the towns and cities where its mains and service pipes are laid. Both seller and buyer are subsidiaries of the Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation, which owns the entire capital stock of each of them as well as that of other companies producing in other fields or distributing in other cities.\n On June 17, 1929, the appellant filed with the commission a new schedule of 'rates and prices' to take effect 30 days later unless suspended or annulled. The average rate of increase was 5.67 cents per thousand cubic feet. Under the authority of statute (Pence Law, 110 Ohio Laws, p. 366, General Code,  614-20), the commission suspended the operation of the new schedule for 120 days, and at the same time initiated an inquiry of its own motion as to the fairness of the increase. The proceedings being undetermined at the end of the period of suspension, the statute permitted the appellant to put the schedule into effect at once upon filing a bond securing the repayment to the consumers of such portion of the increased rate as the commission, upon final hearing, might determine to have been unreasonable or excessive. Such a bond was given on October 9, 1929. The proceeding was then continued, but a decision was not announced till November 3, 1932. There had been a pause in the hearings to await the final submission of the testimony in the case of the Columbus Gas & Fuel Company, an affiliated corporation serving other territory. Much of the testimony in that case was read into the record by stipulation as testimony in this. Upon the record thus supplemented, the commission announced its decision that the revenues under the earlier schedule were sufficient to yield a yearly net return of 6 1\/2 per cent. upon the fair value of the property, that this return was reasonable, and that more must not be charged. An order was therefore made striking the new schedule from the files of the commission, \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n restraining the appellant from collecting the higher rates, and directing as to the past that the difference between the old rates and the new ones, with 6 per cent. interest, be refunded to consumers in accordance with the bond. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, the order was affirmed ( 127 Ohio St. 137, 187 N.E. 18) against the protest of the appellant that there had been an infringement of its privileges and immunities under the Constitution of the United States. Amendment 14; Article 1,  10. Upon appeal to this court (Judicial Code,  237(a), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a), the protest is renewed.\n At the threshold there is a controversy as to the scope of the problem before us for solution. The appellee argues that the only question for the commission was one as to the reasonableness of the new schedule in the very form proposed: Let the rates be excessive by ever so little, the schedule, it is said, was to be rejected altogether, and no other could be substituted. In opposition the appellant urges that this is too narrow a construction of the function and powers of the commission under the applicable statute: If the proposed schedule was too high and the earlier one too low, there was a duty to fix a rate between, and thereby make the compensation adequate. We accept this broader view in the absence of a ruling to the contrary by the courts of the state. It is borne out by the terms of the bond and by the requirements of the statute under which the bond was given: Such part of the new collections as shall be found to be unreasonable, that and no more is to be refunded to the customers. It is borne out again by the findings and the order: The rate is to be returned to what it had been before the change, and the difference repaid. Finally it is borne out by the opinion of the state court, which considers upon the merits the objections enumerated by the appellant in its petition to review the order of the commission, and finds them all to be untenable. \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n With the field of inquiry thus charted, we turn to the objections in the effort to determine whether separately or collectively they support the claim of confiscation.\n They fall into three classes: (1) Objections to the computation of operating expenses; (2) objections to the valuation of the property making up the rute base; and (3) objections to the rate itself.\n First. Objections to the computation of operating expenses.\n The chief item of controversy under this head is the price payabel to the affiliated seller for gas delivered at the gates.\n The contract between the appellant and the Ohio Fuel Gas Company called for payment at the rate of 45 cents per thousand cubic feet; the commission found this price to be excessive to the extent of 6 cents, thereby reducing to 39 cents the allowance to be made as a proper operating expense. \n1\n There is no doubt under the decisions of the court that the commission was not concluded by the price fixed in the agreement. This results from the relation of intimate alliance between the buyer and the seller. They were not dealing with each other at arm's length, and the prices that they fixed in their intercompany transactions were of no concern to the consumer unless kept within the bounds of reason. Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Commission of Kansas, \n285 \nU.S. 119\n, 52 S.Ct. 283; Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133\n, 51 S.Ct. 65; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 320\n, 49 S.Ct. 150. Whether the bounds were overpassed or heeded is next to be considered.\n\n 1. \nFirst in order of importance is the value of the gas fields. \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n The Ohio company, the seller, does not own its fields in fee. It does own leases covering nearly 3,000,000 acres in Ohio and elsewhere. Some of these it uses as a source of supply to meet the present needs of customers. Others are held as a standby for the future. Are all to be included in determining the base on which a fair price is to be reckoned? Are some to be ruled out until the wells now in use are wholly depleted, or until depletion is near at hand? If some or all are to be included, what shall be the principle of appraisal? Shall it be market value, or value as shown by the books, or some compromise between them?\n These and like questions have been much debated in the opinions below and in the arguments of counsel. They suggest interesting and important problems in the process of rate making for companies with wasting assets. When regard is had, however, to what has been done by the commission and the state court, as distinguished from what has been said, the case assumes another aspect. Much of the debate is then perceived to be irrelevant to the issue of confiscation vel non-confiscation, that is to say, of the property interests of the appellant-which in ultimate analysis is the only issue to be determined. To bring this out more clearly there is need to amplify the statement of the subject-matter to be valued and the mode of valuation.\n The leaseholds, operated and unoperated, are grouped into four classes. Class No. 1 (291,396 acres) is made up of 'tracts of land having producing gas wells drilled thereon from which gas is being furnished to the public.' Class No. 2 (164,739 acres, unoperated) is made up of 'tracts of land proved by actual developments and operations in the immediate vicinity thereof to be good gas-producing lands, but which do not have any producing wells drilled thereon.' Class No. 3 (312,631 acres, unoperated) is made up of tracts of land shown by sur- \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 297]\n\u00a0\n rounding or neighboring developments of operations, geological considerations, etc., to be reasonably certain to be good gas land, at least as to large portions thereof, but not yet demonstrated to be such by actual drilling.' Class No. 4 (2,065,421 acres, unoperated) is made up of 'tracts of land situate within the areas of territory where gas sands are known or assumed to exist from general geological conditions, but which are so remote from actual gas-producing wells or territory that they are merely prospective gas lands.'\n The commission has stated in its opinion that the leases in class No. 1 are the only ones that are presently 'used and useful' in the public business of the owner, and hence the only ones to be valued in estimating a fair return. 2 The commission has also stated in effect that there was no satisfactory evidence before it either of market or of intrinsic value for any portion of the acreage. This is what was said, but what was done was different. The value of the 291,396 acres in class No. 1 was $1,569, 479 on the basis of their original cost with certain overheads and expenses added; the book value of the other classes, after deducting what is found to have been an arbitrary write-up of about $3,700,000, was $3, 160,765, a total for all classes of $4,730,244.3 Instead of resorting to those tests, the commission made an allowance of $25 per acre for the 291, 396 acres in class No. 1, selecting that figure because it had been approved by the Supreme Court \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 298]\n\u00a0\n of Ohio in another litigation affecting part of the same lands. Logan Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 124 Ohio St. 248, 177 N.E. 587. The result was an appraisal of $7,284,900, which was about $2,500,000 more than the book value of all the leases in classes 1 to 4, inclusive. On appeal this method of valuation did not pass without impeachment. The Supreme Court of Ohio said in its opinion (Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 127 Ohio St. 109, 187 N.E. 7; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 127 Ohio St. 137, 187 N.E. 18) that the appraisal at the rate of $25 per acre was too high, and that the limit of the allowance should have been the book value of the leases in class No. 1. Once more there must be a distinction between what was said and what was done. Criticizing the appraisal of the Commission as overliberal to the company, the court affirmed the order which had been made on the assumption that there should be an allowance of $7,284,900 because of the ownership of leases. The appellant may not prevail unless there has been error in the result as well as error in the reasoning. Is the appraisal of the leases at over $7,000,000 an arbitrary act, which in turn has brought about an arbitrary rejection of the contract for gas delivered at the gates, and hence an infringement of constitutional immunities?\n As to that issue, the burden of proof rests heavily on the appellant. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637. In the endeavor to sustain it, there has been an attempt to establish market and intrinsic values by the estimates of experts as well as by actual sales.\n Webber, a witness for the appellant, placed the value of the leases in class No. 1 at $11,473,717; Meals at $17,483,760; Wittmer at $21,825, 000; and Dally at $26,225,640. For class No. 2 the estimates were: (Webber ) $10, \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 299]\n\u00a0\n 440,300; (Meals) $9,884,340; (Wittmer) $12,300,000; (Dally) $16,473,900. For class No. 3: (Webber) $10,504,320; (Meals) $1,250,524; (Wittmer) $3, 120,000; (Dally) $6,252,620. For class No. 4: (Webber) $6,196,263; (Meals) $ 8,261,684; (Wittmer) $6,195,000; (Dally) $4,130,842. Variations so wide are sufficient of themselves to disprove the existence of a market in the strict or proper sense. Sinclair Refining Co. v. Jenkins Petroleum Process Co., \n289 \nU.S. 689, 697\n, 698 S., 699, 53 S.Ct. 736, 88 A.L.R. 496. If they have any probative effect, it is that of expressions of opinion by men familiar with the gas business and its opportunities for profit. But plainly opinions thus offered, even if entitled to some weight, have no such conclusive force that there is error of law in refusing to follow them. This is true of opinion evidence generally, whether addressed to a jury, Head v. Hargrave, \n105 U.S. 45\n, 49; or to a judge, The Congueror, \n166 \nU.S. 110, 131\n, 133 S., 17 S.Ct. 510; or to a statutory board, Uncasville Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 893, 897; Tracy v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 53 F.(2d) 575, 577; Anchor Co., Inc., v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 99, 100; Gloyd v. Commissioner (C. C.A.) 63 F.(2d) 649, 650. There are reasons why the principle has special application here. In the first place, the intrinsic value of the leases is dependent upon the capacity of the lands to yield productive wells, a capacity seldom to be judged with even a fair approach to certainty until tested by experience. Natural Gas Co. of W. Va. v. Public Service Comm., 95 W.Va. 557, 569, 121 S.E. 716. In the second place, the profits to be earned in a regulated business must vary with the rates established by the supervising agencies of government, with the result that prophecies, however, radiant, may be upset over night by the publication of a lower schedule. The witnesses for the appellant were alive to these possibilities of surprise and disappointment, and there are admissions that their chief interest was in an unregulated market. To these perturbing tendencies, all operating to weaken \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 300]\n\u00a0\n the persuasive force of their opinions, there must be added still another, that of interest or bias, conscious or unconscious. Webber, a broker, was a stockholder in the Columbia Gas & Electric Company, the parent corporation. For fifteen years he had been in the service of the Ohio Fuel Supply Company, the predecessor of the Ohio Fuel Gas Company. He had been a witness for the appellant in other litigations. Meals was the president of a gas company, had been engaged in the gas business for over forty years and had testified in other suits. Wittmer was the owner of gas fields and sold his gas to the Ohio Fuel Gas Company and affiliated corporations. Dally was in the same position. The testimony of all is subject to the infirmities that were pointed out by this court in another rate controversy involving fields in West Virginia. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 316\n, 49 S.Ct. 150. It is not based, at least to a controlling extent, 'on prevailing prices for gas leases or on actual sales.' It is based upon 'an estimated or assumed exhaustible supply of gas available to appellants until exhausted, and upon a predictable price for natural gas in unregulated markets' through a future period of years. Cf. City of Charleston v. Public Service Commission, 110 W.Va. 245, 159 S.E. 38. How uncertain are the data can be gathered from the variant results.\n The appellant has attempted to correct these uncertainties by supplementing the opinions of its experts with testimony of actual sales. But they were sporadic transactions, separate in time and space, and at prices too disparate to supply a helpful test of value. Thus, in 1929, Wittmer sold 101,600 acres of Ohio leaseholds to the Penn-Ohio Gas Company for $1,085,000, and in the same year bought 7,000 acres for $100,000. About the same time Meals made a sale of 21,000 acres for $2,500,000. Dally had made purchases at prices ranging from $2 an acre for leaseholds of the quality of class No. 4 up to $50 or $75 an acre \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 301]\n\u00a0\n for leaseholds of a higher grade. Over against the evidence of these prices must be set the evidence that class No. 1 leases, acquired by the appellant in 1927, 1928, and 1929, had been bought at an average price of $ 2.05 an acre, and, if three leases be excluded, at an average of 62 1\/4 cents an acre. Then, too, there are quantitative considerations that are not to be ignored. For the most part the prices stated by the appellant's witnesses had been paid for small tracts, if comparison be made with the vast and often unproved acres in controversy here. Nor is there any such uniformity of price as to suggest the existence of a standard. Meals sold 21,000 acres for more than Wittmer sold a tract almost five times as large. Indeed, the truth becomes obvious when one reads the testimony as a whole that the prices upon sales were playing a subordinate role, and that the ultimate appraisal was a forecast of productive power. Granting even that the testimony had an evidential value, it had that and nothing more. It had no such commanding quality as to apply coercion to the judgment of the appointed triers of the facts, and exclude every choice but one.\n We do not attempt to determine upon this record whether the commission and the state court were in error in expressing the opinion that only class No. 1 leases should have a place in the appraisal. On the one side it is argued (cf. Wichita Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission (D. C.) 2 F.Supp. 792, 799) that the discretion of the owner as to the extent of the reserve essential for prudent management ought not to be overridden by a court unless proved by convincing testimony to have been fraudulent or arbitrary. On the other side it is argued (cf. Wichita Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, page 816 of 2 F.Supp., United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm. (D.C.) 14 F.(2d) 209, 221) that the value of reserve leases acquired by the owner to supply the needs of a remote future are not a part of the rate base upon which profits are presently to be earned at \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 302]\n\u00a0\n the cost of the consuming public, though they may be brought into the base afterwards when the time to use them is at hand. Moreover, the very reason for including in operating expenses a depletion allowance that will amortize wasting assets is to make provision for a fund out of which capital may be replenished by the purchase of other leases if that use is thought to be preferable to dividing the fund among the shareholders and winding up the business. These and other arguments we put aside without expression of a choice, and this for the reason that the case as it has shaped itself does not require us to weigh them. Again we emphasize the distinction between dictum and decision. If that distinction is observed, the upshot of the case is seen to be that the Supreme Court of Ohio, with authority to revise the findings of the commission in respect of fact and law (Hocking Valley Railway Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 100 Ohio St. 321, 326, 327, 126 N.E. 397), has disapproved the appraisal of the No. 1 leaseholds at $25 an acre, has found the testimony insufficient to establish a value beyond that shown by the books, but has, none the less, upheld an order whereby rates have been fixed upon the basis of the book value of leases of every class (numbers 1 to 4, inclusive), and $2,500,000 besides. If the evidence would have been adequate to uphold a lower rate, a fortiori it was adequate to uphold the rate prescribed. Plainly in all this there has been no infringement of constitutional immunities unless a higher value has been made out by evidence too strong to be rejected. But, for reasons already stated, the evidence is lacking in that high coercive power. Court and commission were free in their discretion to reject as unsatisfactory the conflicting opinions of a group of friendly experts. They were free in their discretion to refuse to draw an inference of value from the prices stated to have been paid upon a few purchases and sales. If those data were unacceptable, the only \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 303]\n\u00a0\n others left were the entries in the books, and these perforce were followed for lack of anything better. The result is to reproduce the situation that was found and commented on in a suit by the United Fuel Gas Company, an affiliated corporation. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 318\n, 49 S.Ct. 150, 155. 'On the record as made, appellants have failed to present any convincing evidence of value of their gas field which would enable us to assign to it any greater value than that which they appear to have assigned to it on their books. This book value, therefore, may be accepted, not as evidence of the real value of the gas field, but as an assumed value named by the appellants, which, on the evidence presented cannot reasonably be fixed at any higher figure.' Cf. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, \n278 \nU.S. 322, 326\n, 49 S.Ct. 157.\n\n 2. \nAmortization and depletion.\n In determining the price to be paid by the appellant for gas delivered at the gates, the commission included among the operating expenses of the affiliated seller an annual allowance of $4,158,954 to amortize the value of leaseholds No. 1 (the only leaseholds then in use) and of the well structures and equipment used in connection therewith, and thus provide a fund that would restore the depleted capital when the gas had been exhausted.\n The Supreme Court of Ohio expressed the view in its opinion that this allowance was not permissible under the statutes of the state. None the less it affirmed the order of the commission which fixed the rate of gas on the assumption that a charge for amortization was properly included in the operating expenses. In such circumstances the appellant is not aggrieved through the expression of a belief that the rate would have been lawful if the charge had been omitted.\n The amount of the allowance is adequate and even liberal. It was made on the assumption (1) that the value \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 304]\n\u00a0\n of the gas fields in class No. 1 was $25 an acre, and (2) that the life expectancy of the contents of the wells and of the appurtenant structures and equipment was only three years and two months. Both assumptions are erroneous, though the error results to the appellant's benefit. As to assumption (1), the state court has held that there is no satisfactory evidence of the value of the leases in class No. 1 in excess of the value assigned to them upon the books. A depletion allowance must therefore be excessive if it is made in the belief that a value of $25 per acre is the amount to be restored. As to assumption (2), there has been an underestimate of the life expectancy of the gas content of the wells, resulting once more in an exaggerated allowance for inroads upon capital. The prediction may have been correct in respect of the wells already driven and in use, though this is far from certain, but it was certainly too low if expectancy is to be measured by sources of supply in the 291, 000 acres that had never been tapped and were available for the future.\n The effect of these errors, and indeed of the first of them alone, without attempting to estimate the consequences of the second, is to make the amortization charge excessive to the extent of $761,098.50. In figuring the charge, the present value of the leases was treated as 41. 8874 per cent. of $7,284,900, or $3,051,455; that of the gas well construction as $5,944,692; and that of the gas well equipment as $4,069, 434-a total of $13,065,581. The actual present value of the leases in class No. 1 was not more than 41.8874 per cent. of $1,569,479, or $657,414. The fund to be restored through amortization was thus overestimated to the extent of $2,394,041 or 18 3\/10 per cent., which would reduce the annual charge, without change of the life expectancy, from $4,158,954 to $3,397, 865.50.\n We have assumed in what has been written that for the purpose of amortization the leases in class No. 1 are \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 305]\n\u00a0\n to be taken at the value shown on the books. The appellant will be little helped, however, if another standard is accepted. No method of valuation supported by the record will lay a basis for a holding that the allowance is inadequate to the point of confiscation. The truth seems to be, as was stated by a witness for the appellant, that the percentage of depletion appropriate for gas fields is 'the wildest sort of guess.' This results from many circumstances, not the least of which is the probability of improved methods of production. In an industry subject to these rapid changes, the prophecies of one year are likely to be overturned by the experience of the next.\n We think the allowance for depletion, instead of being too small, is so manifestly excessive as to supply a margin for the correction of other contested items that may approach the border line. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 317 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637.\n\n 3. \nReserve for depreciation.\n The commission allowed as a charge against the operating expenses of the affiliated seller an annual reserve of $667,612 to be placed in a sinking fund and devoted to the maintenance of the plant, with the exception of the wells and their equipment which had been separately cared for in the allowance for depletion.\n The appellant has failed to show in any conclusive or convincing way that this reserve will be inadequate.\n The commission also allowed as a charge against the appellant's operating expenses an annual reserve in the amount of 2 per cent. of the 'depreciable property' employed by the appellant in the business of distribution.\n The percentage so fixed is stated to be in accord with the practice of the appellant as disclosed in its annual reports on file with the commission.\n The contention that the percentage of allowance should have been 4 per cent. instead of 2 has no basis in the evidence. \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 306]\n\u00a0\n 4. Accrued Depreciation.\n In determining the price to be paid for gas delivered at the gateways, the commission appraised the wells and equipment of the affiliated seller as having suffered a depreciation of 58.1126 per cent. The appellant insists that the depreciation is excessive.\n There is evidence that the method of computation adopted by the commission is in accordance with the accepted practice of mining engineers. The practice is to ascertain the rock pressure at the initial flow of the gas and again at the time of the appraisal, and to measure the depreciation by the reduction thus disclosed. The wells and their equipment have only a scrap value after the exhaustion of the gas, and contents and containers thus depreciate together.\n The appellant, though complaining that the percentage of depreciation is excessive, has had a benefit, more than equivalent to any injury, in the enhancement of the allowance for amortization and depletion.\n\n 5. \nThe disallowance of the 'delay rentals' for unoperated leases.\n To keep alive the leases acquired as a reserve the affiliated seller paid the annual carrying charges (known as 'delay rentals'), and there is objection to the exclusion of the payments from operating expenses.\n We think it a sufficient answer that the annual amortization allowance of $4,158,954 has made provision for a fund whereby new leases can be acquired and paid for out of current earnings. Operating expenses are magnified unduly if they cover both the fund and the payments that are made out of it.\n\n 6. \nThe rate of 45 cents per thousand cubic feet viewed in the aspect of a customary charge.\n An attempt is made to show that the price paid by the appellant to the affiliated seller was the current or market rate in contracts between producers and distributors in \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 307]\n\u00a0\n other towns and cities. To bolster up that argument, a schedule of contracts was marked as an exhibit. Twenty-five contracts are listed. There is a concession that in all but two the seller is the Ohio Fuel Gas Company or an affiliated corporation. There is no evidence as to the relation between the seller and the buyers. For all that appears the buyers in most instances are parts of the same system. The prices are not uniform; many are higher than 45 cents, but some are lower, one of them being as low as 39 cents. Distances and other geographical conditions affecting the cost of transportation and delivery are undescribed and unexplained.\n The commission did not err in its determination that this was inconclusive evidence.\n\n 7. \nThe general administrative expenses incurred by the appellant in the conduct of its business.\n These, as claimed by the appellant, were $38,395; the commission reduced them to $32,432.\n A contract had been made with the Columbia Engineering & Management Corporation, an affiliated company, for services as manager in return for a percentage of the gross earnings. This item ($13,741) was found by the commission to be excessive to the extent of $5,963, and the compensation was reduced accordingly. In view of the close relation between the affiliated companies, the burden was upon the appellant to sustain the fairness of the contract. We cannot hold that it did so in opposition to the judgment of a commission acquainted with prices and other conditions in the localities affected.\n We have now considered the objections to the allowance and disallowance of operating expenses.\n To determine whether 39 cents per thousand cubic feet is a fair price to be paid for gas delivered at the gates, there has been need to consider the assets and expenses of the affiliated seller, for only thus has it been possible to estimate a fair return. \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 308]\n\u00a0\n We have kept in mind the principle that 'rates substantially higher than the line between validity and unconstitutionality properly may be deemed to be just and reasonable, and not excessive or extortionate.' Banton v. Belt Line Railway Corp., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 423\n, 45 S.Ct. 534, 537\n\n\n Even so, the burden of proof was on the buyer of the gas to show that in these transactions with the affiliated seller the price was no higher than would fairly be payable in a regulated business by a buyer unrelated to the seller and dealing at arm's length. Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Comm. of Kansas, \n285 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 52 S.Ct. 283.\n State court and commission did not act in an arbitrary fashion when they held upon the evidence before them that the burden had not been borne.\n There are certain other objections that have relation to the value of the appellant's property, and not to its expenses of operation or to the value of the property of the affiliated seller.\n To these we now turn.\n Second. The value of appellant's property.\n\n\n (a)\n Objection is made that the going value of the appellant's business should have been included in the base.\n The decisions of this court show what going value means (Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 313 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637), distinguish it from good will, and hold that upon proof of its existence it may have a place in the base upon which rates are to be computed. The Commission was of opinion that there was here no constituent of property that called for separate appraisal apart from the recognition that had been given it as a contributory factor in other elements of value.\n The appellant is a new company, engaged in business for a few years. The value of its physical assets is less than a million dollars. In the brief term of its existence it professes to have added to that value from $ 125,000 to \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 309]\n\u00a0\n $140,000 by combining the parts into an organism and causing them to work together. The commission took the view that whatever increment of value had emerged from these sources was sufficiently reflected in the allowance of the cost of developing 'new business' and in the appraisal of the physical assets as parts of an assembled whole. A like conclusion has been reached by this court in very similar conditions. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 314 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637. Going value is not something to be read into every balance sheet as a perfunctory addition. 'It calls for consideration of the history and circumstances of the particular enterprise.' Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 314 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 647. Here the company was a small one and its organization simple. There was no diversified and complex business with ramifying subdivisions. We cannot in fairness say that, after valuing the assets upon the basis of a plant in successful operation, there was left an element of going value to be added to the total. Even if the addition might have been made without departure from accepted principles, the omission to make it does not appear to have been so unreasonable or arbitrary as to overleap discretion and reach the zone of confiscation. 'It is necessary again, in this relation, to distinguish between the legislative and judicial functions.' Los Angeles Case, supra, page 314 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 647. Much that the framers of a schedule are at liberty to do, this court in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction may not require them to do. For the legislative process, at least equally with the judicial, there is an indeterminate penumbra within which choice is uncontrolled.\n\n\n (b)\n A number of other objections may conveniently be grouped together.\n The appellant complains of the refusal to make allowance for organization or preconstruction costs. There is no evidence that any were incurred, though this of itself \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 310]\n\u00a0\n is indecisive. Ohio Utilities Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n267 \nU.S. 359, 362\n, 45 S.Ct. 259. It is conjectural whether they would be incurred in the hypothetical event of a reproduction of the business, and, if incurred, in what amount. The appellant's position as a member of an affiliated system would have a tendency to reduce such expenses to a minimum. We think the ruling is supported by decisions of this court. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 310 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637; Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, \n287 \nU.S. 488, 500\n, 53 S.Ct. 234. To this it is to be added that the item is of negligible importance. Its presence or absence would not make the difference between confiscation and a fair return. We do not figure to so fine a point in determining the application of the constitutional restraints of power. \n4\n An intelligent estimate of probable future values (Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 31 A.L.R. 807), and even indeed of present ones, is at best an approximation. The like is true of a forecast of the extent of future revenues. There is left in every case a reasonable margin of fluctuation and uncertainty.\n The appellant complains also of the failure to include the hypothetical expense of financing the business as part of the cost of reproduction.\n Considering the absence of evidence that any such expense had been incurred when the business was established and the uncertainty that it would be incurred if the plant were destroyed and reproduced, we think this item under recent decisions was properly rejected as remote and conjectural. Wabash Valley Electric Co. v. Young, supra, page 500 of 287 U. S., 53 S.Ct. 234; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 311]\n\u00a0\n v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 310 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637. We are to remember that the cost of reproduction is a guide, but not a measure. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 307 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637.\n What has been said of the foregoing items applies with little variation to the reduction of 'general overheads,' or undistributed expenses during the period of construction, from 17 per cent., the amount claimed by the appellant, to 14 per cent., the amount allowed by the commission.\n The cost in imaginary conditions of cutting and restoring pavements was not an increment of value. Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153\n, 35 S.Ct. 811.\n The amount necessary for working capital was carefully computed, and has not been proved to be too small for the requirements of the business.\n Third. The rate of return on the investment.\n The appellant contends that, to avoid confiscation, the rate of return should be 8 per cent. instead of 6 1\/2, which was allowed.\n In view of business conditions, of which we take judicial notice ( Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 52 S.Ct. 146), the rate allowed was adequate (Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, page 319 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637).\n Whether a lower rate could be upheld is a question not before us.\n Dissection of the several items that have been criticized in the appellant's argument has thus brought us to the conclusion that the order of the commission, whether generous or ungenerous, is at all events not confiscatory, and hence not subject to revision here. But the conclusion has reinforcements that come to it from other avenues of approach. In a statement put in evidence by the appellant, the rate of return under the new schedule is said to be 128\/100 per cent. of the fair value of the property. Under the earlier schedule the revenue was even less. So modest \n\n[292 U.S. 290, 312]\n\u00a0\n a rate suggests an inflation of the base on which the rate has been computed. It is a strain on credulity to argue that the appellant, when putting into effect a new schedule of charges, was satisfied with one productive of so meager a return. The same surprise is excited when we consider what it claims as to the fair value of the gas delivered at the gates. All that the affiliated seller asks is 45 cents per thousand cubic feet, yet according to the appellant's figures nearly 7 cents more, or a price of about 52 cents, is necessary to protect the seller against the wrong of confiscation. The argument proves too much; the valuations are discredited by the teachings of experience. Men do not transact business without protest at confiscatory rates, at all events in the absence of extraordinary circumstances making submission to the loss expedient. If such circumstances exist, the appellant has not proved them. Nothing in the record lays the basis for a belief that the natural gas business in Ohio is unable to pay its way. That being so, what the public utility has done belies what it has said. We shall hardly go astray if we prefer the test of conduct.\n Upon the submission of the cause the appellant made a motion to amend its assignments of error, which motion is now granted.\n The decree of the Supreme Court of Ohio, affirming the order of the Public Utilities Commission, does not impair any privileges or immunities secured to the appellant by the Constitution of the United States, and must therefore be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The appraisal of the appellant's property at the amount fixed by the commission will allow a return of 6 1\/2 per cent. if operating expenses are lowered by this reduction of the gateway price.

GRAY(1934)\nNo. 709\nArgued: May 1, 1934Decided: May 21, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. Dean S. Edmonds, William H. Davis, and George E. Middleton, all of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Thomas Raeburn White, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[292 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In an action at law, respondent, Gray, alleged that the petitioners had infringed his patent for a power transmitting mechanism and asked damages. The patent contains six claims; he relied upon all except the fourth. A plea of the general issue and notice of special matters raised questions of novelty, invention, and infringement.\n The cause was first tried to a jury, Judge Dickinson presiding. Certain facts were stipulated; witnesses were examined by both parties; there were many exhibits. The jury found for respondent; the judge granted a new trial because he deemed the charge inadequate.\n Thereupon, the parties stipulated in writing 'that trial by jury is hereby waived and that the case shall be submitted to the Court for decision upon the record already made, as if the testimony and exhibits offered in evidence at the trial before Judge Dickinson and a jury had been duly offered in evidence before the Judge who may be assigned to hear this case, subject to any objections which appear on the record, and that all motions made by either party at the said trial shall be deemed to have been made before the Judge trying the case, both parties to have the right of appeal as in other cases.'\n Afterwards, at a session held before Judge Kirkpatrick, the issues between the parties 'came to be tried by the Court without a jury upon the record of the same case which had been previously tried before a jury and the Court the tenth to fourteenth days inclusive of December, 1931, the issue between the said parties having been tried by the Court without a jury on said seventeenth day of March, 1932, in accordance with a stipulation entered into by and between the attorneys for the respective \n\n[292 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n parties, at which date, namely March 17, 1932, came as well the said plaintiff as the said defendants by their res ective attorneys; and upon the trial the counsel for the respective parties offered their evidence as particularly set forth in the following stenographic notes of testimony and the stenographer's minutes attached hereto; and the evidence in the cause being closed the learned Trial Judge rendered his opinion and decision, in writing, as hereinafter set forth. ...' Judgment went for the petitioners here July 16, 1932. A supporting opinion dealt generally with the issues. Near the end of it he said: 'The statements of fact contained in this opinion may be taken as findings of fact. If separate findings of fact are desired the parties may submit requests in accordance herewith.' And he thus summarized his conclusions:\n'1. The combination of closed coil inner thrust member and open coil outer sheath member is not patentable because its elements were known to the prior art and no new mode of operation or functional relationship arises from putting them together.\n\n'2. Claims 1 and 2 cannot be interpreted as calling for a closed coil inner thrust member in view of the file wrapper history of this patent.\n\n'3. Claims 1 and 2 are anticipated.\n\n'4. Claim 3 is not infringed.\n\n'5. Claims 5 and 6 are invalid because United States patent No. 1,297, 327 to Dakin and Underwood antedating the plaintiff's application discloses the method of attaching the thrust member to the stem claimed, and conclusion '1' applies to these claims.'\n\n Finally, he directed, 'judgment may be entered for the defendant.'\n Counsel for Gray tendered a bill of exceptions 'to the rulings, opinion and action of the said Court, and re- \n\n[292 U.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n quested the seal of the Judge aforesaid should be put to the same, according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.' This was duly signed and sealed July 28, 1932. The bill contains the evidence presented and the minutes of the proceedings. It shows no exception to any ruling upon a motion presented by respondent during the progress of the cause. The transcript shows the following docket entry opposite the date January 9, 1932: 'Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the verdict and assessment of treble damages filed' without more. This is not enough to support the suggestion that a motion for judgment upon the whole record was duly presented and overruled accompanied by adequate exceptions.\n August 15, 1932, respondent prayed and obtained allowance of an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The assignment of errors there stated in five separate paragraphs that the trial judge erred in finding as set out in conclusions 1, 2, 3, and 5, supra, and in granting the judgment.\n Counsel for petitioner correctly affirmed: 'Examination of this bill of exceptions discloses that no request or motion was made, denied, and excepted to, or any like action taken during the progress of the trial, which presented to the trial court the question whether there was support in the evidence for the findings challenged by the assignment of errors or whether the undisputed evidence required contrary findings. The fact is that respondent made no request for any findings of fact or for any rulings of law at any time, either during the first trial before the jury, or during the progress of the second trial before the court, or even after the filing of the opinion directing judgment for defendants.'\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals petitioners unsuccessfully moved for dismissal of the appeal or affirmation of \n\n[292 U.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n the challenged judgment. They pointed out the situation disclosed by the record, and relied upon Fleischmann Construction Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349\n, 46 S.Ct. 284. The court examined the record, held the patent valid and infringed, and reversed the challenged judgment. It declared: 'In substance, the trial was a quasi demurrer. No witnesses were examined. On final hearing neither party asked for any special findings of fact, for there were no disputed facts.' This we think was error. The motion to affirm should have been gr nted. The trial was not 'in substance a quasi demurrer.' All the essential facts were not stipulated, or agreed upon by counsel. To proceed upon the contrary view was improper.\n In Fleischmann Construction Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 356 S., 357, 46 S.Ct. 284, 287, opinion by Mr. Justice Sanford, this Court considered and announced and proper interpretation of sections 649 and 700, R.S. (28 U.S. Code,  773, 875 (28 USCA  773, 875)), copied in the margin. Concerning civil causes tried without the intervention of a jury, we there said: 'And it is settled by repeated decisions, that in the absence of special findings, the general finding of the court \n\n[292 U.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n is conclusive upon all matters of fact, and prevents any inquiry into the conclusions of law embodied therein, except in so far as the rulings during the progress of the trial were excepted to and duly preserved by bill of exceptions, as required by the statute. ... To obtain a review by an appellate court of the conclusions of law a party must either obtain from the trial court special findings which raise the legal propositions, or present the propositions of law to the court and obtain a ruling on them.' This ruling was followed in Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 48 S.Ct. 63, and in Harvey Co. v. Malley, \n288 \nU.S. 415, 418\n, 53 S.Ct. 426.

(C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 862.\n The assignments of error in the Circuit Court of Appeals presented no point based upon the pleadings. The bill of exceptions disclosed no special findings of fact nor any proposition of law duly presented and relied upon during the progress of the trial. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed; the only by the District Court is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] U.S. Code Ann. \"Sec. 773.

CO. v. BROOKLYN EDISON CO.(1934)\nNo. 611\nArgued: March 15, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 69, 70]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Melville Church and D.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had previously held the patent valid and infringed. Metropolitan Device Corp. v. Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., 36 F.(2d) 477. \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n Correct appreciation of the contentions made requires at the outset some discussion of the structure of electric cables for the transmission of high-tension (voltage) electric currents and, more particularly, the causes of leakage or wastage of current at the joints of such cables, for the prevention of which the patented device is said to be useful. Cables for the transmission of high-tension currents comprise a plurality of copper conductors, usually three in number, each covered with an insulating tape of paper or fabric, inclosed in an outer insulating wrapping, and all in turn surrounded by pervious insulating material filling the interstices between the conductors and saturated with oil. The whole is inclosed in a lead tube or sheath, which constitutes the outer surface or cover of the cable. In practice, the cables are spliced or connected by forming a joint at the connecting ends. This is accomplished by cutting back the lead sheath for a suitable distance, bringing the ends of the conductors together and joining them, usually by a connecting copper sleeve, and covering or surrounding them with successive wrappings or layers of insulating material, impregnated with an insulating compound such as an oil, long recognized as a desirable insulating material. A cylindrical lead sleeve is then placed over the joint and soldered at its ends to the lead sheath of the cable so as to surround and hermetically inclose the joint. Through openings made in the sleeve insulating compounds may be introduced.\n Leakage of current at the joint results from imperfect insulation. Deterioration in the insulation may result from the drying out of the insulating material, particularly through loss or 'bleeding' of the insulating fluid at the ends, or when the cable is cut. Also high-tension currents, ranging upwards from 15,000 volts, develop heat in the conductors and adjacent material, with consequent expansion and corresponding contraction when cooling, known as 'breathing.' This causes migration of the in \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 72]\n\u00a0\n sulating compound within the cable and to some extent its extrusion, and produces cracks and voids in it, with resulting ionization of the interstitial air at high tensions, and the lowering of the dielectric strength or resistance of the cable at the joint.\n The patent claimed is for a device, in combination, to prevent current leakage by improving the insulation. Claim 4, upon which alone the petitioner relies, reads:\n'4. An electric cable, comprising a sheath, a line conductor having a joint, a body of pervious insulating material inclosing said joint, the said sheath being removed for a distance sufficient to expose said pervious body, a sleeve of impervious material of greater diameter than said body, inclosing the same and hermetically united at its ends to said cable sheath, a receptacle communicating with the interior of said sleeve, and an insulating fluid adapted to permeate said pervious body contained in said receptacle and the space between said body and said sleeve.'\n\n On February 11, 1927, before either the present suit or that in the Sixth Circuit was begun, an assignee of the patent and petitioner's predecessor in interest filed a disclaimer of the improvement, 'except for electric cables which comprise a line conductor, insulating wrapping permeated with insulating compound and a sheath of flexible, inelastic metal constituting a unitary product of manufacture and commerce which is portable and capable of being drawn through conduits; and except as to an insulating liquid which is fluid at ordinary working temperatures of such cables and in quantity sufficient to supply at all times the demands made by the cable in use, and by the joint.'\n Petitioner's expert testified at the trial, as the prior art shows, that Torchio was not the first to discover that oil is an insulating material; that he was not the first to provide a cable with conductors inclosed in insulating ma- \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 73]\n\u00a0\n terial permeated with oil, or the first to make joints in a cable or to use pervious insulated wrappings of joints, or to show a sleeve inclosing the joint larger than the sheath of the cable, hermetically closed and connected to the metal sheath of the cable. The only elements enumerated in the claim, asserted to be new, are the receptacle communicating with the interior of the sleeve, and the insulating oil or liquid, fluid at low temperatures, contained in the receptacle and in the space between the sleeve and the pervious insulating material surrounding the joint.\n The issue for decision is whether the addition of these elements, in combination with the others enumerated in the claim, involve invention.\n In the earlier case the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held claims 3 and 4 valid. Claim 3 embraces all the elements of claim 4, except the communicating reservoir containing the described insulating fluid. That court did not discuss the reservoir or pass upon its effect as adding anything patentable to the combination. It concluded on the evidence before it that Torchio had substituted, in a combination which was old, a liquid insulating compound for a compound not soft enough to flow, that this was new and was enough 'beyond the skill of an expert' to amount to invention, and that the patent was there infringed by the use in the combination of a joint-insulating compound 'normally of the consistency of vaseline or jelly.' In the present case both courts below found that the use of oil or an insulating liquid, fluid at ordinary working temperatures, within the sleeve inclosing the joint, had been disclosed in printed publications before the alleged invention by Torchio, and they held that the addition of the reservoir or receptacle containing the fluid and communicating with the interior of the sleeve did not involve invention and was known before Torchio. \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n Brief reference will be made to the prior art, shown by the present record, which was not before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the earlier case.\n The British patent of Geipel, No. 11,280, of December 8, 1894, disclosed an electric cable joint box 'filled with a suitable insulating material, as for example oil, wax, bitumen, or any combination of any of these according to the nature of the insulation used for the conductor ... with paper or jute insulated conductors oil may be used.' The patent states 'with paper, jute, hemp, flax, cotton or other suitable insulating material the joints ... are best surrounded by oil.'\n The Lemp patent, No. 534,802, of February 26, 1895, speaks of the use of oil in electric transformers in which the conductors forming the primary are insulated with asbestos 'loosely wound to allow the asbestos to take up the oil.' The space containing the primary 'is filled with oil connected with a reservoir or supply pipe being maintained to allow for expansion under increase of temperature.'\n In 1907 De Gelder published at The Hague a description of the electric cable system of the city of Amsterdam. He described 'high tension cables for 3,000 volts' having paper insulation impregnated 'with a rather thin liquid, oily and not too resinous mass' with cable joints bound with linen tape first boiled in oil so that it is completely saturated, with the wrapped joint inclosed in a lead sleeve, soldered to the lead sheath of the cable. Through a hole cut in the top of the sleeve or socket 'hot insulating mass is poured into the socket. For this purpose the same mass or rather the same oil is used as for impregnating the cable. It is a kind of resin oil.' The paper also points out that the impregnating mass used with the high-tension, paper insulated cables supplied by a British firm is thinner than that used in other types, that in the British cables being \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 75]\n\u00a0\n 'a rather thin resinous oil at 15 degrees Centigrade, 59 degrees Fahrenheit.'\n Since 1911 the Consolidated Gas Electric Light & Power Company in Baltimore has used oil in insulating its cables carrying a current of 13, 000 volts or more, the cables consisting of three paper-wrapped conductors, insulated with oil impregnated jute, inclosed in a lead sheath. To avoid the draining out of the cables and the consequent defective insulation in sections extending vertically from the subterranean conduits to the power houses, the cables were passed into enlarged containers or potheads containing oil, which, flowing downward in the cables, replenished the oil in the jute insulation for distances as great as 1,200 feet. Paraffin, solid at ordinary temperatures, which had originally been placed in the potheads, was found unsatisfactory. Defective insulation resulted from drying out of the cables, and in 1911 paraffin was replaced by an oil which was fluid at ordinary temperature.\n Vernier, in an article on 'The Laying and Maintenance of High Tension Cables,' published in the journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1911 and in summarized form in 'The Electrician' of March 10, 1911, discussed in detail the insulation of joints in electric cables carrying currents up to 20,000 volts. He described a cable consisting of three paper insulated conductors inclosed in a lead sheath or tube. He pointed out the dangers of voids in joint insulating material and ensuing gas ionization which result in reduced 'breakdown pressure' or dielectric strength, and described a method of insulating the joint by wrapping the conductors with oil impregnated tape surrounded with insulating material, all inclosed in a lead sleeve, soldered to the lead sheath of the cable. This sleeve, he stated, was then filled with an insulating compound of either 'an oil or a viscous joint box compound, preferably the latter, which can run into the tubes \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 76]\n\u00a0\n and all parts of the joint box.' Again, 'Such a compound must be viscous of about the consistency of thick cream at ordinary temperatures. When heated it should run as freely as heated oil so as to penetrate all crevices and it must retain these features through its life. ...' The tendency of solid compounds to form air voids was pointed out, and the author's preference for a joint filled with oil or a compound viscous at ordinary temperatures was stated. Vernier's teaching of 'a viscous compound which never sets' is referred to in connection with his name in Pender's American Handbook of Electrical Engineers, 1914, a standard work of authority.\n Torchio himself, in a written report to his employers, in 1914, on the Berlin cable system, transmitting currents of 30,000 volts, described the cables as having joints inclosed in a lead sleeve soldered to the lead sheathing of the cable by means of 'wiped joints,' and as being insulated with a compound which 'at normal temperature is semi-liquid and is similar to the compound used for saturation of cables.' In August, 1914, an associate, in reporting to him in writing upon the underground cable system in Boston carrying from 13,000 to 25,000 volts, described cables in use there as consisting of three conductors, paper wrapped and sheathed in lead. He described a joint box in use inclosing the insulated conductors and filled with an insulating compound which 'at ordinary temperature is about the viscosity of molasses.'\n The prior art thus briefly outlined shows that an insulating fluid, described in Torchio's fourth claim as 'adapted to permeate the pervious material surrounding the conductors,' used with the other elements of the joint sleeve combination embraced in his third claim, was not new, and was fully described in publications before Torchio. Its advantages in such use over nonfluid compounds had been recognized and pointed out. Hence petitioner's claim to patentable invention must rest on the \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n addition of the other elements enumerated in claim 4; the receptacle containing the described insulating fluid and communicating with the sleeve.\n The combination thus effected, it is said, is especially adapted to insulating the joint, and is useful in replacing the loss of insulating oil, in connection with the 'breathing' which takes place in the cable, particularly at the joints when in use. The expansion of the interior cable parts and insulating material, accompanying the rise in temperature, forces the oil from the joints along the cable and also causes it to exude at the joints. As the cable cools, the fluid insulation, particularly at the joint, may not be sufficient to fill it and voids result. This occurs the more readily if the insulating compound tends to solidify at cooling temperatures. These consequences are avoided by the use, in conjunction with the reservoir, of oil which is sufficiently fluid to flow freely at ordinary cable temperatures. The breathing accompanying the alternate expansion and contraction of the cable through the creation of partial vacua within the insulating material facilitates the migration of the oil within the cable. The reservior provides for sufficient excess of reserve oil to restore the losses of oil from the joint and thus to prevent formation of the voids or to fill them.\n Breathing is a natural phenomenon. The expansion and contraction of materials used in cables under the influence of changing temperatures are within the range of ordinary scientific knowledge. Breathing is readily observable and known by those having the skill of the art. Torchio did not invent it, nor was he the first to observe it. Publications before Torchio did not make use of the term, but they disclosed knowledge of the effect of temperature changes upon the cable and the insulating fluid. In 1907, De Gelder, in recommending the use of oil in joint boxes, mentioned the fact that the heating of the cable would cause the insulating mass to flow from the \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n joints, and called attention to the probability that if the oil was pressed out by overheating 'when contraction takes place water will be sucked in even though the junction box may be well sealed.' He also spoke of the downward shifting or draining out of the oil in cables if elevated at or near their terminals, as had been observed in the lines of the Baltimore light and power system. The potheads used as oil reservoirs in the Baltimore installation, when full of a free-flowing oil, were observed to overflow when the cables were heated, and the migration of the oil along the cables for considerable distances was also noted. Vernier noted the shrinkage of joint box insulating compounds on cooling and their tendency in the process to form vacua, and, 'if of a solid nature, to form blow holes or air pockets.' In recommending that the joint sleeve be filled with oil, he pointed out the tendency of the insulating oil to run out of the cable when cut, and recommended the construction of the joint by the use of insulating tape 'so as to allow the greatest possible freedom of access to the oil which will keep the insulating tapes constantly impregnated.' The oil or joint box compound used, he said 'must be viscous and of about the consistency of thick cream at ordinary temperatures,' and he stated that impregnation 'will be greatly assisted by the constant temperature changes which the cable undergoes under changes of load.' This was a clear recognition of the phenomenon of breathing and the adaptability to it of an oil which, with the heat developed in high-tension cables, would flow freely 'so as to penetrate all crevices.'\n Thus the use in cable joints of an oil, free flowing at prevailing cable temperatures, by introducing it into the joint sleeve combination of petitioner's third claim, was not only old, but before Torchio the special adaptability of that combination to the need because of the expansion and contraction of the cable structure in use had been recognized and described by publication. \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 79]\n\u00a0\n To this the petitioner added the oil reservoir. The fact that the combination, without it, was old, does not preclude invention by the addition of a new and useful element. Parks v. Booth, \n102 U.S. 96\n, 104. But the addition must be the result of invention, not the mere exercise of the skill of the calling and not one plainly indicated by the prior art. Figure 1 of the patent shows the receptacle claimed, a reservoir connecting with the lead sleeve. Figure 6 shows the sleeve without the connecting reservoir, protruding upward above the wrapped joint so as to form a dome affording an increased interior oil space. The patent states: 'Instead of making the reservoir 10 in the form of a separate chamber communicating with the sleeve as shown in Figure 1, I may dispose the sleeve eccentrically on the joint so that the greatest clearance will be uppermost as shown at 12 in Figure 6. In this way I produce an additional holding space for the oil within the sleeve itself.' This additional holding space is thus described as the equivalent of the reservoir in the form of a separate chamber or receptacle, enumerated in claim 4. Vernier showed a like enlargement in the sleeve in sketches in his published article. He does not refer to this protuberance or dome as a reservoir, but, examined in the light of the text, its function is unmistakable. See In re Bager (Cust. & Pat. App.) 47 F.(2d) 951, 953.\n The prior art had also foreshadowed the enlargement in the form of a receptacle or reservoir. Such were the potheads used by the Baltimore Power & Light Company for oil impregnation of cable insulation. Lemp showed and described an additional holding space in the form of a connecting receptacle for the oil insulation of transformers. But in any case enlargement of the oil space in the sleeve in an existing combination, so as to increase the oil supply, would clearly not involve any special skill, to say nothing of invention. It was not invention to bring into the combination its equivalent, a further enlargement \n\n[292 U.S. 69, 80]\n\u00a0\n and extension of the holding space in the form of the familiar device of a connecting oil cup or reservoir, so as to increase the oil supply. No more than the skill of the calling was involved. Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177\n, 46 S.Ct. 42; Saranac Automatic Machine Corporation v.

LOMBARD(1934)\nNo. 463\nArgued: March 6, 1934Decided: April 9, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. H. McClendon, Jr., and J. Zach Spearing, both of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. P. M. Milner, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent Lombard, owner of motor ship Lucky Girl and a sand barge, presented to the District Court, Canal Zone, a libel in rem against the Real and in personam against her owner, Elliot, to recover damages resulting from a collision between those vessels-July, \n\n[292 U.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n 1930. The Real was seized under admiralty process; her owner claimed and secured her release under a stipulation, whereon the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company was surety, which contained the following clause: 'Now, therefore, the condition of this stipulation is such that if the stipulators undersigned, shall at any time, upon the interlocutory or final order or decree of the said District Court, or of any Appellate Court to which the above named suit may proceed, and upon notice of such order or decree to Van Siclen and Boggs, Esquires, Proctors for the Claimant of the said Motorship Real, abide by and pay the money awarded by the final decree rendered by the Court or the Appellate Court if any appeal intervene, then this stipulation to be void otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.'\n The stipulation also contained the further clause: 'and the parties hereto hereby consenting and agreeing that in case of default or contumacy on the part of the claimant or their surety, execution for the above amount may issue against their goods, chattels and lands.'\n Elliot filed an answer, also a cross-libel against the Lucky Girl.\n After a hearing in open court, Lombard prevailed and had a decree, August 27, 1932, the presently important portions of which follow:\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the libelant herein do have and recover from the respondent herein the sum of $6,321.29, with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from the 31st day of July, 1930, together with the libelant's costs taxed in the sum of $117.20, with interest thereon until paid; and it is further\n\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed, that unless this decree be satisfied or an appeal taken within ten days after service of a copy of this decree with notice of entry upon the respondent or his proctor, execution issue against \n\n[292 U.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n Hans Elliot, respondent, and the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., his stipulators for costs and value, their goods, chattels and lands to satisfy this decree; and it is further\n\n'Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the cross-libel herein be dismissed at cross-libelant's costs.'\n\n Notice of the entry of this decree was duly made on the proctor August 31, 1932\n\n\n September 10, 1932, Elliot alone, without notice to the surety or severance, secured an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. In April, 1933, Lombard moved to dismiss the appeal upon the grounds that the decree was against the claimant Elliot and the surety jointly, that the surety was a necessary party to the appeal but had not been made such, and that the period limited therefor had expired. By way of avoiding that motion the surety then asked to join with Elliot in the prosecution of the appeal and Elliot moved for leave to amend so as to include the surety as party appellant.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals regarded the matter thus presented as of uncertain solution but concluded, with some division in opinion, that the decree was joint and in that view regarded our decision in Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company v. Bunn, \n285 \nU.S. 169\n, 52 S.Ct. 354, as controlling, and accordingly dismissed the appeal. The case so relied upon was a suit in equity which was brought to this Court on appeal from the Supreme Court of Mississippi which had awarded a joint judgment for the payment of money against a litigant and his surety. We there said ( pages 178, 182 of 285 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 354, 356):\n'The judgment is joint in form and no reason appears why either or both of the parties defendant therein might not have appealed to this Court and submitted claims of error for our determination. In matters of this kind we may not disregard the face of the record and treat the judgment as something other than it appears to be. So \n\n[292 U.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n to do probably would lead to much confusion and uncertainty. ...\n\n'We cannot undertake to explore the record to ascertain what issues were relied upon in courts below. So to do would lead to uncertainty and unfortunate confusion. We must accept the terms of the judgment as entered. As pointed out above, this is the approved practice when it becomes necessary to determine whether a judgment is final or to what court a writ of error should run. Like reasons apply and control here.'\n\n If the decree in the present admiralty suit were joint, as the judgment in that equity suit was, we should regard the rule there announced and applied as controlling here. But we think the decree in the present suit is not joint within the spirit of that rule. The release stipulation was given by the claimant Elliot under 28 U.S.C.  754, 28 USCA  754 (Rev. St.  941), and Admiralty Rules 5, 6, 11, and 12 (254 U.S. Appendix (28 USCA  723)), and its purpose was to secure the release to him of the vessel then held under admiralty process. Under the statute and the admiralty rules the stipulation was thereby substituted for the vessel and the latter was released. Had the vessel not been released exectuion on thedecree subsequently rendered would have run against the vessel. By the terms of the stipulation the claimant and his surety consented and agreed that the execution might run against their goods, chattels and lands, instead of against the vessel.\n The decree which was rendered is in three parts. By the first the libelant is awarded a recovery of damages in a stated sum, with interest and costs, against the claimant, there called respondent; by the second execution is awarded against the claimant and his surety 'unless this decree be satisfied or an appeal taken within ten days after service of a copy'; and by the third the claimant's cross-libel is dismissed. \n\n[292 U.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n The decree is in a form long recognized as admissible in such an admiralty proceeding. The principal part-that which awards a recovery in damages for the collision-is directed only against the claimant Elliot, not against him and the surety. The only mention of the surety is in the dependent and contingent part relating to the issue of execution, and this part of the decree is based upon provisions in Admiralty Rules 5, 12, and 20 (28 USCA  723), under which, where a release stipulation is given and the libelant obtains a decree for the payment of money, summary process of execution may be issued against the principal and sureties for the purpose of enforcing the decree.\n We think the decree is to be read in connection with the applicable statute and admiralty rules and that when so read it is not joint. That it might have been made joint is not of present importance. There was no requirement that it be so made, and in fact it was not so made. So, giving effect to the face of the record, as the rule in the Bunn Case requires, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the claimant's appeal, without the surety joining therein, could not be entertained. The decree of that court is accordingly reversed, and the cause is remanded to it for consideration and disposal on the merits.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE BALDWIN(1934)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 610, 612]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Kelley and Harry R. Jones, both of Houston, Tex., Edward J. White, of St. Louis, Mo., and Frank Andrews, of Houston, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. Lon E. Blankenbecker, of Houston, Tex. (Mr. Richard W. Franklin, of Houston, Tex., of counsel), for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This petition for a writ of mandamus, filed in this Court by leave, prays that the federal court for Southern Texas and Thomas M. Kennerly, judge thereof, be commanded to take jurisdiction, on a petition for removal, of a suit instituted in a state court of Texas by Tyrrell-Garth Investment Company. The petitioners are the defendants in that suit. \n1\n Two of them, Baldwin and Thompson, are the trustees in bankruptcy of the Missouri Pacific Railroad system and are operating it. They were appointed by orders of the federal court for Eastern Missouri entered in proceedings for reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended March 3, 1933, c. 204,  1, 47 Stat. 1474 (11 USCA  205). The other two petitioners are Texas corporations-Houston North Shore Railway Company and Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Railway Company-and are parts of the Missouri Pacific system. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 610, 613]\n\u00a0\n The federal court entered an order denying the petition for removed and returned the papers to the petitioners, on the ground that it appears from the petition for removal that the suit is not one in which it is sought to hold the trustees 'responsible in their own person and\/or property but only in their representative capacity. See Ruff v. Gay (D.C.) 3 F.Supp. 264; Id. (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 684.' The trustees claim that they are entitled to a writ of mandamus, because the suit in the state court is removable under section 33 of the Judicial Code as amended by Act of August 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532 (28 USCA  76), being an action against officers of a court 'of the United States on account of acts done under color of their office and in performance of their duties as such officers.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The petition for mandamus alleges that among the properties of which the trustees took possession is an interurban railway in Texas, owned by the Houston North Shore Railway and leased to the Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Railway; that they had taken possession of this property prior to the institution of the suit in the state court; and that the necessary effect of the institution and prosecution of the suit in the state court 'is and will be to materially interfere with and obstruct the jurisdiction and powers of the federal court for eastern Missouri, with respect to the properties and assets of said debtors, the Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Railway Company and Houston North Shore Railway Company, and each of them.'\n The petition for mandamus shows further, by reference to the complaint of the investment company, that a part \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 614]\n\u00a0\n of the interurban railway's right of way had been acquired by mesne conveyance from the predecessor in title of the investment company; that, after the trustees took possession of this interurban railway, the investment company brought the suit in the state court in which it claims that it is the owner of the fee of a part of the land over which the railway extends, and that the easement of right of way has been forfeited by failure of the Texas corporations and the trustees to operate trains thereon in accordance with the conditions contained in a contract which accompanied the grant of the right of way,4 and prayed as follows: That the deeds conveying the right of way be canceled; that they be 'annulled and held for naught as an existing cloud upon plaintiff's title to the lands and properties therein conveyed'; that the two railways and the trustees be enjoined from making further use of the lands for the operation of the interurban railway or otherwise; and that the complainant recover from Houston North Shore Railway and the trustees 'in their capacity as trustees' damages in the sum of $150,000.\n We are of opinion that the trustees may be entitled to have their controversy with the investment company adjudicated in the federal court, but are not entitled to the remedy of mandamus, because, to secure adjudication in the federal court of their rights and duties, they could have applied, and still can apply so far as now appears, either in the original bankruptcy proceeding, or by an ancillary bill in Texas, for an injunction to restrain the investment company from prosecuting its suit in the state court. \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 615]\n\u00a0\n First. All property in the possession of a bankrupt of which he claims the ownership passes, upon the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, into the custody of the court of bankruptcy. To protect its jurisdiction from interference, that court may issue an injunction. The power is not peculiar to bankruptcy or to the federal courts. It is an application of the general principle that, where a court of competent jurisdiction has, through its officers, taken property into its possession, the property is thereby withdrawn from the jurisdiction of other courts. Having possession, the court may not only issue all writs necessary to protect its possession from physical interference, but is entitled to determine all questions respecting the same. Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S. Ct. 399; compare Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 49 S.Ct. 310; Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 319\n, 51 S.Ct. 465. The jurisdiction in such cases is exclusive of the jurisdiction of other courts, although otherwise the controversy would be cognizable in them. Murphy v. John Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562, 569\n, 29 S.Ct. 154. In bankruptcy, this rule applies regardless of whether the property is located in the district in which the bankruptcy proceeding originated. The injunction to protect its possession may issue either from the court of original jurisdiction or from the fedeal court for the district in which the state court suit is brought or in which the plaintiff in that suit resides. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734, 737\n, 738 S., 51 S.Ct. 270.5\n Second. It is immaterial that the investment company, after the petition for removal had been presented to the federal court, amended its complaint in the state court by striking therefrom so much of the prayer as sought to enjoin the two railways and the trustees from \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 616]\n\u00a0\n making further use of the lands for operation of the interurban railway or otherwise. \n6\n The purpose of the amendment was evidently to confine the litigation in the state court to the issue of the right and title to the property, as distinguished from its use during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, in the hope of thereby removing the obvious interference with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. But the exclusive jurisdiction acquired by the bankruptcy court through taking possession of the interurban railway under claim of title was not limited to the prevention of interference with the use of the land. Compare Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 44 S.Ct. 232; Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 44 S.Ct. 396. The jurisdiction extends also to the adjudication of questions respecting the title. White v. Schloerb, \n178 \nU.S. 542\n, 20 S.Ct. 1007; In re Eppstein (C.C.A.) 156 F. 42, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 465. Compare Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, 208 U.S 38, 54, 28 S.Ct. 182; Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, \n278 \nU.S. 149, 153\n, 49 S.Ct. 84. 7\n Third. The inherent power of the bankruptcy court to protect its jurisdiction, over property of which it has taken possession, from interference by suit thereafter begun in a state court, has not been abridged by any legis- \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 617]\n\u00a0\n lation of Congress. The power is expressly reserved to the bankruptcy court in Judicial Code  265 (28 USCA  379), which contains the general prohibition against staying proceedings in state courts. Nor is this power of the bankruptcy court affected by section 23(a) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 552, 11 USCA 46(a), which declares:\n'The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between trustees as such and adverse claimants concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies had been between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants.'\n\n That section relates only to suits in which the trustees are plaintiffs. It has no restrictive effect on the right of trustees or receivers to protect their possession or title through proceedings in the bankruptcy court. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Nor is the inherent power of the bankruptcy court to protect its jurisdiction in respect to property of which it has taken possession abridged by Judicial Code  66 (28 USCA  125), which declares:\n'Every receiver or manager of any property appointed by any court of the United States may be sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business connected with such property, without the previous leave of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed; but such suit shall be subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such manager or receiver was appointed so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice.' \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 618]\n\u00a0\n That section does not abridge the exclusive jurisdiction of the court over property of which it has taken possession. In re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 165, 182\n, 184 S., 13 S.Ct. 785.9\n\n Fourth. It is true that the investment company seeks, in addition to the adjudication of the forfeiture of the right of way, damages 'in the sum of $150,000' from the two railways and 'from the trustees in their said capacity as trustees' for failure to maintain the daily schedule of passenger trains set forth in the contract. This prayer of the complaint is no bar to staying the suit in the state court. The exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is determined by the main purpose of the suit, which is to have the forfeiture declared and the alleged cloud upon title removed. The claim for damages is merely an incident. Moreover, the breach of contract for which damages are claimed is not 'an act or transaction of the 'trustees' in carrying on the business connected with such property.' The breach alleged is that of 'wholly' ceasing to maintain the passenger train schedule. It is alleged that this breach had occurred months before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding. The only wrong with which the trustees are charged is in not 'now maintaining' the service. Such nonfeasance is not an 'act or transaction' within the meaning of section 66 (28 USCA  125).10\n We have no occasion to determine otherwise the scope of Judicial Code  33, as amended (28 USCA  76). Nor need we consider whether the federal court, if it had entertained the petition for removal, would have been obliged to dismiss the suit on the ground that the state court was without jurisdiction because the bankruptcy court had possession of the res. \n\n[291 U.S. 610, 619]\n\u00a0\n Compare Isaacs v. Hobbs Timber & Tie Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734, 738\n, 739 S., 51 S.Ct. 270; Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 42 S.Ct. 349.11 It is sufficient that the extraordinary remedy of mandamus should be denied, because the trustees may by the common remedy of injunction prevent any interference with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Compare Ex parte Park Square Automobile Station, \n244 \nU.S. 412, 414\n, 37 S.Ct. 732; Ex parte Riddle, \n255 \nU.S. 450\n, 41 S.Ct. 370; Ex parte Krentler- Arnold Hinge Last Co., \n286 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S.Ct. 621. Moreover, the bankruptcy court might, in the exercise of its discretion, conclude that it is desirable to have the litigation proceed in the state court. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Rule discharged. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There is another defendant in the state court suit (Johnson) who did not join in the petition for removal. The allegations concerning him are not here material. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] All the stock of these corporations is owned by New Orleans, Texas & Mexico Railway Company; and nearly all of the latter's voting stock is owned by the Missouri Pacific. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Judicial Code  33 as amended (28 USCA  76) provides: 'When any civil suit ... is commenced in any court of a State ... against any officer of the courts of the United States for or on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance of his duties as such officer ... the said suit ... may at any time before the trial or final hearing thereof be removed for trial into the district court ... in the district where the same is pending.'\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The contract provided for an easement subject to forfeiture for nonuser for the purpose of an interurban railroad. 'Nonuser' is defined as failure to operate the railroad for 30 successive days; and 'operation' as involving a passenger schedule over which first-class coaches must run over the entire line by electric or gas engines on a regular schedule of at least one train not less than every two hours of each day from 6 o'clock a.m. until 12 o'clock midnight.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See In re Patterson Lumber Co.

As to railroads, see section 77 added to the Bankruptcy Act by Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204,  1, 47 Stat. 1467, 1474 (11 USCA  205).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] From the answer to the petition for removal filed by the investment company in the federal court it appears that, after the filing of the petition for removal, and before action thereon by the federal court, the investment company had moved in the state court to dismiss so much of the prayer in its suit as seeks an injunction against the trustees in their official capacity and the two railway companies; and that the state court granted the motion 'without prejudice to the plaintiff hereafter to seek such injunction against said defendant railway companies when and if they shall be discharged from jurisdiction and control of' the federal court for Eastern Missouri. We have no occasion to consider the effect of the amendment so far as concerns the right of removal. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Whitney v.

Anderson, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent. \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent recovered judgment against petitioner upon the verdict of a jury in an Ohio state court of first instance for a personal injury resulting from a collision at a railroad-highway crossing between an automobile which she was driving and a train of cars operated by petitioner over its line of railroad. There is evidence that the train approached the crossing without sounding the whistle of the engine or ringing the bell so as to give warning of the train's approach. There is also evidence which fairly establishes that as respondent drew near the crossing the train was in plain view for a sufficient length of time to have enabled respondent, by the use of ordinary care, to see the train, stop and avoid the collision, and, therefore, that she was guilty of contributory negligence. Miller v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n290 \nU.S. 227, 231\n, 54 S.Ct. 172. The train was equipped with air brakes, in conformity with the Federal Safety Appliance Act, as amended, U.S.C., title 45, c. 1,  1 and 9 (45 USCA  1, 9),1 and the orders of the Interstate \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 593]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission made thereunder; but the air was disconnected between the cars and the engine, leaving the brakes of the engine and tender as the only means of stopping the train or checking its speed, thus constituting a clear violation of the act, since the requirement that a train shall be equipped with power brakes necessarily contemplates that they shall be maintained for use. See United States v. Great Northern Ry. Co. (C.C.A.) 229 F. 927, 930.\n The complaint alleges, as one ground of negligence, failure on the part of petitioner to make an air connection between the engine and cars, and to maintain and use the power brakes. In respect of that ground of negligence the trial court instructed the jury, in effect, that, if the violation of the federal act resulted proximately or immediately in the injury complained of, the railroad company was liable. But the jury was also told that, if respondent was guilty of contributory negligence, she could not recover notwithstanding the negligence of petitioner. The trial court also instructed the jury in respect of the doctrine of the last clear chance-its view apparently being that, notwithstanding the contributory negligence of respondent, petitioner would be liable if, after the danger to respondent became apparent, it could have avoided the injury but for its antecedent failure to maintain and use an equipment of air brakes such as required by the federal act.\n The appellate court, in sustaining the judgment of the trial court, held: (1) That the federal law violated by petitioner was enacted, not only for the protection of railroad employees and passengers on railroad trains, but \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 594]\n\u00a0\n the public generally-that is to say, as applied to the present case, that the requirement of the Federal Safety Appliance Act as to power controlled brakes and their use imposed a duty upon the railroad company in respect of travelers at railroad-highway crossings; and (2) that the instructions of the trial court in respect of the doctrine of the last clear chance correctly stated the law. 46 Ohio App. 457, 189 N.E. 10.\n These two rulings present the questions which the writ brings here for consideration.\n First. The contention of petitioner is that the Federal Safety Appliance Act was intended only for the protection of employees and travelers upon the railroads, and has no relation to the safety of travelers upon highways or of the public generally. Very likely, the primary purpose in the mind of Congress was to protect employees and passengers. So much is indicated by the title-' An act to promote the safety of employes and travelers upon railroads,' etc. And this is borne out by the history of the legislation. President Harrison in his first annual message to Congress called attention to the need of legislation for the better protection of the lives and limbs of those engaged in operating the interstate freight lines of the country, and especially the yardmen and brakemen, and expressed the view that Congress had power to require uniformity in the construction of cars used in interstate commerce and the use of approved safety appliances upon them.\n But we are asked to hold that the title expresses the sole intent of the act, and this involves a question of statutory co struction. The title of an act and the history leading up to its adoption, as aids to statutory construction, are to be resorted to only for the purpose of resolving doubts as to the meaning of the words used in the act in case of ambiguity. Patterson v. Bark, Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169, 172\n, 23 S.Ct. 821; Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 U.S. 418\n, \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 595]\n\u00a0\n 430, 24 S.Ct. 383; Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78, 92\n, 34 S. Ct. 196. Compare Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514, 519\n, 522 S., 43 S.Ct. 428. But here the words of sections 1 and 9 of the act speak plainly, and nothing in the nature or operation of the legislation requires, or suggests the necessity of, an appeal to extrinsic aids to determine their meaning. It may be that the protective operation of section 2 of the act (45 USCA  2) requiring automatic couplers2 was not meant to extend to persons other than employees. Compare St. L. & San Fran. R.R. v. Conarty, \n238 \nU.S. 243\n, 35 S. Ct. 785; Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617, 620\n, 37 S.Ct. 456; Lang v. New York Cent. R.R. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 455\n, 41 S.Ct. 381; Davis v. Wolfe, \n263 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 44 S.Ct. 64; Philadelphia & R. Ry. Co. v. Eisenhart (C.C.A.) 280 F. 271. But the installation and use of power brakes required by sections 1 and 9 so obviously contribute to the safety of the traveler at crossings that it is hardly probable that Congress could have contemplated their inapplicability to that situation.\n Section 9, supra, provides that, when a train is operated with power or train brakes, not less than 50 per cent. (under regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission now 85 per cent.) of the cars in such train shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the locomotive drawing the train. That a train so equipped and operated can be brought to a stop much more quickly than by the use of hand brakes is, of course, perfectly clear; and it is reasonable to conclude that a result so readily perceivable lies within the purview of the requirement. The most important purpose of a brake upon any vehicle is to enable its operator to check its speed or stop \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 596]\n\u00a0\n it more quickly than would otherwise be possible. The old railway hand brake was principally for that purpose, but it was undesirable for two reasons: First, because in setting it the brakeman was exposed to danger; and, second, and especially in the case of long heavy trains, it did not meet the necessity of stopping the train quickly in emergencies. In tis second aspect, the common-law duty of the railway company to use ordinary care to provide and keep in reasonably safe condition adequate brakes for the control of its trains was one owing, among others, to travelers in the situation which the respondent here occupied. Sections 1 and 9 of the safety Appliance Act converts this qualified duty imposed by the common law into an absolute duty, from the violation of which there arises a liability for an injury resulting therefrom to any person falling within the terms and intent of the act. Compare Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Layton, supra, page 620 of 243 U.S., 37 S.Ct. 456; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 295\n, 28 S.Ct. 616. To confine the beneficial effect of these provisions to employees and passengers would be to impute to Congress an intention to ignore the equally important element which their enactment actually contributes to the safety of travelers at highway crossings. Since all of these three classes of persons are within the mischief at which the provisio  are aimed, it is quite reasonable to interpret the statute imposing the duty as including all of them.\n It fairly may be said that the nature of the duty imposed by a statute and the benefits resulting from its performance usually determine what persons are entitled to invoke its protection. In Atchison, T. & S.F. R. Co. v. Reesman (C.C.A.) 60 F. 370, 23 L.R.A. 768, where the railroad company failed to erect and maintain sufficient fences, as required by a state statute, in consequence of which an animal got upon the track and derailed the train, it was held that an employee upon the train who was injured was entitled to recover under the statute. In the opinion, \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 597]\n\u00a0\n delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer (pages 373, 374 of 60 F.), it is said:\n'At any rate, it is clear that the fact that certain classes of persons were intended to be primarily protected by the discharge of a statutory duty will not necessarily prevent others, neither named nor intended as primary beneficiaries, from maintaining an action to recover for injuries caused by the violation of such legislative command. It may well be said that, though primarily intended for the benefit of one class, it was also intended for the protection of all who need such protection . ... The purpose of fence laws, of this character, is not solely the protection of proprietors of adjoining fields. It is also to secure safety to trains. That there should be no obstruction on the track is a matter of the utmost importance to those who are called upon to ride on railroad trains. Whether that obstruction be a log placed by some wrongdoer, or an animal straying on the track, the danger to the trains, and those who are traveling thereon, is the same. To prevent such obstruction being one of the purposes of the statute, any one whose business calls him to be on a train has a right to complain of the company, if it fails to comply with this statutory duty.'\n\n See, also, Hayes v. Michigan Central R.R. Co., \n111 \nU.S. 228, 239\n, 240 S., 4 S.Ct. 369, and other authorities cited in the Reesman Case:\n In the light of what has now been said, it follows that the duty imposed upon petitioner by the provisions of the act in respect of power controlled brakes extends to and includes travelers at railway-highway crossings.\n Second. The holding of the court below as to the doctrine of the last clear chance is challenged as being contrary to the weight of American authority; 3 but we are \n\n[292 U.S. 589, 598]\n\u00a0\n precluded from considering the contention because it does not present a federal question. The Federal Safety Appliance Act, as we already have said and this court repeatedly has ruled, imposes absolute duties upon interstate railway carriers and thereby creates correlative rights in favor of such injured persons as come within its purview; but the right to enforce the liability which arises from the breach of duty is derived from the principles of the common law. The act does not affect the defense of contributory negligence, and, since the case comes here from a state court, the validity of that defense must be determined in accordance with applicable state law. Moore v. C. & O. Ry. Co., \n291 U.S. 205\n, 214 et seq., 54 S.Ct. 402, and cases cited; Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 57\n, 54 S.Ct. 573, 78 L.Ed. --, April 2, 1934. And see Schlemmer v. Buffalo Rochester, etc., Ry., \n205 \nU.S. 1\n, 27 S.Ct. 407, upon second appeal, \n220 \nU.S. 590, 598\n, 31 S.Ct. 561. The same is true of the doctrine of the last clear chance, which likewise is not affected by the act. If doubt might otherwise exist in respect of the specific application of the cases cited to that doctrine, regarded independently, the doubt would vanish when consideration is given to the relation which it bears to the rule of contributory negligence, namely, that it amounts in effect to a qualification of that rule, Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Taylor (C.C.A.) 196 F. 878, 880, having the result of relieving the injured person from the consequenc  of his violation of it.\n Nothing we have said is to be understood as indicating our acceptance, as a substantive principle, of the ruling of the court below in respect of the point. That question is left open for consideration and determination when, if ever, it shall be so presented as to admit of its being dealt with upon its merits.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to use on its line any locomotive engine in moving interstate traffic not equipped with a power driving wheel brake and appliances for operating the train-brake system, or to run any train in such traffic that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.\n  9. Whenever, as provided in this chapter, any train is operated with power or train brakes not less than 50 per centum of the cars in such train shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer of he locomotive drawing such train; and all power-braked cars in such train which are associated together with said 50 per centum shall have their brakes so used and operated; and, to more fully carry into effect the objects of said chapter, the Interstate Commerce Commission may, from time to time, after full hearing, increase the minimum percentage of cars in any train required to be operated with power or train brakes which must have their brakes used and operated as aforesaid; and failure to comply with any such requirement of the said Interstate Commerce Commission shall be subject to the like penalty as failure to comply with any requirement of this section. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n]  2. It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in itnerstate commerce by railroad to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, for example, Illinois Cent.

MCLEAN(1934)\nNo. 166\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi. \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Garner W. Green and Marcellus Green, both of Jackson, Miss., for appellants.\n Mr. W. W. Pierce, of Philadelphia, Miss., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on appeal, under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344), for review of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi upholding a state excise tax assailed as a forbidden imposition upon a federal instrumentality, and as infringing the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. 166 Miss. 739, 147 So. 325. Sections 3, 57, 220, 221, 225, 242, of chapter 88, of the General Laws of Mississippi of 1930, exact an annual license tax for the privilege of operating a cotton compress which is graduated according to the number of bales of cotton compressed per annum. \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n Sections 3 and 63 levy a similar additional tax upon each person operating a warehouse, whether in conjunction with a compress or not, which is graduated according to the storage capacity of the warehouse.\n Appellant, a Delaware corporation, which maintains and operates a cotton warehouse and compress at Cleveland, Miss., brought the present suit to recover taxes imposed with respect to both classes of business, paid under protest to appellee, the tax collector, in 1932. The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts, from which it appears that the appellant is licensed by the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a warehouse for the storage of agricultural products under the provisions of the United States Warehouse Act of August 11, 1916, c. 313, 39 Stat. 486, as amended, c. 10,  241 et seq., tit. 7, USCA. Appellant has given a bond for the faithful performance of the duties which are exacted of a licensed warehouseman by the act and by the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture, and its business as a warehouseman is subject to his inspection and control as the statutes and regulations provide.\n Cleveland is a shipping point for baled cotton in interstate and foreign commerce and is a market in which cotton is purchased by brokers and dealers from those who produce it within the state. The purchases are made for resale or to fulfill contracts for sale of cotton without the state. In the usual course of business the purchased cotton, after it is ginned, is transported to appellant's warehouse for storage and compression, about 25 per cent. arriving by automobile truck or wagon and the remainder by rail over the line of the single railroad serving Cleveland. Upon delivery appellant issues its negotiable warehouse receipts for the cotton, in the form and manner provided by the United States Warehouse Act. The right to demand delivery of the cotton or otherwise control its \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n disposition is reserved to the holders of the receipts. A small part of the stored cotton, from 1 per cent. to 10 per cent., is resold within the state to buyers, who sell it to purchasers without the state, but all except a negligible part of it is ultimately shipped to points outside the state. Upon shipping orders given by the holders of the warehouse receipts, appellant compresses the cotton into bales of standard weight and size, suitable for shipment, and delivers them to the rail carrier for interstate transportation. The movement of the cotton out of the warehouse is directed by the owners of its who hold the warehouse receipts. Its destination is not determined until the owner gives shipping instructions to appellant, and shipment is not made until surrender of the warehouse receipts. The compress charges are paid by the carrier, which it adds to the charge for carriage, and, in the case of cotton brought to the warehouse by rail carriage, the through interstate rail rate is applied from the point of origin to destination instead of the combination rate which is the sum of the intrastate rate to Cleveland and the interstate rate from that point to destinction. The identity of the cotton is not preserved in reshipping it, and substitution is permitted with the understanding that the through rate from point of origin to destinction without the state shall not be affected.\n By written agreement with the railroad company appellant is designated as the agent of the railroad to receive the cotton from and deliver it to the railroad and to load and unload cotton upon and from its cars. The agreement also provides for the use of the warehouse by the railroad as a cotton depot.\n Upon this state of facts appellant argues that the tax upon the business both of warehousing and of compressing the cotton is a forbidden burden on interstate commerce, and that the warehouse tax is unconstitutional \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n because a direct tax upon a business conducted by appellant as a federal instrumentality, designated as such by its license under the United States Warehouse Act.\n\n 1. \nIt is clear that by all accepted tests the cotton, while in appellant's warehouse, has not begun to move in interstate commerce, and hence is not a subject of interstate commerce immune from local taxation. When it comes to rest there, its intrastate journey, whether by truck or by rail, comes to an end, and, although in the ordinary course of business the cotton would ultimately reach points outside the state, its journey interstate does not begin, and so it does not become exempt from local tax until its shipment to points of destination outside the state. Before shipping orders are given, it has no ascertainable destination without the state, and in the meantime, until surrender of the warehouse receipts, it is subject to the exclusive control of the owner. Property thus withdrawn from transportation, whether intrastate or interstate, until restored to a transportation movement interstate, has often been held to be subject to local taxation. Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S.Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S.Ct. 475; Susquehanna Coal Company v. South Amboy, \n228 \nU.S. 665, 669\n, 33 S.Ct. 712; State of Minnesota v. Blasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 34, decided November 6, 1933; cf. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134\n, 39 S.Ct. 237.\n A nondiscriminatory tax upon the business of storing and compressing the cotton, which is not itself the subject of a movement in interstate commerce, is not forbidden. Most articles, before their shipment in interstate commerce, have had work done upon them which adapts them to the needs of commerce and prepares them for sale and convenient transportation, but that fact has never been thought to immunize from local taxation either the articles themselves or those who have manufactured or otherwise prepared them for interstate transportation. American \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522; Crescent Cotton Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129\n, 42 S.Ct. 42; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S.Ct. 639; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S.Ct. 548. Here the privilege taxed is exercised before interstate commerce begins; hence the burden of the tax upon the commerce is too indirect and remote to transgress constitutional limitations. See Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345. The case, therefore, stands on a footing different from those in which local regulations of the business of purchasing a commodity within and shipping it without the state have been deemed to impede or embarrass interstate commerce in those commodities. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S.Ct. 244.\n The fact that appellant's contract with the interstate rail carrier has designated appellant as the carrier's agent and appellant's warehouse as the carrier's depot cannot alter the legal consequences of what is actually done with the cotton by its owners or of their power of control over it, or of the actual course of dealing with it by appellant. It is not within the power of the parties, by the descriptive terms of their contract, to convert a local business into an interstate commerce business protected by the interstate commerce clause. See Merchants' Warehouse Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 507\n, 508 S., 51 S.Ct. 505; Superior Oil Co. v. State of Mississippi, \n280 \nU.S. 390\n, 50 S.Ct. 169; Browning v. City of Waycross, \n233 \nU.S. 16, 23\n, 34 S.Ct. 578.\n\n 2. \nAppellant's license under the United States Warehouse Act did not confer upon it immunity from state taxation, for neither the appellant nor its business was, by force of the license, converted into an agency or instrumentality of the federal government. The Warehouse Act confers upon licensees certain privileges and \n\n[291 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n 'secures to the national government, by means of the licensing provisions, a measure of control over those engaged in the business of storing agricultural products who find it advantageous to apply for the license. The government exercise that control in the furtherance of a governmental purpose to secure fair and uniform business practices. But the appellant, in the enjoyment of the privilege, is engaged in its own behalf, not the government's, in the conduct of a private business for profit. It can no longer be thought that the enjoyment of a privilege conferred by either the national or a state government upon the individual, even though to promote some governmental policy, relieves him from the taxation by the other of his property or business used or carried on in the enjoyment of the privilege or of the profits derived from it. Susquehanna Power Company v. State Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 291\n, 51 S.Ct. 434; Fox Film Corporation v. Doyal, \n286 \nU.S. 123\n, 52 S.Ct. 546; Broad River Power Company v. Query, \n288 \nU.S. 178, 180\n, 53 S.Ct. 326.\n The fact that the license is used also as a means of government control of appellant's business does not call for a different conclusion. The national government has not assumed to tax the business or to exercise any control over the taxation of it by the state. The state does not tax the license itself, and the tax upon petitioner's business, applied without discrimination to all similar businesses whether licensed or not, does not impair the control which the federal authority has chosen to exert. The mere extension of control over a business by the national government does not withdraw it from a local tax which presents no obstacle to the execution of the national policy. Compare Susquehanna Power Company v. State Tax Commission, supra; Broad River Power Company v. Query, supra. See Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 226\n, 230 S., 51 S.Ct. 125.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL LAND BANK OF BERKELEY v. WARNER(1934)\nNo. 498\nArgued: February 16, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. Peyton R. Evans, of Washington, D.C., and Richard W. Young, of Berkeley, Cal., for petitioner. \n\n[292 U.S. 53, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents gave petitioner a mortgage on their farm lands in Arizona to secure a loan of $7,200 made in accordance with the Farm Loan Act. \n1\n The mortgage provides that in case of suit to foreclose the mortgagors shall pay a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court. And that clause is valid under Arizona law. \n2\n The borrowers having failed to pay according to their promise, petitioner brought this suit to foreclose the mortgage and prayed that an attorney's fee of $125 be included in the judgment. Respondents objected to the allowance of any amount on account of that item, the trial court sustained their contention and the supreme court upheld that part of the decree upon the ground that the collection of such a fee is forbidden by the following part of section 31: 'No land bank ... shall charge or receive any fee, commission, bonus, gift, or other consideration not herein specifically authorized.' 12 U.S.C.  983 (12 USCA  983).\n That construction cannot be sustained. The Act establishes cooperation between borrowers on farm mortgages and investors in the bonds secured by them. The requirement, by means of the mortgage provision, that a mortgagor shall bear the expense put upon the bank by his default is reasonable and in harmony with that principle. \n\n[292 U.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n In the absence of a plain expression to that effect, it may not be held that Congress intended to put upon nondefaulting borrowers any part of the expense of foreclosure of mortgages made by others. The Act does not prescribe proceedings for foreclosure but indicates that state laws are to govern. Section 30 directs the land bank commissioner to examine the laws of each State and to report, among other things, whether in his opinion they are such as to safeguard against loss in case of default. 12 U.S. Code,  971 (12 USCA  971). It provides that, if examination shall show that the laws of any do not afford sufficient protection, the Farm Credit Administration may declare mortgages on land in that State ineligible. 12 U.S. Code,  972 (12 USCA  972). And the petition for this writ indicates that, except in a few States where local law prohibits such contracts, all the mortgages taken by the Federal Land Banks contain stipulations for attorney's fees for foreclosure. \n3\n From this it appears that officers charged by law with the administration of the banks have always construed the Act to permit state laws to control. Our attention has not been called to any case in which that construction has been questioned. It is entitled to great weight. United States v. Mo. Pac. R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269, 280\n, 49 S. Ct. 133.\n And we are of opinion that the decision of the Arizona supreme court in this case is not supported by the language it quotes from section 31 or by any other part of the Act. The paragraph containing this language4 defines \n\n[292 U.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n criminal offenses and prescribes punishments. The first sentence holds officers, directors, and employees to their usual salaries and directors' fees, and limits each of them, and as well every attorney for a bank, to 'a reasonable fee ... for services rendered.' The second sentence contains the provision relied on. Its sole purpose is to limit banks to the charges, fees, etc., that are specifically authorized. Then, after restricting disclosure of names of borrowers, the paragraph makes violations of its provisions punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. Other than the counsel fee in question, the judgment below does not exclude any expense of foreclosure that is permitted by Arizona law. But plainly the compensation of attorneys engaged to foreclose a mortgage is as necessary as the payment of charges for advertisement, the service of process or the sale of the property. The items last mentioned are generally, if not indeed everywhere, chargeable to defaulting mortgagors. There is nothing in the Act to suggest purpose to denounce the one and permit the others. Moreover, the quoted clause is in harmony with the restrictions put upon loans by section 12, 12 U.S. Code,  771 (12 USCA  771), and is undoubtedly intended to emphasize and strictly to enforce limitations set by section 13(9), 12 U.S. Code,  781(9), 12 USCA  781(9), upon fees for appraisal and examination of title, legal fees, \n\n[292 U.S. 53, 57]\n\u00a0\n recording charges and the like that are included in the preliminary costs of negotiating and carrying the mortgage loans. Undoubtedly Congress intended that state laws are to govern in respect of counsel fees for foreclosure of mortgages given under the Act.\n But what it said above is not to be taken to approve the collection of a substantial attorney's fee for foreclosure in every case where stipulations such as the one before us are valid under state law. Uncontested foreclosures generally follow established routine and undoubtedly many of them may be made, without much if any cost to the banks, by their regularly employed salaried lawyers. In any such case the employment of another attorney or the exaction of any substantial charge for legal services cannot be justified as reasonable. In all cases-whether foreclosure is obtained by default or after contest-the mortgagor's promise to pay the mortgagee a reasonable attorney's fee is to be construed having regard to the purpose of Congress to enable farmers, by means of mortgages on their lands, to obtain loans at low cost.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916, 39 Stat. 360, as amended. 12 U.S.C.  636 et seq.

ALGOMA LUMBER CO.(1934)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Harold M. Stephens, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner. \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Allan P. Matthew, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n Mr. Edward S. Rogers, of New York City, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In May, 1929, the Federal Trade Commission filed and served complaints against a group of fifty manufacturers on the Pacific Coast charging 'unfair competition in interstate commerce' in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 38 Stat. 717, 719, c. 311,  5, 15 U.S.C.  45 (15 USCA  45).\n After the service of answers the proceedings were consolidated and many witnesses examined. The outcome was a series of reports sustaining the complaints as to thirty-nine manufacturers, with orders to 'cease and desist' from the practice challenged as unfair. Twelve companies thus enjoined petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review the orders of the Commission. Such review being had, the orders were annulled. 64 F.(2d) 618. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n The practice complained of as unfair and enjoined by the Commission is the use by the respondents of the words 'California white pine' to describe lumber, logs, or other forest products made from the pine species known as 'pinus ponderosa.' The findings as to this use and its effect upon the public are full and circumstantial. They are too long to be paraphrased conveniently within the limits of an opinion. We must be content with an imperfect summary.\n The respondents are engaged in the manufacture and sale of lumber and timber products which they ship from \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n California and Oregon to customers in other states and foreign lands. Much of what they sell comes from the species of tree that is known among botanists as 'pinus ponderosa.' The respondents sell it under the name of 'California white pine,' and under that name, or at times 'white pine' simply, it goes to the consumer. In truth it is not a white pine, whether the tests to be applied are those of botanical science or of commercial practice and understanding.\n Pine trees, the genus 'pinus,' have for a long time been divided by botanists, foresters, and the public generally into two groups, the white pine and the yellow. The white pine group includes, by common consent, the northern white pine (pinus strobus)The sugar pine, and the Idaho white pine. It is much sought after by reason of its durability under exposure to weather and moisture, the proportion of its heartwood as contrasted with its sapwood content as well as other qualities. For these reasons it commands a high price as compared with pines of other species. The yellow pine group is less durable, harder, heavier, more subject to shrinkage and warping, darker in color, more resinous, and more difficult to work. It includes the long leaf yellow pine (pinus palustris), grown in the southern states, and the pinus ponderosa, a far softer wood, which is grown in the Pacific Coast states, and in Arizona and New Mexico as well as the 'inland empire' (Eastern Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Western Montana).\n Of the varieties of white pine, the northern or pinus strobus has been known better and longer than the others. It is described sometimes as northern white pine, sometimes as white pine simply, sometimes with the addition of its local origin, as Maine white pine, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Canadian, New Brunswick. It is native to the northeastern states and to the Great Lakes region, as far west as Minnesota. It is found also in Canada and \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 71]\n\u00a0\n along the Appalachian highlands. It was almost the only building material for the settlers of New England, and so great is its durability that many ancient buildings made from it in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries survive in good condition. The sugar pine is native to the upland regions of California, Southern Oregon and parts of Nevada. The Idaho white pine grows in the mountainous sections of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon and in parts of British Columbia. The white pine species 'still holds an exalted reputation among the consuming public' and 'in general esteem is the highest type of lumber as respects the excellences desired in soft wood material.' 'It is coming more and more to be a specialty wood, largely devoted to special purposes, as it becomes scarcer and higher in price. It is in great demand.'\n About 1880 the pinus ponderosa, though botanically a yellow pine, began to be described as a white pine when sold in the local markets of California, New Mexico, and Arizona, the description being generally accompanied by a reference to the state of origin, as 'California white pine,' etc. By 1886, sales under this description had spread to Nevada and Utah with occasional shipments farther east. About 1900, they entered the middle western states, and about 1915 had made their way into New England, though only to a small extent. The pines from the inland empire traveled east more slowly, and when they did were described as western white pine, a term now generally abandoned. The progress of the newcomers both from the coast and from the inland empire was not wholly a march of triumph. In their movement to the central and eastern markets they came into competition more and more with the genuine white pine with which those markets had been long familiar. Mutherings of discontent were heard. In 1924, partly as a result of complaints and official investigations, many of the producers, notably those of the 'inland empire,' as well as \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 72]\n\u00a0\n some producers in California and Arizona, voluntarily gave up the use of the adjective 'white' in connection with their product, and adopted the description 'pondosa pines,' pondosa being a corruption or abbreviation of the ponderosa of the botanists. 'Pondosa pine is the term employed for ponderosa by the representatives of producers of slightly more than half of the ponderosa marketed.' The respondents and others, however, declined to make a change. During the next five years California white pine and its equivalents became an even more important factor in the lumber markets of the country. Accumulating complaints led to an inquiry by the Commission, which had its fruit in this proceeding.\n The confusion and abuses growing out of these interlocking names have been developed in the findings. Many retail dealers receiving orders for white pine deliver California white pine, not knowing that it differs from the lumber ordered. Many knowing the difference deliver the inferior product because they can buy it cheaper. Still others, well informed and honest, deliver the genuine article, thus placing themselves at a disadvantage in the race of competition with the unscrupulous and the ignorant. Trade has thus been diverted from dealers in white pine to dealers in pinus ponderosa masquerading as white pine. Trade has also been diverted from dealers in pinus ponderosa under the name pinus pondosa to dealers in pinus ponderosa under the more attractive label. The diversion of trade from dealers of one class to dealers of another is not the only mischief. Consumers, architects, and retailers have also been misled. They have given orders for the respondents' product, supposing it to be white pine and to have the qualities associated with lumber of that species. They have accepted deliveries under the empire of that belief. True indeed it is that the woods sold by the respondents, though not a genuine \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 73]\n\u00a0\n white pine, are nearer to that species in mechanical properties than they are to the kinds of yellow pine indigenous to the south. The fact that for many purposes they are halfway between the white species and the yellow makes the practice of substitution easier than it would be if the difference were plain. Misrepresentation and confusion flourish in such a soil. From these findings and others the Commission was brought to the conclusion that the respondents compete unfairly in transacting business as they do, and that in the interest of the public their methods should be changed.\n'The findings of the Commission as to facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive.' 15 U.S.C.  45 (15 USCA  45). The Court of Appeals, though professing adherence to this mandate, honored it, we think, with lip service only. In form the court determined that the finding of unfair competition had no support whatever. In fact what the court did was to make its own appraisal of the testimony, picking and choosing for itself among uncertain and conflicting inferences. Statute and decision (Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Trade Association, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 61\n, 63 S., 47 S.Ct. 255) forbid that exercise of power.\n\n First. The argument is made that unfair competition is disproved by the 'simplified practice recommendations' of the Bureau of Standards when read in conjunction with the testimony as to the comparative utility of the genuine white pine and pinus ponderosa.\n The Court of Appeals concedes that the recommendations of the Bureau will not avail without more to control the action of the Commission. Cf. Brougham v. Blanton Mfg. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 495, 499\n, 39 S.Ct. 363; Piedmont & Northern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 299, 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 541. The view was expressed, however, that alone they are in a high degree persuasive, and that in conjunction with other evidence they are even controlling. In \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 74]\n\u00a0\n particular that result was thought to follow in this case because the substituted wood, in the judgment of the court, is so nearly equal in utility that buyers are not injured, even though misled. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Such a holding misconceives the significance of the Government's endeavor to simplify commercial practice. It misconceives even more essentially the significance of the substitution of one article for another without notice to the buyer.\n\n\n (a)\n The Bureau of Standards is a branch of the Department of Commerce. At its instance representatives of manufacturers, sellers, and users of lumber, as well as architects, engineers, and others, met in conference at various times between 1922 and 1928 in an endeavor to simplify methods of business in the lumber industry. Following these conferences the Bureau in 1929 issued a report entitled 'Lumber, Simplified Practice Recommendations.' Many subjects that were considered are without relation to this case. The report dealt with standards of size, of inspection, of structural material, and other cognate themes. One of its subdivisions, however, enumerates the standard commercial names for lumber of many types. Sixteen names of pines are stated in the list, and among them is the name 'California white pine' with its botanical equivalent, pinus ponderosa.\n The recommendations of the Bureau of Standards for the simplification of commercial practice are wholly \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 75]\n\u00a0\n advisory. Dealers may conform or diverge as they prefer. The Bureau has defined its own function in one of its reports. The Purpose and Application of Simplified Practice, National Bureau of Standards, Department of Commerce, July 1, 1931, pp. 2, 7, 10, 17. 'Simplified practice is a method of eliminating superfluous variety through the voluntary action of industrial groups.' 'The Department of Commerce has no regulatory powers' with reference to the subject, and hence 'it is highly desirable that this recommendation be kept distinct from any plan or method of governmental regulation or control.' There is nothing to show that in making up the list of names the Bureau made any investigation of the relation between pinus ponderosa and the white pines of the east. Certainly it had no such wealth of information on the subject as was gathered by the Commission in the course of this elaborate inquiry. There is nothing to show to what extent its advice has been accepted by the industry. The record does show that the recommendation does not accord with the practice of other governmental agencies. For example, the United States Forest Service in its publications and forest signs describes the ponderosa species as western yellow pine. In such circumstances the action of the Bureau was at most a bit of evidence to be weighed by the Commission along with much besides. It had no such significance as to discredit in any appreciable degree a conclusion founded upon evidence otherwise sufficient. The powers and function of the two agencies of government are essentially diverse. The aim of the one is to simplify business by substituting uniformity of methods for wasteful diversity, and in the achievement of these ends to rely upon cooperative action. The aim of the other is to make the process of competition fair. There are times when a description is deceptive from the very fact of its simplicity. \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 76]\n\u00a0\n [b] The wood dealt in by the respondents is not substantially as good as the genuine white pine, nor would sales under the wrong name be fitting if it were.\n The ruling of the court below as to this is infected by a twofold error. The first is one of fact. The supposed equivalence is unreal. The second is one of law. If the equivalence existed, the practice would still be wrong.\n The Commission found as a fact that the genuine white pine is superior for many reasons to pinus ponderosa, and notably because of its greater durability. The court held the view that the difference in durability had not been proved so clearly as to lay a basis for the orders, and this, it seems, upon the ground that though the superiority exists, the evidence fails to disclose its precise degree. 'What the testimony appears to establish is that Northern white pine has relatively a greater durability for exterior use without establishing any comparative degree of such durability.' 64 F.(2d) 618 at page 622.\n Court and counsel for the respondents lean heavily at this point upon the testimony of the Director of the United States Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wis., and his assistant Mr. Hunt. The Director testified that he did not know the comparative durability of the pines, and would refer any inquirer to specialists, of whom Mr. Hunt was one. The testimony of Mr. Hunt is that there have been no tests in a strict sense, but that the comparison between the white pines and pinus ponderosa has been based upon observation and opinion. He continues: 'The general experience with the use of the white pines, during the two hundred years since they began to be used, indicated that those pines had moderately high durability. The general experience with pinus ponderosa indicated that that wood had low durability in contact with the ground or any place favoring the growth of decay. That is a matter of common knowledge.' Inquirers at the Laboratory were accordingly advised that 'the \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 77]\n\u00a0\n heartwood of the white pine has more decay resistance, will give longer service under conditions favoring decay than the heartwood of pinus ponderosa,' and 'the mill run of the white pine probably would average higher in durability under decay producing conditions.'\n This testimony, even if it stood alone, would tend to sustain rather than to discredit the findings by the Commission that the genuine white pines are materially superior to the woods that the respondents are selling as a substitute. It is fortified, however, by evidence from many other sources. To be sure there is contradiction which we have no thought to disparage. For present purposes we assume the credibility of those who spoke for the complainants. Wholesalers, retailers, manufacturers, lumber graders, laboratory experts and others bore witness to the comparative merits of the woods, stating their own experience as well as common opinion among their fellows in the industry. If all this may be ignored in the face of the findings of the Commission, it can only be by turning the court into an administrative body which is to try the case anew.\n What has been written has been aimed at the position that pinus ponderosa is as good or almost as good as the white pines of the east. We have yet to make it plain that the substitution would be unfair though equivalence were shown. This can best be done in considering another argument which challenges the finding of the Commission that there has been misunderstanding on the part of buyers. To this we now turn.\n Second. The argument is made that retailers and consumers are not shown to have been confused as to the character of the lumber supplied by the respondents, and that even if there was confusion there is no evidence of prejudice.\n Both as to the fact of confusion and its consequences the evidence is ample. Retailers order 'white pine' from \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 78]\n\u00a0\n manufacturers and take what is sent to them, passing it on to their customers. At times they do this knowing or suspecting that they are supplying California white pine instead of the genuine article, and supplying a wood that is inferior, at least for the outer parts of buildings. Its comparative cheapness creates the motive for the preference. At times they act in good faith without knowledge of the difference between the California pines and others. Architects are thus misled, and so are builders and consumers. There is a suggestion by the court that for all that appears the retailers, buying the wood cheaper, may have lowered their own price, and thus passed on to the consumer the benefit of the saving. The inference is a fair one that this is not always done, and perhaps not even generally. If they lower the price at all, there is no reason to believe that they do so to an amount equivalent to the saving to themselves.\n But saving to the consumer, though it be made out, does not obliterate the prejudice. Fair competition is not attained by balancing a gain in money against a misrepresentation of the thing supplied. The courts must set their faces against a conception of business standards so corrupting in its tendency. The consumer is prejudiced if upon giving an order for one thing, he is supplied with something else. Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., \n288 \nU.S. 212, 216\n, 53 S.Ct. 335; City of Carlsbad v. W. T. Thackeray & Co. (C.C.) 57 F. 18. In such matters, the public is entitled to get what it chooses, though the choice may be dictated by caprice or by fashion or perhaps by ignorance. Nor is the prejudice only to the consumer. Dealers and manufacturers are prejudiced when orders that would have come to them if the lumber had been rightly named, are diverted to others whose methods are less scrupulous. 'A method inherently unfair does not cease to be so because those competed against have become aware of the wrongful practice.' Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 79]\n\u00a0\n Hosiery Co., \n258 \nU.S. 483, 494\n, 42 S.Ct. 384, 385.2 The careless and the unscrupulous must rise to the standards of the scrupulous and diligent. The Commission was not organized to drag the standards down.\n Third. The argument is made that the name for the respondents' lumber was adopted more than thirty years ago without fraudulent design, and that a continuation of the use is not unfair competition, though confusion may have developed when the business, spreading eastward, attained national dimensions.\n The Commission made no finding as to the motives animating the respondents in the choice of the contested name. The respondents say it was chosen to distinguish their variety of yellow pine from the harder yellow pines native to the southern states. We may assume that this is so. The fact remains, however, that the pines were not white either botanically or commercially, though the opportunity for confusion may have been comparatively slight when the sales were restricted to customers in local markets, buying for home consumption. Complaints, if there were any, must have been few and inarticulate at a time when there was no supervisory body to hold business to its duty. According to the law as then adjudged, many competitive practices that today may be suppressed ( Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., supra), were not actionable wrongs, the damage to the complainants being classified often as collateral and remote. American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co. (C.C. A.) 103 F. 281, 286, 50 L.R.A. 609.3 The Federal Trade Commission was not organized till 1914, its jurisdiction then as now confined to interstate and foreign commerce. Silence up to that time is \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 80]\n\u00a0\n not even a faint token that the misapplied name had the approval of the industry. It may well have meant no more than this, that the evil was not great, or that there was no champion at hand to put an end to the abuse. Even silence thereafter will not operate as an estoppel against the community at large, whatever its effect upon individuals asserting the infringement of proprietary interests. French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., \n191 \nU.S. 427\n, 24 S.Ct. 145. There is no bar through lapse of time to a proceeding in the public interest to set an industry in order by removing the occasion for deception or mistake, unless submission has gone so far that the occasion for misunderstanding, or for any so widespread as to be worthy of correction, is already at an end. Competition may then be fair irrespective of its origin. This will happen, for illustration, when by common acceptation the description, once misused, has acquired a secondary meaning as firmly anchored as the first one. Till then, with every new transaction, there is a repetition of the wrong.\n The evidence here falls short of establishing two meanings with equal titles to legitimacy by force of common acceptation. On the contrary, revolt against the pretender, far from diminishing, has become increasingly acute. With the spread of business eastward, the lumber dealers who sold pines from the states of the Pacific Coast were involved in keen competition with dealers in lumber from the pines of the east and middle west. In the wake of competition came confusion and deception, the volume mounting to its peak in the four or five years before the Commission resolved to act. Then, if not before, misbranding of the pines was something more than a denial wrong. The respondents, though at fault from the beginning, had been allowed to go their way without obstruction while the mischief was not a crying one. They were not at liberty to enlarge the area of their business without adjusting their methods to the needs of new con- \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 81]\n\u00a0\n ditions. An analogy may be found in the decisions on the law of trade marks where the principle is applied that a name legitimate in one territory may generate confusion when carried into another, and must then be given up. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 416\n, 36 S.Ct. 357; United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., \n248 \nU.S. 90, 100\n, 39 S. Ct. 48. More than half the members of the industry have disowned the misleading name by voluntary action and are trading under a new one. The respondents who hold out are not relieved by innocence of motive from a duty to conform. Competition may be unfair within the meaning of this statute and within the scope of the discretionary powers conferred on the Commission, though the practice condemned does not amount to fraud as understood in courts of law. Indeed there is a kind of fraud, as courts of equity have long perceived, in clinging to a benefit which is the product of misrepresentation, however innocently made. Redgrave v. Hurd, L.R. 20 Ch. D. 1, 12, 13; Rawlins v. Wickham, 3 De G. & I. 304, 317; Hammond v. Pennock, 61 N.Y. 145, 152. That is the respondents' plight today, no matter what their motives may have been when they began. They must extricate themselves from it by purging their business methods of a capacity to deceive.\n Fourth. Finally, the argument is made that the restraining orders are not necessary to protect the public interest (see Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., supra), but to the contrary that the public interest will be promoted by increasing the demand for pinus ponderosa, though it be sold with a misleading label, and thus abating the destruction of the pine forests of the east.\n The conservation of our forests is a good of large importance, but the end will have to be attained by methods other than a license to do business unfairly.\n The finding of unfair competition being supported by the testimony, the Commission did not abuse its discretion in reaching the conclusion that no change of the \n\n[291 U.S. 67, 82]\n\u00a0\n name short of the excision of the word 'white' would give adequate protection.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It would not necessarily follow ... that a yellow pine might be sold as a white pine if such sales were unfair to the trade and injurious to the public, notwithstanding the Bureau of Standards had specified a name such as 'California white pine' in a list of 'Standard commercial names' for pine lumber. It would be different, however, if the particular lumber sold under such name possessed substantially the same qualities possessed by the white pines of commerce as distinguished from certain well known commercial yellow pines.' 64 F.(2d) 618, at page 620. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The many cases in which the Federal Trade Commission has acted to prevent misbranding or like misrepresentation will be found collected in Henderson, The Federal Trade Commission, p. 182 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The cases are reviewed by Henderson, The Federal Trade Commission, p. 179, et seq. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v.

Ed. --, to review a decree of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission forbidding certain trade practices of respondent as an unfair method of competition. 63 F.(2d) 81; section 5, Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 717, 719 ( 15 USCA  45).\n The Commission found that respondent, one of numerous candy manufacturers similarly engaged, manufactures, sells, and distributes, in interstate commerce, package assortments of candies known to the trade as 'break and take' packages, in competition with manufacturers of assortments known as 'straight goods' packages. Both types are assortments of candies in packages in convenient arrangement for sale by the piece at a small price \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n in retail stores in what is known as the penny candy trade. The break and take assortments are so arranged and offered for sale to consumers as to avail of the element of chance as an inducement to the retail purchasers. One assortment, consisting of 120 pieces retailing at 1 cent each, includes four pieces, each having concealed within its wrapper a single cent, so that the purchasers of those particular pieces of candy receive back the amount of the purchase price and thus obtain the candy without cost. Another contains 60 pieces of candy, each having its retail price marked on a slip of paper concealed within its wrapper; 10 pieces retail at 1 cent each, 10 at 2 cents, and 40 at 3 cents. The price paid for each piece is that named on the price ticket, ascertained only after the purchaser has selected the candy and the wrapper has been removed. A third assortment consists of 200 pieces of candy, a few of which have concealed centers of different colors, the remainder having white centers. The purchasers of the candy found to have colored centers are given prizes, packed with the candy, consisting of other pieces of candy or a package containing lead pencils, penholder and ruler. Each assortment is accompanied by a display card, attractive to children, prepared by respondent for exhibition and use by the dealer in selling the candy, explaining the plan by which either the price or the amount of candy or other merchandise which the purchaser receives is affected by chance. The pieces of candy in the break and take packages are either smaller than those of the competing straight goods packages, which are sold at a comparable price without the aid of any chance feature, or they are of inferior quality. Much of the candy assembled in the break and take packages is sold by retailers, located in the vicinity of schools, to school children.\n The Commission found that the use of the break and take package in the retail trade involves the sale or dis- \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n tribution of the candy by lot or chance; that it is a lottery or gambling device which encourages gambling among children; that children, enticed by the element of chance, purchase candy so sold in preference to straight goods candy; and that the competition between the two types of package results in a substantial diversion of trade from the manufacturers of the straight goods package to those distributing the break and take type. It found further that in some states lotteries and gaming devices are penal offenses; that the sale or distribution of candy by lot or chance is against public policy; that many manufacturers of competing candies refuse to engage in the distribution of the break and take type of package because they regard it as a reprehensible encouragement of gambling among children; and that such manufacturers are placed at a disadvantage in competition. The evidence shows that others have reluctantly yielded to the practice in order to avoid loss of trade to their competitors.\n The court below held, as the respondent argues here, that respondent's practice does not hinder competition or injure its competitors, since they are free to resort to the same sales method; that the practice does not tend to create a monopoly or involve any deception to consumers or the public, and hence is not an unfair method of competition within the meaning of the statute.\n Upon the record it is not open to question that the practice complained of is a method of competition in interstate commerce and that it is successful in diverting trade from competitors who do not employ it. If the practice is unfair within the meaning of the act, it is equally clear that the present proceeding, aimed at suppressing it, is brought, as section 5 of the act requires, 'in the interest of the public.' The practice is carried on by forty or more manufacturers. The disposition of a large number of complaints pending before the Commission, \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n similar to that in the present case, awaits the outcome of this suit. Sales of the break and take package by respondent aggregate about $234,000 per year. The proceeding involves more than a mere private controversy. A practice so generally adopted by manufacturers necessarily affects not only competing manufacturers but the far greater number of retailers to whom they sell, and the consumers to whom the retailers sell. Thus the effects of the device are felt throughout the penny candy industry. A practice so widespread and so far reaching in its consequences is of public concern if in other respects within the purview of the statute. Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., \n288 \nU.S. 212, 216\n, 53 S.Ct. 335. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19, 28\n, 50 S.Ct. 1, 68 A.L.R. 838. Hence we pass without further discussion to the decisive question whether the practice itself is one over which the Commission is given jurisdiction because it is unfair.\n Although the method of competition adopted by respondent induces children, too young to be capable of exercising an intelligent judgment of the transaction, to purchase an article less desirable in point of quality or quantity than that offered at a comparable price in the straight goods package, we may take it that it does not involve any fraud or deception. It would seem also that competing manufacturers can adopt the break and take device at any time and thus maintain their competitive position. From these premises respondent argues that the practice is beyond the reach of the Commission because it does not fall within any of the classes which this Court has held subject to the Commission's prohibition. See Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S.Ct. 572; Federal Trade Commission v. Beech Nut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 453\n, 42 S. Ct. 150, 19 A.L.R. 882; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 652\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191; Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., supra, 288 U.S. at page 217, 53 S.Ct. 335. But we cannot say that the Com- \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n mission's jurisdiction extends only to those types of practices which happen to have been litigated before this Court.\n Neither the language nor the history of the act suggests that Congress intended to confine the forbidden methods to fixed and unyielding categories. The common law afforded a definition of unfair competition and, before the enactment of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Sherman Anti- Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note) had laid its inhibition upon combinations to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce which the courts had construed to include restraints upon competition in interstate commerce. It would not have been a difficult feat of draftsmanship to have restricted the operation of the Trade Commission Act to those methods of competition in interstate commerce which are forbidden at common law or which are likely to grow into violations of the Sherman Act, if that had been the purpose of the legislation.\n The act undoubtedly was aimed at all the familiar methods of law violation which prosecutions under the Sherman Act had disclosed. See Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 649, 650\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191. But as this Court has pointed out it also had a broader purpose, Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co ., \n258 \nU.S. 483, 493\n, 42 S.Ct. 384; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Company, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 648\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A. L.R. 1191. As proposed by the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce and as introduced in the Senate, the bill which ultimately became the Federal Trade Commission Act declared 'unfair competition' to be unlawful. \n1\n But \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 311]\n\u00a0\n it was because the meaning which the common law had given to those words was deemed too narrow that the broader and more flexible phrase 'unfair methods of com- \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 312]\n\u00a0\n petition' was substituted. \n2\n Congress, in defining the powers of the Commission, thus advisedly adopted a phrase which, as this Court has said, does not 'admit of precise definition, but the meaning and application of which must be arrived at by what this court elsewhere has called 'the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\" Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Company, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 648\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 590, 79 A.L.R. 1191; compare Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 104.3\n The argument that a method used by one competitor is not unfair if others may adopt it without any restriction of competition between them was rejected by this Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted Hosiery Co., supra; compare Federal Trade Commission v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n291 \nU.S. 67\n, 54 S.Ct. 315. There it was specifically held that a\n___ 2 The phrase 'unfair methods of competition' was substituted for 'unfair competition' in the Conference Committee. This change seems first to have been suggested by Senator Hollis in debate on the floor of the Senate in response to the suggestion that the words 'unfair competition' might be construed as restricted to those forms of unfair competition condemned by the common law. 51 Cong. Record 12145. The House Managers of the conference committee, in reporting this change said, House Report No. 1142, 63d Congress, 2d Sess., September 4, 1914, at page 19: 'It is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair practices. There is no limit to human inventiveness in this field. Even if all known unfair practices were specifically defined and prohibited, it would be at once necessary to begin over again. If Congress were to adopt the method of definition, it would undertake an endless task. It is also practically impossible to define unfair practices so that the definition will fit business of every sort in every part of this country. Whether competition is unfair or not generally depends upon the surrounding circumstances of the particular case. What is harmful under \n___certain circumstances may be beneficial under different circumstances.'\n 3 References showing the details of the legislative history of the act may be found in Handler, The Jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission over False Advertising, 31 Columbia Law Review, 527; Montague, Unfair Methods of Competition, 25 Yale Law Journal, 20; Henderson, The Federal Trade Commission, c. I. \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 313]\n\u00a0\n trader may not, by pursuing a dishonest practice, force his competitors to choose between its adoption or the loss of their trade. A method of competition which casts upon one's competitors the burden of the loss of business unless they will descend to a practice which they are under a powerful moral compulsion not to adopt, even though it is not criminal, was thought to involve the kind of unfairness at which the statute was aimed.\n The practice in this case presents the same dilemma to competitors, and we can perceive no reason for distinguishing between the element of chance as employed here and the element of deception involved in labelling cotton goods 'Natural Wool,' as in the Winsted Case. It is true that the statute does not authorize regulation which has no purpose other than that of relieving merchants from troublesome competition or of censoring the morals of business men. But here the competitive method is shown to exploit consumers, children, who are unable to protect themselves. It employs a device whereby the amount of the return they receive from the expenditure of money is made to depend upon chance. Such devices have met with condemnation throughout the community. Without inquiring whether, as respondent contends, the criminal statutes imposing penalties on gambling, lotteries and the like, fail to reach this particular practice in most or any of the states, it is clear that the practice is of the sort which the common law and criminal statutes have long deemed contrary to public policy. For these reasons a large share of the industry holds out against the device, despite ensuing loss in trade, or bows reluctantly to what it brands unscrupulous. It would seem a gross perversion of the normal meaning of the word, which is the first criterion of statutory construction, to hold that the method is not 'unfair.' See Federal Trade Commission v. Royal Milling Co., supra, 288 U.S. at page 217, 53 S.Ct. 335; Federal Trade Commission v. Algoma Lumber Co., supra, \n291 \nU.S. 67\n, 54 S.Ct. 315. \n\n[291 U.S. 304, 314]\n\u00a0\n While this Court has declared that it is for the courts to determine what practices or methods of competition are to be deemed unfair, Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, supra, in passing on that question the determination of the Commission is of weight. It was created with the avowed purpose of lodging the administrative functions committed to it in 'a body specially competent to deal with them by reason of information, experience and careful study of the business and economic conditions of the industry affected,' and it was organized in such a manner, with respect to the length and expiration of the terms of office of its members, as would 'give to them an opportunity to acquire the expertness in dealing with these special questions concerning industry that comes from experience.'

Beech Nut Packing Co., supra, \n257 U.S. 441\n, at page 453, 42 S.Ct. 150, 19 A.L.R. 882; compare Illinois Central R.R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700. If the point were more doubtful than we think it, we should hesitate to reject the conclusion of the Commission, based as it is upon clear, specific and comprehensive findings supported by evidence.\n We hold that the Commission correctly concluded that the practice was an unfair method of competition within the meaning of the statute. It is unnecessary to attempt a comprehensive definition of the unfair methods which are banned, even if it were possible to do so. We do not intimate either that the statute does not authorize the prohibition of other and hitherto unknown methods of competition or, on the other hand, that the Commission may prohibit every unethical competitive practice regardless of its particular character or consequences. New or different practices must be considered as they arise in the light of the circumstances in which they are employed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, in recommending the bill in its original form, seems to have adopted the phrase 'unfair competition' with the deliberate purpose of giving to the Commission some latitude for dealing with new and varied forms of unfair trade practices. The Committee said in its report of June 13, 1914, Senate Report No. 597, 63d Cong., Second Session, page 13:\n'The committee gave careful consideration to the question as to whether it would attempt to define the many and variable unfair practices which prevail in commerce and to forbid their continuance or whether it would, by a general declaration condemning unfair practices, leave it to the commission to determine what practices were unfair. It concluded that the latter course would be the better, for the reason, as stated by one of the representatives of the Illinois Manufactures' Association, that there were too many unfair practices to define, and after writing 20 of them into the law it would be quite possible to invent others. ... \n\n'It is believed that the term 'unfair competition' has a legal significance which can be enforced by the commission and the courts, and that it is no more difficult to determine what is unfair competition than it is to determine what is a reasonable rate or what is an unjust discrimination. The committee was of the opinion that it would be better to put in a general provision condemning unfair competition than to attempt to define the numerous unfair practices, such as local price cutting, interlocking directorates, and holding companies intended to restrain substantial competition.'\n\n Senator Newlands, in introducing the bill for the Committee, emphasized this feature. In answering the criticism that the phrase 'unfair competition' lacked definition he said, 51 Cong. Record, 11084:\n'Our answer to this is that it would be utterly impossible for Congress to define the numerous practices which constitute unfair competition and which are against good morals in trade, for we are beginning to realize that there is a standard of morals in trade or that there ought to be. Germany does not hesitate by law to condemn practices in business that are contra bonos mores. It leaves their tribunals to determine what practices are against good morals. ...\n\n'It is the illusive character of the trade practice that makes it though condemned today appear in some other form tomorrow. If we should attempt to define all the trade practices that can be devised, that would create dishonest advantage in competition, we would undertake a hopeless task.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT.

They arise out of the plan of reorganization of the National Radiator Corporation of Delaware dated February 11, 1931. The reorganization committee sought to effectuate its plan through securing, in a suit filed in the Western district of Pennsylvania, the appointment of receivers and a judicial sale of the property. In that suit the federal jurisdiction was invoked on the ground of diversity of citizenship; the original plaintiffs being citizens of states other than Delaware and one of them a citizen of the district in which the suit was brought. The corporation, a citizen of Delaware, was the sole defendant. The District Court appointed receivers, and entered decrees ordering the sale, confirming it, approving the plan, and directing the receivers to convey and deliver to the purchaser the entire property. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decrees. 64 F.(2d) 847. The petitioners in No. 64 urge that the final decrees should be reversed as to them on the ground that the court lacked equity jurisdiction or that the bill lacked equity. \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners in Nos. 62 and 63 urge that the decrees should be reversed as to them mainly because the property was sold at a grossly inadequate price. The petitioner in No. 65 is the plaintiff in a bill of review, brought in the same court, praying that the order appointing receivers be vacated. Its dismissal, which was affirmed on appeal, is alleged to have been erroneous.\n In August, 1927, National Radiator Corporation was organized to effect a merger of six independent manufacturers of radiators and boilers for heating purposes. The net assets of the consolidated corporation, which included ten manufacturing plants located in five states and warehouses in four others, were valued at $26,192,261.72. The capital was represented by 270,000 shares of no par common stock; 60,000 shares of $7 cumulative convertible no par preferred stock; and $12,000,000 twenty-year 6 1\/2 per cent. sinking fund gold debentures. These had been underwritten, and were marketed, by J. & W. Seligman & Co. and Bankers' Trust Company of New York. The terms governing the issue of the debentures and the rights and remedies of the holders thereof were fixed by an indenture between the corporation and the Bankers' Trust Company, as trustee.\n In January, 1931, the management of the corporation concluded, after months of consideration and conference with the bankers, that a revision of its capital structure was desirable in order to effect a drastic reduction of the debenture liability and the elimination of all fixed charges, and that, to this end, default should be made in the payment of the February 1, 1931, interest on the debentures. Before the merger, the constituent concerns had operated successfully for many years. After the merger, the business ceased to prosper. By the end of 1931, all but three of the ten manufacturing plants had been closed; the outlook for the immediate future was \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n obscure; and there was no definite promise of an early recovery in earning power. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A meeting of the board of directors was called for the purpose of taking formal action in respect to the payment of the February 1, 1931, interest. Although the corporation had suffered (including depreciation and sinking fund charges) large losses in each of the years 1928, 1929, and 1930, its financial condition was still excellent. On December 31, 1930, the ratio of current assets to all current liabilities was more than 10 to 1; the current assets, including raw material and stock in process and manufactured, being $5,054,007.30. The ratio of cash on hand to all current liabilities was then 3 1\/2 to 1. It had $1,701,899.94 cash, and $1, 132,563.17 in good accounts receivable; whereas its debts presently payable were only $46,787.60 (besides $293,339.58 for semiannual interest accrued on the debentures but not payable until February 1, 1931, $151,768. 54 of accrued taxes and like items, and $60,000 in notes payable in one, two, and three years). The twenty-year debentures outstanding had been reduced from $12,000,000 to $10,716,000.2\n After presenting to the board the December 31, 1930, financial statement, the chairman said:\n'That although the working capital of the Company as shown by the balance sheet was reasonably ample, it \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n was evident that, if the Company were to do an increasing volume of business, it would require the use of all or a substantial part of this cash to carry larger inventories and receivables, and that it would also be necessary to make large expenditures for the design of new products and for equipment necessary in their manufacture. Otherwise, the Chairman pointed out it might well prove to be impossible to maintain the Company's competitive business as against other enterprises in the industry. The Chairman then referred to the fact that the management had considered the advisability of a reorganization and had requested Messrs. Rudolph B. Flershem (the Chairman of its Executive Committee), Charles O. Cornell (a member of a firm specializing in reorganizations) and John H. Waters (the corporation's President) to act as a Committee to consider the matter and to formulate a Plan of Reorganization which might be submitted to the security holders of the Company. The Chairman reported that this Committee was now considering the matter of reorganization and had formed the opinion that a reorganization was advisable.'\n\n The recommendations of the management were adopted by the board of directors. It was voted to default in the payment of the February 1 interest; the holders of the debentures were notified that the default was deemed advisable in order to conserve the corporation's cash resources; and, under date of February 11, 1931, an elaborate 'Plan and Agreement of Reorganization' was submitted to the security holders for acceptance.\n The plan did not provide for raising additional capital. It was directed solely to reducing the liability on the debentures and eliminating all fixed charges. It provided that a new corporation be organized which would take over all the assets of the existing one, continue the business, and pay in cash all the current debts for merchandise and services; that the debenture indebtedness be \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n scaled by giving for each $1,000 of the 6 1\/2 per cent. twenty-year sinking fund debentures, $500 of the new corporation's 5 per cent. fifteen- year income debentures (without sinking fund provision),3 5 shares of its $ 7 preferred stock (entitled to $100 a share on involuntary liquidation and $ 115 a share on voluntary liquidation), and 20 shares of its common stock. Holders of the preferred stock in the existing company were to receive therefor, share for share, common stock in the new; and holders of the common stock of the existing company might (upon payment of $1), receive for every three shares a stock warrant, entitling the holder to purchase on or before July 1, 1941, one share of common stock in the new company upon payment of $20 per share. The plan made no provision for dissenting debenture holders.\n The reorganization committee proceeded to solicit deposits of securities under the plan. Before September 15, 1931, it had secured the deposit of about 81 per cent. of the debentures and a large part of the preferred and common stocks. On that day it declared the plan operative. On the same day it made a settlement with an opposing bondholders' protective committee,4 whereby it secured additional deposits of about 9 per cent. of the debentures. Later, other deposits were received; so that ultimately more than 95 per cent. of all outstanding debentures were deposited under the plan.\n Some holders of nonassenting debentures demanded payment of their overdue coupons, including those for the \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n August 1, 1931, interest. When payment was refused, the holders of $24,000 of the debentures brought an action therefor; and counsel gave notice of intention to bring a further action on coupons attached to others. In order to frustrate these attempts to collect the interest, and in order to compel the minority debenture holders to acquiesce in the plan of reorganization, the committee commenced, on October 5, 1931, this suit praying for the appointment of receivers with power to continue the business; for a sale of the properties as an entirety; and that meanwhile all creditors be enjoined from enforcing their claims. The bill set forth the existing capital structure, the defaults in the payment of interest, and the plan of reorganization. It did not allege that the corporation was unable to pay the interest; or that it was insolvent; or that its assets, while ample, were not then available for payment of its debts. The bill alleged merely that:\n'The defendant has no means at hand with which to meet, pay or satisfy the interest charges on the Debentures overdue as aforesaid without seriously jeopardizing the ability of the defendant to continue its business and without making it difficult or impossible for the defendant to secure the necessary supplies, materials and labor to continue the operation of its plants and the sale of its products.'\n\n'(That) certain holders of the debentures not deposited with the complainants have threatened to bring suits in respect of interest due on their coupons and may levy execution upon the property of the defendant . ... (That) unless the Court will take jurisdiction in this cause for the protection of every interest in the property and assets of the defendant, the result will be a multiplicity of suits, a race of diligence, wasteful strife and controversy'; and dismemberment of the properties (and that) 'It is to the best interests of the defendant and the complainants and other creditors of the defendant that \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 513]\n\u00a0\n the going concern value of the defendant's business and properties should be maintained,' etc.\n\n On October 9, 1931, the corporation entered its appearance; filed an answer admitting the truth of the allegations contained in the bill; joined in the prayers thereof; and consented to the appointment of receivers. On the same day receivers were appointed with power to continue the business; and creditors were restrained from enforcing their claims against the property. One of the receivers was Robert S. Waters, a vice president and general manager of the corporation and the son of John H. Waters, its president, chairman of its board of directors, and member of the reorganization committee. The other receiver was William G. Heiner, a Pittsburgh lawyer. With like consent, ancillary receivers were appointed in ten other jurisdictions in which the corporation had property, and also in Delaware where it had none.\n When the bill was filed, and when the receivers were appointed, the corporation could have paid from the cash on hand all overdue debenture interest, as well as all its other current liabilities, without impairing its ability to continue the business. The cash on hand was.$1,257,381.59.5 The overdue interest amounted then to $709,395.69.6 That $547,985.90, the difference between these two amounts, was more than the amount required for working capital, is demonstrated by action of the receivers. Two weeks after their appointment, they applied \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 514]\n\u00a0\n for and obtained from the court leave to invest 'such amount or amounts of cash of the receivership estate as in the judgment of the receivers is not needed at the time for expenses and working capital.' Thereupon, they invested $1,030,000 of the cash in United States Treasury certificates of indebtedness and in bank certificates of deposit.\n The Bankers' Trust Company, as trustee for the debenture holders, co- operated in all respects with the reorganization committee; served as depositary under the plan; made formal demand for payment of the overdue interest; and brought, with leave of court, suit for the amount of the overdue interest on all outstanding debentures and recovered judgment therefor; thereupon declared the principal of the debentures immediately payable; recovered judgment therefor on December 30, 1931, and then intervened in the receivership suit as plaintiff.\n In due course, application was made for an order of sale. The District Court did not make an appraisal by independent experts. In fixing the upset price and in confirming the sale, it relied practically upon the evidence given, or introduced, by officers of the corporation and the members of the reorganization committee. On May 31, 1932, the decree ordering a sale was entered; the upset price was fixed at $2,500,000; and a date after the sale was set for a hearing on its confirmation and on the fairness of the plan. An appeal from this decree was taken forthwith. At the sale, held August 8, 1932, the property was purchased in behalf of the committee for $2,550,000 cash. The purchasers assigned their rights to the new company, National Radiator Corporation of Maryland, which agreed to enter an appearance in this cause; and, upon the petition of the purchasers and the new company, a decree was entered finding the plan fair; confirming the sale; and directing that the property be transferred to the new corporation free and clear of all obligations to creditors of \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 515]\n\u00a0\n the old. Thereupon the assets were conveyed to the new company, over the objection of some of the petitioners that the appeal already filed rendered the court powerless to take or approve further action. The same counsel acted for the reorganization committee, the receivers, and the new company.\n While all the petitioners refused assent to the plan and all appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from action of the District Court, the differences in their several positions and contentions are such as to require separate consideration of their legal rights.\n First. Amy Arzt and Josephine Ramsey, the petitioners in No. 64, hold $ 121,000 of the debentures. They appeared specially at the hearing on the confirmation of the sale; objected, among other things, on the ground that the court lacked equity jurisdiction of the subject-matter; appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from the decree affirming the sale; and contended there and here that, since they refused assent to the plan, the decree should, as to them, be declared void and reversed. Whether strictly there was lack of equity jurisdiction, we need not decide. Compare Burnrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs, \n274 \nU.S. 208\n, 47 S.Ct. 578; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 640\n, 43 S.Ct. 641; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491\n, 43 S.Ct. 454. For the suit is clearly without equity. The court's power was invoked for a purpose for which it may not be exercised.\n We have no occasion to consider under what circumstances a court of equity may, through appointment of receivers and judicial sale, lend aid to protect the interests of creditors and effect a reorganization of an insolvent corporation. \n7\n Nor need we consider under what circum- \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 516]\n\u00a0\n stances a court of equity may, because the assets of a corporation are ample to meet all liabilities but cannot then be immediately converted into cash, properly appoint receivers in order to preserve values and prevent unequal treatment of creditors. \n8\n The case before us is of a different character. The possibility of insolvency was not mentioned when the board of directors voted to make default in the payment of the semiannual interest on its funded indebtedness and approved the plan of reorganization. While defaulting on its debentures, the corporation continued its business operations and paid promptly its merchandise and other unfunded indebted- \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 517]\n\u00a0\n ness. Insolvency was not present or imminent. The debentures were not to mature until 1947. Insolvency even in the remote future was not certain. This company defaulted when it was both solvent and liquid. It defaulted, although it had cash in bank equal to three and a half times its total current liabilities, including this interest. It defaulted, although the amount of the cash on hand was so large that, even if the interest had been paid, the surplus of cash remaining would have been more than was then required for working capital.\n This deliberate disregard by the corporation of the legal rights of the debenture holders is sought to be justified on the ground that the management, looking to the long future, concluded that the course taken would inure to the benefit of the business and all concerned-would benefit bondholders as well as stockholders. The default was the first step in a proposed revision of the capital structure by which the funded indebtedness would be cut in half and all fixed charges eliminated. The management, whose competency had been challenged, functioned as members of the reorganization committee. Having failed to obtain the assent of all the security holders to its plan, the committee sought the aid of a court of equity to compel the minority's acquiescence; and the corporation joined as defendant in the prayers of the bill. Reorganization was the primary relief sought. The appointment of the receivers and the judicial sale were the device employed to effect a transfer of the assets of the existing corporation to a new one, thereby relieving both from the payment of the former's debts. \n9\n By these means \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 518]\n\u00a0\n it was hoped to subject all dissenting creditors to the condition of impotency so frequently occupied by minority stockholders.\n The substantive law affords no warrant for so abridging the rights of individual creditors. There is no contention that the corporation laws of Delaware conferred such power upon the board of directors and the majority of the debenture holders. The purpose of the transaction was to hinder and delay certain creditors. If, acting upon purported authorizations from the board of directors and all stockholders, the Radiator Corporation had sought to achieve the purpose of the reorganization committee by a voluntary transfer of all of the assets to a new corporation, the conveyance would have been fraudulent in law as to dissenting debenture holders. It would have been a fraudulent conveyance even if the transaction had been entered upon solely in the interest of the debenture holders, in a well-founded belief that it would prove to their advantage, and although full payment of the indebtedness had been contemplated. Means v. Dowd, \n128 \nU.S. 273\n, 9 S.Ct. 65.10 The illegality would not have been avoided by coupling the transfer later with the appointment of a receiver. Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348, 354\n, 355 S., 53 S.Ct. 142, 85 A.L.R. 128. Nor could the illegality be avoided by first securing the appointment of \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 519]\n\u00a0\n receivers and then effecting the transfer through a receiver's sale. Since the purpose was fraudulent in law, the rights of the nonassenting creditors cannot be impaired by the corporation's admission of the self- serving allegations of the bill. Compare Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S.Ct. 268.\n The power of the District Court was invoked, not to enforce rights of creditors, but to defeat them. The fact that the means employed to effect the fraudulent conveyance was the judgment of a court and not a voluntary transfer does not remove the taint of illegality. \n11\n Jackson v. Ludeling, 21 Wall. 616. Compare James v. Milwaukee & M. Railroad Co., 6 Wall. 752; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482, 507\n, 33 S.Ct. 554. Nor is it material that the corporation became insolvent later, long before entry of the order of sale, and that, but for the appointment of receivers, some nonassenting debenture holders would have obtained a preference. The lack of equity in the bill when filed is not cured by the insolvency later occuring. Compare Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491\n, 43 S.Ct. 454. Moreover the insolvency which supervened was precipitated by the reorganization committee, then the only plaintiffs in this suit. It was at their request that the Bankers' Trust Company, as trustee, declared the principal of the debentures due, recovered judgment thereon for $10,673,000, and inter- \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 520]\n\u00a0\n vened as party plaintiff. These acts were steps in carrying out the plan in which the corporation, the committee, and the trust company co-operated.\n The sale and reorganization being in law fraudulent as to the petitioners in No. 64, it remains to consider the relief to which they are entitled. If, as in Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348, 357\n, 53 S.Ct. 142, 145, 85 A.L.R. 128, the reorganization had been effected by a voluntary transfer and thereafter receivers had been appointed by the federal court, these creditors would, upon recovery of judgment, have been 'entitled to an order in the alternative either for the payment of his judgment out of the assets in the hands of the receivers or in default thereof for leave to issue execution.' The relief and the procedure should be the same here, although these petitioners are not judgment creditors, and the transfer followed the appointment of receivers. They should be paid in full upon establishing their claims in this case, because they were prevented by the interlocutory order appointing receivers from proceeding against the assets, fraudulently transferred, and thereby securing a lien, which would have yielded them full payment. Compare Metcalf v. Barker, \n187 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 23 S.Ct. 67; Freedman's Savings & T. Co. v. Earle, \n110 \nU.S. 710\n, 4 S.Ct. 226; Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191.12\n Nothing in the indenture with the Bankers' Trust Company, or in its action as trustee thereunder, interferes with affording them this relief. That instrument expressly reserves to the individual debenture holders the right to collect interest and principal in an action at law. If that right was impaired by the acts of the trust company, in declaring the principal of the debentures due and securing judgment thereon, equity will grant relief; because those acts, done at the request of the reorganization com- \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 521]\n\u00a0\n mittee, were incidents of the plan which we hold was fraudulent in law as to these petitioners. \n13\n The debenture holders who, by assenting to the plan, co-operated with the corporation and the reorganization committee, are in no position to complain that these petitioners will fare better than they. Compare Davis v. Virginia Railway & Power Co. (C.C.A.) 229 F. 633, 642.14 Since the assets fraudulently conveyed far exceed the amount of the claims of all nonassenting creditors, none of these could have occasion to object to the payment to these petitioners in full.\n Second. Lily Clapier, the petitioner in No. 65, is the holder of $11, 000 of the debentures. She refused to assent to the plan of reorganization, but did not seek to intervene in the receivership suit. Instead, she brought in the \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 522]\n\u00a0\n same court a separate suit against the corporation and the receivers in the nature of a bill of review. Suing on behalf of herself and all other creditors who had refused to accept the plan, she charged that the court was without jurisdiction in equity to appoint receivers, and prayed that the decree appointing them be vacated and no further proceedings be had. The receivers and the corporation moved to dismiss the Clapier suit on the ground that the bill failed to set forth a cause of action. These motions were granted, without passing upon the question whether, in view of the fact that two of the defendants were citizens of the same state as the plaintiff, there was lack of federal jurisdiction. From the decree of dismissal she appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n A bill of review is called for only after a final decree-one that finally adjudicates upon the entire merits, leaving nothing further to be done except the execution of it.' John Simmons Co. v. Grier Bros. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 82, 88\n, 42 S.Ct. 196, 198. For this reason, a bill of review will not lie to review an interlocutory order appointing a receiver. The dismissal of the Clapier suit was therefore proper. But that decree should have been without prejudice to her right to prosecute her claim against the corporation, the assets in the hands of the receivers, and the new company. To this end she should be given leave to intervene in the receivership suit and there present her claim for such relief as may appear to be appropriate. As the new corporation became party to the suit when it applied for confirmation of the sale, there is here no obstacle to this procedure. Compare National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 438\n, 53 S.Ct. 678; Kneeland v. American Loan & Trust Co., \n136 \nU.S. 89\n, 10 S.Ct. 950.\n Third. The First National Bank, one of the two petitioners in Nos. 62 and 63, is the holder of $68,000 of the debentures. It filed, before the hearing on ordering the sale, a petition for leave to intervene, and was permitted \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 523]\n\u00a0\n to do so as party defendant, but only 'in subordination to and recognition of the propriety of the main proceeding.' In the hearings on ordering the sale, on approving the plan, and on confirming the sale, it took part by cross- examination of witnesses and by argument; but it did not introduce any evidence. It appealed from both the interlocutory and the final decree.\n The bank does not claim that the District Court was without equity jurisdiction or that the bill lacked equity. It concedes that the court could properly lend its aid to effectuate the proposed reorganization and, to this end, might sell the assets as an entirety. Its contention is that the property held in receivership was a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of each and every creditor, and, since some of the debenture holders had refused to assent to the plan of reorganization, the court was under the duty to make the sale on such terms and under such conditions as would insure to them, as their distributive share of the assets, the largest amount in cash which could be realized therefrom, and that the court, basing its action upon estimates offered in support of the plan, fixed a grossly inadequate upset price and erred in confirming the sale. The respondents insist that the nonassenting debenture holders were entitled only to their distributive share of the sum for which the property could have been sold if scrapped, and that they would, under the price paid, receive that much.\n It is clear from the evidence introduced by the reorganization committee and the receivers that the upset price and the sale price were far below even the scrap value. The upset price fixed was $2,500,000. The entire property was sold to the reorganization committee for $2,550,000. At that time the cash and assets equivalent to cash alone aggregated $2, 192,804.95. There was cash $1,551,615.78, and notes and accounts receivable (after deducting ample reserve for doubtful accounts) $641, \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 524]\n\u00a0\n 189.17. Besides, there were $1,671,605.91 in raw material, goods in process and manufactured; bonds, stocks, and like items valued at $88,873. 41; manufacturing plants, and the warehouses in the several cities theretofore valued at $6,388,318.83; good will, trade-marks, and patents theretofore valued at $6,634,501.90; and other assets valued at $166,475. 65. Moreover, the existence of the plan of reorganization, assented to by a vast majority of the security holders, gave assurance of at least one bidder for the entire property who had confidence that the business, if sold as an entirety as a going concern, possessed a value greater than its liquidating value, and would, if necessary to effectuate the plan, bid for the assets in cash more than the estimated liquidating value. The upset price and the sale price were grossly inadequate.15. \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 525]\n\u00a0\n In justifying the action taken, the Court of Appeals called attention to the fact that the nonassenting creditors had not introduced any evidence to prove their contention that the sale should not be confirmed. In view of the undisputed facts stated above, the introduction of such evidence was not indispensable. The failure to secure an adequate price seems to have been due, not to lack of opposing evidence, but to the mistaken belief that it was the duty of the court to aid in effectuating the plan of reorganization, since a very large majority of the debenture holders had assented to it. Moreover, the court stood in a position different from that which it occupies in ordinary litigation, where issues are to be determined solely upon such evidence as the contending parties choose to introduce. In receivership proceedings, as was held in National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, every important determination by the court calls for an informed, independent judgment; and special reasons exist for requiring adequate, trustworthy information where the jurisdiction rests wholly upon the consent of the defendant who joins in the prayers for relief. It would be \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 526]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable to impose upon a few dissenting creditors the heavy financial burden of making an adequate appraisal supported by the testimony of competent experts, where, as here, the assets include extensive plants and equipment located in nine states.\n The relief which the bank seeks is that sum in cash which it would have received if the property had been sold at a proper price. To this relief it is clearly entitled. The cause is remanded to the District Court for the purpose of ascertaining the sum. In making their determination, it must be borne in mind that the problem which was presented to the trial court upon the application for the receiver's sale of the assets of this manufacturing company, with its many far-flung plants and warehouses, was a very different one from that with which courts have been confronted upon applications for sale on foreclosure of railroad systems. In such cases, it is ordinarily necessary that the property be sold as an entirety. The unity of the system must be preserved in both the public and the private interest, and the large amount of cash required by the upset price renders the reorganization committee, which ordinarily controls a large majority of the outstanding securities, practically the only bidder. \n16\n Compare Kansas City Terminal R. Co. v. Central Union Trust \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 527]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n271 \nU.S. 445, 453\n, 454 S., 46 S.Ct. 549. In the case at bar, preservation of the unity of the property was not essential. The sale of the assets in many parcels was possible, and perhaps desirable in the interest of all concerned.\n A detailed appraisal must now be made of the corporation's assets as of the date of the sale, based upon then values and the possibility of disposing of them in parcels, as well as an entirety. The appraisal of the current assets will present little difficulty; and the experience gained since the sale in collecting the receivables and in disposing of the inventory will be of aid. The appraisal of the property other than the current assets will require careful preparation and consideration. The inadequacy of the upset price seems to have resulted mainly from the assumption that the only alternatives were to continue to operate the properties as an entirety or to scrap all, and from a determination that the properties should not be scrapped. So far as appears, no consideration was then given to the possibility of selling the properties in such parcels as would permit of reconstituting as separate units some of the original independent concerns; or to the fact that a detailed valuation of the many items of which the assets, tangible and intangible, were composed was essential to intelligent bidding for the property in such parcels or as scrap; or to the fact that, if the sale was not made as an entirety, the appropriate markets for some of the parcels or lots might not be New Castle, Pa., where the sale was held. Moreover, no attempt appears to have been made then to secure bids from buyers of scrapped properties.\n The history of the enterprise lends no support to the view that, unless all the property was to be scrapped, all had to be sold as an entirety. The losses of the corporation appear to have been due largely to the fundamental mistake of judgment committed in merging the several independent concerns. Before the consolidation, each of \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 528]\n\u00a0\n the six independent concerns earned large profits. Their aggregate profits for each of the last three years before the merger had averaged $3,455,642 a year. A few months after the merger the corporation entered upon a period of heavy losses which continued unbroken up to the time of the receivers' sale. The abrupt change from profit to loss was not the result of the general business depression. Although 1928 and 1929 were years of general business prosperity,17 the loss of the corporation (before payment of debenture interest) was $587,123 in 1928 and $490,371 in 1929.18 The heavy losses during 1928, 1929, and later years (including the period of the receivership) appear to have been due in large measure to the cost of carrying unused properties. During the receivership, only the Pennsylvania plants were in operation. \n19\n For them there was still substantial business; and that business might then have been profitable if not burdened with the cost of carrying the many unused properties. \n20\n In valuing the assets, the appraisers should also bear in mind that, even if part of the properties should have been sold as scrap, the reorganization committee was a willing purchaser for the rest.\n Fourth. The International Heater Company, the other petitioner in Nos. 62 and 63, holds three promissory notes of the corporation of $20,000 each, maturing, respectively, \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 529]\n\u00a0\n on the last days of 1931, 1932, and 1933. It refused assent to the plan; but it does not question either that the District Court had equity jurisdiction of the cause, or that there was equity in the bill. It expressly concedes that the court could properly lend its aid to enable security holders of an unsuccessful corporation to find, through reorganization, a practical method of continuing the business. Its main objection is that, under the decree entered, it is denied payment in cash of the amount to which it is entitled. The heater company did not learn of the application for the order of sale until after the hearing thereon had closed. Then it filed a petition to intervene, was permitted to intervene as defendant, but only 'in subordination to, and recognition of, the propriety of the proceeding'; and it appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from both the decree ordering the sale and from that confirming it and approving the plan. It seeks reversal of the decree on two entirely distinct and alternative grounds.\n\n 1. \nThe heater company asks that, pursuant to the plan, these notes be paid in full by the new corporation. The plan provides that debts for merchandise or services shall be paid by the new corporation in full. These notes were part of the purchase price paid, in the latter part of 1927, for a minority interest in the stock of the Lincoln Radiator Company, the majority interest of which the corporation had previously acquired. The heater company contends that the notes, being a part of the current indebtedness of the old company, and having been given for personal property, are to be deemed merchandise debts within the meaning of the plan, but that, if the plan as drawn does not include them, it should be amended by the court, so as to provide for the payment of the notes in full. The Court of Appeals rejected this contention. We think it was right, substantially for the reasons stated by it. \n\n[290 U.S. 504, 530]\n\u00a0\n 2. The heater company contends that, if the notes are not to be paid in full, it should receive a sum much larger than its distributive share of the purchase price paid by the new corporation. Unlike the bank, it does not argue that the court was obliged to make an independent investigation into the value of the assets before fixing the upset price. Its contentions are that the heater company should not be prejudiced by its own failure to introduce evidence on that issue, since it had no notice or knowledge of the hearing; that, moreover, the gross inadequacy of the price paid was due to the fact that, instead of aiming to secure for nonassenting creditors the largest possible sum in cash, the court treated the receiver's sale as merely a necessary step in effectuating the plan of reorganization, and hence adopted a method of selling which excluded all bidders except the reorganization committee. We have no occasion to discuss this argument in detail. For the reasons stated in connection with the bank's claim, we think that the sale was made at a grossly inadequate price, and that it was invalid also as to the heater company. Like the bank, the heater company is entitled to receive in cash its distributive share of the amount which, upon the new appraisal, shall be found to have been the fair selling value of the assets.\n In Nos. 62, 63, and 64, decree reversed as to petitioners.\n In No. 65, decree modified, and, as modified, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The corporation acquired by the merger ten plants. Two at Johnstown, Pa.; two at New Castle, Pa.; one at Framingham, Mass.; one at Trenton, N.J .; one at Chicago, Ill.; and one each at Utica, Dunkirk, and North Tonawanda, N.Y. One plant had been sold in 1927, and one was shut down. Two were closed early in 1929. In 1930 one plant was shut down because of the decline in business, and one in 1931 before the receivers were appointed. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] On December 30, 1931, at which time Bankers' Trust Company, trustee for the debenture holders, recovered judgment for the entire principal outstanding, the amount had been further reduced to $10,673,000. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Moreover, the existing debentures were entitled to be secured by a prior lien against any subsequent mortgage; the new debentures were entitled only to an equal lien with any subsequent mortgage. The committee later agreed with an opposition committee (see note 4) that the lien should be prior. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The opposition committee were to receive $35,000 for fees and expenses of the members and counsel; and one of its members, to be designated by the reorganization committee, was to become a member of the latter and of the board of directors of the new company. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] On the day of their appointment, the receivers had also $1,494,327. 22 in sound receivables and at least $34,534.40 in securities convertible in cash. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The aggregate of other current liabilities (including amounts not then payable) was only $157,511.89. There was besides the August 1, 1931, requirement for the sinking fund. But the debentures held by the corporation applicable for this purpose reduced the requirement of cash to $ 43,918.50. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] All the cases in which this Court appears to have exercised this power in aid of reorganization upon the ground of insolvency dealt with railroads or other public utilities where continued operation of the property and preservation of its unity seemed to be required in the public interest.

McCreery, \n141 \nU.S. 475\n, 12 S.Ct. 28, where the defendant corporation had allowed the receivership of a rolling mill to proceed nine months without answering and creditors did not object until after the decree of sale, this Court refused to decide whether originally the suit should have been allowed to proceed.\n The Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204,  77, 47 Stat. 1474, amending the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  205(a), provides: 'Reorganization of railroads engaged in interstate commerce. (a) Any railroad corporation may file a petition stating that the railroad corporation is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it desires to effect a plan of reorganization.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] In National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 435\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, the question before this Court was not the equity of the bill, but the propriety of the procedure pursued by the District Court when approving the plan of reorganization. Compare Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 343\n, 52 S.Ct. 512; Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348, 356\n, 53 S.Ct. 142, 85 A.L.R. 128; Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597\n, 38 S.Ct. 211; Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218\n, 49 S.Ct. 310; Munroe v. Raphael, \n288 \nU.S. 485\n, 53 S.Ct. 424. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Unless all debenture holders assented to the plan, it could not be effectuated except through the medium of a judicial sale; for the indenture with the Bankers' Trust Company, trustee, provided that the property of the Radiator Corporation should not be sold as an entirety unless 'as a part of the purchase price for the sale of the property of the company as an entirety (the purchaser) expressly assumes in writing the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest of all the debentures,' whereas the main purpose of the plan was to cut in half the amount of the debenture liability and to eliminate all fixed charges through transfering the entire property to a new company. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Similarly, it has been held that an assignment made for the benefit of creditors, by one who is solvent, to avoid temporary embarrassment and sacrifice of assets, is a fraudulent conveyance as to those who have not consented, and that the conveyance will be set aside to the extent necessary to permit nonassenting creditors to levy execution. Burt v. McKinstry, 4 Minn. 204 (Gil. 146), 77 Am.Dec. 507; Gardner v. Commercial Nat. Bank, 95 Ill. 298. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 'An execution sale under a consent judgment, where the consent is, in effect, not the act of the defendant, but that of the plaintiff prosecuting the action, is in reality merely a voluntary transfer.

Moses, 35 App.Div. 596, 55 N.Y.S. 179; Id., 161 N.Y. 587, 56 N.E. 67; Johnston v. Straus (C.C.) 26 F. 57. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The record does not show that all the debentures would not have been paid in due course under proper management, in the absence of the voluntary default made to effect the desired reorganization, and other proceedings to that end. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] There, in a case of reorganization, the court said: 'The holders of the bonds secured by the senior mortgages and the other debenture bondholders of the Richmond Company had the opportunity to join the petitioner in his effort to recover property which he alleged had been taken from that on which they all relied for security. They refused to enter the contest, and accepted as full payment and satisfaction of their bonds the settlement offered in the reorganization. Thus the petitioner was left as the only bondholder who chose to avail himself of the reservation and make the contest, and it follows that he alone is entitled to receive the fruit of his effort. ... All other creditors waived their rights, and were in the position of saying, either that there was no merit in petitioner's contention, or that they were unwilling to make any effort to bring under the security the property alleged to have been diverted. Evidently, under such conditions, the property which may be recovered or brought back as a part of the assets of the Richmond Company by petitioner's efforts and expense would be applicable to his bonds. The principle is well settled by authority. Freedman's S. & T. Co. v. Earle, \n110 \nU.S. 710\n, 4 S.Ct. 226.' See, also, In re American Candy Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 256 F. 87, 88; George v. St. Louis Cable & Western R. Co . (C.C.) 44 F. 117, 120-124. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] It seems to have been the aim of the reorganization committee to have the upset price fixed at a sum which would yield to nonassenting debenture holders not more than the then market value of their bonds. At one time it has made at one of its meetings a tentative suggestion of $3, 600,000. The gross inadequacy of the upset price is illustrated by the division of the $2,500,000, as applied to the ten separate parcels in which, as a formality, the property was offered before selling it as an entirety to the reorganization committee. Parcel A for which the upset price of $2,392,000 was set included, besides the plants and other real estate in Pennsylvania, all the personal property except that used in connection with the plants and other real estate located in the other eight states. Parcel B embraced the plant and appurtenant real and personal property in New Jersey (including 11 1\/2 acres near Trenton and 14 dwelling houses), carried on the books at $861,179.12. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $28,000. Parcel C embraced the plant and appurtenant real and personal property in Massachusetts (including 23 acres at Framingham), carried on the books at $592,452,64. The upset price for this parcel was fixed at $17,500. Parcel D embraced the plant and appurtenant real and personal property at North Tonawanda (including 10 acres) and Dunkirk, N.Y., valued on the books at $1,318,373.60. The upset price for this parcel was fixed at $37,500. Parcel E included 10 acres of land, the plants and appurtenant real and personal property and a warehouse at Chicago, Ill., carried on the books at $605,149.43, and also the Edgewood Apartment Hotel, at Chicago, carried on the books at $51,172. 31. The upset price fixed for this parcel was $17,500. Parcel F included the warehouse at Baltimore, Md., and the usual equipment, which was carried on the books at $33,477.93. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $1,000. Parcel G included the warehouse equipment at Cincinnati, Ohio, which was carried on the books at $48,632.84. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $2,250. Parcel H included the warehouse at Richmond, Va., which was carried on the books at $26,045.42. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $1,000. Parcel I included two warehouses at Hempstead, N.Y., which was carried on the books at $30,093.81. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $1,000. Parcel J included the warehouse at Washington, D.C., which was carried on the books at $58,536. 53. The upset price on this parcel was fixed at $1,000. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] By the decree, the purchaser was required to pay only $300,000 in cash, presumably to cover the expenses and fees of the reorganization committee, the receivers, and counsel. The decree provided that on the balance of the purchase price 'The Purchaser shall be credited on account of his purchase price for Debentures and coupons and assigned claims finally established and allowed, turned over in part payment of the purchase price, with such sum as would be paid in respect of such Debentures, coupons and assigned claims out of the proceeds of sale, if the whole amount of the purchase price had been paid in cash.' By this provision, customary in decrees for sales of railroad systems on foreclosure, the reorganization committee was relieved of the necessity of raising a large sum in cash-a necessity which naturally would deter bidders not so situated. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The losses were doubtless due in part to the fact that already, at the end of 1927, the very lucrative 'direct to the consumer' business theretofore carried on by two of the theretofore independent concerns had to be discontinued, because incompatible with the selling methods of the other plants of the consolidated company. \n[\nFootnote 18\n] The greater part of the products of these plants was used in the new buildings. In the year 1928, the new construction in America was said to have reached its all-time record. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] See note 1, supra. \n[\nFootnote 20\n] During the first four months of the receivership, the gross sales were $1,300,000. For the first fifty days of the receivership an operating gain of $31,917.77 was turned into a loss of $14,630.44 by reason of maintenance expense of the nonoperating plants of $46,548.21. \n\n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIX v. PHILADELPHIA BARGE CO.(1934)\nNo. 153\nArgued: December 13, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas P. Mikell, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action originally brought by MacLaughlin, a collector of internal revenue, in a federal District Court, against respondents, to recover on a bond conditioned for the payment of such income taxes assessed against the barge company as should remain unabated after consideration of a claim for abatement by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The obligee named in the bond is Ephraim Lederer, collector of internal revenue when the bond was executed, 'or his successors.' MacLaughlin having died, the case was first revived in the name of Ladner, and, upon his resignation, in the name of petitioner. All three, in turn, succeeded to the office held by Lederer.\n In the District Court the surety company filed an affidavit of defense, incorporating a plea that the cause of action upon the bond had abated, and had been lost, by failure to comply with section 11 of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 941, U.S.C. title 28,  780 ( 28 USCA  780). \n\n[290 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n In support of that contention, the plea alleges that suit in assumpsit on the same bond had been brought by one McCaughn, the first successor of Lederer; that, pending the suit, McCaughn resigned as collector; that judgment, nevertheless, was thereafter entered in his favor; and that subsequently, upon a suggestion of abatement of the cause of action, an order was entered striking the judgment from the record by reason of the fact that the action upon which the judgment was rendered had abated prior to the entry thereof.\n The District Court held that, since one suit, brought by a successor of the original obligee, had abated by reason of the failure of the government to make substitution under the act of 1925, there resulted an abatement of the cause of action as well as of the writ. 60 F.(2d) 333. Upon the basis of this ruling and upon a praecipe filed by the United States attorney, final judgment was entered against the collector, which judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 63 F.(2d) 258.\n Respondents raise some question as to the right of the government to appeal to the court below, but the point is so obviously without merit that we do not stop to state or discuss it.\n Section 11 of the act of 1925 (28 USCA  780), so far as pertinent, provides that where, during the pendency of an action brought by or against an officer of the United States, relating to the present or future discharge of his official duties, such officer dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, it shall be competent for the court where the action is pending, 'to permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or against the successor in office or such officer, if within six months after his death or separation from the office it be satisfactorily shown to the court that there is a substantial need for so continuing and maintaining the cause and obtaining an adjudication of the questions involved.' The original act on the subject, of which the act of 1925 \n\n[290 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n is an amplification, as passed February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822, evidently in response to a suggestion of this court in U.S. ex rel. Bernardin v. Butterworth, \n169 \nU.S. 600\n, 18 S.Ct. 441, decided in 1898. See Murphy v. Utter, \n186 \nU.S. 95, 101\n, 22 S.Ct. 776; Caledonian Coal Company v. Baker, \n196 U.S. 432\n, 440-442, 25 S.Ct. 375; Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219, 222\n, 42 S.Ct. 293. In the Butterworth Case it was held that a suit to compel the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent was abated by the death of the Commissioner; and that it could not be revied in the name of his successor, even with the latter's consent. The court suggested that, in view of the inconvenience occasioned by this state of the law, it would seem desirable that Congress should provide for the difficulty by enacting that in such cases it should be lawful for the successor in office to be brought into the case. The purpose of the act, as explained in the House Committee report (H. Rep. No. 960, 55 Cong., 2d Sess.), and by the member of the House who reported the bill from the committee (Cong. Rec., Vol. 31, Pt. 4, pp. 3865-3866), was to permit the suit to survive and avoid the necessity of compelling a party to commence a new action against the successor in office.\n The act is purely remedial, designed to remove what this court in the Butterworth Case called an 'inconvenience.' Failure to comply with the statute forecloses the particular remedy therein provided; it does not destroy the right. There is a clear difference between the action and the cause of action. Revival of the action is necessary because that does not survive the death or resignation of the officer by or against whom it has been brought; but the cause of action may survive, depending upon its nature and the applicable rule. See Sanders' Adm'x v. Louisville & N.R. Co . (C.C.A.) 111 F. 708, 710; Martin v. Wabash R. Co. (C.C.A.) 142 F. 650, 651, 6 Ann.Cas. 582. Compare Green v. Watkins, 6 Wheat. 260; Henshaw v. Miller, 17 How. 212, 219; Warren v. Furstenheim ( C.C.) 35 F. 691, 695, 1 L.R.A. 40. The \n\n[290 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n vice of the ruling below, and of the argument here in support of it, is the failure to give effect to this distinction. The present bond runs to each successor, as it ran to the original obligee and with like effect; and, notwithstanding the termination of the latter's possession of the office, the cause of action which arose in his favor survives for appropriate enforcement by his several successors. Tyler v. Hand et al., 7 How. 573; Bowers v. American Surety Co. (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 244, 246. This accords with the policy of the revival statute, as observed by Judge L. Hand in the case last cited. A conclusion to the contrary would subvert the purpose of the bond, which 'is to create an obligation in favor of the incumbents, as they succeed each other.'\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFREULER v. HELVERING(1934)\nNo. 129\nArgued: December 8, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 35, 36]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R.I., Felix T. Smith, of San Francisco, Cal., and W. W. Spalding, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A. C. Whitcomb, a resident of California, died in 1889, and by his will, probated in that state, gave the residue of his estate in trust, one- third of the income to be paid to his widow for life, with limitations in remainder. The petitioner is the administrator of the estate of Mrs. Whitcomb, who died in 1921. The will of A. C. Whitcomb contained no direction for the computation of trust income, none for the keeping of the trustee's accounts and none for any allowance or deduction representing depreciation. Beginning about 1906 the trustee converted trust assets into real estate and other forms of investment \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n subject to depreciation. In fiduciary income tax returns for 1921 and subsequent years, the trustee deducted from gross income an amount representing depreciation, but failed to withhold from the beneficiaries, to whom he paid income, the amount of the depreciation deduction, so that each beneficiary was paid his or her full ratable share of income for the taxable year. As Mrs. Whitcomb died in 1921 a portion of the year's income was paid to her and a portion to the petitioner as her administrator. Neither the petitioner, as administrator of Mrs. Whitcomb, nor any of the other beneficiaries, included in their returns, as income received, that proportion of the income represented by the depreciation deduction shown on the trustee's fiduciary return.\n The applicable sections of the Revenue Act of 19211 are:\n'Sec. 219. (a) That the tax imposed by sections 210 and 211 shall apply to the income of estates or of any kind of property held in trust, including-... (4) Income which is to be distributed to the beneficiaries periodically, whether or not at regular intervals, and the income collected by a guardian of an infant to be held or distributed as the court may direct. ...\n\n'(d). In cases under paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) ... the tax shall not be paid by the fiduciary, but there shall be included in computing the net income of each beneficiary that part of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable year which, pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable to such beneficiary, whether distributed or not. ...'\n\n In the belief that these provisions warranted his action, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue increased the income shown on the petitioner's return by so much of the amount received as reflected the proportionate share of \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 38]\n\u00a0\n the depreciation deducted by the trustee in his fiduciary return, and determined a deficiency accordingly. The petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n In 1928, while the case was pending before the Board, the trustee, who had annually rendered income statements to the beneficiaries, but had filed no accounts as trustee, lodged in a California court having jurisdiction of the trust, an account for the period 1903-1028 and prayed its approval. Due notice of the proceeding was given the parties in interest. Certain remaindermen objected to the account, on the ground that the trustee had paid the entire income to beneficiaries without deducting and reserving proper amounts for depreciation and for capital losses sustained. The matter coming on for hearing the court sustained the objection concerning depreciation and overruled that as to capital losses; found the amounts which should have been reserved for depreciation; refused to surcharge the trustee, but decreed that the life beneficiaries ( including the estate of Louise P. V. Whitcomb) repay to the trustee the amounts which he should have withheld annually for depreciation. The sum fixed for the year 1921 was $43,003.16, which the Board of Tax Appeals has found was the correct amount, a pro rata share of which the petitioner had deducted from the reported income of Louise P. V. Whitcomb. Pursuant to this decree the petitioner repaid $10,700 to the trustee, which was more than petitioner's share of the required repayment for the year 1921. Since, however, Mrs. Whitcomb's estate owed additional amounts for each of the \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 39]\n\u00a0\n years 1913-1928 the balance was adjusted by a promissory note of her next of kin. Other beneficiaries also gave notes in settlement of amounts due the trustee.\n The Board of Tax Appeals reversed the Commissioner. \n3\n The state court's judgment was held conclusive of the fact that no part of the sums paid to the beneficiaries out of the amount required to be deducted by the trustee for depreciation belonged to them; and the conclusion was, therefore, that the amount distributable to the petitioner's decedent for 1921 was the income of the trust due her, less her proportionate share of the sum representing depreciation of the trust property.\n The Commissioner petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decision, and, after hearing, the court reversed the Board and sustained the Commissioner's ruling. \n4\n The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner insists the plain meaning of section 219 is that an income beneficiary of a trust shall pay tax, not on so much of the income as he actually receives, but on the amount he should properly have received in any tax year. His position is that if the amount of income properly 'distributable' to him is in excess of the amount paid, he must return and pay tax on the larger amount, irrespective of when in the future he may actually re- \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 40]\n\u00a0\n ceive the balance due him for the year in question. In this view the respondent concurs. But conversely, says the petitioner, if in any year the beneficiary is actually paid more than is properly distributable to him, he should not return and pay tax on the excess to which he was not entitled. The respondent disagrees with this proposition. If the question be decided in favor of the respondent we need go no further; but if in favor of the petitioner, we must inquire what are the criteria for determining whether the sum actually paid was in fact distributable. On this matter also the parties are in disagreement.\n\n 1. \nSection 219(a) declares that the income of estates and property held in trust is to bear the same tax as the income of individuals. The tax is measured by the gross income received by the fiduciary, less certain allowable deductions, as in the case of an individual. To clarify and emphasize this purpose it is stated that income received by a decedent's estate in course of administration, income to be accumulated for unborn or unascertained persons, income to be held for future distribution, income to be distributed periodically to beneficiaries, and income received by a guardian, to be held or distributed as the court may direct, is included in the taxable income of the estate or trust. Paragraphs (1) to (4).\n Subsection (b) puts upon the fiduciary the duty of making a return and directs what it shall contain. As respects income which is to be distributed periodically to beneficiaries the return is to include 'a statement of the income of the estate or trust which, pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable to each beneficiary, whether or not distributed before the close of the taxable year for which the return is made.'\n Subsection (c) requires the fiduciary to pay the tax on all net income of the estate or trust, save that which is \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 41]\n\u00a0\n distributable periodically, but subsection (d) directs, as respects the sort of income last mentioned, 'the tax shall not be paid by the fiduciary,' but in computing the income of each beneficiary there shall be included 'that part of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable year which pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable to such beneficiary, whether distributed or not. ...'\n Subsection (e) covers a case where the total income to be returned by a fiduciary is made up of two classes, as, e.g., a portion to be held and accumulated and a portion to be distributed periodically to beneficiaries. The fiduciary must then prepare his return as if he were required to pay the tax on the whole and enter 'as an additional deduction' (in addition, that is, to the usual deductions allowed all taxpayers by the other sections of the act) that part of the estate or trust income 'which, pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable during the (fiduciary's) taxable year to such beneficiary.' To remove all doubt of the intent of the act, a sentence is added to the effect that in such case each beneficiary's personal income shall include the portion of the trust's income which 'pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable' to him.\n Plainly the section contemplates the taxation of the entire net income of the trust. Plainly, also, the fiduciary, in computing net income, is authorized to make whatever appropriate deductions other taxpayers are allowed by law. The net income ascertained by this operation, and that only, is the taxable income. This the fiduciary may be required to accumulate, or, on the other hand, he may be under a duty currently to distribute it. If the latter, then the scheme of the act is to treat the amount so distributable, not as the trust's income, but as the beneficiary's. But as the tax on the entire net income of the trust \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 42]\n\u00a0\n is to be paid by the fiduciary or the beneficiaries or partly by each, the beneficiary's share of the income is considered his property from the moment of its receipt by the estate. This treatment of the beneficiary's income is necessary to prevent the possibility of postponement of the tax to a year subsequent to that in which the income was received by the trustee. If it were not for this provision the trustee might pay on part of the income in one year and the beneficiary on the remainder in a later year. For the purpose of imposing the tax the act regards ownership, the right of property in the beneficiary, as equivalent to physical possession. The test of taxability to the beneficiary is not receipt of income, but the present right to receive it. Clearly an overpayment to a beneficiary by mistake of law or fact, would render him liable for the taxable year under consideration, not on the amount paid, but on that payable. If the trustee should have deducted a sum for depreciation from the year's gross income before ascertaining the amount distributable to Mrs. Whitcomb and the other beneficiaries, but failed to do so, he paid her more than was properly distributable for the taxable year. Both the language used and its aptness to effect the obvious scheme for the division of tax between the estate and the beneficiary seem so plain as not to require construction. The administrative interpretation has been in accord with the meaning we ascribe to the section;6 and no decision to the contrary has been brought to our attention.\n The respondent suggests that income distributable within the meaning of the section is income which was reasonably regarded by the parties as distributable at the time it was distributed. We think such a construction would do violence to the plain import of the words used.\n The respondent relies on North American Oil Consoli- \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 43]\n\u00a0\n dated v. Burnet, \n286 \nU.S. 417\n, 52 S.Ct. 613. That case, however, involved the receipt of income in 1917 through a money award of a court. An appeal was taken and the award was not confirmed by the appellate court until 1922. The taxpayer's claim that the possibility of reversal shifted the receipt of the income to the later year was overruled. Section 219 had no bearing upon the question presented.\n\n 2. \nThe will of A. C. Whitcomb contains no direction and the statutes of California make no provision as to depreciation of trust assets. In the absence of either, the Circuit Court of Appeals thought the decision of the state court inconclusive in the administration of the federal Revenue Act, and interpreted the will according to the general law of trusts, which was held to forbid deductions from distributable income on account of depreciation, and to place upon the remaindermen the burden of any shrinkage of capital value of that nature. The petitioner challenges the ruling, insisting upon the binding force of the state court's decree. Obviously that decree had not the effect of res judicata, and could not furnish the basis for invocation of the full faith and credit clause of the federal Constitution in the present case. The petitioner, however, says that it furnishes the standard for the application of section 219, since the section plainly so declares; but even if this be not true, the decision settles the property rights of the beneficiaries which section 219 intended should be observed in distributing the burden of the tax.\n The first position is supported by citation of the language of subsection (d) that 'there shall be included in computing the net income of each beneficiary that part of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable year which, pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable to such beneficiary, whether distributed or not. ...' The decree of the state court is said to be the order governing distribu- \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 44]\n\u00a0\n tion of this estate. The respondent reads the language as making the terms of the trust instrument controlling where there is one, and resorting to an order only where there is no instrument governing payments of income; and he adverts to the language of section 219, subsec. (a)(4) exempting the fiduciary from returning 'income collected by a guardian of an infant to be held or distributed as the court may direct,' as explaining the use of the word 'order' in subsection (d) and rendering it applicable only to income collected by a guardian. But a moment's reflection will shown this is an error. The whole of a minor's income received by his guardian is taxable to the minor irrespective of its accumulation in the guardian's hands, distribution to the minor or payment for his support or education. This is the reason that a fiduciary in receipt of such income is not bound to return it as trust income. Either the minor or his guardian must make the return, but in either case it embraces all the income and is the minor's individual return, not that of the guardian or the trust. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The word 'order' must be given some meaning as applied to trust income which is to be distributed periodically; and we think it clear that the section intended that the order of the court having jurisdiction of the trust should be determinative as to what is distributable income for the purpose of division of the tax between the trust and the beneficiary. We understand the respondent to concede the binding force of a state statute, or a settled rule of property, followed by state courts, and, as well, an antecedent order of the court having jurisdiction of the trust, pursuant to which payments were made. But, if the order of the state court does in fact govern the distribution, it is difficult to see why, whether it antedated actual payment or was subsequent to that event, it should \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 45]\n\u00a0\n not be effective to fix the amount of the taxable income of the beneficiaries. We think the order of the state court was the order governing the distribution within the meaning of the Act.\n Moreover, the decision of that court, until reversed or overruled, establishes the law of California respecting distribution of the trust estate. It is none the less a declaration of the law of the state because not based on a statute, or earlier decisions. The rights of the beneficiaries are property rights and the court has adjudicated them. What the law as announced by that court adjudges distributable is, we think, to be so considered in applying section 219 of the Revenue Act of 1921\n\n\n The respondent suggests that the proceeding in the state court was a collusive one-collusive in the sense that all the parties joined in a submission of the issues and sought a decision which would adversely affect the Government's right to additional income tax. We cannot so hold, in view of the record in the state court which is made a part of the record here. The case appears to have been initiated by the filing of a trustee's account, in the usual way. Notice was given to the interested parties. Objections to the account were presented, and the matter came on for hearing in due course, all parties being represented by counsel. The decree purports to decide issues regularly submitted and not to be in any sense a consent decree. The court ruled against the remaindermen on one point, and in their favor on another-that here involved-but refused to surcharge the trustee, for reasons stated, and ordered repayment by the life tenants of overpayments of income consequent on the trustee's failure to withhold sums for a depreciation reserve.\n But, it is said, the life beneficiaries gave their notes for the indebtedness due by them to the trust, as determined by the state court, some of which were jointly executed \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 46]\n\u00a0\n by those who would take in remainder, and therefore these beneficiaries are permitted to retain and enjoy the full amounts distributed to them without reference to proper deductions for depreciation, and are therefore taxable thereon as income distributed.\n After the decree had been entered two of the life beneficiaries delivered their own notes to the trustee. One life beneficiary, who may become possessed of an interest in remainder, gave her note. Louise P. V. Whitcomb's daughter, a life beneficiary, executed her note, in which her two children, who are possible takers in remainder, joined. The notes were without interest, and were payable to the order of those who should be entitled in remainder at the termination of the trust. The persons so entitled are the descendants of the two children of the testator, per stirpes. What persons if any may fill this description is of course unknown. In the event of the failure of issue the ultimate remainder is to Harvard College.\n The parties evidently proceeded upon the theory that if the fund were restored to the trust it would be invested and the life beneficiaries would receive the income from it, and that a satisfactory settlement of the matter would be to have the life beneficiaries give their notes payable at the termination of the trust. At most this form of settlement amounted to a concession or gift on the part of the remaindermen to the life beneficiaries. Any advantage obtained by the latter through the adjustment was obviously not effected by the state court's decree, but by the voluntary action of the remaindermen. The decree was a judgment which fixed the rights of the remaindermen and the obligations of the life tenants. If the parties in interest chose to adjust these obligations in some manner other than by present payment of cash, their action in no wise altered the quality of the trustee's overpayments of income. We cannot seize on the form of \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 47]\n\u00a0\n the settlement made between the parties either to impugn the good faith and judicial character of the state court's decree, or to ignore the decree and its conclusiveness as to what was in fact and in law income distributable to the beneficiaries under the trust.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n I assume for present purposes that the duty of the trustee under the will of Mr. Whitcomb has been adjudicated without fraud or collusion by the Superior Court of California, and that the taxing officers of the United States as well as the parties to the accounting must govern themselves accordingly.\n I dissent from the conclusion that the effect of the adjudication is to diminish the taxable income of the life beneficiaries to the extent of the difference between the amount actually distributed and the amount that would have been distributed if the trustee had done his duty.\n By the decree in its first form, the court adjudged that the trustee was at fault in failing to make an annual reserve for depreciation for the years 1913 to 1927 inclusive, but also adjudged that he had acted in good faith after obtaining the advice of counsel, and should therefore be relieved of any personal liability. By the same decree the recipients of the income were directed to repay to the trustee the excess payments ( amounting in all to $622,440.90) 'by making, executing and delivering to said Trustee their respective promissory notes payable without interest at the termination of said trust to the order of the remaindermen under said trust as they may be determined at the time of the termination of said trust.'\n By an amended decree made the same day (September 19, 1928) the direction to make payment by the delivery of promissory notes was omitted, and the decree there \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 48]\n\u00a0\n upon stood as one commanding payment simply, without statement of the time or manner.\n The recipients of the income reverted at once to the method of payment prescribed by the original decree and did so with the approval of the trustee and the presumptive owners of the remainders. Charlotte A. Lepic, a daughter of the testator, and a life beneficiary made her promissory note for $305,867.06, payable without interest at the termination of the trust, and her two children, Napoleon and Charlotte, whose interest was solely as remaindermen, were co-makers with her. Louise Whitcomb, a daughter of a deceased son of the testator, made a note for $ 118,353.85, signing by her guardian. Her interest was partly that of a beneficiary, and partly as the presumptive owner of an estate in remainder. Lydia, whose interest was the same as that of Louise, made her note for a like amount. Marie, the widow of the deceased son, made her note for $69, 159.35. Her interest was in income only. All the notes were payable to the order of 'the remaindermen under the said trust as they may be determined to be' when the trust is at an end. All were without interest. The sum total of the notes is substantially equal to the total overpayments, except for $10,700, paid in cash by the administrator of the widow of the testator who died during the pendency of these proceedings. There is nothing to show that the cash was applied upon account of the overpayment due for the years covered by the assessment. In the absence of such evidence, the law appropriates the payment to the items first in point of time. The conclusion therefore follows that as to any overpayments made by the trustee during the years of the contested liability for taxes, the limit of any obligation now resting on the beneficiaries of the trust is the payment of these promissory notes to the \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 49]\n\u00a0\n persons entitled in remainder when the trust shall terminate.\n I assume in aid of the petitioner that an enforceable duty of repayment existing at the time of an assessment of a tax will call for the reduction of the taxable income to the same extent as if repayment has been actually made, though much can be said in support of another view. The existence of a duty is, however, an indispensable condition. If money distributed to a beneficiary is to be freed from taxation on the ground that though received and enjoyed, it will have to be returned, the recipient must make it plain that burden and benefit are exact equivalents. He must show that the effect of the fulfillment of the obligation to repay will be to cancel all the gain, and leave him in the same position as if the income had never been received.\n At the time of the review of these assessments by the Board of Tax Appeals, the California court had announced by its decree that the trustee had distributed to the beneficiaries more income than was due; but the presumptive owners of the remainders had exonerated the recipients from any duty of repayment until the end of the trust and then without interest upon moneys overpaid. In effect the act of the fiduciary had been adopted and confirmed to a proportionate extent. \n8\n Whether there was ratification or confirmation in a strict and narrow sense is not decisive of the controversy. The law of taxation is more concerned with the substance of economic opportunity than with classifying legal concepts, and tagging them with names and labels. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74. If the testator had stated in so many words that there should be no deduction for depreciation in distribut- \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 50]\n\u00a0\n ing the income, but that at the termination of the trust the beneficiaries would owe to the remaindermen without interest a sum equivalent to the deduction that would otherwise have been made, the result in its practical aspect would have been identical with the one achieved under this will through confirmation or consent. Here the parties by agreement have made their own rule, which relates back to the year when the income was received.\n To put the case in another way: the remaindermen might have signed an order before the income was paid over directing the trustee to make no deduction for depreciation of the trust. They did not do so then, but by relation backwards they did it afterwards. Without the aid of the agreement the decree of the California court would have imposed upon the trustee a duty to use diligent endeavor to collect without delay the moneys misapplied. Through the acceptance of these notes the presumptive owners of the remainders absolved him from that duty and thus confirmed his action. Consent or confirmation may supplement a will or deed of trust with the result that income 'distributed' will have become 'distributable' also. It may work a like result where the meaning of the instrument has been established by an 'order' of a court. The order is no more than evidence of pre-existing rights and duties. If the obligation to make restitution had been extinguished for all time, and the agreement extinguishing it had been proved to the assessing officers before the assessment became final, a court would listen with little patience to the taxpayer's complaint that a tax was not due because there had been an interval during which the money would have been reclaimable if the law had run its course. The situation is not different in principle where the benefits confirmed to the recipients of the income are something less than they would be if the duty to return had been extinguished altogether. \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 51]\n\u00a0\n For the benefits, though not complete, are not illusory or trivial. The Commissioner's assessment is supported by a presumption of correctness. If a taxpayer would overthrow it, he has the burden of proving it erroneous, and of fixing in dollars and cents the amount of the error. By the decision just announced, the taxpayer is relieved of that burden. He has received upon account of his taxable income an allowance of the face amount of an indebtedness payable in the future without deduction for the benefits resulting from the time and manner of the payment. How substantial those benefits are will be obvious if we let them pass before us in review.\n The beneficiaries, instead of restoring the overpaid income to the corpus of the estate, are permitted to retain it until the termination of the trust and to dispose of it as their own. They gain thereby the benefit of investing or consuming, with the opportunity for profit or enjoyment that goes along with such a privilege. If gain is derived, it is theirs without accountability to any one. If a loss ensues and the money is used up, a court of bankruptcy is open to them, in the event of their insolvency, to discharge the liability. At the making of the notes, their resources may have been adequate to enable them to restore what had been unlawfully obtained. At the time when the notes become due, they may find themselves without a dollar except their interest in the trust estate.\n But this does not exhaust the catalogue of benefits. In any reckoning of these, account must be taken of the relation of kinship between makers and payees. Except in remote contingencies the notes will be payable either to the children or descendants of the makers, or to the makers themselves. If the makers are dead at the termination of the trust, they will have had it in their power to write a clause into their wills requiring their descendants who elect to take under the wills to cancel any claim \n\n[291 U.S. 35, 52]\n\u00a0\n that has accrued upon the notes. If the makers are then alive, they will have put their names to notes that will be payable to themselves. There is grave doubt, to say the least, whether any one of them will ever have to pay a dollar.\n Up to this, attention has been confined to terms of the notes that have to do with the restitution of the principal. The postponement of payment of the principal was, however, accompanied by a provision that there should be no liability for interest. On its face this was a gain. The argument is made, however, that the gain is unreal for the reason that the overpayments, if restored, would be accretions to the corpus of the trust, and that the income on the accretions would be due to the same persons absolved from liability for interest. But this is only a part truth. The makers gained the difference between interest at the legal rate upon the principal of the notes and the lower rate of income likely to be earned by a trustee who invests the funds of a trust in conformity with law. What is even more important, they gained the privilege in the meantime of retaining for themselves what would otherwise be principal in the hands of the trustee and of using it as they pleased.\n These are important benefits. They would be unhesitatingly recognized as such by any investor or by any man of business. Some account should be taken of them before we say that the income of the trust was not income in the hands of the beneficiaries who received it as their own and who for all that appears may never come under a duty to pay it back to any one.\n I think the Court of Appeals did not err in upholding the assessment and that its decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1921, ch. 136,  219, 42 Stat. 246. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The propriety of taxing the full amount of the annual distributions of income in this estate in the years 1918-1920 was tested by certain of the beneficiaries.

RUFF(1934)\nNo. 663\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Archibald B. Lovett and Robert M. Hitch, both of Savannah, Ga ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas W. Hardwick, of Augusta, Ga., for respondent. \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ruff brought in a state court of Georgia this suit against Gay, as receiver of the Savannah & Atlanta Railway, appointed by the federal court for southern Georgia sitting in equity. The cause of action alleged is the homicide of plaintiff's minor son as a result of the negligent operation of a train by employees of the receiver. Before trial in the state court, the receiver duly filed in the appropriate federal court a petition for removal and certiorari, under the amendment made by Act of August 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532 to Judicial Code  33 (28 USCA  76), which inserted therein the clause: 'or against any officer of the courts of the United States for or on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance of his duties as such officer.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The federal court denied a motion to remand, (D.C.) 3 F.Supp. 264; and thereafter dismissed the suit, entering a \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n final judgment for want of prosecution. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that judgment, with direction to set aside the dismissal and remand the cause to the state court. 67 F.(2d) 684. Because of conflict of decisions,2 certiorari was granted to determine whether the amendment to Judicial Code  33 authorizes a receiver of a railroad appointed by a federal court sitting in equity to remove from a state court an action brought against him as receiver for damages resulting from the negligent operation of a train by his employees.\n First. The respondent raises the preliminary question whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The contention is that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review a judgment directing the remand to a state court, because Judicial Code  28 ( 28 USCA  71), declares: 'Whenever any cause shall be removed from any State court into any district court of the United States, and the district court shall decide that the cause was improperly removed, and order the same to be remanded to the State court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the district court so remanding such cause shall be allowed.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n This provision, enacted in 1887, was broadly construed by this Court as prohibiting review of an order of remand, directly or indirectly, by any proceeding. The prohibition was applied to appeals from, and writs of error to, the federal circuit (and later district) court; to writs of error to a state court after final judgment there; and to mandamus in this Court. \n4\n In German National Bank v. Speckert, \n181 \nU.S. 405, 409\n, 21 S.Ct. 688, where the trial court had refused to remand the case to the state court and the Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that judgment and ordered a remand, this Court held that it was without jurisdiction to review the latter's action. While adverting in support of its conclusion to the broad construction which had been given to the above- quoted prohibition, the Court ruled there that the fact that an order of remand is not a final judgment precluded its review by writ of error. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n But by reason of the extensive power to issue writs of certiorari which the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 18916 thereafter gave to this Court, it may now review the action to the circuit court of appeals in directing the remand of a cause to the state court. That Act provided that in any case in which the judgment of the circuit court of appeals is made final, 'it shall be competent for the Supreme Court to require, by certiorari or otherwise, any such case to be certified to the Supreme Court for its review and determination with the same power and authority in the case as if it had been carried by appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court.' In Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 512\n, 17 S.Ct. 665, it was held that the power given was unaffected by the condition of the case as it exists in the circuit court of appeals; that the power may be exercised before, as well as after, any decision by that court and irrespective of any ruling or determination therein; and that the sole essential of this Court's jurisdiction to review is that there be a case pending in the circuit court of appeals. The jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders was exercised in American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville, \n148 \nU.S. 372\n, 13 S.Ct. 758; Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 33 S.Ct. 657; Spiller v. Atchison, etc., R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 121\n, 40 S.Ct. 466; and Du Pont Powder Co. v. Masland, \n244 \nU.S. 100\n, 37 S.Ct. 575. And in The Three Friends, \n166 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 17 S.Ct. 495, 497, it was held that this Court could review a case pending in, and not yet decided by, the circuit court of appeals, with the same power and authority as if it had been carried here by appeal or writ of error 'that is, as if it had been brought directly from the district or the circuit court.' In Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. v. Willard, \n220 \nU.S. 413\n, 31 S.Ct. 460, decided under the \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n act of 1891, this Court, without questioning its power, reviewed the judgment of the circuit court of appeals reversing a judgment of dismissal and ordering a remand. Nor has the existence of the power been questioned by the Court since. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The contention that the removal is authorized rests upon the amendment made by the act of 1916 to Judicial Code  33. The argument for removal is that, since the receiver is an 'officer' of the federal court and an action for damages resulting from the negligent operation of a train by his employees is a suit 'for or on account of' an 'act done ... in the performance of his duties as such officer,' the removal here in question is directed in such plain words that there is no room for any other construction of the statute. But the amendment may not be isolated from its context. It must be read in the light of the then existing provisions of section 33; of the then existing statute conferring the right to bring in a state court suits against receivers; of the statute denying removal from state to federal courts of a large class of cases similar in character to that before us; and of other legislation restricting the jurisdiction of federal trial courts. When the clause is so read, there arises at least a doubt whether Congress intended to give to the words inserted in section 33 the comprehensive meaning attributed to them. That doubt makes it appropriate to examine the history of the amendment, Binns v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 24 S.Ct. 816; United States v. St. Paul, Minn. & Manitoba Ry., \n247 \nU.S. 310, 318\n, 38 S.Ct. 525. And such examination makes it clear that Congress did not authorize the removal of this case. \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 32]\n\u00a0\n Judicial Code  33 enables a defendant in a state court to remove the case before trial or final hearing there, and thus secure an adjudication by a federal court of first instance of the issues of fact as well as law involved in his justification under the federal statutes. Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 U.S. 257\n, 263. The origin of that section is section 3 of the 'Force Act,' March 2, 1833, c. 57, 4 Stat. 632, 633-the nation's reply to South Carolina's threat of 'nullification.' The purpose of the Force Act was to prevent paralysis of operations of the federal government. The special aim of section 3 was to protect those engaged in the enforcement of the federal revenue law from attack by means of prosecutions and suits in a state court for violation of state law. This removal provision was extended by Act of March 3, 1875, c. 130,  8, 18 Stat. 371, 401, to suits against 'any person for or on account of anything done by him while an officer of either House or Congress in the discharge of his official duty, in executing any order of such House.' These provisions only are embodied in Judicial Code  33.8 The scope of the section was thus \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 33]\n\u00a0\n limited to cases arising out of the enforcement of the revenue laws or of some order of either House of Congress. And it applied in those cases only when the person defending caused it to appear that his defense was that in doing the acts charged he was doing no more than his duty under those laws or orders. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n To appreciate the exceptional character of the removal privilege conferred by section 33, that section should be compared with section 28. Of the two, section 33 alone provides for removal of a criminal case. Removal of civil causes is provided for in both section 33 and section 28 of the Judicial Code. But the civil cases to which section 33 is applicable are few. While section 28 applies to many. Under the latter, any officer of a federal court can remove a suit brought against him on account of any act done under color of his office or in the performance of his duties as such officer, because section 28 applies to 'any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, ... of which the district courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction.' But in order to avail of the removal privilege conferred by section 28 in respect of a suit arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the facts showing that the suit is of \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 34]\n\u00a0\n that class must appear by the complaint in the state court;10 the amount in controversy must exceed $3,000, except in those cases where jurisdiction is conferred regardless of amount;11 the petition for removal must be filed in the state court before the time fixed for answer there; and it must be accompanied by a bond. On the other hand, where section 33 is applicable, the conditions for removal are much more liberal. Removal may be had of the civil suit, at any time before trial or final hearing12 in the state court, regardless of the amount involved and without giving any bond, by filing the appropriate papers in the federal court. \n13\n And the facts showing that the suit is of a removable class need not appear by the complaint in the state court.\n Third. The case here sought to be removed has none of the characteristics of those which were removable under Judicial Code  33 before the 1916 amendment. This suit is under the law of Georgia; and was brought as of right in the state court. Erb v. Morasch, \n177 \nU.S. 584\n, 20 S. Ct. 819. It does not relate to any operation of the federal government. The defendant receiver does not justify under any judgment or order of a federal court. Nor does the suit present otherwise any federal question. Its only relation to the federal law is that the receiver sued was appointed by a federal court, in the exercise of its diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. The fact that the defendant is a federal receiver does not make the cause removable 'upon the ground that it was a case arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' Gableman v. Peoria, Decatur & Evansville Ry. Co., \n179 \nU.S. 335\n, 21 S.Ct. 171, 172. \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 35]\n\u00a0\n If the amendment of 1916 is construed as merely affording the protection of removal to officers of the court engaged in executing its judgments or orders, it is strictly in pari materia with the other removal provisions of section 33. If it is construed so as to authorize removal of the case at bar, it introduces a wholly different ground of jurisdiction; in effect, repeals by implication legislation which deals expressly with suits against receivers; and departs from the established trend of legislation limiting the jurisdiction of the federal trial courts.\n I. Congress provided in 1887 that the fact that the defendant was a federal receiver should not preclude the maintenance of an action against him in a state court. \n14\n That provision had recently been embodied in section 66 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  125), which declares: 'Every receiver or manager of any property appointed by any court of the United States may be sued in respect of any act or transaction of his in carrying on the business connected with such property, without the previous leave of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed.'\n In the thirty-nine years since its enactment there had not been, so far as appears, any attempt to repeal that law. It is in harmony with the trend of legislation providing that the federal character of the litigant should not alone confer jurisdiction upon a federal court-a policy acted upon in case of national banks as early as 188215 and which had been extended in 1915 to railroads having federal charters. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 25, 36]\n\u00a0\n II. Congress had by the Federal Employers' Liability Act17 provided that suits for injuries resulting from negligence in the operation of a railroad, although arising under a federal statute, could be brought in a state court, and if so brought, could not be removed to the federal court.\n III. Congress had by recent legislation manifested its adherence to the policy, inaugurated in 1887, of restricting the jurisdiction of the federal trial court. Thus, the prescribed jurisdictional amount, which, after standing for nearly a century at $500 had been raised to $2,000 in 1887,18 and was increased to $3,000 in 1911.19 Moreover, in 1914 the requirement of this jurisdictional amount was \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 37]\n\u00a0\n applied to the removal of actions under the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) against railroads for injury to or loss of property, although theretofore federal courts had jurisdiction regardless of the amount in controversy. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. There is no expression in the Act of 1916, or in the proceedings which led to its enactment, of an intention to repeal any existing law or to depart from the long existing policy of restricting the federal jurisdiction. Whether there was any special occasion for the amendment does not appear. The bill was passed in each House as introduced, without amendment, without debate and without a record vote. \n21\n The legislation was not required in order to assure to officers of the federal courts when engaged in enforcing the laws or orders to which section 33 related the same protection which it then afforded to other persons. Marshals executing revenue laws had, for more than fifty-eight years, repeatedly availed themselves of this removal provision. \n22\n But an extension of the removal \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 38]\n\u00a0\n provision might have been desired so as to make it apply to those engaged in executing any judgment or order of a federal court. For any order of the court might arouse opposition to those engaged in enforcing it and result in retaliation by means of proceedings instituted in a state court. The only method of securing in such other cases an adjudication in the federal court before trial in the state court was then by habeas corpus; and that remedy was not always adequate. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n The report of the Judiciary Committee of the House which recommended the adoption of the 1916 amendment establishes that such was the sole purpose of Congress. It states:24\n'The purpose of the proposed amendment is to extend the provisions of section 33 uniformly to officers of the courts of the United States, not only in cases arising under the revenue laws, but in all cases, giving to them the same protection in all cases now given to officers acting under the revenue laws, and to officers of Congress. The omission of such a provision from the original act gives rise to certain incongruities and creates a want of uniformity in the application of the law; for example: A United States \n\n[292 U.S. 25, 39]\n\u00a0\n marshal engaged in the execution of a warrant or other process of the United States court, in a case which involves the prosecution of a violation of the revenue laws, is entitled to the right of removal, now conferred by this statute. (Davis v. S(outh) C(arolina), \n107 U.S. 597\n (2 S. Ct. 636) (1882). The same marshal engaged in executing process of the same court in which the revenue law is not involved is not entitled to the right of removal. This creates an anomalous condition which cannot be justified upon any line of reasoning.\n\n'The statute, with the proposed amendment, does not extend in any degree the jurisdiction or the powers of the courts of the United States. It merely provides a more orderly method of procedure, which enures as much, in fact more, to the benefit of the States than to the benefit of the United States, because it substitutes for the writ of habeas corpus the right of removal, so that instead of a summary discharge under the habeas corpus proceedings the amendment provides for trial before a court and jury.'\n\n The action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing the judgment of the District Court and directing that the cause be remanded to the state court was proper. A suit for damages for an injury resulting from negligent operation of a train is not, within the meaning of Judicial Code  33 as amended, a suit 'for or on account of any act done under color of his (the receiver's) office.' The receiver here sued, although an officer of the court operating the railroad pursuant to the order appointing him, is not an officer engaged in enforcing an order of a court. The operation of trains through his employees is a duty imposed upon the receiver; but he is not entrusted in his capacity as receiver with the service or execution of any process of the court.

Chicago & Alton R.R. Co. v. Wiswall, 23 Wall. 507, 509. By the act of 1875, express provision was made to review the remand by appeal or writ of error. That provision was repealed by Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373,  2, 24 Stat. 552, 553 (corrected by Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866,  2, 25 Stat. 433, 434, 435), which enacted the provision embodied in Judicial Code  28 (28 USCA  71). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Morey v.

Shattuck (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 485. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The contention made that the prohibition in section 28 does not extend to cases under section 33, because of the saving clause in section 5 of the acts of 1887 and 1888 (24 Stat. 555; 25 Stat. 436), appears to be unfounded. See Cole v. Garland (C.C.A.) 107 F. 759, dismissed on appeal, \n183 \nU.S. 693\n, 22 S.Ct. 933. Compare Kentucky v. Powers (C.C.) 139 F. 452, 593. Moreover, the saving clause of section 5 of the acts of 1887 and 1888 was in terms applicable to Revised Statutes  641, 642, 643; and those sections were repealed expressly by the Judicial Code. Their substance was carried into sections 31, 32, 33, respectively, of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  74-76); but section 5, though not expressly repealed, was nowhere carried into the Judicial Code. See, also, Index of Federal Statutes (1934), p. 1297, footnote 44, which states that by reason of the express repeal of sections 1-4, 6, 7, of the act of 1887 by the Judicial Code, 'Sec. 5 can have no force independent of the remainder of the act.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] March 3, 1891, c. 517,  6, 26 Stat. 826, 828. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 938, amending section 240(a) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  347(a), gives in terms the power to review by writ of certiorari 'either before or after a judgment or decree' of the lower court, 'with the same power and authority, and with the like effect, as if the cause had been brought there by unrestricted writ of error or appeal.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] There had been several other acts amending section 3 of the Force Act and section 643 of the Revised Statutes which embodied it. While section 3 of the act of 1833 provided in terms for removal where the suit is against 'any officer of the United States, or other person, for or on account of any act done under the revenue laws of the United States, or under colour thereof,' the title of the Act referred only to collection of duties on imports. Doubtless, for this reason, it was deemed desirable in the Internal Revenue Act of June 30, 1864, c. 173,  50, 13 Stat. 241, to extend the operation of the 1833 Act in terms to internal revenue officers and those acting under the internal revenue laws. Compare Hornthall v. Collector, 9 Wall. 560, 561. By Act of July 13, 1866, c. 184 ,  68, 14 Stat. 98, 172, that provision was repealed; and by section 67 of the same Act this removal provision was made available to any officer acting under the internal revenue laws or 'against any person acting under or by authority of any such officer.' By Act of February 28, 1871, c. 99,  16, 16 Stat. 433, 438, the provision was extended to those engaged in enforcing laws for the protection of the elective franchise. In Revised Statutes,  643, this provision appears; but by Act of February 8, 1894, c. 25, 28 Stat. 36, most of title 26 of the Revised Statutes (section 2002 et seq.) relating to elective franchises was repealed and with it that part of section 643 relating to the elective franchise.\n It was held in Maryland v.

As far as appears there were no hearings before the subcommittee or the committee. It was placed on the Calendar For Unanimous Consent and passed without debate or record vote. 53 Cong. R., 9442. In the Senate it went through substantially the same course. The calendar of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate shows no record of a hearing.

Any receiver or manager who shall \n\n[293 U.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n willfully violate any provision of this section shall be fined not more than $3,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.'\n\n The District Court, Southern District of California, in a cause instituted there for the purpose of conserving the assets of Western Oil & Refining Company and giving opportunity for reorganization, appointed petitioner, Gillis, receiver, April 4, 1931. Immediately after assuming the duties of the office, as required by the local statutes, he procured license and executed bond with the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland as surety. Thereafter he carried on the business of the company- manufacturing, refining, producing, and distributing gasoline-and co- operated with creditors and stockholders concerning reorganization plans.\n In 1933 the Fidelity & Deposit Company refused to continue upon the bond after a specified day. Petitioner endeavored to find another acceptable surety. Failing in this, he reported the circumstances to the court; pointed out his inability to comply with the local statutes; and stated that, unless the business could continue substantially as theretofore, the purpose of the receivership would be frustrated. He asked authority to proceed without bond or license; otherwise, he affirmed, final liquidation at material loss to all concerned would be necessary. The Attorney General, speaking for the state, objected. The court ordered and directed petitioner 'to continue his operations as such Receiver ( including the production, distribution and sale of gasoline or motor vehicle fuel in the State of California) after termination of the hereinbefore mentioned bond, or withdrawal therefrom of the surety thereon, for the payment of gasoline taxes ... without any such bond or the giving of security in any other manner for the payment of such gasoline taxes and without any license. ...' \n\n[293 U.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held section 65 of Judicial Code (28 USCA  124) applicable and controlling, and reversed the challenged order. The result we think is correct; the judgment must be affirmed.\n While the precise point now presented does not seem to have been definitely decided, the power of Congress to prescribe duties and obligations of receivers has been often recognized.

(D.C.) 286 F. 425, 428; Crawford v. Duluth St. R. Co. (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 212, 214.\n There is no suggestion of repugnance between the state Constitution and the motor vehicle fuel statute. And the latter must be accepted as valid law of the state within the ambit of section 65, Judicial Code (28 USCA  124), unless its provisions conflict with the constitution or laws of the United States.\n Petitioner insists that there is such disagreement, since the state statute diminishes the power of the United States District Court to direct its receiver to operate the business of the company. Also because, by requiring bond to secure taxes, the statute creates an unlawful preference of state over the United States in respect of collections. And finally because, in the circumstances here presented, it is impossible for the receiver to comply with the prescribed requirements; and, unless relieved from them, he 'must cease receivership operations that are essential to the conservation of assets and the general purposes of the receivership.' \n\n[293 U.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n Manifestly the diminution, if any, of powers possessed by District Courts prior to its enactment, results from section 65, Judicial Code. The ultimate inquiry is whether Congress can withhold from District Courts the power to authorize receivers in conservation proceedings to transact local business, contrary to state statutes obligatory upon all others.\n That Congress has such power we think is clear, and the language of section 65 leaves no doubt of its exercise.\n The accepted doctrine is that the lower federal courts were created by the acts of Congress, and their powers and duties depend upon the acts which called them into existence, or subsequent ones which extend or limit. Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510; Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 327\n, 24 S.Ct. 665. Whatever may be the inherent power of a court incident to a grant of jurisdiction, Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 43, 66\n, 45 S.Ct. 18, 35 A.L.R. 451, there seems no ground whatever for saying that Congress cannot withhold or withdraw from courts of equity the right to empower receivers in conservation proceedings to disregard local statutes.\n The suggestion that to require petitioner to observe local laws would give the state inequitable priority over the United States as to taxes lacks merit. If any such result should follow, it would accompany permissive action of Congress.\n And, if the receiver cannot continue to carry on the Company's business according to the plain direction of Congress, he must pursue some other course permitted by law.\n The same statute which required receivers to observe the laws of the state, gave permission to sue them in state courts under stated circumstances. It was enacted more than forty years ago, and seems to have been commonly regarded as within congressional authority. \n\n[293 U.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n We are not dealing here with the acknowledged power of courts to protect property in their custody.

The commission had approved the agreement, respondent paid the premiums necessary to keep it in force, and in all respects complied with the law. Petitioner was injured while he and respondent were engaged in intrastate commerce.\n The complaint alleges that his injuries were caused by respondent's failure to comply with the Safety Appliance Acts (45 USCA  1 et seq.), in that cars which he, with other members of his crew, was attempting to couple were not equipped with couplers that would couple automatically by impact, thereby making it necessary for him to go between the ends of the cars where he was caught and injured. In addition to a denial of the violation of the statutes, respondent's answer sets up the election to be bound by the state Compensation Act. The court held that the agreement was not sufficient to constitute a defense, and struck out that part of the answer. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for petitioner. The court of appeals reversed and gave final judgment in favor of the respondont, 'for the reason that the acceptance and notice of election by the employee contract approved by the Industrial Commission of Ohio is a complete bar to a right \n\n[292 U.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n of recovery in this action.' In the state Supreme Court, the judges being equally divided in opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.\n As the petitioner when injured was not engaged in interstate commerce, the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) does not apply, and the question is whether the agreement of the parties, in pursuance of the Ohio statute, is repugnant to the Federal Safety Appliance Acts.\n Unless excluded by congressional enactment under the commerce clause, state law governs the respective liabilities and rights of railroad carriers and their employees growing out of injuries suffered by the latter whether in interstate or intrastate commerce. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 54\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S .) 44. The power conferred upon the Congress is such that when exerted it excludes and supersedes state legislation in respect of the same matter. But Congress may so circumscribe its regulation as to leave a part of the subject open to state action. Atlantic Coast Line v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 290\n, 34 S.Ct. 829. Cf. Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n272 \nU.S. 605\n, 47 S.Ct. 207. The purpose exclusively to regulate need not be specifically declared. New York Central R.R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147\n, 37 S.Ct. 546. L.R.A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139. But ordinarily such intention will not be implied unless, when fairly interpreted, the federal measure is plainly inconsistent with state regulation of the same matter. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170.\n The Safety Appliance Acts govern common carriers by railroad engaged in interstate commerce. The act of 1893 applied only to vehicles used by them in moving interstate traffic. 45 U.S.C.  2 (45 USCA  2). Its requirements were by the act of 1903 extended to all their vehicles. Id.,  8 (45 USCA  8); Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 32 S. Ct. 2; Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 205\n, 54 S. Ct. 402. So far as the safety equipment of such vehicles is concerned, these acts operate to exclude state regulation whether consistent, \n\n[292 U.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n complementary, additional, or otherwise. Prigg v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617; Southern Ry. Co. v. R.R. Commission of Indiana, \n236 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 35 S.Ct. 304; International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 49 S.Ct. 108. The imposition of penalties (Id.,  6, 45 USCA  6) and abrogation of assumption of risk (Id.,  7 (45 USCA  7) are measures for enforcement.\n A violation of the acts is a breach of duty owed to an employee, whether he is at the time engaged in interstate or in intrastate commerce. And by abolishing assumption of risk the acts impliedly recognize the right to recover for injuries resulting therefrom. But the absence of a declaration similar to that in the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), which denounces contracts and other arrangements made for the purpose of exempting carriers from liability created by that act (45 USCA  55 (45 USCA  55)), strongly suggests a lack of legislative purpose to create any cause of action therefor. Moreover, if there had been such purpose, Congress probably would have included provisions in respect of venue, jurisdiction of courts, limitations, measure of damages, and beneficiaries in case of death.\n Petitioner cites language in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 41\n, 36 S.Ct. 482. But that case is not in point on the question under consideration in this case. There we were called upon to decide whether a railroad employee engaged in intrastate commerce upon the line of an interstate carrier was within the protection of the Safety Appliance Acts. We held that he was. The opinion supports our recent construction of these acts that, while they prescribe the duty, the right to recover damages sustained by the injured employee through the breach 'sprang from the principle of the common law' and was left to be enforced accordingly, or in case of death 'according to the applicable statute.' Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., supra, \n291 \nU.S. 205\n, 54 S.Ct. 402, 406; Minneapolis, St. Paul & S.S.M. Ry. v. Popplar, \n237 \nU.S. 369, 372\n, 35 S.Ct. 609. These acts do not create, \n\n[292 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n prescribe the measure, or govern the enforcement of, the liability arising from the breach. They do not extend to the field occupied by the State Compensation Act. There is nothing in the agreement repugnant to them.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2, Act of March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C.  2 (45 USCA  2).

UNITED STATES(1934)\nNo. 419\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederic L. Ballard, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel W. Cooper, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this suit in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania to recover on a bond given by petitioner, as surety, to secure the performance of a government construction contract as provided by the Heard Act, which requires the contractor to furnish a surety bond to the government as obligee, conditioned upon satisfactory performance of the contract and payment by the contractor for labor and material furnished by subcontractors for the construction. Act of August 13, 1894, 28 Stat. 278, as amended. Act of February 24, 1905, 33 Stat. 811, and March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1167, 40 USCA  270. In authorizing suits on the bond, the Heard Act provides:\n'If no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of said contract, then the person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials shall ... have a right of action: ... Provided, That ... it ... shall be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of said contract, and not later. ...'\n\n The contract was for materials for use in the construction of an irrigation project, and was entered into on behalf of the United States by the Department of the Interior under the provisions of the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, 389, 43 USCA  391, 419. By letter of June 16, 1927, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior forwarded the claim of the contractor to the General Accounting Office 'for direct settlement,' by a letter which stated that the contract had been completely performed and that, after deducting a stipulated amount as liquidated damage for delay in performance, the balance due was $ 8,889.30. The letter concluded: 'The claim has received administrative examination, is approved for $8,889.30 and I recommend that the amount found due be paid' from a designated ap- \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n propriation. Four months later, on October 26, 1927, the General Accounting Office issued its formal certificate of settlement confirming the balance found due by the Department of the Interior. The claim was paid by the Treasurer of the United States on November 5, 1927\n\n\n The defense to the present suit on the bond was that it had been begun October 17, 1928, more than one year after performance and final settlement of the contract. The sole question presented is whether 'final settlement,' within the meaning of the Heard Act, was effected by the action of the Interior Department of June 16, 1927, or only by the certificate of the General Accounting Office of October 26th. Judgment for the petitioner by the District Court was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 66 F.(2d) 302, which held that the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 23, 31 USCA  41 et seq., had transferred the authority to make settlements of such contracts from the Department of the Interior to the General Accounting Office, that consequently final settlement did not occur until the action of the General Accounting Office upon the contractor's claim, and that the suit brought within a year was in time. Certiorari was granted. \n290 \nU.S. 618\n, 54 S.Ct. 100, 78 L.Ed. --, to resolve an alleged conflict between this decision and that in Consolidated Indemnity & Insurance Co. v. W. A. Smoot & Co. (C.C.A.) 57 F.( 2d) 995; compare Lambert Lumber Co. v. Jones Engineering & Construction Co . (C.C.A.) 47 F.(2d) 74.\n The Budget and Accounting Act set up the General Accounting Office under the direction of the Comptroller General of the United States. Section 301, 31 USCA  44, transferred to it the powers and duties of the Comptroller of the Treasury and of the six Auditors of the Treasury Department, and authorized the heads and disbursing officers of executive departments to apply for the decision of the General Accounting Office upon any question involving a payment to be made by them, which de- \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n cision, it is declared, shall govern such office in passing upon the account. And by section 305, 31 USCA  71, it is provided that 'all claims and demands whatever by the Government of the United States or against it ... shall be settled and adjusted in the General Accounting Office.' But none of these duties imposed on the Comptroller General were new. Like provisions applicable to the Comptroller of the Treasury or the Auditors of the Treasury Department are found in section 8 of the Act of July 31, 1894, 28 Stat. 207 (31 USCA  74), and in Rev. St.  236. The chief change effected by the Budget and Accounting Act was that it transferred powers lodged with officers of the Treasury Department to the Comptroller General and made his office independent of the executive branch of the government. But the function which he exercises in auditing and settling claims against the government is precisely that which was previously exercised by the Accounting Office in the Treasury Department. Before, as after the Budget and Accounting Act, claims against the United States might be paid from the proper appropriation upon approval of the authorized officer of the department concerned, without previous settlement or audit by the accounting office. Before, as after, department heads or disbursing officers might ask the accounting office to rener a decision upon a question involving payment to be made by them, in order to protect the disbursing officers and their bondsmen from liability for a payment unauthorized by law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act this Court had decided Illinois Surety Co. v. United States, to Use of Peeler, \n240 \nU.S. 214\n, 36 S.Ct. 321. There the Treasury Department had directed that a voucher be issued for the balance which it found to be due upon a contract entered into with the department for the construction of a public building. The Treasury Auditors apparently did not pass upon the claim before payment. The issue presented was whether suit by a subcontractor upon a bond given under the Heard Act was premature when begun six months after the date of the department's determination, but less than six months after payment. It was held that it was not; that the term 'final settlement' in the Heard Act was not intended to denote payment, but had been used to describe an administrative determination of the amount due upon completion of the contract. Similar determinations made by other departments before the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act have repeatedly been held to constitute final settlement within the meaning of the Heard Act. Pederson v. United States, for Use of Washington Iron Works (C.C.A.) 253 F. 622; United States, for Use of R. Haas Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co. (C.C.A.) 254 F. 958; Mandel v. United States to Use of Wharton & N.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 4 F.(2d) 629; Antrim Lumber Co. v. Hannan (C.C.A.) 18 F.(2d) 548.\n In the light of this history we cannot say that Congress, merely by transferring the function previously performed by the Treasury to the General Accounting Office, intended to disturb this construction of the statute or to make final administrative determinations in the executive departments any the less final settlements within the meaning of the Heard Act than they had been before. Consolidated Indemnity & Insurance Co. v. W. A. Smoot & Co., supra. \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n Respondent does not directly challenge this conclusion. It does not assert that the General Accounting Office can alone make a final settlement of a government contract, or deny that in some circumstances the authorized officer of the department concerned may make it, but it insists that where, as in this case, the claim, in advance of payment, is referred to the General Accounting Office, its decision alone is controlling, and is therefore the final settlement which, under the Heard Act, fixes the period within which suit by a subcontractor may be brought.\n It is true, as respondent points out, that the question thus raised is different from that involved in the earlier cases, where payment preceded audit by the accounting office, and from that in the Peeler Case. The contract in the Peeler Case was under the administrative control of the Treasury Department, and, when that case arose and was decided, the power to settle contracts, now lodged with the Comptroller General, was in the Treasury Department. Thus the question presented there was not whose was the authority to make the final settlement, but at what stage the decision of the department, authorized to make it, became final. Here the question is whether the decision of the Comptroller General supplanted that of the Department of the Interior, which concededly would have been a final settlement if there had been no action by the Comptroller General before payment. This question must be resolved in view of the purpose sought to be accomplished by the Heard Act and of the administrative procedure for the settlement, auditing and payment of claims against the government.\n The Heard Act relates only to bonds given as surety for those entering into contracts for the construction of public buildings or works. It serves the dual purpose of securing to the United States the protection of a surety \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n bond conditioned upon the performance of the contract, and of protecting those who furnish labor or material to the contractor by the further condition that the contractor shall pay for such labor and material. The statute provides that subcontractors may intervene in any suit brought on the bond of the government, but, if the government does not bring suit, it makes the time of completion and final settlement of the contract the crucial date for measuring the period within which subcontractors are permitted to bring suit on the bond.\n The policy of the statute to afford protection to the interests of laborers and materialmen would not be effected unless they were allowed to bring suit with reasonable promptness after the United States has determined that it will have no claim on the bond and unless the date of final settlement which fixes the time within which suit is permitted could be ascertained with reasonable certainty and finality. A determination, made and recorded in accordance with established administrative practice by the administrative officer or department having the contract in charge, that the contract has been completed and that the final payment is due, fulfills these requirements. See Illinois Surety Co. v. United States, to Use of Peeler, supra. Such was the determination made here by the Interior Department, which alone was in possession of the knowledge and data necessary to prompt decision. The department, in forwarding the claim, made every determination prerequisite to payment. See Illinois Surety Co. v. United States, to Use of Peeler, supra; Mandel v. United States, supra. It declared that the contract had been completely performed; it stated the balance due after deducting the stipulated amount for liquidated damages for delay; it declared that the claim had received administrative examination and \n\n[291 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n was approved for the balance found due; and it recorded its findings. Such a determination would be 'final settlement' for purposes of the Heard Act if payment had preceded action by the Comptroller General. Consolidated Indemnity & Insurance Co. v. W. A. Smoot & Co., supra. If, as respondent maintains, this determination may be supplanted by a subsequent settlement by the Comptroller General, the subcontractors could never be certain that the departmental determination would mark the period of limitation, and suits begun within the statutory period measured from this determination might have to be discontinued and begun anew if the departmental head or disbursing officer should later refer the claim to the Comptroller General. A construction so out of harmony with administrative practice, so inconvenient in operation, and so inconsistent with the obvious purpose of the statute is not to be entertained.\n No such consequences either to the government or to subcontractors can result from treating the departmental settlement as the final one within the meaning of the Heard Act. There is no more occasion for delaying suit on the bond because of the contingency that the departmental determination may not be approved by the Comptroller General in his auditing of the accounts than because of the contingency that any administrative determination may not be approved by the courts. See Illinois Surety Co. v. United States, to Use of Peeler, supra, \n240 \nU.S. 221\n, 36 S.Ct. 321; Consolidated Indemnity & Insurance Co. v. W. A. Smoot & Co., supra, 57 F.(2d) 997.\n A different question would be presented if the department concerned declined to settle the claim and referred it to the General Accounting Office for settlement. See Lambert Lumber Co. v. Jones Engineering & Construction Co., supra.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The history, procedure, and function of the Accounting Office of the Treasury before 1921 and of the General Accounting Office are discussed in detail in Smith, The General Accounting Office (Institute for Government Research, Service Monograph No. 46); Willoughby, The Legal Status and Functions of the General Accounting Office (Institute for Government Research, Studies in Administration).

Green, of Jackson, Miss., for appellee.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellee brought this suit in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking to enjoin state officers from proceeding to assess its property for the years 1927 to 1931, inclusive, upon the ground that the proposed assessments would impair the obligation of a contract by which the company had secured an exemption from taxation. Chapter 138, Laws of Mississippi of 1922, and chapter 172, Laws of 1926. The challenged proceedings were taken pursuant to a statute which authorized assessments in cases where it was ascertained that in past years property had escaped taxation. See chapter 214, Laws of 1928; chapter 291, Laws of 1932; Mississippi Code of 1930,  3226 and 6992; Code Supp. 1933,  3204, 3208. It appeared that on April 14, 1933, at the instance of the state tax collector, the state tax commission had made assessments of appellee's property for prior years, subject, however, to objections to be made and filed with the commission on or before May 23, 1933. Appellee, instead of availing itself of that opportunity, filed its bill in this suit on May 16, 1933\n\n\n The District Judge, on an application for an interlocutory injunction, considering section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) to be applicable, called to his assistance two other judges, and the District Court, as thus composed, granted an injunction restraining defendants from approving and enforcing the proposed assessments. Motions to dismiss \n\n[292 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n the bill for want of equity were denied. An agreed statement of facts was filed and on final hearing the District Court of three judges made the injunction permanent. The court stated in its findings that it had been agreed that the assessment order would certainly be made final.\n No substantial question was presented as to the validity of the statute authorizing assessments of property which had escaped taxation. The statute did not specify the property of appellee and authorized assessments only of property that was taxable.\n A mere assessment is not a statute or an order of an administrative board or commission within the meaning of section 266 of the Judicial Code ( 28 USCA  380). Ex parte Williams, \n277 \nU.S. 267, 272\n, 48 S.Ct. 523. The decision in City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24\n, 54 S.Ct. 259 (January 8, 1934), is not to the contrary. Hence, there was no occasion for constituting a court of three judges. As the case was not one within section 266, the merits cannot be brought to this court by a direct appeal. Compare Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 389\n, 391 S., 47 S.Ct. 385; Healy v. Ratta, \n289 \nU.S. 701\n, 53 S.Ct. 522. But, although the merits cannot be reviewed here in such a case, this Court by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction in cases of decrees purporting to be entered pursuant to section 266, necessarily has jurisdiction to determine whether the court below has acted within the authority conferred by that section and to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitations which that section imposes. The case is analogous to those in which this Court, finding that the court below has acted without jurisdiction, exercises its appellate jurisdiction to correct the improper action. Assessors v. Osborne, 9 Wall. 567, 575; Mansfield, C. & L.M. Railway Company v. Swan, \n111 U.S. 379\n, 378-389, 4 S.Ct. 510; Union & Planters' Bank v.

The section makes it unlawful for a transportation com- \n\n[291 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n pany to bring to the United States 'any immigrant who does not have an unexpired immigration visa.' The alien was a 'nonquota immigrant' within the definition of the statute. Id., section 4(b), 8 U.S.C. 204(b), 8 USCA  204(b). If it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that 'any immigrant has been so brought,' the transportation company must pay to the collector of customs the sum of $1,000, and in addition, for the benefit of the immigrant, an amount equal to that paid for his transportation. Section 16 further provides that 'such sums shall not be remitted or refunded' unless the Secretary of Labor is satisfied that it could not have been ascertained, with reasonable diligence, that the person so transported was an immigrant.\n Plaintiff insists that the admission of the alien took the case out of the statute. Section 16 makes no such excep- \n\n[291 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n tion. But plaintiff invokes section 13 of the Act of 1924 (Id., 8 U.S.C.  213 (8 USCA  213))2 which, after providing generally in subdivision (a) for the exclusion of an immigrant who is without an unexpired immigration visa, creates a particular exception in subdivision (b) to meet the case of immigrants 'who have been legally admitted to the United States and who depart therefrom temporarily.' Immigrants of that sort may be admitted to the United States 'without being required to obtain an immigration visa.' The exception is limited. It applies only 'in such classes of cases and under such conditions as may be by regulations prescribed.' Acting under this authority, regulations were prescribed, which provided for the admission of such im- \n\n[291 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n migrants without an immigration visa, but only in case they obtained a permit to reenter under the provisions of section 10 of the Act of 1924. Id., 8 U.S.C.  210 (8 USCA  210).3 In authorizing such permits, the evident purpose of section 10 was to enable aliens who were domiciled here and contemplated a temporary absence, to equip themselves with evidence which would identify them and facilitate their reentry. They could thus avoid the trouble and delay incident to the procuring of an immigration visa from a consulate abroad. \n4\n The permit is prima facie evidence of the fact that the alien is returning from a temporary visit. The regulations prescribed under section 10 and section 13(b) except \n\n[291 U.S. 420, 425]\n\u00a0\n aliens who have such permits from the requirement that an immigration visa must be obtained. See Immigration Rules of March 1, 1927; Rule 3, subdiv. F, pars. 1, 3; subdiv. I, par. 2. Valid permits may be presented 'in lieu of immigration visas.' Executive Order No. 4813 of February 21, 1928\n\n\n These provisions should be read in connection with section 16. And as they make the possession of a permit to re-enter the equivalent of an unexpired visa, the permit should be taken to stand in place of the visa required by section 16. In this view, where the returning alien has the prescribed permit, no fine can be imposed. This conclusion, however, gives gives no aid to plaintiff, as the alien in the instant case had neither visa nor permit. We are unable to agree with the contention that, where a permit will suffice, section 16 must be regarded as having no application. As we have said, we think the proper construction of section 16, taken with section 13, is that the permit is merely a substitute for the visa and satisfies the requirement.\n Plaintiff's argument that under section 13 a discretion is vested in the Secretary of Labor to admit the returning alien, and that the exercise of that discretion in his favor tolls the fine, is met by the provision of subdivision (f) of section 13 (8 USCA  213(f): 'Nothing in this section shall authorize the remission or refunding of a fine, liability to which has accrued under section 16 (section 216 of this title).' Plaintiff urges that if the alien is admitted, no liability for the fine can be said to have 'accrued.' But section 16 does not make the liability turn upon the admissibility or admission of the alien. Whatever may have been the effect of prior statutory provisions, section 16 of the Act of 1924 makes it clear that the occasion for the fine is the bringing in of the alien without an unexpired visa or that which is prescribed as an equivalent. The question whether the Secretary of Labor had authority to admit the alien in this instance need not be considered, for if it were assumed that the Secretary under \n\n[291 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n section 13 could admit the alien in his discretion, the fine would still stand. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in the view that section 13(f) 'preserves the fine against any discretionary admission.'\n Equally unavailing is the plea that the fine, as prescribed, is indivisible, and hence that no fine whatever can be imposed where the alien is admitted and the transportation company, for that reason, has not been required to return the passage money. It is true that the requirement of the payment of the passage money is for the benefit of the alien and the reason for that part of the penalty disappears on the alien's admission. But although admission in certain cases is contemplated by section 13, liability to fine under section 16 is none the less maintained. We think it follows that, in a case of admission, the fine of $1,000 can legally be imposed without requiring payment of the passage money and the fact that the latter has not been required gives plaintiff no ground for complaint.\n Plaintiff was charged with knowledge of the statute and brought in the alien in violation of its provisions. Compare Elting v. North German Lloyd, \n287 \nU.S. 324, 328\n, 329 S., 53 S.Ct. 164. The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section provides:\n'Sec. 16.

REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIF.(1934)\nNo. 55\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Beardsley, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Gregory Hankin, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John U. Calkins, Jr., of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees. \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under  237(a), Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a), from a judgment of the highest court of California sustaining a state law that requires students at its University to take a course in military science and tactics, the validity of which was by the appellants challenged as repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n The appellants are the above-named minors and the fathers of each as his guardian ad litem and individually. They are taxpayers and citizens of the United States and of California. Appellees are the regents constituting a corporation created by the state to administer the University, its president, and its provost. Appellants applied to the state Supreme Court for a writ of mandate compelling appellees to admit the minors into the University as students. So far as they are material to the questions presented here, the allegations of the petition are:\n In October, 1933, each of these minors registered, became a student in the University, and fully conformed to all its requirements other than that compelling him to take the course in military science and tactics in the Reserve Officers Training Corps which they assert to be an integral part of the military establishment of the United States and not connected in any way with the militia or military establishment of the state. The primary object of there establishing units of the training corps is to qualify students for appointment in the Officers Reserve \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n Corps. The courses in military training are those prescribed by the War Department. The regents require enrollment and participation of ablebodied male students who are citizens of the United States. These courses include instruction in rifle marksmanship, scouting and patrolling, drill and command, musketry, combat principles, and use of automatic rifles. Arms, equipment, and uniforms for use of students in such courses are furnished by the War Department of the United States government.\n These minors are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church and of the Epworth League and connected religious societies and organizations. For many years their fathers have been ordained ministers of that church. The Southern California Conference at its 1931 session adopted a resolution:\n'With full appreciation of the heroic sacrifices of all those who have conscientiously and unselfishly served their country in times of war, but with the belief that the time has come in the unfolding light of the new day for the settlement of human conflicts by pacific means, and because we as Christians owe our first and supreme allegiance to Jesus Christ. Because the Methodist Episcopal Church in her General Conference of 1928 has declared: 'We renounce war as an instrument of national policy.' Because our nation led the nations of the world in signing the Paris Peace Pact, and the Constitution of the United States, Article 6, Section 2, provides that: 'This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made under authority of the United States shall be the Supreme Law of the Land'. Thus making the Paris Pact the supreme law of the land which declares: 'The high contracting parties agree that the settlement of all disputes or conflict-shall never be sought except by pacific means.' \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n 'Therefore we, the Southern California Conference, memorialize the General Conference which convenes in Atlantic City in May, 1932; to petition the United States Government to grant exemption from military service to such citizens who are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, as conscientiously believe that participation in war is a denial of their supreme allegiance to Jesus Christ.'\n\n And in 1932 the General Conference of that church adopted as a part of its tenets and discipline:\n'We hold that our country is benefited by having as citizens those who unswervingly follow the dictates of their consciences ... Furthermore, we believe it to be the duty of the churches to give moral support to those individuals who hold conscientious scruples against participation in military training or military service. We petition the government of the United States to grant to members of the Methodist Episcopal Church who may be conscientious objectors to war the same exemption from military service as has long been granted to members of the Society of Friends and other similar religious organizations. Similarly we petition all educational institutions which require military training to excuse from such training any student belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church who has conscientious scruples against it. We earnestly petition the government of the United States to cease to support financially all military training in civil educational institutions.'\n\n And the Southern California Conference at its 1933 session adopted the following:\n'Reserve Officers' Training Corps-Recalling the action of the General Conference asking for exemption from military service for those members of our church to whom war and preparation for war is a violation of conscience, we request the authorities of our State Universities at Berkeley, Los Angeles and Tucson, to exempt Methodist students from the R. O.T.C. on the grounds of conscien- \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n tious objection, and we hereby pledge the moral and official backing of this Conference, seeking such exemption, provided that it be understood that no conscientious objector shall participate in the financial profits of war. The Secretary of the Conference is asked to send copies of this paragraph to the governing boards of these institutions.'\n\n Appellants as members of that church accept and feel themselves morally, religiously, and conscientiously bound by its tenets and discipline as expressed in the quoted conference resolutions; each is a follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ; each accepts as a guide His teachings and those of the Bible, and holds as a part of his religious and conscientious belief that war, training for war, and military training are immoral, wrong, and contrary to the letter and spirit of His teaching and the precepts of the Christian religion.\n Therefore these students at the beginning of the fall term in 1933 petitioned the University for exemption from military training and participation in the activities of the training corps, upon the ground of their religious and conscientious objection to war and to military training. Their petition was denied. Thereupon, through that church's bishop in California, they and their fathers petitioned the regents that military training be made optional in order that conscientious and religious objectors to war, training for war, and military training might not be confronted with the necessity of violating and foreswearing their beliefs or being denied the right of education in the State University to which these minors are entitled under the Constitution and laws of the state of California and of the United States.\n The regents refused to make military training optional or to exempt these students. Then, because of their religious and conscientious objections, they declined to take the prescribed course, and solely upon that ground the regents by formal notification suspended them from the \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n University, but with leave to apply for readmission at any time conditioned upon their ability and willingness to comply with all applicable regulations of the University governing the matriculation and attendance of students. The University affords opportunity for education such as may not be had at any other institution in California except at a greater cost which these minors are not able to pay. And they, as appellees at the time of their suspension well knew, are willing to take as a substitute for military training such other courses as may be prescribed by the University.\n Other allegations of the petition need not be stated, as they merely go to show the grounds upon which appellants under the state practice sought the writ of mandate.\n The University is a land grant college. An act of Congress (Morrill Act approved July 2, 1862, 12 Stat. 503, 7 U.S.C.  301-308 (7 USCA  301-308)) donated public lands to the several states in order that upon the conditions specified all moneys derived from the sale of such lands or from the sale of land scrip issued under the act should be invested and constitute a perpetual fund the interest of which should be inviolably appropriated by each state accepting the benefits of the act 'to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 245, 255]\n\u00a0\n March 23, 1868, the Legislature of California passed an act creating the University 'in order to devote to the largest purposes of education the benefaction made to the State' by the Morrill Act. St. 1867-68, p. 248. This law of the state, called the organic act, provides that 'any resident of California, of the age of fourteen years or upwards, of approved moral character, shall have the right to enter himself in the University as a student at large, and receive tuition in any branch or branches of instruction at the time when the same are given in their regular course, on such terms as the Board of Regents may prescribe.' Section 3. It declared that the college of agriculture should be first established, section 4; that the college of mechanic arts should be next established, section 5, 'and in order to fulfil the requirements of the said Act of Congress, all able-bodied male students of the University, whether pursuing full or partial courses in any college, or as students at large, shall receive instruction and discipline in military tactics in such manner and to such extent as the Regents shall prescribe, the requisite arms for which shall be furnished by the State,' section 6. Article 9,  9, of the state Constitution as amended November 5, 1918, declares: 'The University of California shall constitute a public trust, to be administered by the existing corporation known as 'The Regents of the University of California,' with full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative control as may be necessary to insure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the university and the security of its funds; ... provided, that all moneys derived from the sale of public lands donated to this State by act of Congress approved July 2, 1862 (and the several acts amenda- \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 256]\n\u00a0\n tory thereof), shall be invested as provided by said acts of Congress and the income from said moneys shall be inviolably appropriated to the endowment, support and maintenance of at least one college of agriculture, where the leading objects shall be (without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics) to teach such branches of learning as are related to scientific and practical agriculture and mechanic arts, in accordance with the requirements and conditions of said acts of Congress.' September 15, 1931, pursuant to the provisions of the organic act and Constitution, the regents promulgated the following order:\n'Every able bodied student of the University of California who, at the time of his matriculation at the University, is under the age of twenty-four years and a citizen of the United States and who has not attained full academic standing as a junior student in the University and has not completed the course in military science and tactics offered to freshmen and sophomore students at the University shall be and is hereby required as a condition to his attendance as a student to enroll in and complete a course in not less than one and one-half units of instruction in military science and tactics each semester of his attendance until such time as he shall have received a total of six units of such instruction or shall have attained full academic standing as a junior student.'\n\n In the court below appellants assailed the laws and order above referred to as repugnant to specified provisions of the California Constitution and Political Code. And they adequately challenged the validity of the state Constitution, organic act, and regents' order, in so far as they were by the regents construed to require these students to take the prescribed course in military science and tactics, as repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n The state court, without announcing an opinion, denied the petition for a writ of mandate. Appellants applied for a rehearing. The court, denying the application, handed down an opinion in which it held that article 9,  9, reposes in the regents full powers of organization and government of the University subject to legislative control in respect of its endowments and funds; that by section 6 of the organic act and article 9,  9, military tactics is expressly required to be included among the subjects which shall be taught at the University, and that it is the duty of the regents to prescribe the nature and extent of the courses to be given and to determine what students shall be required to pursue them; and that the suspension of the petitioning students because of their refusal to pursue the compulsory courses in military training involved no violation of their rights under the Constitution of the United States.\n By their assignment of errors, appellants call upon this court to decide whether the challenged provisions of the state Constitution, organic act, and regents' order, in so far as they impose compulsory military training, are repugnant to the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the due process clause of that amendment, or the treaty that is generally called the Briand-Kellogg Peace Pact. 46 Stat. 2343\n\n\n Appellees contend that this court has no jurisdiction because, as they say, the regents' order is not a 'statute of any state' within the meaning of section 237(a), Judicial Code, 28 USCA  344(a). But by the California Constitution the regents are, with exceptions not material here, fully empowered in respect of the organization and government of the University which, as it has been held, is a constitutional department or function of the state government. Williams v. Wheeler (1913) 23 Cal.App. 619, 623, 138 P. 937; Wallace v. Regents (1925) 75 Cal.App. 274, \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n 277, 242 P. 892. The assailed order prescribes a rule of conduct, and applies to all students belonging to the defined class. And it was because of its violation that the regents by resolution suspended these students. The meaning of 'statute of any state' is not limited to acts of state Legislatures. It is used to include every act legislative in character to which the state gives sanction, no distinction being made between acts of the state Legislature and other exertions of the state lawmaking power. King Mfg. Co. v. Augusta, \n277 \nU.S. 100\n, 48 S.Ct. 489; Sultan Ry. & Timber Co. v. Dept. of Labor and Industries, \n277 \nU.S. 135\n, 48 S.Ct. 505. It follows that the order making military instruction compulsory is a statute of the state within the meaning of section 237(a), 28 USCA  344(a).\n And the appellees insist that this appeal should be dismissed for the want of a substantial federal question. But that contention cannot be sustained, for we are unable to say that every question that appellants have brought here for decision is so clearly not debatable and utterly lacking in merit as to require dismissal for want of substance. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The allegations of the petition do not mean that California has divested itself of any part of its power solely to determine what military training shall be offered or required at the University. While, by acceptance of the benefits of the Morrill Act of 1862 and the creation of the University in order appropriately to comply with the terms of the grant, the state became bound to offer students in that University instruction in military tactics, it remains untrammeled by federal enactment and is entirely free \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 259]\n\u00a0\n to determine for itself the branches of military training to be provided, the content of the instruction to be given, and the objectives to be attained. That state-as did each of the other states of the Union-for the proper discharge of its obligations as beneficiary of the grant made the course in military instruction compulsory upon students. Recently Wisconsin and Minnesota have made it elective. \n3\n The question whether the state has bound itself to require students to take the training is not here involved. The validity of the challenged order does not depend upon the terms of the land grant.\n The petition is not to be understood as showing that students required by the regents' order to take the prescribed course thereby serve in the Army or in any sense become a part of the military establishment of the United States. Nor is the allegation that the courses are prescribed by the War Department to be taken literally. We take judicial notice of the long-established voluntary co-operation between federal and state authorities in respect of the military instruction given in the land grant colleges. \n4\n The War Department has not been empowered \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 260]\n\u00a0\n to determine, or in any manner to prescribe, the military instruction in these institutions. The furnishing of officers, men, and equipment conditioned upon the giving of courses and the imposing of discipline deemed appropriate, recommended, or approved by the Department does not support the suggestion that the training is not exclusively prescribed and given under the authority of the state. The states are interested in the safety of the United States, the strength of its military forces, and its readiness to defend them in war and against every attack of public enemies. Gilbert v. Minnesota, \n254 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 329 S., 41 S.Ct. 125; State v. Holm, 139 Minn. 267, 273, 166 N.W. 181, L.R.A. 1918C, 304. Undoubtedly every state has authority to train its able-bodied male citizens of suitable age appropriately to develop fitness, should any such duty be laid upon them, to serve in the United States Army or in state militia (always liable to be called forth by federal authority to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection, or repel invasion, Constitution, art. 1,  8, cls. 12, 15 and 16.

(1925) 186 Wis. 1, 202 N.W. 191) or as members of local constabulary forces or as officers needed effectively to police the state. And, when made possible by the national government, the state, in order more effectively to teach and train its citizens for these and like purposes, may avail itself of the services of officers and equipment belonging to the military establishment of the United States. So long as its action is within retained powers and not inconsistent with any exertion of the authority of the national government and transgresses no right safeguarded to the citizen by the Federal Constitution, the state is the sole judge of the means to be employed and the amount of training to be exacted for the effective accomplishment of these ends. Second Amendment; Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 16, 17; Dunne v. \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 261]\n\u00a0\n People (1879) 94 Ill. 120, 129, 34 Am.Rep. 213; 1 Kent's Commentaries, 265, 389. Cf. Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252\n, 6 S.Ct. 580.\n The clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment invoked by appellants declare: 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' Appellants' contentions are that the enforcement of the order prescribing instruction in military science and tactics abridges some privilege or immunity covered by the first clause and deprives of liberty safeguarded by the second. The 'privileges and immunities' protected are only those that belong to citizens of the United States as distinguished from citizens of the states-those that arise from the Constitution and laws of the United States as contrasted with those that spring from other sources. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 72-74, 77-80; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 13 S.Ct. 3; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S.Ct. 570; Twining v.

Appellants assert-unquestionably in good faith-that all war, preparation for war, and the training required by the University are repugnant to the tenets and discipline of their church, to their religion, and to their consciences. The 'privilege' of attending the University as a student comes not from federal sources but is given by the state. It is not within the asserted protection. The only 'immunity' claimed by these students is freedom from obligation to comply with the rule prescribing military training. But that 'immunity' cannot be regarded as not within, or as distinguishable from, the 'liberty' of which they claim to have been deprived by the enforcement of the regents' order. If the regents' order is not repugnant to the due process clause, then it does not violate the privileges and immunities \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 262]\n\u00a0\n clause. Therefore we need only decide whether by state action the 'liberty' of these students has been infringed.\n There need be no attempt to enumerate or comprehensively to define what is included in the 'liberty' protected by the due process clause. Undoubtedly it does include the right to entertain the beliefs, to adhere to the principles, and to teach the doctrines on which these students base their objections to the order prescribing military training. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 43 S.Ct. 625, 29 A.L.R. 1446; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 369 S., 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625. The fact that they are able to pay their way in this University but not in any other institution in California is without significance upon any constitutional or other question here involved. California has not drafted or called them to attend the University. They are seeking education offered by the state and at the same time insisting that they be excluded from the prescribed course solely upon grounds of their religious beliefs and conscientious objections to war, preparation for war, and military education. Taken on the basis of the facts alleged in the petition, appellants' contentions amount to no more than an assertion that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as a safeguard of 'liberty' confers the right to be students in the State University free from obligation to take military training as one of the conditions of attendance.\n Viewed in the light of our decisions, that proposition must at once be put aside as untenable.\n Government, federal and state, each in its own sphere owes a duty to the people within its jurisdiction to preserve itself in adequate strength to maintain peace and order and to assure the just enforcement of law. And every citizen owes the reciprocal duty, according to his capacity, to support and defend government against all \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 263]\n\u00a0\n enemies. Selective Draft Law Cases, supra, page 378 of 245 U.S., 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856; Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 166.\n United States v. Schwimmer, \n279 \nU.S. 644\n, 49 S.Ct. 448, involved a petition for naturalization by one opposed to bearing arms in defense of country. Holding the applicant not entitled to citizenship we said (page 650 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 448, 450): 'That it is the duty of citizens by force of arms to defend our government against all enemies whenever necessity arises is a fundamental principle of the Constitution . ... Whatever tends to lessen the willingness of citizens to discharge their duty to bear arms in the country's defense detracts from the strength and safety of the government.'\n In United States v. Macintosh, \n283 \nU.S. 605\n, 51 S.Ct. 570, 571, a later naturalization case, the applicant was unwilling, because of conscientious objections, to take unqualifiedly the statutory oath of allegiance which contains this statement: 'That he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.' 8 U.S.C.  381 (8 USCA  381). His petition stated that he was willing, if necessary, to take up arms in defense of this country, 'but I should want to be free to judge of the necessity.' In amplification he said: 'I do not undertake to support 'my country, right or wrong' in any dispute which may arise, and I am not willing to promise beforehand, and without knowing the cause for which my country may go to war, either that I will or that I will not 'take up arms in defense of this country,' however 'necessary' the war may seem to be to the Government of the day.' The opinion of this court quotes from petitioner's brief a statement to the effect that it is a 'fixed principle of our Constitution, zealously guarded by our laws, that a citizen cannot be forced and need not bear arms in a war if he has conscientious religious scruples against doing so.' And, referring to that part of the \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 264]\n\u00a0\n argument in behalf of the applicant, this court said (page 623 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 570, 575): 'This, if it means what it seems to say, is an astonishing statement. Of course, there is no such principle of the Constitution, fixed or otherwise. The conscientious objector is relieved from the obligation to bear arms in obedience to no constitutional provision, express or implied; but because, and only because, it has accorded with the policy of Congress thus to relieve him. ... The privilege of the native-born conscientious objector to avoid bearing arms comes, not from the Constitution, but from the acts of Congress. That body may grant or withhold the exemption as in its wisdom it sees fit; and, if it be withheld, the native-born conscientious objector cannot successfully assert the privilege. No other conclusion is compatible with the well-nigh limitless extent of the war powers as above illustrated, which include, by necessary implication, the power, in the last extremity, to compel the armed service of any citizen in the land, without regard to his objections or his views in respect of the justice or morality of the particular war or of war in general. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 29\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 362, 3 Ann.Cas. 765, this court (upholding a state compulsory vaccination law), speaking of the liberties guaranteed to the individual by the Fourteenth Amendment, said: '... And yet he may be compelled, by force if need be, against his will and without regard to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, or even his religious or political convictions, to take his place in the ranks of the army of his country, and risk the chance of being shot down in its defense.\"\n And see Pearson v. Coale, 165 Md. 224, 167 A. 54, a case, similar to that now before us, decided against the contention of a student in the University of Maryland who on conscientious grounds objected to military training there required. His appeal to this Court was dismissed for the want of a substantial federal question. Coale v. Pearson, \n290 \nU.S. 597\n, 54 S.Ct. 131. \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 265]\n\u00a0\n Plainly there is no ground for the contention that the regents' order, requiring ablebodied male students under the age of twenty-four as a condition of their enrollment to take the prescribed instruction in military science and tactics, transgresses any constitutional right asserted by these appellants.\n The contention that the regents' order is repugnant to the Briand- Kellogg Peace Pact requires little consideration. In that instrument the United States and the other high contracting parties declare that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another and agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts which may arise among them shall never be sought except by pacific means. Clearly there is no conflict between the regents' order and the provisions of this treaty.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO.\n Concurring in the opinion, I wish to say an extra word.\n I assume for present purposes that the religious liberty protected by the First Amendment against invasion by the nation is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against invasion by the states.\n Accepting that premise, I cannot find in the respondents' ordinance an obstruction by the state to 'the free exercise' of religion as the phrase was understood by the founders of the nation, and by the generations that have followed. Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333, 342\n, 10 S. Ct. 299.\n There is no occasion at this time to mark the limits of governmental power in the exaction of military service when the nation is at peace.* The petitioners have not been required to bear arms for any hostile purpose, offensive or defensive, either now or in the future. They have \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 266]\n\u00a0\n not even been required in any absolute or peremptory way to join in courses of instruction that will fit them to bear arms. If they elect to resort to an institution for higher education maintained with the state's moneys, then and only then they are commanded to follow courses of instruction believed by the state to be vital to its welfare. This may be condemned by some as unwise or illiberal or unfair when there is violence to conscientious scruples, either religious or merely ethical. More must be shown to set the ordinance at naught. In controversies of this order, courts do not concern themselves with matters of legislative policy, unrelated to privileges or liberties secured by the organic law. The First Amendment, if it be read into the Fourteenth, makes invalid any state law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' Instruction in military science is not instruction in the practice or tenets of a religion. Neither directly nor indirectly is government establishing a state religion when it insists upon such training. Instruction in military science, unaccompanied here by any pledge of military service, is not an interference by the state with the free exercise of religion when the liberties of the Constitution are read in the light of a century and a half of history during days of peace and war.\n The meaning of those liberties has striking illustration in statutes that were enacted in colonial times and later. They will be found collected in the opinion of the lower court in MacIntosh v. U.S.(C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 845, 847, 848; U.S. v. Macintosh, \n283 \nU.S. 605, 632\n, 51 S.Ct. 570, and more fully in the briefs of counsel. From the beginnings of our history, Quakers and other conscientious objectors have been exempted as an act of grace from military service, but the exemption, when granted, has been coupled with a condition, at least in many instances, that they supply the Army with a substitute or with the money necessary to hire one. This \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 267]\n\u00a0\n was done in Virginia in 1738 and 1782 (5 Hening 16; 11 Id. 18; cf. 1766, 1780, 8 Id. 242, 243; 10 Id. 261, 262, 334, 335); in Massachusetts (Acts and Resolves, 1758, vol. 4, p. 159; 1759, 4 Id. 193; in North Carolina ( 1781, 24 State Records 156); and in New York Colonial Laws, 1755, vol. 3, pp. 1068, 1069). A like practice has been continued in the Constitutions of many of the states. See, e.g., Constitution of Alabama, 1819, 1865, 1867 (F.N. Thorpe, Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters and Other Organic Laws, vol. 1, pp. 105, 119, 147); Arkansas, 1868 (Thorpe, vol. 1, p. 325); Colorado, 1876 (Thorpe, vol. 1, p. 507); Idaho, 1889 ( Thorpe, vol. 2, p. 943); Illinois, 1819, 1870 (Thorpe, vol. 2, pp. 980, 1044); Indiana, 1816 (Thorpe, vol. 2, p. 1067); Iowa, 1846, 1857 (Thorpe, vol. 2, pp. 1132, 1148); Kansas, 1855, 1857, 1859 (Thorpe, vol. 2, pp. 1190, 1214, 1253); Kentucky, 1792, 1799, 1850, 1890 (Thorpe, vol. 3, pp. 1271, 1283, 1307, 1350); Louisiana, 1879, 1898 (Thorpe, vol. 3, pp. 1501, 1587); Michigan, 1850 (Thorpe, vol. 4, p. 1966); Mississippi, 1817 (Thorpe, vol. 4, p. 2041); Missouri, 1820, 1875 (Thorpe, vol. 4, pp. 2164, 2268); New Hampshire, 1792, 1902 (Thorpe, vol. 4, pp. 2472, 2495); New York, 1821, 1846 (Thorpe, vol. 5, pp. 2648, 2671); Pennsylvania, 1790, 1838 (Thorpe, vol. 5, pp. 3099, 3111); Vermont, 1793 (Thorpe, vol. 6, p. 3763). For one opposed to force, the affront to conscience must be greater in furnishing men and money therewith to wage a pending contest than in studying military science without the duty or the pledge of service. Never in our history has the notion been accepted, or even, it is believed, advanced, that acts thus indirectly related to service in the camp or field are so tied to the practice of religion as to be exempt, in law or in morals, from regulation by the state. On the contrary, the very lawmakers who were willing to give release from warlike acts had no thought that they were doing any- \n\n[293 U.S. 245, 268]\n\u00a0\n thing inconsistent with the moral claims of an objector, still less with his constitutional immunities, in coupling the exemption with these collateral conditions.\n Manifestly a different doctrine would carry us to lengths that have never yet been dreamed of. The conscientious objector, if his liberties were to be thus extended, might refuse to contribute taxes in furtherance of a war, whether for attack or for defense, or in furtherance of any other end condemned by his conscience as irreligious or immoral. The right of private judgment has never yet been so exalted above the powers and the compulsion of the agencies of government. One who is a martyr to a principle-which may turn out in the end to be a delusion or an error-does not prove by his martyrdom that he has kept within the law.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n293 \nU.S. 633\n, 55 S.Ct. 345, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The quoted language, section 4, has been twice re-enacted.

HAFF(1934)\nNo. 325\nArgued: February 6, 1934Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 559, 560]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roger O'Donnell, of Washington, D.C., and Stephen M. White, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. George C. Sweeney, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By section 3 of the Immigration Act of 19171 Congress ordained that 'The following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: ... Prostitutes, or persons coming into the United States for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose.' In reliance upon this mandate the petitioner was ordered deported, and the question is whether she is within the proscribed class.\n She is a citizen of Denmark, and first came here in 1922, making her home in Los Angeles, Cal., where she was employed as a domestic servant. In 1924 she became acquainted with a married man and in 1925 commenced \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n having illicit relations with him; she did not live with him and was not supported by him, but resided where she was employed and supported herself from her own earnings, although he gave her money and clothing from time to time. In 1926 she made a trip to Denmark to visit her parents, and returned to Los Angeles in 1928, where she again took service as a domestic. In May, 1931, she made a second visit to Denmark to see her relatives. On this occasion she was accompanied by the man with whom she had been intimate, who paid part of her expenses. He went to Europe to attend a convention in Vienna. For a portion of the time they traveled together in Europe, having illicit relations. They returned together through Canada, coming from Vancouver to Seattle, where they entered the United States, she being admitted by the authorities as a returning resident. They went to a hotel in Seattle where they registered as man and wife. Upon her arrest by immigration officers she admitted her purpose to continue the relationship of husband and wife with the man until they should arrive in Los Angeles, but denied that it was her intention to continue it after arrival in that city.\n Upon these facts, developed at the hearing before a board of inspectors, the Secretary of Labor ordered the petitioner deported. She petitioned the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, an order to show cause was issued, and, after hearing, the writ was denied. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n The case is here on certiorari.\n The petitioner's previous residence here and her possession of a re- entry permit do not entitle her to remain in this country. Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78\n, 34 S.Ct. 196; Lewis v. Frick, \n233 \nU.S. 291\n, 34 S.Ct. 488. She was liable to deportation at \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 562]\n\u00a0\n any time within five years of her entry at the port of Seattle, if she was a member of one of the prohibited classes of aliens. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Was she a prostitute, or person coming into the country 'for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose' within the intent of section 3 of the Act of 1917? The respondent does not contend that she is a prostitute or that her purpose in entering the United States was to practice prostitution, but he affirms that she did come for an immoral purpose as defined by the statute. We cannot adopt this conclusion.\n The principle of ejusdem generis limits the connotation of the words 'any other immoral purpose' to such as are of like character with prostitution, United States v. Bitty, \n208 \nU.S. 393, 401\n, 28 S.Ct. 396; and extramarital relations, short of concubinage, fall short of that description.\n Moreover, it cannot be said that the petitioner's entry was for the purpose of having such relations. The respondent argues that, as she had indulged in misconduct before leaving, had continued that misconduct while on her trip abroad, and intended to continue it at least until she should arrive in Los Angeles, the Secretary of Labor was justified in disbelieving her statement that the relations would cease when she took up her residence in that city. This may be conceded; but it does not follow that her purpose in returning to the United States was to continue her irregular and improper conduct. The fact is that she was returning to her former residence, and nothing is disclosed to indicate that she did not intend, as she claimed, to resume her employment as a domestic. Her entry cannot be said to be with the purpose 'only that she might live in a state of concubinage.' United States v. Bitty, supra, \n208 \nU.S. 403\n, 28 S.Ct. 396, 399. People not of good moral character \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 563]\n\u00a0\n like others, travel from place to place and change their residence. But to say that, because they indulge in illegal or immoral acts, they travel for that purpose, is to emphasize that which is incidental and ignore what is of primary significance. Compare Ex parte Rocha (D.C.) 30 F.(2d) 823.\n The Mann Act4 creates the offense of transporting in interstate commerce a woman or girl 'for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose. ...' Section 6 (18 USCA  402). This court has said that act 'seeks to reach and punish the movement in interstate commerce of women and girls with a view to the accomplishment of the unlawful purposes prohibited.' Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 491\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, 197, L.R.A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168. Accordingly, it has been held that the transportation denounced must have for its object or be a means of effecting of facilitating the sexual intercourse of the participants. If the purpose of the journey is not sexual intercourse, though that be contemplated, the statute is not violated. Welsch v. United States (C.C.A.) 220 F. 764; Fisher v. United States (C.C.A.) 226 F. 667; Sloan v. United States (C.C.A .) 287 F. 91; Alpert v. United States (C.C.A.) 12 F.(2d) 352; Hunter v. United States (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 55, 73 A.L.R. 870. So here, by the language of the act, the purpose of the entry is made controlling. And we think it plain that in no proper sense may the entry of the petitioner be said to have been for the purpose of immoral sexual relations.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The statute forbids admission of 'persons coming into the United States for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose.' The doctrine of this decision is that 'extramarital relations' of an unmarried \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 564]\n\u00a0\n woman that fall short of concubinage are not within the condemnation of the statute. But there is no ground for the assumption that petitioner is not the concubine of a married man. Since 1924 she has continued illicit relations with him. They cohabited as, and held themselves out to be, husband and wife abroad and in this country while not in the vicinity of his home. Admittedly, these relations were to continue until again they reached that neighborhood. There is abundant warrant for the Secretary's conclusion that petitioner returned to this country as, and intending to continue to be, that man's concubine. The findings quote Webster's definition-'a woman who cohabits with a man without being his wife.' The Secretary found her to be such a person. He relied upon, and I think rightly applied the opinion in, United States v. Bitty, \n208 \nU.S. 393\n, 28 S. Ct. 396.\n Bitty was indicted under a provision of the Act of February 20, 1907, 34 Stat. 898, 899,  3, forbidding 'the importation into the United States of any alien woman ... for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose.' The indictment alleged importation of a woman for an 'immoral purpose'; namely, 'that she should live with him as his (Bitty's) concubine.' The circuit court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the facts alleged did not constitute a violation of the statute. This court reversed. The phrase there construed is in the same words as that now under consideration. They undoubtedly have the same meaning. In that case defendant's counsel maintained that Congress did not by that act intend to legislate against 'those isolated cases where certain individuals come into this country with their mistresses.' But repelling that construction, this court said (page 401 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 396, 398) that: 'In forbidding the importation of alien women 'for any other immoral purpose,' Congress evidently thought that there were purposes in connection with the importations of alien women which, as in the \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 565]\n\u00a0\n case of importations for prostitution, were to be deemed immoral.' After reference to the rule of ejusdem generis relied on by the defendant, the court said (page 402 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 396): 'But that rule cannot avail the accused in this case; for the immoral purpose charged in the indictment is of the same general class or kind as the one that controls in the importation of an alien woman for the purpose strictly of prostitution. The prostitute may, in the popular sense, be more degraded in character than the concubine, but the latter none the less must be held to lead an immoral life, if any regard whatever be had to the views that are almost universally held in this country as to the relations which may rightfully, from the standpoint of morality, exist between man and woman in the matter of sexual intercourse. ... (Page 403 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 396, 399.) The statute in question, it must be remembered, was intended to keep out of this country immigrants whose permanent residence here would not be desirable or for the common good, and we cannot suppose either that Congress intended to exempt from the operation of the statute the importation of an alien woman brought here only that she might live in a state of concubinage with the man importing her, or that it did not regard such an importation as being for an immoral purpose.'\n Moreover, the statute is not limited to prostitution and concubinage. While the Secretary regarded her as a concubine, his decision may not fairly be held to depend upon that characterization. Plainly it rests upon the ground there stated 'that she entered for an immoral purpose' condemned by the statute. The law does not require him more definitely to classify. Refinements of nomenclature adopted for the sake of decency in speech may not be used to conjure up doubts and distinctions that obscure the real substance of the statute. The meaning of the findings is that petitioner's doings and course of living constitute a kind of immorality that bars admission. The \n\n[291 U.S. 559, 566]\n\u00a0\n Secretary rightly may have deemed that her admitted intention temporarily to continue, when coupled with environment, opportunity, and temptation under which habitual transgression had developed and for years persisted, amounted to a fixed purpose indefinitely to remain in concubinage. That is enough.\n And there is nothing in the opinion in United States v. Bitty, supra, or elsewhere to support the idea that Congress intended to keep out only those coming exclusively for the purposes referred to and to admit prostitutes, concubines, and the like intending to follow legitimate occupation while practicing, incidentally or otherwise, any of the immoralities covered by the statute. Indeed, the court's opinion implies that, if concubinage were her principal or primary purpose, she ought to be excluded, even though she intended regularly to pursue her work as a domestic. The making of exclusion to depend upon the determination whether the immoral purpose is dominant or subordinate goes far to strike down the statute by making its enforcement difficult and in many cases practically impossible. Congress undoubtedly intended to exclude those who entertain a purpose here to practice prostitution or immorality of that sort. That is the construction adopted by the Secretary, the District Court, and the Circuit Court of Appeals. They are right. Petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus was properly denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, U.S.C., title 8,  136 (8 USCA  136).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 65 F.(2d) 94.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29,  19, 39 Stat. 889, U.S.C., title 8 ,  155 (8 USCA  155).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of June 25, 1910, c. 395, 36 Stat. 825, U.S.C., title 18,  397-400 (18 USCA  397-400).\n\n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTFORD ACCIDENT & I.

Barrett Jones and W. Calvin Wells, both of Jackson, Miss., for appellants.\n Mr. Gerard H. Brandon, of Natchez, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy hinges upon the validity of a statute of Mississippi whereby the bond of a contractor guaranteeing to an owner the faithful performance of a contract for the construction of a building shall inure to the benefit of persons furnishing material or labor, and this though the bond expresses an intention to exclude them.\n The statute challenged by the appellants was enacted in March, 1918, and is framed for the protection of subcontractors, materialmen, laborers, and journeymen who have had a part in the making of buildings or of structures akin thereto. Laws Miss. 1918, c. 128; Mississippi Code 1930,  2274-2281. \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n By section 1, which amended section 3074 of the Code of 1906 (Code 1930,  2274), materialmen or laborers, not paid by a contractor may give notice in writing to the owner, and thereupon any amount due from the owner to the contractor shall be bound in the hands of the owner for the payment pro rata of claims covered by the notice.\n By section 2 (Code 1930,  2275), no contractor may 'assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of in any way, the contract or the proceeds thereof, to the detriment or prejudice' of materialmen or laborers, and 'all such assignments, transfers, or dispositions' shall be in subordination to their rights, 'provided, however, that this section shall not apply to any contract or agreement where the contractor or the master workman shall enter into a solvent bond' conditioned as provided for in section 3 thereof (Code 1930,  2276).\n By section 3, any bond for the faithful performance of a building contract shall include a guaranty that the contractor shall make payment to materialmen and laborers, and, if such a provision is omitted, the bond shall inure to the protection of materialmen and laborers as if the provision were expressed. The text of this section is quoted in the margin. 1 \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n In October, 1926, Natchez Investment Company, Inc., the owner of land in Natchez, Miss., made a contract with builders, J. V. and R. T. Burkes, for the construction of a hotel. The Burkes made a subcontract with Acme Engineering Company for the plumbing, heating, and ventilating work, and the subcontractor assigned its contract to the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company, the appellee in this court. By the principal contract provision was made for the giving of a bond which was to secure materialmen and laborers as well as the owner. \n2\n Thereafter the contractors did furnish a bond for the cost of the building ($316,822) with the Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company as surety, but a bond giving narrower protection, or so the surety contends, than the one that had been promised. The bond that was furnished refers to and incorporates the contract between the owner and the builders. It provides that, if the principal shall indemnify the obligee against loss or damage directly caused by the failure of the principal faithfully \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n to perform the contract, the obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in force, provided, however, that the obligee shall have complied with certain conditions precedent for the protection of the surety. One is that the terms of the building contract shall be faithfully fulfilled in so far as they call for performance on the part of the owner, the surety to be relieved of all liability in the event of a default. Another is that, if the obligee shall have notice of any claim against the contractor for unpaid labor or material, no further payments shall be made by the obligee to the contractor until such claims are satisfied. Finally, in an effort to cut off materialmen and laborers, the bond provides that 'no right of action shall accrue upon or by reason hereof to or for the benefit of any one other than the obligee named herein.'\n The contractors for the building made default in the performance of their contract owing large sums of money to materialmen and laborers, including Acme Engineering Company, appellee's assignor. Thereupon, the investment company, the owner, sued in the chancery court of Adams county, Miss., for a decree construing the bond, adjudging that it was subject to the rights and liabilities defined in section 3 of the statute, and determining the proportionate interests of those entitled thereunder. The contractors, the surety, and various subcontractors, materialmen, and laborers were joined as defendants, as well as an assignee of moneys due upon the contract. Other subcontractors and materialmen intervened and by cross-bill and otherwise sought relief upon the bond. The Supreme Court of Mississippi held upon demurrer that the bond was one for the faithful performance of a building contract within section 3 of the statute; that its effect was to substitute a new security for the protection of materialmen and laborers in place of that provided by sections 1 and 2; and that by force of that substitution the contractor had become free to assign and dispose of the \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n contract and the proceeds thereof. An assignment to a bank of moneys due from the owner to the amount of upwards of $26,000 was accordingly sustained. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Natchez Investment Co., 155 Miss. 31, 119 So. 366. The cause having been remanded to the court of chancery, there was a trial of the issues, which was followed by a new appeal. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Natchez Investment Co., 161 Miss. 198, 219, 132 So. 535, 538, 135 So. 497. On that appeal the court reiterated its ruling as to the operation of the bond. It held that 'none of the provisions of the bond had the effect of writing out of the contract' the provisions of the statute, 'and could not have that effect . ... All stipulations contrary to the statutory provisions must be disregarded so far as persons furnishing labor or material are concerned.' An appeal to this court was dismissed for defect of parties. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Bunn, \n285 \nU.S. 169\n, 52 S.Ct. 354.\n In the meantime, the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company, the present appellee, had intervened in the court of chancery by leave of that court, and had made claim to its proportionate share of the proceeds of the bond. The surety renewed the contest, as it was privileged to do (Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Co., \n225 \nU.S. 111, 127\n, 32 S.Ct. 641, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 875), insisting that the bond was unaffected by the statute, and that there could be no holding to the contrary without an arbitrary interference with liberty of contract and a resulting violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The chancellor, overruling these contentions, gave judgment upon the bond in favor of the intervening claimant. The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed upon the authority of its earlier opinions. 147 So. 815. See, also, U.S.F. & G. Co. v. Parsons, 147 Miss. 335, 112 So. 469, 53 A.L.R. 88. An appeal to this court followed; the surety on the appeal bond joining as appellant with the surety on the bond in suit. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Bunn, supra. \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n As to the meaning of the statute now challenged as invalid, the Supreme Court of Mississippi speaks with ultimate authority Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 362\n, 53 S.Ct. 145, 85 A.L.R. 254; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, \n287 \nU.S. 509, 513\n, 53 S.Ct. 244. We assume in accordance with its ruling that the statute was intended to apply to such a bond as the one in controversy here, and to blot out the causes repugnant to the statutory scheme. The only question in this court is whether the result is consistent with the Constitution of the United States. Opposition is asserted by counsel for the surety. We think it is unreal.\n Materialmen and laborers may be secured by mechanics' liens upon land improved or affected by their material or labor, and this without reference to technical and ancient concepts of privity of contract. Great Southern Hotel Co. v. Jones, \n193 \nU.S. 532, 550\n, 24 S.Ct. 576; Jones v. Great Southern Hotel Co. (C.C.A.) 86 F. 370; Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., \n254 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 41 S.Ct. 1. For like reasons they may be secured as against the owner by a lien upon any moneys due to the contractor, and secured as against the contractor by a lien upon any moneys collected from the owner. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Natchez Investment Co., 155 Miss. 31, 51, 119 So. 366; U.S.F. & G. Co. v. Parsons, supra; cf. United States v.

The fundamental liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment do not include immunity from restraints so deeply rooted in policy and justice. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 157\n, 52 S. Ct. 69; Advance-Rumely Thresher Co. v. Jackson, \n287 \nU.S. 283\n, 53 S.Ct. 133. The owner contracting with a builder or making payments under the contract may be required to give heed to the equities of a subcontractor or a workman adding \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n value to the land. The builder may be required to give heed to the same equities in contracting with the owner or in disposing of his contract or of the moneys paid thereunder.\n The statute of Mississippi was framed in a genuine endeavor to make these equities prevail. Neither owner nor builder is commanded to give a bond, though decisions are not lacking that such a command will be upheld. 3 Cf. Gant v. Oklahoma City, \n289 \nU.S. 98\n, 53 S.Ct. 530; Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 \nU.S. 340\n, 36 S.Ct. 561. All that the statute does by force of section 3 is to standardize the form, at least in some particulars, when bonds are freely given, and to define the consequences attaching to the standard thus prescribed. The form shall include a clause for the protection of materialmen and laborers; the consequences shall include the exemption of the owner from the burden of a lien, and a like exemption of the builder. U.S.F. & G. Co. v. Parsons, supra. The security of the bond becomes a substitute for the security of the building contract and of the moneys due thereunder. No arbitrary restraint of liberty of contract is laid upon the owner. His personal liability toward materialmen and laborers is not greater by a dollar than it was at the beginning. To the contrary, it is less. By force of the new security he is relieved of the burden of a lien, yet he has priority of interest in the proceeds of any suit upon the bond. See section 3, quoted ante. No arbitrary restraint of liberty is laid upon the builder. Upon the giving of a bond he is charged with a liability in favor of materialmen and laborers, a liability consistent with fair dealing between men in that relation, but he is relieved of the duty of holding present \n\n[291 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n and future payments as a fund impressed with a trust and devoted to specific uses. U.S.F. & G. Co. v. Parsons, supra. Indeed, this very builder took advantage of that privilege, making an assignment of the contract and its proceeds to a bank; and because of the bond the assignment was upheld. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Natchez Investment Co., 155 Miss. 31, 53, 119 So. 366. Plainly he is in no position to complain that the statute is invalid in its application to himself. Indeed, owner and builder do not declare themselves aggrieved, but through silence and inaction, if not otherwise, evince submission and consent. The only other person whose interests are affected is the surety on the bond. If the statute is valid in its application to owner and builder, to obligee and principal, there can be no privilege of the surety to contract on better terms. The secondary obligation must follow the primary one and conform to its restraints. The surety has the alternative either to write its indemnities and guaranties upon the only terms permitted to obligee and principal, or to renounce the writing altogether. The business of insurance is one peculiarly subject to supervision and control. German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, Supt. of Insurance of State of Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A. 1915C, 1189; National Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71\n, 43 S.Ct. 32; Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., supra. The Fourteenth Amendment does not make it necessary that materialmen and laborers shall be deprived of fair protection to the end that sureties for profit may be given an opportunity to diversity their bonds.\n Liberty of contract is not an absolute concept. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., supra; Advance-Rumely Thresher Co. v. Jackson, supra; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 202\n, 31 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 31 S.Ct. 259; Mutual Loan Co. v.

It is relative to many conditions of time and place and circumstance. The Constitution has not ordained that the forms of business shall be cast in imperishable moulds. There is no question here of the impairment of the obligation of a contract by later legislation. The act assailed by the appellants S.Ct. 74, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 529; bond in suit was written. Principal and surety in writing it became subject to the statutes then in force, and by these they must abide.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 3.

M. Hall, of Memphis, Tenn., for appellants.\n Mr. Garner W. Green, of Jackson, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action instituted in a circuit court of Mississippi by Delta & Pine Land Company, a corporation of that state, with its principal place of business therein, against Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, a corporation of Connecticut, having its principal place of business in Hartford in that state. The declaration alleges that on or about January 1, 1928, the plaintiff ap- \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n plied to the defendant for a fidelity bond and paid the agreed premiums therefor, and the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff such a bond, whereby it bound itself to pay the plaintiff, within sixty days after satisfactory proof, pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiff through fraud or dishonesty or willful misapplication by any employee 'in any position, anywhere,' from the time that the name of such employee should be placed upon a schedule attached to the bond to and including the termination of the suretyship for such employee by his dismissal, retirement from service, discovery of loss, or cancellation of the bond by the parties. It is alleged that the name of H. H. Harris, as treasurer of the plaintiff, appears upon the schedule, and that the amount of coverage for him is $25,000. Sundry defalcations by Harris between May 9, 1929, and December 20, 1929, totaling $2,703.79, are set forth, all of which and the resulting loss occurred in the First judicial district of Bolivar county, Miss. The further material matters charged are that the defendant, throughout all the times mentioned in the declaration, and ever since, was and now is duly qualified and licensed to do business in Mississippi; that the dishonest acts of Harris were discovered on or about May 20, 1931, immediate notice given to the defendant at its home office, and affirmative proof of loss under oath, with full particulars, filed with the defendant at its home office within three months after the discovery. The declaration in conclusion asserts compliance by plaintiff with all the terms of the bond, and refusal of the defendant, though requested, to make payment of the sum demanded. Annexed to the declaration are copies of the bond and the supplementary schedules forming part of it.\n The defendant's plea was, in substance: The plaintiff, before and at the date of the contract of suretyship, was doing business in Tennessee, with its principal office at Memphis in that state, and defendant also was then and \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n is now doing business in Tennessee, having an agency at Memphis; plaintiff, through its office at Memphis, applied to defendant through its agency there for the bond, rider, and schedules containing the name of the defaulting employee, Harris, constituting the contract of suretyship; defendant through its agency at Memphis executed and delivered the bond and schedules to plaintiff at its office in that city; the contract is a Tennessee contract and governed by the laws of Tennessee, and full faith and credit must be given to it in the courts of Mississippi in accordance with the requirements of article 4,  1, article 1,  10, and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; there was not at the time of delivery of the contract, and is not now, any statute in Tennessee prohibiting or invalidating the condition or limitation in the contract to the effect that any claim thereunder must be duly made upon the defendant as surety within fifteen months after the termination of the suretyship for the defaulting employee, and the plaintiff did not make claim upon the defendant for the loss within fifteen months after the termination of the suretyship for Harris, as the contract was canceled and terminated December 31, 1929, and the plaintiff made no claim until June 22, 1931\n\n\n To this plea the plaintiff demurred, assigning these causes of demurrer: (1) The construction and validity of the provision of the contract relied upon in the plea is to be determined by the laws of Mississippi, and not by the laws of Tennessee; (2) the statute of limitations of the state where suit is brought is the statute which governs the time for bringing this action, and the provision in the contract requiring that any claim thereunder must be made upon the defendant within fifteen months after the termination of the suretyship for the defaulting employee is in violation of section 2294 of the Mississippi Code of 1930 and in violation of the public policy of Mississippi, and \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n its courts are not required to give full faith and credit to this provision of the contract by article 4,  1, article 1,  10, or section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n The cause came on for hearing upon the pleadings, and the court sustained the demurrer. The defendant declined to plead further; whereupon judgment was entered by default in favor of the plaintiff, a jury was impaneled and assessed damages at the amount claimed, and final judgment was accordingly entered.\n Upon appeal by the defendant, the Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed the judgment. 150 So. 205. Conceding that under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Tennessee the provision for notice within fifteen months of the termination of the suretyship is a valid limitation of liability and not a limitation of action, the court said the converse is true in Mississippi. Although the bond was executed and delivered and the agreement consummated in Tennessee, where the plaintiff and the defendant's agent had their respective offices, and where, in the absence of proof of a contrary intent, the contract was to be performed, the court concluded that the statutes of Mississippi made the instrument a Mississippi contract, and annulled the contractual limitation of the time for giving of notice of claim.\n The Mississippi statutes relied upon were the following:\n'A contract of insurance is an agreement by which one party for a consideration promises to pay money or its equivalent, or to do some act of value to the assured, upon the destruction, loss or injury of something in which the assured or other party has an interest, as an indemnity therefor; and it shall be unlawful for any company to make any contract of insurance upon, or concerning any property or interest or lives in this state, or with any resident thereof; or for any person as insurance agent or insurance broker to make, negotiate, solicit, or in any manner aid in the transaction of such insurance unless and \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n except as authorized under the provisions of this chapter. All contracts of insurance on property. lives or interests in this state shall be deemed to be made therein.' Section 5131 of the Mississippi Code of 1930.\n\n'The limitations prescribed in this chapter shall not be changed in any way whatsoever by contract between parties, and any change in such limitations made by any contract stipulation whatsoever shall be absolutely null and void; the object of this statute being to make the period of limitations for the various causes of action the same for all litigants.' Section 2294 of the Mississippi Code of 1930.\n\n The state Supreme Court said (150 So. 205, 207):\n'But clearly under section 5131, Code 1930, defining insurance, this indemnity bond is a contract of insurance within the purview of that statute; and, further, it being expressly provided therein that all contracts of insurance on property, lives, or interests in this state shall be deemed to be made therein, in our judgment, makes the contract herein under review a Mississippi contract and solvable under the laws of this state. The contract here provided or stipulated that the appellee should be indemnified from loss by the defalcation of H. H. Harris in any position anywhere, and when he, the employee and the insured herein, removed to Mississippi and there defaulted, so far as the appellee is concerned its interest was insured or indemnified by the appellant in Mississippi, and, under the provision quoted from the above statute, became operative, and this state is obligated to enforce it, as a Mississippi contract, although it contained all the elements necessary to make it a Tennessee contract, but for the statute. ...\n\n'When the statute declares that such a contract shall be deemed to be made in this state, it means that the conflict of law between the two states is eliminated, and \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 149]\n\u00a0\n thereby, ... a contract for fifteen months' notice was a limitation of the action unenforceable as such in this state.'\n\n The Mississippi statutes, so construed, deprive the appellant of due process of law. A state may limit or prohibit the making of certain contracts within its own territory (Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648\n, 15 S.Ct. 207; Orient Insurance Company v. Daggs, \n172 \nU.S. 557, 565\n, 566 S., 19 S.Ct. 281; New York Life Insurance Company v. Cravens, \n178 \nU.S. 389, 398\n, 399 S., 20 S.Ct. 962); but it cannot extend the effect of its laws beyond its borders so as to destroy or impair the right of citizens of other states to make a contract not operative within its jurisdiction, and lawful where made (New York Life Insurance Company v. Head, \n234 \nU.S. 149\n, 34 S.Ct. 879; AEtna Life Insurance Company v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389, 399\n, 45 S.Ct. 129). Nor may it in an action based upon such a contract enlarge the obligations of the parties to accord with every local statutory policy solely upon the ground that one of the parties is its own citizen. Home Insurance Company v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 408 S., 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701.\n It is urged, however, that in this case the interest insured was in Mississippi when the obligation to indemnify the appellee matured, and it was appellant's duty to make payment there; and these facts justify the state in enlarging the appellant's obligation beyond that stipulated in the bond, to accord with local public policy. The liability was for the payment of money only, and was conditioned upon three events, loss under the policy, notice to the appellant at its home office, and presentation of claim within fifteen months of the termination of the suretyship. All of these conditions were of substantial importance, all were lawful in Tennessee, and all go to the obligation of the contract. It is true the bond contemplated that the employee whose faithfulness was guaranteed might be in any state. He was in fact in Mississippi at the date of loss, as were both obligor and obligee. The contract be- \n\n[292 U.S. 143, 150]\n\u00a0\n ing a Tennessee contract and lawful in that state, could Mississippi, without deprivation of due process, enlarge the appellant's obligations by reason of the state's alleged interest in the transaction? We think not. Conceding that ordinarily a state may prohibit performance within is borders even of a contract validly made elsewhere, if the performance would violate its laws (Home Insurance Company v. Dick, supra, page 408 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701), it may not, on grounds of policy, ignore a right which has lawfully vested elsewhere, if, as here, the interest of the forum has but slight connection with the substance of the contract obligations. Here performance at most involved only the casual payment of money in Mississippi. In such a case the question ought to be regarded as a domestic one to be settled by the law of the state where the contract was made. A legislative policy which attempts to draw to the state of the forum control over the obligations of contracts elsewhere validly consummated and to convert them for all purposes into contracts of the forum, regardless of the relative importance of the interests of the forum as contrasted with those created at the place of the contract, conflicts with the guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment. AEtna Life Insurance Company v. Dunken, supra; Home Insurance Company v. Dick, supra. Cases may occur in which enforcement of a contract as made outside a state may be so repugnant to its vital interests as to justify enforcement in a different manner. Compare Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15, 22\n, 37 S.Ct. 366. But clearly this is not such a case.\n Our conclusion renders unnecessary a consideration of the claims made under the full faith and credit and contract clauses of the Federal Constitution.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEALY v. RATTA(1934)\nNo. 731\nArgued: April 4, 1934Decided: April 30, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First circuit. \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thornton Lorimer, of Rochester, N.H., for appellant.\n Mr. Fred C. Demond, of Concord, N.H., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on appeal from a decree of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, affirming a decree of the District Court for New Hampshire, which enjoined appellant, the chief of police for the city of Manchester, from enforcing the Hawkers' and Peddlers' Act, chapter 102, New Hampshire Laws of 1931, as an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment. An appeal taken directly to this Court from the District Court, three judges sitting, was dismissed for want of jurisdiction here since, in the lower court, appellee had waived his prayer for temporary relief. \n289 \nU.S. 701\n, 53 S.Ct. 522; see Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 47 S.Ct. 385. \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n The act, effective April 14, 1931, requires payment of an annual license tax or fee for every hawker or peddler, defined to be 'any person, either principal or agent, who goes from town to town or from place to place in the same town selling or bartering, or carrying for sale or barter or exposing therefor, any goods, wares or merchandise.' Section 1. The tax is $50 for a state-wide license. Local licenses are obtainable at a rate graduated according to population. That for Manchester is stated to be $85 for each license. Violation of the act is punishable by a fine of not more than $200. Appellee's chief ground of attach upon the statute, sustained by both the courts below, is that it denies the equal protection of the laws by excepting from its operation certain classes of hawkers and peddlers, in which appellee and his agents are not included.\n The bill of complaint alleges that, until the effective date of the act, appellee, a resident of Massachusetts, was engaged in Manchester and elsewhere in New Hampshire in the distribution of vacuum cleaners through their sale and delivery to purchasers by traveling salesmen; that the business was conducted in such a manner as to subject the salesmen to the tax, which they were unwilling or unable to pay; and that their arrest and prosecution, which appellant threatens if they continue to sell without paying the tax, would destroy appellee's business. The value of his business and his loss on account of the enforcement of the act are each alleged to be more than $3,000. Appellant's answer and motion to dismiss the cause, as not within the jurisdiction of the District Court, admit the facts stated in the complaint, so far as now material, except that they deny the allegation that the matter in controversy exceeds $3,000, the jurisdictional amount.\n On this issue a trial was had, in the course of which evidence was given to show the extent of appellee's busi- \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n ness in Manchester and elsewhere in New Hampshire and in adjoining states, and the profits derived from it in New Hampshire both before and after the enactment of the taxing statute. No interlocutory injunction was sought, and after the effective date of the statute appellee changed the method of doing his business in New Hampshire in a way to avoid the necessity of a license, sales being made by sample, with later delivery by shipping the merchandise directly to the purchaser from outside the state. The business was carried on in this manner in 1931 at a loss. It appeared that the total number of salesmen employed in conducting appellee's business in Manchester during 1931, when the statute was enacted, was six, and that in earlier years a larger number had been employed. During those years from twenty-two to twenty-seven salesmen were employed elsewhere in the state.\n It is appellee's contention that the matter in controversy is either the tax which he would be required to pay annually in order to continue his business in New Hampshire, or his right to conduct the business there without payment of the tax, and that the value of each exceeds $3,000. He argues upon the evidence that the expenditure for payment of the tax which he would be obliged to bear in order to continue his business in Manchester is at least $350 per annum, and that the capitalized value of this expenditure would exceed $3,000.\n The District Court concluded that, as the tax which would be imposed for the conduct of appellee's business in Manchester would amount to at least $300 per annum, its capitalized value, which would exceed $3,000, satisfies the jurisdictional requirement. The Court of Appeals thought that the matter in controversy was appellee's right to do business throughout the state, which it valued at more than $3,000.\n It is conceded that the authority of appellant, as chief of police, to make arrests for violation of the statute is \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n restricted to the City of Manchester. The bill of complaint does not allege, nor does appellee assert, that appellant will cause the arrest of his salesmen or otherwise interfere with them or with his business outside the city. The controversy here is that defined by the pleadings, see Smith v. Adams, \n130 \nU.S. 167, 175\n, 9 S.Ct. 566, and the matter in controversy does not embrace more than the right asserted to restrain appellant from compelling compliance with the statute in Manchester by criminal prosecutions. Appellee neither asks, nor could he properly be awarded a decree in the present suit restraining enforcement of the law by police officers elsewhere, and the collateral effect of the decree, by virtue of stare decisis, upon other and distinct controversies, may not be considered in ascertaining whether the jurisdictional amount is involved, even though their decision turns on the same question of law. Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 43 S.Ct. 480; Colvin v. Jacksonville, \n158 \nU.S. 456\n, 15 S.Ct. 866; New England Mortgage Co. v. Gay. \n145 \nU.S. 123\n, 12 S.Ct. 815; Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific R. Co. v. Smith, \n135 \nU.S. 195\n, 10 S.Ct. 728; Gibson v. Shufeldt, \n122 \nU.S. 27\n, 7 S.Ct. 1066; Town of Elgin v. Marshall, \n106 \nU.S. 578\n, 1 S.Ct. 484.\n If the threatened action of appellant is not restrained, the consequence will be either the payment of the tax by appellee, or the suppression of his business in Manchester because of his failure to pay it. Hence we disregard evidence of injury to appellee's business outside the city and of the cost of licenses for doing it, and confine ourselves to the inquiry whether his right to do the business in Manchester or the tax which must be paid for doing the business there is the matter in controversy, and whether the record shows that its value does not exceed $ 3,000.\n That the issue between the parties is the right of the state to collect the tax cannot be gainsaid. There is no question of the authority of a state to suppress the conduct of a business for the nonpayment of an exaction lawfully imposed upon it, or of the appellant's authority \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n to suppress the business here, by threat of criminal prosecution of the salesmen, if this tax is valid. The dispute as to the lawfulness of the tax is the controversy which alone gives vitality to the litigation. Once that is resolved, no other issue survives for decision.\n It has been said that it is the value of the 'object of the suit' which determines the jurisdictional amount in the federal courts, Mississippi & Missouri R.R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485; Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 142\n, 44 S.Ct. 257. But this does not mean objects which are merely collateral or incidental to the determination of the issue raised by the pleadings. The statute itself does not speak of objects of the suit. It confers jurisdiction only if 'the matter in controversy exceeds ... the sum or value of $3,000.' It has never been thought that the federal courts have jurisdiction of suits to restrain the collection of a property tax or other money exaction of less than the jurisdictional amount assailed as unconstitutional, merely because the penalty for nonpayment, which has not been incurred, exceeds that amount. Atlantic Coast Line Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C.) 281 F. 321. The tax, payment of which is demanded or resisted, is the matter in controversy, since payment of it would avoid the penalty and end the dispute. See Ross v. Prentiss, 3 How. 771, 772. Whether and in what manner the penalty for nonpayment may be enforced in the event the tax is valid are but collateral and incidental to the determination whether payment may be exacted. Only when the suit is brought to restrain imposition of a penalty already accrued by reason of failure to comply with the statute or order assailed can the penalty be included as any part of the matter in controversy. See McNeil v. Southern Ry. Co., \n202 \nU.S. 343\n, 26 S.Ct. 722; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Ogden Levee Dist. (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 637; compare Barry v. Edmunds, \n116 \nU.S. 550\n, 6 S. Ct. 501. \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n The case of a tax or fee exacted for the privilege of doing a particular business presents no different considerations. Where a challenged statute commands the suppression or restriction of a business without reference to the payment of any tax, the right to do the business or the injury to it is the matter in controversy. Scott v. Donald, 165, U. S. 107, 17 S.Ct. 262; see Bitterman v. Louisville & Nashville Ry. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 205\n, 28 S.Ct. 91, 12 Ann.Cas. 693; Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322\n, 27 S.Ct. 529; Gallardo v. Questell (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 897. 1 But the possible suppression of the business here, through the prosecution of those who conduct it, is but the threatened consequence or penalty for nonpayment of the challenged tax. It is true that, where there is no method at law to test the legality of a tax without risk of incurring a penalty, the imminence of the penalty may involve such a threat of irreparable injury as to satisfy the requirements of equity jurisdiction. See Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 526\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. But the inability of a taxpayer to litigate the validity of a tax without risk of irreparable injury to his business, which is ground for invoking the equity powers of a federal court, affords no measure of the value of the matter in controversy. Atlantic Coast Line Ry. Co. v. railroad Commission, supra. The disputed tax is the matter in controversy, and its value, not that of the penalty or loss which payment of the tax would avoid, determines the jurisdiction. See Washington & Georgetown R.R. v. District of Columbia, \n146 \nU.S. 227\n, 13 S.Ct. 64; compare Elliott v. Empire Natural Gas Co. (C.C.A.) 4 F.(2d) 493.\n Not only does the language of the statute point to this conclusion, but the policy clearly indicated by the successive acts of Congress regulating the jurisdiction of federal courts supports it. Compare Davis v. Mills (C.C.) 99 F. 39, 40. From the beginning suits between citizens of different \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n states, or involving federal questions, could neither be brought in the federal courts nor removed to them, unless the value of the matter in controversy was more than a specified amount. Cases involving lesser amounts have been left to be dealt with exclusively by state courts, except that judgment of the highest court of a state adjudicating a federal right may be reviewed by this court. Pursuant to this policy the jurisdiction of federal courts of first instance has been narrowed by successive acts of Congress, which have progressively increased the jurisdictional amount. \n2\n The policy of the statute calls for its strict construction. The power reserved to the states, under the Constitution ( Amendment 10), to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the judiciary sections of the Constitution (article 3). See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 233\n, 234 S., 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A. L.R. 1077. Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined. See Matthews v. Rodgers, supra at page 525 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 217; compare Town of Elgin v. Marshall, \n106 \nU.S. 578\n, 1 S.Ct. 484.\n The contested license fees must be paid annually as a condition precedent to doing the business. But it does not follow that capitalization of the tax is the method of determining the value of the matter in controversy. The bill of complaint does not allege, nor can it be assumed, that the appellant will act to compel compliance with the statute by appellee in future years for which no tax is yet payable, or that the appellee will seek to continue his business in Manchester indefinitely in the future, or that \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n the taxing act will be continued on the statute books, unmodified either as to the amount of the tax or the features to which the appellee objects. These, or like considerations, have led to the conclusion that, in suits to enjoin the collection of a tax payable annually or the imposition of penalties in case it is not paid, the sum due or demanded is the matter in controversy, and the amount of the tax, not its capitalized value, is the measure of the jurisdictional amount. Washington & Georgetown R.R. Co. v. District of Columbia, supra; Holt v. Indiana Manufacturing Co., \n176 \nU.S. 68, 72\n, 20 S.Ct. 272; Citizens' Bank v. Cannon, \n164 \nU.S. 319\n, 17 S.Ct. 89; see Atlantic Coast Line v. Railroad Commission, supra; Vicksburg, S. & P.R. Co. v. Nattin (C.C.A.) 58 F. (2d) 979; cf. Wright v. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New york (C.C.A.) 19 F.(2d) 117; Elliott v. Empire Natural Gas Co., supra.\n A different question is presented where the matter in controversy is the validity of a permanent exemption by contract from an annual property tax, Berryman v. Whitman College, \n222 \nU.S. 334, 348\n, 32 S.Ct. 147; see Riverside & A. Ry. Co. v. City of Riverside (C.C.) 118 F. 736; or the validity of an order of a state commission directing a railroad to construct and maintain an unremunerative spur track. Western & Atlantic R. R. v. Railroad Commission, \n261 \nU.S. 264, 267\n, 43 S.Ct. 252. There the value of the matter drawn into controversy, the contract providing permanent immunity from taxation, or the order to maintain a permanent structure for an unlimited time, is more than a limited number of the annual payments demanded. Compare Glenwood Light & Water Co. v. Mutual Light, Heat & Power Co., \n239 \nU.S. 121\n, 36 S.Ct. 30. In such a case the burden which rests on a defendant who challenges the plaintiff's allegation of the jurisdictional amount, see Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322, 333\n, 27 S.Ct. 529, may well not be sustained by the mere showing that the annual payment is less than the jurisdictional amount. \n\n[292 U.S. 263, 272]\n\u00a0\n Here the record shows affirmatively, see Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co . (No. 2), \n170 \nU.S. 468\n, 18 S.Ct. 645, that the total amount of the tax demanded, or which may be demanded, within any time reasonably required to conclude the litigation, is less than the jurisdictional amount; that any action by appellant to compel compliance by appellee or his salesmen with the taxing act in future years is at most conjectural; and that the effect of any decree rendered in the present suit upon the tax for other years, or with respect to appellee's business outside the city of Manchester is collateral to the present controversy. The decree will be reversed, with instructions to the district court to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These and other authorities are discussed in 34 Columbia Law Rev. 311. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The amount originally fixed by section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 at $500, exclusive of costs, 1 Stat. 78, was increased to $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs by Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 552, and to $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, by the Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1091; see 28 USCA  41(1). \n\n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEGEMAN FARMS CORPORATION v. BALDWIN(1934)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from a decree of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.\n Messrs. Leonard Acker and Samuel C. Duberstein, both of Brooklyn, N.Y ., for appellant.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellees.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this suit for an injunction, the appellant, a wholesale milk dealer, contests the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of orders of the New York milk control board limiting the price of milk. A District Court of three judges, organized in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)), has denied a motion by the complainant for an interlocutory injunction, and granted a motion by the defendants to dismiss the bill. 6 F.Supp. 297. No testimony was taken, but, for the purposes of the two motions, certain facts were stipulated and \n\n[293 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n embodied in findings. Nothing important is there added to what is stated in the complaint. From the final decree there has been an appeal to this court. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n The attempt is made in the bill to state two causes of action, pleaded in separate counts. The first cause of action assails the Milk Control Act (N.Y. Laws 1933, c. 158) as a whole, and was dismissed on the authority of Nebbia v. People of State of New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469. It has not been pressed in this Court, and must be treated as abandoned. \n1\n The second cause of action, the only one contested here, assumes provisionally the validity of the statute and assails the orders made under it in their application to appellant. On that head the bill recounts the orders of the board prescribing a minimum selling price to be charged by dealers to their customers and also a minimum buying price to be paid by dealers to producers. The milk sold by the appellant is known as grade B. At the time of the trial the minimum wholesale price for milk of that grade in the city of New York was nine cents per quart, except that dealers such as the appellant marketing their product without a well-established trade-name might sell one cent a quart below the minimum for others. By the same orders the minimum price for fluid milk to be paid to producers was fixed at five cents a quart. A separate schedule of the orders gives the rates for fluid cream. The complainant's license was revoked by the board after notice and a hearing because of underpayments to producers. The license was, however, to be reinstated upon payment of the difference ($23,000). The bill prays a decree cancelling the revocation with exemption for the future.\n The question on this appeal is whether the allegations of the bill, admitted in the stipulation, but not substan- \n\n[293 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n tially enlarged, make out a cause of action. For an understanding of the complainant's position both in its economic and in its legal aspects, the fact is of critical importance that there has been no attempt by the board to fix a maximum price in respect of any of the transactions subject to its regulatory power. What is fixed is a minimum only. None the less, the competition among dealers is so keen that in practice the legal minimum is the maximum that the appellant is able to charge. The 'spread' between what must be paid to the producers and what can be collected from the customers is so small that it 'is insufficient in amount to afford plaintiff a fair return on the present fair value of the properties devoted by it to its milk business less depreciation.' This the bill and findings state. They tell us also that the properties have a value of more than $450,000. They do not tell us whether the appellant ran its business with reasonable efficiency when compared with others in its calling. They do not even tell us whether it was earning a fair return on its investment before the orders were adopted. The omission is the more significant because, according to official records, the 'spread' has been increased, instead of being diminished, through the operation of control. Report of the Milk Control Board, March 1934, pp. 17, 18.2 For all that appears upon this record, a change of the minimum prices would avail the appellant nothing if a corresponding increase or reduction were allowed to its competitors. It might still be driven to the wall without the aid of a differential that would neutral- \n\n[293 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n ize inequalities of capacity or power. If different minima would help, the pleading leaves us in the dark as to what those minima should be. There is no statement that a different selling price could be fixed with fairness to consumers, or a different purchasing price with fairness to producers. The appellant's grievance amounts to this, that it is operating at a loss, though other dealers more efficient or economical or better known to the public may be operating at a profit.\n A bill of complaint so uncertain in aim and so meager in particulars falls short of the standard of candor and precision set up by our decisions. Public Service Comm. of Montana v. Great Northern Utilities Co., \n289 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 53 S.Ct. 546; AEtna Ins. Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174. True the appellant is losing money under the orders now in force. For anything shown in the bill it was losing money before. For anything there shown other dealers at the same prices may now be earning profits; at all events they are content, or they would be led by self-interest to raise the present level. We are unable to infer from these fragmentary data that there has been anything perverse or arbitrary in the action of the board. To make the selling level higher might be unfair to the consumers; to make the purchasing level lower might bring ruin to producers. The appellant would have us say that minimum prices must be changed whenever a particular dealer can show that the effect of the schedule in its application to himself is to deprive him of a profit. This is not enough to subject administrative rulings to revision by the courts. If the designation of a minimum price is within the scope of the police power, expenses or losses made necessary thereby must be borne as an incident, unless the order goes so far beyond the needs of the occasion as to be turned into an act of tyranny. Nothing of the kind is charged. The Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a business against the hazards of competition. \n\n[293 U.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n Public Service Comm. of Montana v. Great Northern Utilities Co., supra, at page 135 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 546. It is from hazards of that order, and not from restraints of law capriciously imposed, that the appellant seeks relief. The refuge from its ills is not in constitutional immunities.\n Much is made of a supposed analogy between the plight in which the appellant finds itself and that of public utilities subjected to maximum rates that do not yield a fair return. But the analogy, when scrutinized, is seen to be unreal. A public utility in such circumstances has no outlet of escape. If it is running its business with reasonable economy, it must break the law or bleed to death. But that is not the alternative offered where the law prescribes a minimum. An outlet is then available to the regulated business, an outlet that presumably will be utilized whenever use becomes expedient. If the price is not raised, the reason must be that efficient operators find that they can get along without a change. Either that must be so, or else, as was pointed out in the opinion below, the industry will perish. The bill does not suggest that such a catastrophe is imminent. True, of course, it is that the weaker members of the group (the marginal operators or even others above the margin)may find themselves unable to keep pace with the stronger, but it is their comparative inefficiency, not tyrannical compulsion, that makes them laggards in the race. Whether a wise statecraft will favor or condemn this exaltation of the strong is a matter of legislative policy with which courts are not concerned. To pass judgment on it, there is need that the field of vision be expanded to take in all the contestants in the race for economic welfare, and not some of them only. The small dealer may suffer, but the small producer may be helped, and an industry vital to the state thus rescued from extinction. Such, at any rate, is the theory that animates the statute, if we look to the official declaration of the purpose \n\n[293 U.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n of its framers. Nebbia v. People of State of New York, supra, pages 515, 516 of 291 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 505. The question is not for us whether the workings of the law have verified the theory or disproved it. At least, a law so animated is rescued from the reproach of favoritism for the powerful to the prejudice of the lowly. If the orders made thereunder are not arbitrary fiats, the courts will stand aloof.\n The statute (N.Y. Laws 1933, c. 158,  312(d, f) contains provisions whereby a dealer dissatisfied with any administrative order may be heard in opposition, or may apply to the board afterwards to modify its ruling. This is an administrative remedy which in the one form or the other the appellant should have utilized before resorting to a suit. P. F. Petersen Baking Co. v.

The court below affirmed this action, and the matter is here by certiorari. The meager stipulated facts present only a narrow point; and to that our decision must be limited. \n\n[291 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n Respondent is a New Jersey corporation the nature of whose business is undisclosed. Its books are kept on the accrual basis.\n The Sen Sen Chiclet Company, incorporated under the laws of Maine, also carried on an undiclosed business. In 1909 it issued a series of 20 year bonds-whether secured by a lien, or otherwise, does not appear. The indenture under which they issued required that $50,000 be supplied each year which the trustee should use for purchasing outstanding bonds.\n In 1914 respondent bought all assets of the Sen Sen Company. In part payment it assumed all outstanding liabilities of the seller-among them $2, 425,000 of the 1909 bonds. There is nothing in the record to show the nature of these assets, or what became of them, or the outcome of the transaction.\n Respondent purchased in 1922 $82,000 of the Sen Sen bonds for $55,650. 94-$26,349.06 less than their face. During 1924 it and the trustee under the indenture purchased $59,000 of the same bonds for $47,602.10-$11,397. 90 below their par value. Likewise, during 1925 they purchased $201,500 for $186,146.31-$15,353.69 less than their face.\n The Commissioner treated these differences-$26,349.06, $11,397.90 and $ 15,353.69-as income realized by respondent. The Board of Tax Appeals ruled otherwise and said: 'The payments involved in the transactions under consideration were payments on the purchase price of the Sen Sen Chiclet Company's assets, paid, under the conditions of the agreement, to the holders of that company's bonds. When all of the bonds have been retired by the petitioner its obligations to the Sen Sen Chiclet Company will have been satisfied in full, and whatever the total amount paid to retire the bonds, it will constitute a \n\n[291 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n part of the cost to petitioner of the Sen Sen Chiclet Co. assets.'\n In support of the same view, the Circuit Court of Appeals said: 'When a taxpayer gets money by issuing an obligation which he later discharges for less than its face, the transaction is completed, because money need not be sold or exchanged to be 'realized.' So we read United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., supra, \n284 \nU.S. 1\n, 52 S.Ct. 4. But if he buys property by an obligation in the form of a bond, note, or the like, and if it remains in kind after the debt is paid, there can be no 'gain.' The cost has indeed been definitely settled, but that is only one term of the equation; as long as the other remains at large, there is no 'realized' gain.'\n We know nothing concerning the nature of the assets acquired from the Sen Sen Company, have no means of ascertaining what has become of them, or whether any of them still exist. Nothing indicates whether respondent lost or gained by the transaction.\n The case before us is this:\n In connection with the purchase of the assets of another company, in 1914, respondent assumed-promised to pay-more than $2,000,000 of the seller's outstanding bonds. During 1922, 1924, and 1925 it purchased a considerable number of these bonds in the market at less than their face. The Commissioner assessed the difference between these two amounts as income.\n We find nothing to distinguish this cause in principle from United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., \n284 \nU.S. 1\n, 52 S.Ct. 4. The doctrine there announced is controlling here. Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co ., \n271 \nU.S. 170\n, 46 S.Ct. 449, is not applicable. The final outcome of the dealings was revealed-the taxpayer suffered a loss. Here, for aught we know, there was substantial profit-certainly, the record does not show the \n\n[291 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n contrary. Doubtless, respondent's books indicated a decrease of liabilities with corresponding increase of net assets.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. BLISS(1934)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. James Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. R. L. Von Bernuth and James M. Rose, both of New York City, for respondent Bliss.\n Messrs. Hugh Satterlee, of New York City, and J. E. MacCloskey, Jr., of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent Harbison.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question whether deductions on account of charitable contributions are to be taken from net income as defined by section 21, or from ordinary net income as defined by section 101(c)(7), of the Revenue Act of 1928.1 Though the deductions claimed and disallowed in the two cases differ in amount, the principle involved \n\n[293 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n is the same in both, and statement of the facts in No. 6 will suffice.\n In 1928 respondent had a net income (before any deduction for contributions to charity) of approximately $500,000. Some $211,000 of this was gain from the sale of capital assets, upon which she elected to be taxed at the rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. pursuant to section 101 of the act ( 26 USCA  2101). During the year she made charitable contributions, as defined in the statute, to the amount of approximately $44,000. In her return she deducted the amount of the contributions from her total net income. She paid tax on $211,000 of the net income, after the deduction, at the rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. and on the balance at normal and surtax rates. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled the respondent could not use the $500,000 of net income as a base on which to calculate the 15 per cent. deduction for charitable contributions, but must first subtract the $ 211,000 of net gain on sale of capital assets and use only the balance of $ 289,000 of ordinary net income. A reduction of the allowable deduction for charitable contributions to about $40,000, and a deficiency in tax paid of about $1,000, resulted. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner, but the Circuit Court of Appeals, by a divided court, reversed the Board. \n2\n We granted certiorari (\n292 \nU.S. 617\n, 54 S.Ct. 715).\n For 'net income,' the base specified in section 23(n) (26 USCA  2023(n) upon which the 15 per cent. deduction of charitable contribu- \n\n[293 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n tions is to be calculated, the petitioner would substitute 'ordinary net income' as defined in section 101. So to read the act would violate its plain terms and run counter to the history of the legislation.\n The scheme of all the Revenue Acts since that of 1916 has been to sweep all income of every sort, including capital gains, into what is denominated gross income and to authorize certain deductions therefrom in order to arrive at net income,-the base for calculation of the tax. In the Act of October 3, 1917, 3 Congress, in order to encourage gifts to religious, educational and other charitable objects, granted the privilege of deducting such gifts from gross income, but limited the total deduction to 15 per cent. of the taxpayer's net income, calculated in the first instance without reference to the amount of such contributions. All of the later acts have contained a like provision. The acts provide that the taxpayer shall first deduct from gross income the total of all permissible deductions save that for contributions, thus arriving at a provisional net income, and then deduct therefrom his contributions, but in no event to an amount greater than 15 per cent. of the provisional net income. By the last mentioned operation the final net income-the base for calculation of the tax-is ascertained. The relevant sections of the Act of 1928 are typical. They are copied in the margin. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n Commencing with the Revenue Act of 1921 Congress, in order to encourage realization of profits on capital assets, saw fit to relieve gain thus derived of the heavy surtaxes then applicable, and to permit the payment of tax at a flat rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. on so much of the taxpayer's income as represented the net gain from capital transactions. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The accomplishment of this purpose of applying two rates to two different kinds of net income, required new provisions as to the base for each rate. Section 101 of the Revenue Act of 1928 prescribes the method to be followed. So far as material it is set forth in the margin. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n In extending this relief to taxpayers, Congress might have modified the privilege theretofore existing with respect to charitable contributions, by directing that they should \n\n[293 U.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n be deducted solely from capital net gain or should be apportioned and deducted ratably from ordinary net income and from capital net gain. The Acts, however, evince no such purpose. In the Act of 1928, as will be seen by reference to sections 21, 22 and 23 (26 USCA  2021, 2022, 2023), supra, note 4, the statutory concept of the income is preserved. These sections are found in part 2 of title 1, which deals with 'Computation of Net Income.' Section 101 (26 USCA  2101), on the other hand, is found under 'Supplemental Provisions,' and is captioned 'Supplement A-Rates of Tax.' It is obviously directed to the matter of computation of tax on a portion of net income as defined in section 21. There is nothing novel in such a division of the statutory net income into parts for the purpose of applying different rates of tax, as witness the provisions fixing the rates on those portions of the entire net income attributable to dividends, earned income, interest on United States obligations, and gains from the sale of mines, and allowing credits for dependents. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The plain requirements of section 101 are that in ascertaining ordinary net income there shall be excluded from the computation only items of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions. Charitable contributions covered by section 23(n), 26 USCA  2023(n), obviously are not capital deductions as defined by section 101(c)(3), 26 USCA  2101(c)( 3), but on the contrary are 'ordinary deductions' within the meaning of section 101(c)(4), 26 USCA  2101(c)(4).\n By the express words of section 23(n) charitable contributions are to be deducted to ascertain net income as defined in section 21; and nothing in section 101, which prescribes merely a method for segregating a portion of that net income for taxation at a special rate, in any wise alters the right of the taxpayer to take the deduction in accordance with section 23( n).\n If the meaning of the act were doubtful, we should still reach the same conclusion. The exemption of in- \n\n[293 U.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n come devoted to charity and the reduction of the rate of tax on capital gains were liberalizations of the law in the taxpayer's favor, were begotten from motives of public policy, and are not to be narrowly construed. Nor should the reduction in the rate of tax on capital gain, first granted in the Revenue Act of 1921, be held to circumscribe the privilege granted in the earlier Acts, and retained in later ones, with respect to charitable contributions, unless that result be plainly required by the language used. As has been shown the statutes if read as written lead to a contrary result. Moreover, from 1923 to 1932 the Commissioner uniformly ruled that the deduction for charitable contributions was to be taken from net income before computation of the tax and hence in whole from ordinary net income. \n8\n The re-enactment in later Acts of the sections permitting the deduction indicate Congressional approval of this administrative interpretation.\n The judgments are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 Stat. 797, 811, U.S.C.

Brian Holland, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. Edwin H. Cassels, of Chicago, Ill., for Charles J. Canfield and William R. Thorsen.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question of the construction of the following provisions of section 201 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 228:\n'Sec. 201. (a) That the term 'dividend' when used in this title ... means any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders or members, whether in cash or in other property, out of its earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. ...\n\n'(b) For the purposes of this Act every distribution is made out of earnings or profits, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits, to the extent of such earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913; but any earnings or profits accumulated or increase in value of property accrued prior to March 1, 1913, may be distributed exempt from the tax, after the earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, have been distributed. ...'\n\n The respondent in No. 158 and the petitioner in No. 212 are stockholders of the West Side Lumber Company, a California corporation. The question is as to the amount \n\n[291 U.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n properly taxable against them as their respective shares of a dividend of $ 5,100,000 paid by that company on April 14, 1923\n\n\n The findings of fact state that, in addition to its original capital of $1,500,000, the company had a surplus on March 1, 1913, of $4,332,684. 78. Its profits and losses in the following years-ending on February 28 in each year-were as follows: 1914, a profit of $4,594.62; 1915, a loss of $ 193,139.67; 1916, a loss of $211,707.32; 1917 to 1923, inclusive, and from February 28, 1923, to April 14, 1923, profits aggregating $2,450,688.30. Prior to the dividend here involved, and for the years 1918 to 1923, the company had paid dividends amounting to $1,290,000.\n The question is as to the proper treatment of the lesses of 1915 and 1916. If these losses, over the profits of 1914, are not treated as reducing the surplus of March 1, 1913, but are charged against the subsequent profits, the entire amount of that surplus, or $4,332,684.78, was distributable exempt from the tax after the profits subsequent to February 28, 1913, had been distributed. On this basis, for which the taxpayers contend, the profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, would be deemed to amount to $2,050,435.93, leaving subject to the tax, after deducting prior dividends, the sum of $760,435.93.\n If the losses of 1915 and 1916, over the profits of 1914, are treated as reducing the surplus of March 1, 1913, there remained of that surplus, on February 28, 1916, the sum of $3,932,432.41, which was distributable exempt from the tax after the subsequent profits had been distributed. With this application of the losses of 1915 and 1916, the subsequent profits subject to tax, after deducting prior dividends, amounted to $1, 160,688.30.\n The Board of Tax Appeals adopted the latter view and directed the determination of deficiencies accordingly. 24 \n\n[291 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n B.T.A. 480. That decision was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit as to the respondent Canfield in No. 158 (62 F.(2d) 751), and was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as to the petitioner Thorsen in No. 212 (65 F.(2d) 234). The cases come here on certiorari.\n In deciding between these conflicting views, the outstanding, and we think the controlling, fact is that on February 28, 1916, the surplus of March 1, 1913, had actually been diminished by losses. The company continued in business after March 1, 1913, and exposed its accumulated profits to the hazard of that business. On February 28, 1914, the company still had those profits and an additional profit of $4,594.62. But in the next two years the company lost $404,846.99, so that the surplus of March 1, 1913, was invaded. It is inaccurate to say that this was merely a matter of bookkeeping. Under the findings of fact, the losses must be deemed to have been actual losses, not mere bookkeeping entries. Hence the decrease of the pre-existing surplus was actual-as real as the pre- existing surplus itself, as real as the subsequent profits. The surplus of March 1, 1913, was the amount of net assets over liabilities including capital stock. \n1\n When the losses of 1915 and 1916 were suffered, the net assets of March 1, 1913, shrunk accordingly.\n In the presence of that inescapable fact, the question is not whether the company could distribute, as being surplus of March 1, 1913, what no longer remained of that surplus-a manifest impossibility-but whether the statute entitled the company to treat subsequent profits as restoring what had been lost of the surplus of March 1, 1913, so that, to the extent of that replacement, the subsequent profits could be distributed to stockholders free \n\n[291 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n of tax. That the question is one of such a replacement would be strikingly evident if the whole of the surplus of March 1, 1913, had been lost and an attempt had been made to treat later profits as restoring it. The fact that only a part of the surplus was lost does not alter the question as related to that part.\n The argument that the surplus of March 1, 1913, constituted capital is unavailing. We are not here concerned with capital in the sense of fixed or paid-in capital, which is not to be impaired, or with the restoration of such capital where there has been impairment. \n2\n No case of impairment of capital is presented. We are dealing with a distribution of accumulated profits. Nor is it important that the accumulated profits as they stood on March 1, 1913, constituted capital of the company as distinguished from the gains or income which the company subsequently realized. \n3\n When a corporation continued in business after March 1, 1913, the dividends it later declared and paid to its stockholders, whether out of current earnings or from profits accumulated prior to that date, constituted income to the stockholders, and not capital, and were taxable as income if the Congress saw fit to impose the tax. Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S.Ct. 543. The provision of the act of Congress under consideration was a 'concession to the equity of stockholders' with respect to receipts as to which they had no constitutional immunity. There is no question here of the receipt of 'capital.'\n The fundamental contention of the taxpayers is that the statute created two distinct periods for tax purposes; that the accumulations for each period constituted 'a \n\n[291 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n fixed and static amount, not to be changed by happenings after the end of the period.' That the statute does relate to two periods, the dividing line being March 1, 1913, and that the periods are distinct, is obvious. But it does not follow because there are two distinct periods that the accumulations for each period constitute 'a fixed and static amount' and are to remain unaffected despite the vicissitudes of business. To attribute to the accumulated profits or surplus of March 1, 1913, embarked in a continued business, such a static condition is to ignore the course of business and to impute to the Congress an intention to consider, for tax purposes, the existence of that surplus as still continued, notwithstanding its actual diminution or exhaustion. Such an intention to disregard realities so as to afford immunity from a tax is not lightly to be ascribed to the taxing authority. The 'equity of stockholders,' which we said in Lynch v. Hornby, supra, the Congress probably had in view, might reasonably require freedom from taxation on receiving a distribution of the accumulated profits of March 1, 1913, where those profits remained intact, but that equity is not apparent when those profits had been lost in whole or in part, and immunity is sought from the taxation of an equivalent amount of profits subsequently earned.\n Paragraphs (2) and (b) of section 201 disclose a single purpose, and are to be construed in harmony with each other. They show that the Congress was careful to arrange its plan so that the right to receive, free of tax, a distribution of surplus accumulated prior to March 1, 1913, should not be exercised in such a fashion as to permit profits accumulated after that date to escape taxation. To that end the Congress provided that 'every distribution is made out of earnings or profits, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits, to the extent of such earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913.' Then follows the exemption which is strictly limited to a \n\n[291 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n distribution of profits accumulated prior to March 1, 1913. Nothing is said as to a restoration of those profits out of subsequent earnings if the former have been lost.\n The argument for the stockholders stresses the word 'accumulated.' We think that the expression is made to carry too heavy a burden. The argument is substantially the same as that which is based on what seems to us to be an artificial conception of the two periods. What had been 'accumulated' prior to March 1, 1913, was obviously not immune from the risk of loss. It is urged that the same rule should be applied whether the losses in the subsequent years preceded or succeeded the making of profits. But the actual course of events is not to be ignored. If there had been profits immediately after March 1, 1913, sufficient in amount to absorb later losses incurred before the time of distribution, it is manifest that the profits accumulated prior to March 1, 1913, would have remained intact. The case is different where, in the absence of such profits, losses necessarily diminish the prior accumulations. Thus in the instant case there were no profits accumulated after March 1, 1913, and prior to February 28, 1916, except the small amount in 1914 which was wiped out by the losses of the two succeeding years. The profits from February 28, 1916, to February 28, 1919, amounted to $327,134.45. If there had been a distribution of these profits on February 28, 1919, it could not have been maintained that they constituted part of the surplus existing on March 1, 1913, or that they should escape taxation on the theory that they made good prior losses which had actually reduced that surplus. And the same is true of the profits subsequently made. Administrative practice appears to have been in accord with this view. See A.R.M. 82, 3 Cumulative Bulletin 36 (1920).\n Our conclusion is that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in No. 158 should be reversed and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 212 should be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Edwards v.

Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles F. Fawsett, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Bristol iron ore mine in Michigan, while subject to a fourteen year lease providing for royalties of 19 cents per ton, was conveyed to three trustees to hold during two lives and twenty-one years with power to manage, sell, lease, mortgage, or otherwise dispose thereof. After providing for payment of taxes, expenses, etc., the deed directed: 'Except as above authorized to be expended, paid out or retained, all proceeds which shall come to the hands of the Trustees from said property or from any use which may be made thereof, or from any source whatsoever hereunder as received by the Trustees shall belong to and be \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n the property of the beneficiaries hereunder to be distributed and paid over to them in proportion to and in accordance with their respective interests as shown herein, or as the same shall from time to time appear as hereinafter provided.'\n Respondents are the beneficiaries under the deed and owners of the entire economic interest in the mine. Its life was estimated as nine years. Proper depletion allowance would be 13.255 cents per ton of ore extracted.\n During the years 1922 to 1926 the trustees collected large sums as royalties. After deducting expenses they distributed what remained among the beneficiaries. Claims for depletion made by the trustees in their tax returns were disallowed.\n Each beneficiary claimed the right to deduct from the total received his proportionate share of the depletion. This, he maintained, was not subject to taxation under the statute. The Commissioner demanded payment reckoned upon the whole amount; and the Board of Tax Appeals accepted his view. The court below thought otherwise and sustained the taxpayers.\n There is no substantial dispute concerning the facts. Our decision must turn upon construction of the statute.\n The Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 233, 239, 241, 246, 247, imposes a tax upon the net income of property held in trust, sections 210, 211, 219, and directs that in order to determine this there shall be deducted from gross 'in the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case.' Section 214(a)(10).\n Also it requires the fiduciary to make return of the income of the trust, section 219(b), and provides that whenever income must be distributed to beneficiaries periodically the amounts paid out shall be allowed as an addi- \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n tional deduction in computing the net income of the trusts. In the latter event there shall be included in computing the net income of each beneficiary so much of the income of the trust as he has received. Section 219(e).1\n The relevant provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1924 (c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 269, 272, 275) and 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 26, 28, 32, 26 USCA  955(a)(9), 956(b), 960 note) are substantially the same as those in the Act of 1921\n\n\n The argument for the Commissioner is this-The entire proceeds from the working of a mine constitute income within the constitutional provision and may be subjected to taxation without regard to depletion. Here the beneficiary claims deduction for an item subject to taxation as gross income; but no provision in the statute allows him to subtract anything because of depletion.\n Moreover, section 219 expressly requires every beneficiary to include in his return the portion of the income of a trust distributed to him. Thus in terms he is subjected to taxation upon the whole of this.\n Whatever may be said concerning the power of Congress to treat the entire proceeds of a mine as income, ob- \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n viously this statute has not undertaken so to do. The plain purpose, we think, was to tax only that portion of the proceeds remaining after proper allowance for depletion. This allowance represents property consumed, is treated as if capital assets, and no tax is laid upon it. The statute must be so applied in practice as to carry out this purpose. The intention was that owners of beneficial interests should not be unduly burdened.\n Since 1913 all Revenue Acts have left untaxed the proceeds of a mine so far as these represent actual depletion. And this court has often recognized that this immunity enures to the beneficial owners of the economic interest.\n Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 45 S.Ct. 274, 276. 'The plain, clear, and reasonable meaning of the statute seems to be that the reasonable allowance for depletion in case of a mine is to be made to every one whose property right and interest therein has been depleted by the extration and disposition 'of the product thereof which has been mined and sold during the year for which the return and computation are made.'\n United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 302\n, 47 S.Ct. 608, 610. 'The depletion charge permitted as a deduction from the gross income in determining the taxable income of mines for any year represents the reduction in the mineral contents of the resreves from which the product is taken. The reserves are recognized as wasting assets. The depletion effected by operation is likened to the using up of raw material in making the product of a manufacturing establishment. As the cost of the raw material must be deducted from the gross income before the net income can be determined, so the estimated cost of the part of the reserve used up is allowed.'\n Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299, 302\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, 162. 'We think it no longer open to doubt that, when the execution of an oil and gas lease is followed by production of oil, the bonus and royalties paid to the lessor both involve at \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n least some return of his capital investment in oil in the ground, for which a depletion allowance must be made.'\n Palmer v. Bender, Administratrix, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226. 'That the allowance for depletion is not made dependent upon the particular legal form of the taxpayer's interest in the property to be depleted was recognized by this Court in Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364\n, 45 S.Ct. 274. ... But this Court held that, regardless of the technical ownership of the ore before severance, the taxpayer, by his lease, had acquired legal control of a valuable economic interest in the ore capable of realization as gross income by the exercise of his mining rights under the lease. Depletion was therefore allowed. Similarly, the lessor's right to a depletion allowance does not depend upon his retention of ownership or any other particular form of legal interest in the mineral content of the land. It is enough if by virtue of the leasing transaction he has retained a right to share in the oil produced. If so, he has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production.'\n Freuler, Adm., v. Helvering, Commissioner, \n291 \nU.S. 35\n, 54 S.Ct. 308 (January 8, 1934), construed section 219. We there said: 'Plainly the section contemplates the taxation of the entire net income of the trust. Plainly, also, the fiduciary, in computing net income, is authorized to make whatever appropriate decuctions other taxpayers are allowed by law. The net income ascertained by this operation, and that only, is the taxable income. ... But as the tax on the entire net income of the trust is to be paid by the fiduciary or the beneficiaries or partly by each, the beneficicary's share of the income is considered his property from the moment of its receipt by the estate. ... For the purpose of imposing the tax the Act regards ownership, the right of property in the beneficiary, as equivalent to physical possession. ...'\n True it is that section 219(b) directs that in cases of 'income which is to be distributed to the beneficiaries periodically, ... \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n the tax shall not be paid by the fiduciary, but there shall be included in computing the net income of each beneficiary that part of the income of the estate or trust for its taxable year which, pursuant to the instrument or order governing the distribution, is distributable to such beneficiary.' But we cannot accept the view that this was intended to impose a tax upon that part of the proceeds which represents the return of capital assets, whenever this has been paid over to the beneficiary. In cases like the one before us so to hold would in practice result in taxing allowances for depletion, contrary to what we regard as the plain intent of the statute.\n The petitioner relies upon Anderson, Collector, v. Wilson, \n289 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 53 S.Ct. 417, 419. The conclusion there rests upon the construction of the will. Under it the beneficiaries became entitled to no income until the executors in their discretion should sell the corpus. 'What was given to them was the money forthcoming from a sale . ... Their interest in the corpus was that and nothing more. ... A shrinkage of values between the creation of the power of sale and its discretionary exercise is a loss to the trust, which may be allowable as a deduction upon a return by the trustees. It is not a loss to a legatee who has received his legacy in full.'\n Here the governing instrument directed payment to the beneficiaries of the entire proceeds, less expenditures, etc., and the trustees must be regarded as a mere conduit for passing them to the beneficial owners. Part only of the proceeds was subjected to taxation. The other part was left untaxed and remained so in the hands of the beneficiaries.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be reversed. By a trust created by the lessor of a mine, the trustees were authorized to collect the stipulated cash royalties \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n of 19 cents per ton on ore mined, and to distribute them to the beneficiaries, who are the taxpayers here, without setting up any reserve for depletion of the lessor's capital investment in the mine. The beneficiaries were given no other interest in the trust property or its income. It is not denied that the entire amount thus received by them is income which may be taxed. See Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 108 S., 53 S.Ct. 74; Bankers Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308, 310\n, 53 S.Ct. 150; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 36 S.Ct. 278. Cf. Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S.Ct 543. And the tax is imposed on the entire amount received, subject only to such deductions as the statute permits. The sole question to be decided is whether they are entitled to the benefit of the statute authorizing the taxpayer, in computing the tax, to deduct from income 'a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements according to the peculiar conditions in each case.'\n As the statute permits the deduction only because the allowance represents a return to the taxpayer, in the form of income, for some part of his capital worn away or exhausted in the process of producing the income, see Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161; Bankers Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, supra; United States v. Dakota- Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459\n, 53 S.Ct. 435, it would seem plain that there is no occasion for a depletion allowance, and that the statute authorizes none where as here the taxpayer, a donee of the income, has made no capital investment in the property which has produced it. This was not doubted where the deduction claimed, but denied, was for depreciation, Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333\n, 49 S.Ct. 337, and it was only because the court concluded that the taxpayer had made a capital investment, represented by the minerals in place, that he was permitted to deduct an allowance for depletion from royalties received from the production of an oil well in Palmer v. Bender, 287 U.S. \n\n[291 U.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n 551, 53 S.Ct. 225, and of a mine in Lynch v. Alworth- Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364\n, 45 S.Ct. 274. The function of the allowance for depletion as a means of securing to the taxpayer a credit against gross income for so much of his capital investment as is restored from the income does not differ from that for depreciation or obsolescence when allowed as a deduction. See United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295\n, 47 S.Ct. 608; Gambrinus Brewery Co. v. Anderson, \n282 \nU.S. 638\n, 51 S.Ct. 260; United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., supra. Legally and economically the statutory allowances for depletion and depreciation stand on the same footing. Both are means of restoring capital invested, the one, in ore, the other, in structures and improvements. Both are allowed by same language in a single statute. Neither has any function to perform if the taxpayer has made no investment to be restored from income received. The incongruity of allowing the deduction for depletion where the taxpayer has made no capital investment but denying it for depreciation is apparent.\n The income here, derived from mining royalties, cannot be said to be a return of the taxpayer's capital because if paid to the lessor it would have restored to him some part of his capital investment. The lessor, by directing that the royalties be distributed to the beneficiaries, cut himself off from the enjoyment of the privilege which the statute gives to restore his capital investment from royalties, and he has denied that privilege to the trustees. The taxpayer may not claim the benefit of a deduction which the statute grants to another, Dalton v. Bowers, \n287 \nU.S. 404\n, 53 S.Ct. 205; Burnet v. Clark, \n287 \nU.S. 410\n, 53 S.Ct. 207; Burnet v. Commonwealth Improvement Co., \n287 \nU.S. 415\n, 53 S.Ct. 198, and the petitioners are in no better position to claim the privilege because the lessor, to whom it was given, has relinquished it.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 247.\n'Sec. 219. ...

The 1921 Revenue Act (42 Stat. 261),  244(a), defines 'gross in- \n\n[292 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n come' of such companies as that received from interest, dividends, and rents. Premiums and capital gains are excluded. Section 245(a) directs that net income be ascertained by making specified deductions from gross income. These include 4 per cent. of the company's reserve, '(6) Taxes and other expenses paid during the taxable year exclusively upon or with respect to the real estate owned by the company ...' and '(7) A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' But it is provided, section 245(b), that no deduction shall be made under paragraphs (6) and ( 7) 'on account of any real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a life insurance company unless there is included in the return of gross income the rental value of the space so occupied. Such rental value shall be not less than a sum which in addition to any rents received from other tenants shall provide a net income (after deducting taxes, depreciation, and all other expenses) at the rate of 4 per centum per annum of the book value at the end of the taxable year of the real estate so owned or occupied.' Provisions similarly worded and having the same meaning are contained in the Revenue Act of 1924,  244, 245, 43 Stat. 289 (26 USCA  1003, 1004).\n During 1923 and 1924 respondent owned a building of which it occupied part and rented part. Its tax return for each year included in gross income the rents received for the space let and deducted the taxes, expenses, and depreciation chargeable to the whole building. The result for 1923 was a net of $3,615.30, whereas 4 per cent. of book value amounted to $18,400. The result for 1924 was minus $14,629.76, 4 per cent. of the then book value being $19,770.32. The Commissioner, following section 245(b), added to the rents received from lessees in each year a sum sufficient to make the net equal to the required 4 per cent. On that basis the amount of the deficiency for \n\n[292 U.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n 1923 was $298.97 and for 1924 $1,115.65.1 The Board of Tax Appeals held them direct taxes and therefore invalid. 17 B.T.A. 757. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, one of the judges dissenting. 67 F.(2d) 470. Its decision conflicts with Commissioner v. Lafayette Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.7) 67 F.(2d) 209, and Commissioner v. Rockford Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.7) 67 F.( 2d) 213.\n The question for decision is whether the statutory provisions relied on violate the rule that no direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census. Constitution, art. 1,  9, cl. 4. In support of the decision below, respondent maintains that the 'rental value' of the space occupied by it was included in net income and taxed and that the exaction is a direct tax on the land itself and void for lack of apportionment.\n If the statute lays taxes on the part of the building occupied by the owner or upon the rental value of that space, it cannot be sustained for tha would be to lay a direct tax requiring apportionment.

Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110, 114\n, 46 S.Ct. 48.\n Earlier acts taxed life insurance companies' incomes substantially the same as those of other corporations. Because of the character of the business, that method proved unsatisfactory to the Government and to the companies. The provisions under consideration were enacted upon the recommendation of representatives of the latter. As rents received for buildings were required to be included in gross and expenses chargeable to them were allowed to be deducted, it is to be inferred that Congress found- as concededly the fact was-that the annual net yields from investments in such buildings ordinarily amounted to at least 4 per cent. of book value. Where an insurance company owns and occupies the whole of a building, it receives no rents therefor and is not allowed to deduct the expenses chargeable to the building. Where part is used by the company and part let, the rents are required to be included in the gross, but expenses may not be deducted unless, if it be necessary, there is added to the rents received an amount to make the total sufficient, after deduction of expenses, to leave 4 per cent. of book value. All calculations contemplated by section 245(b) are made subject to that limitation. Congress intended that the rule should apply only where rents exceed such 4 per cent. Where they are less than that, addition of the \n\n[292 U.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n prescribed rental value and deduction of expenses operate to increase taxable income. \n2\n The classification is not without foundation.\n The company is not required to include in gross any amount to cover rental value of space used by it, but in order that, subject to the specified limitation, it may have the advantage of deducting a part of the expenses chargeable to the building, it is permitted to make calculations by means of such an addition. The statute does not prescribe any basis for the apportionment of expenses between space used by the company and that for which it receives rents. The calculation indicated operates as such an opportionment where the rents received are more than 4 per cent. of book value, but less than that amount plus expenses. \n3\n In such cases the addition, called rent l value of space occupied by the company, is employed to permit a deduction on account of expenses. That, as is clearly shown in the dissenting opinion, supra, page 473 of 67 F.(2d), is the arithmetical equivalent \n\n[292 U.S. 371, 381]\n\u00a0\n of lessening the deduction by the amount of the so-called rental value.\n Respondent cites nat. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, 48 S.Ct. 591, but the distinction between that case and this one is fundamental and obvious. There the effect of the statutory deduction was to impose a direct tax on the income of exempt securities, amounting to taxation of the securities themselves. We held that the tax imposed, so far as it affected state and municipal bonds, was unconstitutional and that, in so far as it affected United States bonds, it was contrary to the statute. In Denman v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514\n, 51 S. Ct. 269, we held the taxpayer not entitled to deduct the interest on debts incurred to purchase securities the interest on which was exempt. The opinion points out the distinction between that exclusion from deductions and the taxation of exempt securities condemned in Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. United States. As shown above, the prescribed calculation, section 245(b), is in substance a diminution or apportionment of expenses to be deducted from gross income under the circumstances specified. See Anderson v. Forty-Two Broadway Co., \n239 \nU.S. 69\n, 36 S.Ct. 17.\n Unquestionably Congress has power to condition, limit, or deny deductions from gross income in order to arrive at the net that it chooses to tax.

Co., supra, 23, 24 of 240 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 236. It is clear that the provisions under consideration do not lay a tax upon respondent's building or the rental value of the space occupied by it or upon any part of either.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1923, rents were $73,620.48. Taxes, expenses and depreciation were $70,005.18. Book value was stipulated to be $460,000. The commissioner called the difference between $18,400 (4 per cent. of $460, 000) and $3,615.30 ($73,620.48-$70,005.18) or $14,784.70 the 'value of space owned and occupied by company.' That, added to rents received, amounted to $88,405.18. He then subtracted from gross income so increased the sum of permissible deductions, including the $70,005.18.\n In 1924, rents were $71,289.21. Taxes, expenses, and depreciation were $85,918.97. Book value was $494,257.97. The commissioner added $19, 770.32 (4 per cent. of $494,257.97) and $14,629.76 ($71,289.21-$85,918.97) and called the sum, $34,400.08, the 'value of space owned and occupied by company.' That, added to rents received, amounted to $105,689.29; and from gross income so increased were subtracted the deductions, including the $ 85,918.97. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Take for example: Book value of building, $1,000,000; 4 per cent. of book value, $40,000; rents received, $30,000; expenses, $60,000. If the calculation prescribed by section 245(b) is not made, taxable income is $ 30,000.\n The calculation prescribed by section 245(b) follows: Rents, $30,000, plus 'rental value,' $70,000 (expenses, $60,000, minus rents, $30,000, plus the 4 per cent.-$40,000) amounts to $100,000, less expenses, $60,000, leaves taxable income, $40,000.

Article 686, Treasury Regulations, 62 and 65. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Take for example: Book value of building, $1,000,000; 4 per cent. of book value, $40,000; rents received, $50,000; expenses, $60,000.\n On that basis the calculation is: Rents, $50,000 plus 'rental value,' $ 50,000 (expenses, $60,000 minus rents $50,000 plus 4 per cent., $40,000) amounts to $100,000 less expenses $60,000 leaves taxable income $40,000. Deduction of expenses operates to reduce taxable income by $10,000.\n Assume rents received were $100,000. No rental value need be added.

MORGAN'S INC.(1934)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. Brian Holland, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lawrence E. Green and Haskell Cohn, both of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This petition for certiorari, \n292 \nU.S. 618\n, 54 S.Ct. 717, presents for determination the single question, whether the two separate periods in 1925, for which the taxpayer made separate income tax returns, constitute two 'taxable years' within the meaning of section 206 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 17 (26 USCA  937), which permits the taxpayer suffering a net loss in any taxable year to deduct it from taxable gains in the two succeeding taxable years.\n On June 1, 1925, respondent Morgan's, Incorporated, acquired all the voting stock of respondent Haines Furniture Company. Later, and in due course, in compliance with section 240(a) of the act (26 USCA  993(a), and article 634 of Treasury Regulations 69, the Haines Company filed its separate income tax return for the first five months of 1925 preceding the affiliation, \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n and the two affiliated corporations filed a consolidated return for the last seven months of the year and for the calendar years 1926 and 1927. During the seven months' period of 1925, and in 1926 and 1927, Morgan's, Incorporated, reported net income. In the first five and the last seven months of 1925, and in 1926, the Haines Company suffered net losses. In 1927 it made a net profit. Its net loss in the first five months of 1925, before affiliation, was shown in its separate return for that period. Its net losses for the last seven months of 1925 and for the year 1926 were shown in the consolidated returns of the two corporations for those periods and were deducted from the net income of Morgan's, Incorporated, in the returns for each of these periods. In the consolidated return for 1927, the Haines Company brought forward its loss for the first five months of 1925 and deducted it from its net income for 1927, under the provisions of section 206(b) of the act (26 USCA  937(b). The Commissioner disallowed this deduction, and determined a corresponding deficiency for the taxable year 1927. The order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining his action, was set aside by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 68 F.(2d) 325. Like rulings have been made by the Courts of Appeals in other circuits. Arnold Constable Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 69 F.(2d) 788 (C.C.A.2d); Crossett Western Co. v. Commissioner, 73 F. (2d) 307 (C.C.A.3d); Joseph & Feiss Co. v. Commissioner, 70 F.(2d) 804 (C.C.A.6th). A different conclusion was reached in Wishnich-Tumpeer, Inc., v. Commissioner, 77 F.(2d) 774, decided March 12, 1934, by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, under the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2001 et seq.), applied in circumstances and under regulations not involved in the present case.\n Section 206(b) permits the taxpayer to carry forward a net loss sustained 'for any taxable year' and to deduct it from 'net income of the taxpayer for the succeeding taxable year.' If the net loss to be deducted is in excess of the net income for that year, he is permitted to deduct the excess from 'the net income for the next succeed- \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n ing taxable year,' referred to in the section as the 'third year.' In all cases the deduction is to be made under regulations made by the Commissioner.\n It is plain that under this section the Haines Company, had it not taken advantage of the statutory provision authorizing consolidated returns, would have been permitted to carry over its net loss of 1925 for the next two succeeding years, and as it made no profit in 1926 its entire net loss for 1925 could have been deducted from its profit in 1927. But the government contends that the taxpayer has forfeited that privilege by making a return for the first five months of 1925, as it was required to do in order to avail itself of the privilege of making consolidated returns after the date of affiliation. It is said that the two periods in 1925, for which separate returns were made, are two separate taxable years within the meaning of the tax act, so that the 'third year' within which section 206 permits the deduction is, in this case, the year 1926. This construction is required, it is urged, by the definition of 'taxable year' in section 200(a), which reads: '(a) The term 'taxable year' means the calendar year, or the fiscal year ending during such calendar year, upon the basis of which the net income is computed under section 212 or 232 ( section 953 or 984 of this title). The term 'fiscal year' means an accounting period of twelve months ending on the last day of any month other than December. The term 'taxable year' includes, in the case of a return made for a fractional part of a year under the provisions of this title or under regulations prescribed by the commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, the period for which such return is made. The first taxable year, to be called the taxable year 1925, shall be the calendar year 1925 or any fiscal year ending during the calendar year 1925.' U.S.C., title 26,  931(a), 26 USCA  931(a).\n The provision that the term 'taxable year' 'includes' the period of less than twelve months for which a separate return is made. when read only with its imme- \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n diate context, is not free from ambiguity. It may be admitted that the term 'includes' may sometimes be taken as synonymous with 'means,' and the subsection may be taken to require, as the Government contends, that a fractional part of a normal taxable year of twelve months for which a return is made shall be treated, for all purposes, as a separate taxable year.\n But the phraseology is also open to the construction that the word 'includes' is used as the equivalent of 'comprehends' or 'embraces,' and that by it the section merely adopts a familiar device in aid of statutory construction, by providing that wherever other sections refer to a 'taxable year' that phrase may, if the context requires, be taken also to refer to or to 'include' a fractional part of that taxable year, for which a separate return is made. \n1\n If the language is so construed and ap- \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n plied here, 'the loss sustained for any taxable year,' which section 206 permits to be carried forward, would include the loss sustained for the first five months of the taxable year for which the separate return was made, and that loss, as well as any other loss separately reported for the remaining part of the taxable year, not otherwise absorbed, could be carried forward to the taxpayer's next two succeeding taxable years, here the calendar years of 1926 and 1927. This construction finds support in the final sentence of the subsection which declares that the 'first taxable year,' which by definition 'includes' a fractional part of the year, 'shall be the calendar year 1925 or any fiscal year ending during the calendar year 1925.' Obviously the first five months of 1925 could not be the calendar year 1925. But a return made for those months, a fractional part of the year, might be treated, within the meaning of the section, as a return for the calendar year of which they are a part. It plainly is not contemplated that the five months are to be treated as a taxable year different from the calendar year.\n But the true meaning of a single section of a statute in a setting as complex as that of the revenue acts, however precise its language, cannot be ascertained if it be considered apart from related sections, or if the mind be isolated from the history of the income tax legislation of which it is an integral part. See Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 464\n, 54 S.Ct. 806. The revenue acts since the Sixteenth Amendment have consistently assessed income taxes on the basis of annual accounting periods, either the calendar year or the different fiscal year which the taxpayer may adopt. From the beginning these periods have been known as taxable years and the provisions of the taxing statutes have been drafted and enacted with primary reference to such normal accounting periods. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 51 S.Ct. 150; Woolford Realty Co., Inc., v. Rose, \n286 U.S. 319\n, \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n 326, 52 S.Ct. 568. The statutes since 1917, and related regulations, have uniformly required the taxpayers' returns to be made on the basis of the twelve months' accounting period shown by the taxpayer's books, whether it be the calendar year or a different fiscal year. The change of this period by the taxpayer from the calendar to a different fiscal year or the reverse, has been permitted only on consent of the Commissioner and upon compliance with appropriate regulations. These dominating features of income tax legislation were incorporated in the 1926 Act by sections 212, 232 (26 USCA  953, 984), to which section 200( a) expressly refers.\n The definition of 'taxable year' in section 200(a) is therefore incomplete unless it be understood that the period for which a return is made, whether it be for a year or a fractional part of it, is to be related to the twelve months' accounting period of the taxpayer. Where the return is for a period of less than twelve months, the year of which it is a fractional part is the annual accounting period of the taxpayer, which is his taxable year. Here the taxpayers' taxable year, both before and after the year of affiliation, was the calendar year. After affiliation, as before, the affiliated corporations, although filing consolidated returns, continued to be separate taxable units. The consolidated returns operated only to unite them for the purpose of tax computation and the equitable apportionment between them of the tax thus computed. See Woolford Realty Co., Inc., v. Rose, supra, page 328 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 568. During 1925, the year of affiliation, the accounting year of the taxpayers remained the calendar year and was their taxable year in the sense that it was the twelve months' accounting period for which they were bound to report income and pay taxes, although permitted to make separate returns for fractional parts of the year in order that the income for the seven months following affiliation might be reported in a consolidated return. The filing of separate returns for fractional parts of the year did not involve any change of the \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer's accounting year, and had no effect upon the actual net income of the taxpayer for that year, or on the amount of tax payable except insofar as the provisions for a consolidated return were availed of.\n Section 206(b) appeared in the revenue acts prior to the addition, in section 200(a), of the provision that the term 'taxable year' includes fractions of a year. See section 204(b) of the Revenue Acts of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, 1061, and 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 231. In the 1921 Act it allowed to the taxpayer entitled to its benefits two full accounting periods of twelve months each within which he might carry over and deduct losses of an earlier taxable period. In view of the extent to which the practice of fixing the tax with reference to the twelve months' accounting periods of the taxpayer has been recognized and carried into the structure of the revenue acts, only clear and compelling language added to section 200(a) to define the phrase 'taxable year' would justify application of that phrase in the remedial section 206 to periods of less than twelve months, in such manner as to restrict the benefits which like sections had previously extended to taxpayers entitled to enjoy them.\n It is no answer to the arguments of respondent to say, as the Government does, that the meaning of the phrase 'taxable year' must be the same throughout the section. The same meaning need not always be attributed to a phrase which, by hypothesis, has more than one meaning for purposes of statutory construction. By the Government's own construction, 'taxable year' as used in section 206 is taken to mean the first five months of 1925, the last seven months of that year, and the entire calendar year 1926. The question which we have to decide is whether the two taxable years, within which the taxpayer is permitted to deduct his loss are to be taken as the two taxable years of the taxpayer, here the calendar years 1926 and 1927, even though the statute includes in the \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n loss to be deducted that incurred in the first five months of the calendar year 1925\n\n\n The provision of section 200(a), that the term 'taxable year' includes fractions of a year for which a return is required, first appeared in the like section 200(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 254 (26 USCA  931 and note). The corresponding sections 200 of the 1918 and the 1921 Acts (40 Stat. 1057; 42 Stat. 227) made no reference to fractions of a year for which a return is made. They defined the taxable year as the twelve months of the calendar year or of the fiscal year on the basis of which the net income tax computed, although sections 226, 240 of each act and related regulations provided in special circumstances for returns for a fractional part of a year. Before the 1924 Act the Commissioner had ruled that a fractional part of a taxable year for which a tax return was made was not a taxable year, and that in consequence the privilege granted to taxpayers by section 204(b) of those acts of carrying over a loss sustained 'for any taxable year' to the next or the two succeeding taxable years did not extend to losses shown by a return for a fraction of a year. This ruling was sustained by numerous decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals. See Appeal of Takoma Grocery Co., 1 B.T.A. 1062; Appeal of Arthur Walker & Co., 4 B.T.A. 151; Dorsey Drug Co. v. Commissioner, 7 B.T.A. 229; Turners Falls Power & Electric Co. v. Commissioner, 9 B.T.A. 435; General Box Corp. v. Commissioner, 22 B.T.A. 725, 729. The House Ways and Means Committee, in reporting the bill which became the Revenue Act of 1924 explained the amendment to section 200 as follows: 'In subdivision (a) of this section the term 'taxable year' is defined to include a period of less than a year when a return is made for such period. Under the existing law the use of the term 'taxable year' in the 'net loss' section and other sections has been construed not to cover the case of a return made by a taxpayer for a fractional part of a year, with the re- \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n sult that the benefits of such section are denied to taxpayers who are required by law to make a return for a fractional part of a year.' Report 179, Ways and Means Committee, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 10. The report of the Senate Finance Committee uses identical language. Report 398, Finance Committee, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 10.\n The 1918 Act had permitted the carrying over of the loss for a single taxable year. The 1921 Act had extended the privilege for a period of two full years. There is no suggestion in the committee reports that by the 1924 amendment of section 200, in order to extend the benefits, conferred by section 204 in earlier acts, to the taxpayer who makes a return for a fractional part of his taxable year, there was the purpose to withhold from him any of these benefits. The implication is clear that there was not, and that the intention was that a taxpayer filing a return for a part of his taxable year should stand on the same footing, with respect to carrying over a loss shown by his return, as the taxpayer who had filed a return for the entire twelve months of the same taxable year. This intention was made effective by the addition to section 200 of words which, in terms, made the phrase 'taxable year' as used in section 206 include 'in the case of a return for a fractional part of a year,' that part of the taxable year for which the return is made. Thus, under section 206 the loss for a taxable year which may be carried over includes the loss for the fractional part of the taxable year of the taxpayer, for which a separate return is required. The next succeeding taxable years to which the loss may be carried are likewise the taxable years of the taxpayer, here the calendar years 1926 and 1927.\n It is of some significance that Article 634 of Treasury Regulations 69, which in case a consolidated return is made requires a separate return for the fractional part of a year not included in the consolidated return, uses the \n\n[293 U.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n phrase 'taxable year' as referring to the taxable year of the taxpayer, and speaks of the fraction of a year for which a separate return is made as 'the portion of the taxable year' during which the taxpayers were not affiliated. It does not refer to the return as the return for a taxable year, but only as a return for a fractional part of the taxable year and such returns are required to be made and the tax is required to be paid at the same time as in the case of a return for the entire taxable year.\n It is unnecessary to consider the effect to be given to returns required for a fractional part of the year, where the taxpayer changes his taxable year from a calendar year to a different fiscal year, or vice versa, with respect to which different considerations may enter. See Wishnich-Tumpeer, Inc., v. Commissioner, supra.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The terms 'means' and 'includes' are not necessarily synonymous. The distinction in their use is aptly pointed by sections 2, 200 of the act itself (26 USCA  1262, 931). Section 2(a) of the act (see 26 USCA  1262(a) and note) gives general definitions of ten terms; of these, three are stated to 'include' designated particular instances, the other seven are stated to 'mean' the definitions subsequently given. Section 200, in addition to the definitions contained in subsection (a), gives four of which two use the verb 'include' and two the verb 'means.' That the draftsman used these words in a different sense seems clear. The natural distinction would be that where 'means' is employed, the term and its definition are to be interchangeable equivalents, and that the verb 'includes' imports a general class, some of whose particular instances are those specified in the definition. This view finds support in section 2(b) of the act (26 USCA  1262(b), which reads: 'The terms 'includes' and 'including' when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.' This indicates that the particular is not necessarily a substitute for the general term, excluding more general meanings included within its scope. 'Taxable year' is defined in section 200(a) as 'meaning' a calendar or fiscal year of twelve months, and 'including' a fractional part of a year; it hardly can be said that the words plainly and without ambiguity import that in section 206(b) the term must be taken to mean only a fractional part of the year, to the exclusion of the alternative definitions of a calendar or fiscal year. \n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. NEW YORK TRUST CO.(1934)\nNo. 873\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for Guy T. Helvering.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 455, 460]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Chauncey Newlin and J. Du Pratt White, both of New York City, for New York Trust Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This controversy arises out of the calculation of an income tax on the gain realized on the sale of property by a trustee in 1922. April 27, 1906, one Matthiessen acquired 6,000 shares of stock at a cost of $141,375. Its value on March 1, 1913, was less than cost. December 4, 1921, desiring to make provision for his son, Erard, he transferred the stock to the New York Trust Company in trust for him with remainder over in case of his death. When the trust was created, the market value of the stock was $577, 500. The trustee sold it in 1922 for $603,385. In the tax return for that year the trustee included $87,385 as the gain resulting from the sale. That figure was reached by subtracting the cost of the shares to the trustor, then claimed to be $516,000, from the amount the trustee received for them. But the trustee then, as it always has, insisted that the gain should be calculated on the basis of the value at the time of the creation of the trust. And it applied the rate of 12 1\/2 per cent., applicable to capital gains. The Commissioner ascertained gain on the principle adopted in the return, but found the cost to trustor to be $141,375. He applied the normal and surtax rates that ordinarily are laid upon the incomes of individuals, and by the use of these factors arrived at an additional assessment of $238,275.95.1 The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the determination. 27 B.T.A. \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 461]\n\u00a0\n 1127. The lower court held that the gain had been correctly ascertained, but that it was taxable at 12 1\/2 per cent. 68 F. (2d) 19. These writs were granted on petition of the Commissioner and cross-petition of the trustee. \n292 \nU.S. 616\n, 54 S.Ct. 641, 642, 78 L.Ed. --.\n The questions are: (1) Whether the gain resulting from the trustee's sale is the difference between price paid by trustor and that received by trustee, and (2), if so, whether the 12 1\/2 per cent. rate is applicable.\n The Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, governs. Section 2(9) defines taxpayer to include any person, trust, or estate subject to a tax imposed by the act. Section 202(a) provides: 'That the basis for ascertaining the gain derived ... from a sale ... of property ... shall be the cost of such property; except that-... (2) In the case of such property, acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, the basis shall be the same as that which it would have in the hands of the donor.' Section 206(a)(6) defines capital assets to be 'property acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than two years' and (b) provides that the net gain from the sale of capital assets may be taxed at the rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. instead of at the ordinary rates. Section 219(a) declares that the normal and surtax on net incomes of individuals shall apply to the income of property held in trust, including (3) income held for future distribution; (b) the fiduciary is required to make the return of income for the trust. And subsection (c) provides that, in cases under (a)(3), the tax shall be imposed upon the net income of the trust and shall be paid by the fiduciary.\n By the trust indenture, which recites mutual covenants and agreements and the payment of $10 by each to the other as the consideration, the trustor did 'sell, assign, transfer, and convey' the 6,000 shares 'in trust, nevertheless, for the benefit of' his son, Erard, 'to be administered by the trustee' under specified terms and condi- \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 462]\n\u00a0\n tions, among which are these: The trustee was required to hold the shares and any property purchased out of the avails, to collect and retain income until the twenty-first birthday of Erard, then to pay him the accumulated income, thereafter to pay him current income until he attained the age of twenty-five years, and at that time to deliver to him the principal and undistributed income. During the life of the trustor, the trustee was not to sell or reinvest without the written consent and approval of the trustor. In case of Erard's death before the age of twenty-five, the entire estate was to go to other sons of the trustor.\n The trustor irrevocably disposed of the shares. He did not sell, but made a figt. Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n, 53 S.Ct. 369. He gave the trustee legal title temporarily to be held to enable it to conserve, administer, and transfer the property for the use and benefit of his son to whom he gave the beneficial interest. It may rightly be said that the trustee and beneficiary 'acquired by gift' as meant by section 202(a).2 If the broad definition in section 2(9) stood alone, either might be regarded as the taxpayer, but it is qualified by the rule that the trustee must pay the tax. It follows that the trustee properly may be regarded as the taxpayer and, for the purpose of calculating the gain, as having assumed the place of the trustor. Section 202(a)(2) was enacted to prevent evasion of taxes on capital gains. Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470, 479\n, 482 S., 49 S.Ct. 199, 64 A.L.R. 362. And see Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409\n, 50 S.Ct. 164. Transfers to trustees for the benefit of others are clearly within the reason for the enactment. \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 463]\n\u00a0\n They may be used to avoid burdens intended to be imposed, quite as effectively as may gifts that are directly made. The difference between the cost to the trustor in 1906 and the amount for which the trustee sold in 1922 was rightly taken as taxable income of the trust.\n We come to the question whether the gain derived from the trustee's sale is taxable at 12 1\/2 per cent. That rate is not applicable unless the shares were 'capital assets' defined by section 206(a)(6) to be 'property acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than two years.' The time between the creation of the trust and the sale was less than the specified period and, if the words alone are to be looked to, the shares were not by the taxpayer 'held ... for more than two years.' Soon after the passage of the act the Income Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue ruled that property transferred to a trustee, for purposes and upon terms and conditions analogous to those expressed in the indenture before us, which remained in his hands less than two years, was not 'capital assets,' and that the resulting gain was not taxable at the 12 1\/2 per cent. rate. That construction was followed by the Board of Tax Appeals, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. \n3\n The Commissioner says that the words of the definition are free from ambiguity, and that the statute contains no exception. From an opinion of this court he \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 464]\n\u00a0\n invokes these statements: 'If the language be clear it is conclusive. There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.' United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396. He suggests that his construction was approved by the Revenue Act of 1924,  208(a)(8), 43 Stat. 263, 26 USCA  939 note, which retained the definition, and that the provision in the Revenue Act of 1926,  208(a)(8), 44 Stat. 19, 26 USCA  939 note, which conforms to the construction for which the trustee here contends, operated to make a change in the law.\n The rule that, where the statute contains no ambiguity, it must be taken literally and given effect accoring to its language, is a sound one not to be put aside to avoid hardships that may sometimes result from giving effect to the legislative purpose. Commr. of Immigration v. Gottlieb, \n265 \nU.S. 310, 313\n, 44 S.Ct. 528; Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, \n157 \nU.S. 1, 37\n, 15 S.Ct. 508. But the expounding of a statutory provision strictly according to the letter without regard to other parts of the act and legislative history would often defeat the object intended to be accomplished. Speaking through Chief Justice Taney in Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, page 194, this court said: 'It is well settled that, in interpreting a statute, the court will not look merely to a particular clause in which general words may be used, but will take in connection with it the whole statute (or statutes on the same subject) and the objects and policy of the law, as indicated by its various provisions, and give to it such a construction as will carry into execution the will of the Legislature, as thus ascertained, according to its true intent and meaning.' Quite recently in Ozawa v. United States, \n260 U.S. 178\n, page 194, 43 S.Ct. 65, 67, we said: 'It is the duty of this Court to give effect to the intent of Congress. Primarily this intent is ascertained by giving the words their natural significance, but if this leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, we must \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 465]\n\u00a0\n examine the matter further. We may then look to the reason of the enactment and inquire into its antecedent history and give it effect in accordance with its design and purpose, sacrificing, if necessary, the literal meaning in order that the purpose may not fail.' And in Barrett v. Van Pelt, \n268 \nU.S. 85, 90\n, 45 S.Ct. 437, 439, we applied the rule laid down in People v. Utica Ins. Co., 15 Johns. (N.Y.) 358, 381, 8 Am.Dec. 243, that 'a thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter, and a thing which is within the letter of a statute, is not within the statute, unless it is within the intention of the makers.'\n The part of the definition under consideration is this: 'Held ... for more than two years.' Although on superficial inspection the words appear to be entirely clear, the Treasury Department deemed construction necessary to disclose the meaning that, upon consideration of the actual transactions of the taxpayers, it found Congress to have intended. Regulations 62, art. 1651, declares: 'The specific property sold or exchanged must have been held for more than two years, but in the case of a stock dividend the prescribed period applies to the original stock and the stock received as a dividend considered as a unit and where property is exchanged for other property ... the prescribed period applies to the property exchanged and the property received in exchange considered as a unit.' Construed strictly according to the letter, the provision would not include shares received as a dividend less than two years before the sale or property taken in exchange within that period. The need of this regulation illustrates how ambiguities requiring construction often exist where upon first reading the words seem clear. Generally, questions as to the meaning intended do not arise until the language used is compared with the facts or transactions in respect of which the intent and purpose are to be ascertained. Bradley v. Washington, \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 466]\n\u00a0\n Alexandria & Georgetown Steam Packet Company, 13 Pet. 89, 97; Deery v. Cray, 10 Wall. 263, 270; Patch v. White, \n117 \nU.S. 210, 217\n, 6 S.Ct. 617; Gilmer v. Stone, \n120 \nU.S. 586, 590\n, 7 S.Ct. 689; American Net & Twine Co. v. Worthington, \n141 \nU.S. 468, 474\n, 12 S.Ct. 55.\n Legislative reasons for applying the lower rate to capital gains give support to the construction for which the trustee contends. The report of the Committee on Ways and Means states: 'The sale of ... capital assets is now seriously retarded by the fact that gains and profits earned over a series of years are under the present law taxed as a lump sum (and the amount of surtax greatly enhanced thereby) in the year in which the profit is realized. Many such sales, with their possible profit taking and consequent increase of the tax revenue, have been blocked by this feature of the present law. In order to permit such transactions to go forward without fear of a prohibitive tax, the proposed bill, in section 206, adds a new section ... to the income tax, providing that where the net gain derived from the sale or other disposition of capital assets would, under the ordinary procedure, be subjected to an income tax in excess of 15 per cent. (afterwards changed to 12 1\/2 per cent.) the tax upon capital net gain shall be limited to that rate. It is believed that the passage of this provision would materially increase the revenue, not only because it would stimulate profit-taking transactions but because the limitation of 15 per cent. is also applied to capital losses. Under present conditions there are likely to be more losses than gains.' 67th Congress, 1st Session, House Report No. 350, p. 10. See, also, Senate Report No. 275, p. 12. In respect of the legislative purpose to lessen hindrance caused by high normal and surtaxes, there is no distinction between gains derived from a sale made by an owner who has held the property for more than two years and those resulting from one by a donee whose tenure plus that of the donor exceeds that period. \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 467]\n\u00a0\n Here the taxable gain was ascertained by putting together the periods in which the shares were held by trustor and trustee, respectively. The taxable gain was the same as if the former held continuously from the time of purchase in 1906 until the sale in 1922. But to ascertain the applicable rate the Commissioner broke the continuity. If the trustor had held until the sale, the 12 1\/2 per cent. rate would have been applicable and the tax would have been substantially less than one-fourth of the amount assessed against the trustee who, for the purpose of calculating the gain, was substituted for the trustor. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n Sections 202(a)(2) and 206(a)(6) are included in the same act and are applicable respectively to different elements of the same or like transactions and are not to be regarded as wholly unrelated. While undoubtedly legally possible and within the power of Congress, the methods adopted and results attained by the Commissioner are so lacking in harmony as to suggest that the continuity required to be used to get the base was also intended for use in finding the rate. No valid ground has been suggested for requiring tenures to be added for the one purpose and forbidding combination for the other. The legislative purpose to be served by the application of the lower rate upon capital gains is directly opposed to the Commissioner's construction. There is no ground for discrimination such as that to which the trustee was subjected. It is to be inferred that Congress did not intend penalization of that sort.\n The Commissioner's suggestion that, by retaining the same definition in the 1924 act, Congress approved the construction for which he contends, is without merit. The \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 468]\n\u00a0\n definition had not been construed in any Treasury Decision, by the Board of Tax Appeals or by any court prior to that enactment. The dates of all constructions of the definition to which our attention has been called are shown in the margin. \n5\n The regulation above referred to was approved February 15, 1922. In respect of the question here involved, it puts no construction upon the definition. The rulings, I.T. 1379, 1660, and 1889, cited by the Commissioner were made before the passage of the 1924 act, but they 'have none of the force or effect of Treasury Decisions and do not commit the Department to any interpretation of the law.' See cautionary notice published in the bulletins containing these rulings. It does not appear that the attention of Congress had been called to any such construction. There is no ground on which to infer that by the 1924 act Congress intended to approve it.\n The Revenue Act of 1926,  208(a)(8)6 contains substantially the same language as that used in the 1921 act to define capital assets. That part of the subdivision is followed by rules for determining the period for which the taxpayer has held the property. Among them is one applicable to facts such as those presented in the case before us. It is substantially the same as the construction for which the trustee contends. Mere change of language does not necessarily indicate intention to change the law. The purpose of the variation may be to clarify what was doubtful and so to safeguard against misapprehension as \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 469]\n\u00a0\n to existing law. In view of the inclusion of the same definition in the acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926 and the legislative purpose underlying it, the contention that the new words were added to change the meaning of 'capital assets,' as defined in the earlier acts, is without force. The definition so clarified was not new law, but 'a more explicit expression of the purpose of the prior law.' Jordan v. Roche, \n228 \nU.S. 436, 445\n, 33 S.Ct. 573, 576; Merle-Smith v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 837, 842. McCauley v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 44 F.(2d) 919, 920.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n Within the meaning of section 202(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 229) the trustee acquired the trust res by gift. But reference must be had to sections 206 and 219 to ascertain the rate of tax to be applied o the gain on the sale. These are distinct sections, found not in juxtaposition with 202, but in portions of the act dealing with unrelated topics; the one with 'capital Gains' and the other with 'Estates and Trusts.' Confessedly the first grants an exemption from the normal rate of tax and allows payment at a lower rate only to a 'taxpayer' who realizes gain from the sale of a capital asset which he (the 'taxpayer') has held for profit or investment for over two years. The second, in words too plain to be misunderstood, designates the trustee of a trust such as the one here in question as the taxpayer. The unambiguous mandate of the act should be enforced.\n\n 1. \nUnder the recognized rules of construction we should give the words of the statute their ordinary and common meaning. Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 52 S.Ct. 211. If the language be plain, there is nothing to construe. Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 20 S.Ct. 155; Thompson v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 547, 551\n, 38 S.Ct. 349. We cannot enact a law under the pretense of construing one. Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 331\n, 52 S.Ct. 358. \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 470]\n\u00a0\n Nor can we avoid the plain meaning of a statute by construction, so- called, because we think as written it begets 'hard and objectionable or absurd consequences, which probably were not within the contemplation' of its framers. Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55\n, 51 S.Ct. 49. Where, as in the present case, the provision is one granting an exemption from the full rate of taxation, doubts must be resolved against the taxpayer. Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232, 235\n, 48 S.Ct. 65.\n\n 2. \nFor twelve years after the passage of the act the administrative rulings uniformly denied the benefit of the capital gains sections of the act of 1921 to a donee who had not himself held the property over two years. These are entitled to respectful consideration and will not be disregarded except for weighty reasons. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 51 S.Ct. 144. Two Courts of Appeals have decided against the trustee's contention. In the face of this unbroken agreement of the executive and judicial departments, we should be show to announce a contrary view.\n\n 3. \nThe reason assigned for ignoring the plain import of the terms used in sections 206 and 219 is that the provisions, read in their ordinary sense, bring about a result thought to be contradictory of the paramount purpose to permit the payment of tax on capital gains at a reduced rate. The suggestion is that Congress inadvertently omitted a provision whereby the tacking of the tenures of donor and donee would be allowed for finding the rate, since it has required such tacking for ascertaining the base. It is said that it would be absurd to attribute any other intent to the framers of the law. But there is no necessary inconsistency in the two provisions, literally applied. Plainly the requirement that a donee should calculate his gain on the value paid by his donor was to prevent evasions, through transfer and immediate sale by the donee, who would claim the value at the date of the gift \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 471]\n\u00a0\n as the base and assert that he had made no gain. There is no incongruity in declaring that, in the case of a gift, the donee shall pay tax at the full rate unless he shall have held the property a full two years. Congress might well think it proper thus to condition the privilege of a reduced rate to one who paid nothing for the property.\n Assuming, however, for the sake of argument, that there is a logical inconsistency between the prescribed method for arriving at the base and that for ascertaining the rate, it is the province of Congress alone to remove it. There is no abstract justice in any system of taxation. Nothing could involve more dangerous consequences than that the courts should rewrite plain provisions of a tax act in order to bring them into harmony with a supposed gene al policy. Such a principle of decision would embark us on a sea of construction whose bounds it is difficult to envisage. Every revenue act embodies policies which conflict to some extent with those elsewhere in the act evinced. Income tax legislation is a continuous series of corrections and amendments in an effort to make the policy of taxation more congruous.\n The very sections extending the relief of a reduced rate on capital gains teach us how inconsistently the principle has been followed and how impossible and improper it would be for a court to rewrite the sections in an effort to make them logically consistent.\n The act omitted to impose any limitation of 12 1\/2 per cent. on capital net losses. If, therefore, a taxpayer had no capital gains during the year, he could deduct his entire capital losses from his ordinary income. \n1\n This omission was cured by the Revenue Act of 1926, which reduced the permissible deduction from the tax on net income to 12 1\/2 per cent. of capital net loss. 2 The amend- \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 472]\n\u00a0\n ment of 1926, in turn, leaves a glaring inconsistency, for, though the taxpayer may have no actual income, yet, as a result of the application of the mandatory 12 1\/2 per cent. rate to capital net losses, he may have to pay a tax. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Under the act of 1921 capital assets were so defined as to exclude property held for personal use or consumption of the taxpayer or his family. \n4\n By the Revenue Act of 1924 and later acts the exception was omitted. \n5\n It results that, whereas the taxpayer may now include such property as the residence occupied by him, his automobiles, his jewels, and similar items, in respect to gains, he may not include them with respect to losses, for no deduction whatever for losses is permitted in the case of property held for personal use or consumption. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Instances might be multiplied of logical inconsistency in the incidence of the capital gain or loss provisions; but this court is not at liberty, because it thinks the provisions inconsistent or illogical, to rewrite them in order to bring them into harmony with its views as to the underlying purpose of Congress.\n\n 4. \nThe sections in question were re-enacted without change in the Revenue Act of 1924. If, as is suggested, omission of a provision permitting one circumstanced as this trustee to have the benefit of the reduced rate in virtue of his donor's as well as his own tenure was an inad- \n\n[292 U.S. 455, 473]\n\u00a0\n vertence as respects the act of 1921, it is curious that the same inadvertence occurred in the enactment of the 1924 act, despite the fact that the rulings of the department had been against the trustee's present contention. The section was amended by the act of 1926 so as to allow the donee to tack his donor's tenure to make up the required two years. \n7\n In reporting it, the committees of the Senate and House both referred to this as an amendment of the law. The change was recommended in connection with two other alterations of language, both intended to confirm rulings of the department. In referring to this particular alteration the committees said:\n'The same question arises in the case of property received by gift after December 31, 1920. The amendment provides that the period in which the property was held by the donor shall be added to the period in which the property was held by the donee in determining whether or not the property so received falls within the capital gain or loss section.'8\n\n Certainly this language is far from compelling the conclusion pressed upon us, that the amendment was merely a confirmation of the understanding of Congress as to the effect of the earlier acts.\n The judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded for the calculation of the tax to the trustee at ordinary rates for the reason that it did not hold the capital assets for two years, so as to entitle it to the 12 1\/2 per cent. rate.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On the basis of the return made the tax was $14,391.71.

NEWPORT CO.(1934)\nNo. 515\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 485, 486]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles F. Fawsett, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 65 F.(2d) 925, affirming a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, that a deficiency assessment against respondent as transferee of the assets of the Newport Chemical Works, Inc., for 1917 income and profits taxes of the transferor was barred by the statute of limitations.\n In 1919 the Chemical Works, a Maine corporation, after it had filed its tax return for 1917, transferred all its assets to the respondent, a Delaware corporation, which, as consideration for the transfer, issued its stock to the stockholders of the transferor and assumed all liabilities of the transferor. On March 1, 1920, the Supreme Court of Maine entered a decree which purported to dissolve the Chemical Works. The statutory period of limitation for the assessment and collection of the 1917 taxes, as the government concedes, expired on April 1, 1923, five years after the return for that year had been filed. Whether this period was extended by waiver so as to include the date of the deficiency assessment fixed by the Commissioner's sixty-day letter of March 14, 1927, depends on the validity and effect of several documents filed with the Commissioner by the Chemical Works or by respondent.\n During the period from December 15, 1920, to November, 1926, six documents, asserted by the government to be waivers extending the time for assessment, were executed by the Chemical Works by an officer or its general counsel, and lodged with the Commissioner. On or about November 6, 1926, a further waiver extending the period \n\n[291 U.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n for assessment to December 31, 1927, executed by respondent by its president, was filed with the Commissioner.\n The court below and the Board of Tax Appeals both held, as respondent argues here, that the period for assessment and collection of the tax, which had been indefinitely extended by the terms of the first waiver, was terminated and the assessment barred on April 1, 1924, by a departmental ruling (Mimeograph 3085, II-1 Cum. Bull. 174, April 11, 1923); that all the subsequent waivers, before that of November 6, 1926, were void because they were given by the Chemical Works, which had been previously dissolved; and that, as the assessment against the Chemical Works had thus been barred prior to the Revenue Act of 1926, the right to assess the respondent as transferee could not, under the provisions of that act, be revived by respondent's waiver of November 6, 1926\n\n\n Several independent grounds are urged by the government to support the challenged deficiency assessment. The only one which we need now consider is that the waiver of November 6, 1926, unaided by the earlier ones, extended the time for the assessment against the respondent, as transferee of the Chemical Works until its expiry date, December 31, 1927. Before that date the assessment had been made.\n Respondent, as such transferee, became liable for any tax which might have been lawfully assessed against its transferor before the transfer, and section 280(a) of the Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1069(a) directs that such liability 'shall ... be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of a deficiency in a tax imposed' by that act. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, 51 S.Ct. 608. If, as respondent maintains and as the court below held, any assessment was barred before respondent's waiver of November 6, 1926, the effect of that waiver upon the right to assess respondent pursuant to section 280 must be determined by the Revenue Act of 1926. \n\n[291 U.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of the act applicable to limitations and waivers are found in sections 277 and 278. Section 277 (26 USCA  1057) fixes the period of limitation, but section 278(c), 26 USCA  1060 note provides: 'Where both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the time prescribed in section 277 ( section 1057 of this title) for its assessment the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.' Had these provisions stood alone the waiver of November 6, 1926, if otherwise valid, would have extended the time for assessment to the specified date, December 31, 1927, even though it was made after the period for assessment had expired. There is nothing in section 278(c) or related sections which requires that a waiver be given prior to the expiration of the statutory period, and this Court has uniformly held that, under the identical section 278(c) of the 1924 Act (26 USCA  1060 note), the defense of the statute of limitations may be waived by the taxpayer after, as well as before, the expiration of the statutory period. McDonnell v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 420\n, 53 S.Ct. 410; Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270\n, 51 S.Ct. 145; Brown & Sons Lumber Co. v. Burnet, \n282 \nU.S. 283, 287\n, 51 S.Ct. 140; Burnet v. Railway Equipment Co., \n282 \nU.S. 295, 298\n, 51 S.Ct. 137.\n To avoid this conclusion here, respondent relies on section 1106(a) of the Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1249 note), which provides that: 'The bar of the statute of limitations against the United States in respect of any internal-revenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability ....' This section, it is said, indicates a congressional intent that, once the liability of the taxpayer is extinguished, it should not be revived by waiver. The government argues that this attempted distinction between the defense of the bar of the statute of limitations and the defense that the liability has been extinguished is, at most, only formal and does not affect the application of section 278(c); that a defense founded on a right which may \n\n[291 U.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n be waived by failure to plead it may likewise be waived by formal document authorized by statute. Burnet v. Desmornes, \n226 \nU.S. 145\n, 33 S.Ct. 63. See Atlantic Coast Line v. Burnette, \n239 \nU.S. 199, 200\n, 36 S.Ct. 75; Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227, 233\n, 8 S.Ct. 82. Compare Stange v. United States, supra. But doubts as to the effect which Congress intended, if any, to be given to the quoted provision of section 1106(a), 26 USCA  1249 note in construing section 278(c)1 were removed by section 612 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 875), which declared that section 1106(a) was repealed as of February 26, 1926, its effective date. Congress thus indicated its intention that the section should be erased from the books as though it had never been enacted, so that section 278, like other surviving sections of the 1926 Act, \n\n[291 U.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n must be construed free of such restrictive influence, if any, as section 1106(a) would otherwise impose. Thus it must be dealt with as was the identical section in the Act of 1924 which was before the Court in Stange v. United States, supra. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n That Congress, with consent of the taxpayer, has power to reinstate his tax liability and to authorize assessment of the tax cannot be doubted. Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 426\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; Mascot Oil Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 436\n, 51 S.Ct. 196. The taxpayer cannot complain that Congress has availed itself of the consent which he has given, and cannot object that it did so by revival of the tax 'liability,' rather than by removing the bar of the statute as in McDonnell v. United States, supra, and Stange v. United States, supra; see Wm. Danzer & Co. v. Gulf R.R., \n268 \nU.S. 633, 636\n, 45 S.Ct. 612; Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 409\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701.\n We have considered, but do not discuss, respondent's arguments based on the construction of the waiver of November 6, 1926, which are without merit. We do not doubt that rightly construed the waiver conformed to the requirements of sections 278 and 280 of the Act of 1926 and that by it respondent consented to the deficiency assessment.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The legislative history of section 1106(a) shows that its purpose was not to prevent a taxpayer from voluntarily agreeing to pay a tax after the period of limitation had expired. It was proposed in order to avoid the effect of a decision of the Court of Claims in Toxaway Mills v. United States, 61 Ct.Cl. 363, 372, holding that if a tax had been collected after the running of the statute of limitations the taxpayer could not set up that fact as entitling him to recover, but could establish a right to a refund only by proving that there had been an overpayment of the tax, on the theory that the statute of limitations did not extinguish the liability but merely barred the remedy. As stated in the Conference Report on this section of the bill, H. Rep. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 55: 'This amendment is deemed advisable because of an opinion in a recent decision of the Court of Claims, Toxaway Mills v. United States. ... Obviously this section does not apply in the case of fraud or in the case of a waiver.' And see 67 Cong. Rec., Part IV, p. 3531. But in conference  1106(a) was qualified by the addition of a clause denying a right to a refund unless taxpayers had in fact overpaid the tax. See Conference Rep., H. Rep. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 26, 55. Congress, in enacting these provisions, was thus concerned with refunds rather than assessments and obviously did not enact the provision for the purpose of rendering invalid waivers executed after the running of the statute. See also Sen. Rep. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 41; Report of Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., House Doc. No. 139, p. 16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is true that section 506(a) of the Act of 1928 (26 USCA  1060) amended section 278(c) of the Act of 1926 by providing for extension, by consent, of the time within which an assessment might be made only if the consent were given before the expiration of the period of limitation. But section 506(b) (26 USCA  1062a) further provided that any such consent, given after the expiration of the period of limitation, should be valid and effective according to its terms if entered into after the enactment of the Act of 1928 and before January 1, 1929. It was also provided, in  506(c), 26 USCA  1060 note, that 'The amendments made by this section to the Revenue Act of 1926 shall not be construed as in any manner affecting the validity of waivers made prior to the enactment of this Act, which shall be determined according to the law in existence at the time such waiver was filed.' The application of subdivision (c) of section 506 is by its terms limited to amendments made by the section and it seems plain that it was intended to be a qualification of subdivision (a) and not a limitation upon section 612. Compare United States v. Morrow, \n266 \nU.S. 531\n, 45 S.Ct. 173. Thus construed it prevents any retroactive operation of subdivision (a) by saving the effect of waivers already given although after the expiration of the period of limitation. That effect is to be determined by the application of the provisions of the Act of 1926, with section 1106(a) eliminated as provided by section 612 of the Act of 1928. The declared purpose of section 506 was to preserve the Commissioner's rights to waivers filed under prior acts and to fix January 1, 1929, as the date of change from the old practice to the new. See H. Rep. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29; Sen. Rep. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 36; Conference Rep., H. Rep. 1882, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 21. If subdivision (c) were construed as a limitation upon section 612 it would nullify the operation of section 612, and would produce a 'whimsical result.' See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Oswego & Syracuse R.R. Co . (C.C.A.) 62 F. (2d) 518, 520. For waivers executed after the period of limitation had run would be valid if filed prior to February 26, 1926, the effective date of the 1926 Act. Like waivers would be invalid if executed between February 26, 1926, and May 29, 1928, the effective date of the 1928 Act. But by section 506(b), supra, they would be valid if executed between May 29, 1928 and January 1, 1929. Scope is given for the operation of section 612, see Bernier v. Bernier, \n147 \nU.S. 242, 246\n, 13 S.Ct. 244, and incongruous results are avoided by treating section 1106( a) as though it had never been a part of the 1926 Act, as section 612 directs.

Immunity is sought upon the ground that the trustees are officers of the commonwealth of Massachusetts and instrumentalities of its government. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, held in favor of the exemption. 26 B.T.A. 1381; 68 F.(2d) 634. We granted a writ of certiorari. \n292 \nU.S. 620\n, 54 S.Ct. 777\n\n\n Chapter 159 of the Massachusetts Special Acts, 1918, provides for the public operation of the Boston Elevated Railway Company. The act creates a board of five trustees, to be appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the council, for the term of ten years. The act provides that the trustees shall be sworn before entering upon their duties; they shall own no stock or other securities of the company and shall each receive from the company $5,000 annually as compensation for his services. They are subject to removal by the Governor with the advice and consent of the council.\n The trustees are charged with the duty of managing and operating the company and its properties for the period, as stated or extended, of public operation, and to that end are to have 'possession of said properties in be- \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n half of the commonwealth.' Except as otherwise stated, they are to exercise all the powers of the company, being empowered in their discretion to appoint and remove the president and other officers of the company, except the directors. The trustees are authorized 'to regulate and fix fares' and to 'determine the character and extent of the service and facilities to be furnished.' Their authority for this purpose is made 'exclusive' and is not 'subject to the approval, control or direction of any other state board or commission.' The act provides that the trustees and their employees shall be deemed to be acting as agents of the company and not of the commonwealth, and that the company shall be liable for their acts and negligence to the same extent as if they were in the immediate employ of the company, but that the trustees shall not be personally liable.\n The company was required, on or before its acceptance of the act, to raise a stated amount by the issue of preferred stock in order to provide for the improvement of the property of the company and the establishment of a reserve fund. The trustees are to fix such rates of fare as will reasonably insure sufficient income to meet the cost of service, as defined, which, in addition to operating expenditures, outlays for the required upkeep of the properties, and other amounts chargeable against income and surplus, includes fixed dividends on the preferred stock and dividends on the common stock at specified rates. Surplus income is to be transferred to the reserve fund and that fund is to be used to meet deficiencies. If it is insufficient for that purpose, the trustees are required to notify the treasurer and receiver general of the commonwealth, and the commonwealth is to pay the amount of the deficit ascertained according to the act. Amounts thus paid are to be assessed upon the several cities and towns in which the company operates. Provision is \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 222]\n\u00a0\n made for reimbursement out of subsequent surplus income. The act contemplates the maintenance of the property in good operating condition and the restoration of the reserve fund, if depleted, to its original amount on the expiration of the period of public management. At that time the control of the property is to revert to the company. It may then collect such reasonable fares as will produce an income sufficient to pay the reasonable cost of the service as defined in the act, including specified dividends on the common stock, and the company is then to be subject to public regulation in such manner as may be determined by the general court, but not so as to reduce the income below the cost of the service as stated.\n The tax in question was on the compensation received by the trustees for the years 1926 to 1929. It appears that in 1919 the commonwealth paid to the company nearly $4,000,000 as a deficiency resulting from the public operation, and that in subsequent years, up to and including 1929, the income received was not sufficient for full reimbursement.\n The validity of the statute has been sustained as one enacted for a public purpose and providing for the management of the enterprise by the commonwealth. Boston v. Treasurer and Receiver General, 237 Mass. 403, 413, 420, 130 N.E. 390, 392; Boston v. Jackson, \n260 \nU.S. 309, 314\n, 316 S., 43 S.Ct. 129. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has characterized the 'public operation' as 'undertaken by the commonwealth, not as a source of profit, but solely for the general welfare.' Boston v. Treasurer and Receiver General, supra. The trustees are the administrative agents of the commonwealth in this enterprise, and we may assume, as the Circuit Court of Appeals has held, that the trustees come within the general category of 'public officers' by virtue of their appointment by the \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 223]\n\u00a0\n Governor, with the advice and consent of the council, and their tenure and duties fixed by law. \n1\n United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 393; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 520\n, 46 S. St.Ct. 172. See Opinion of the Justices, 261 Mass. pages 542, 543, 550, 159 N.E. 55.\n While the undertaking is for the public benefit, it is still a particular business enterprise-the operation of a street railway-and the functions of the trustees are limited accordingly. The property remains in private ownership. The act, accepted by the company, constitutes in substance an agreement between the company and the commonwealth that the latter shall temporarily take over the management and operation and pay specified amounts by way of compensation. While the commonwealth may be called upon to bear losses that may occur, if the fares as fixed prove to be insufficient, the operation by the trustees is intended to be self- sustaining. The transportation service is to be rendered, as respondents' counsel say, 'under such a flexible system of rate-making as would allow the fixing of fares equal, as nearly as might be, to the cost of service.' The compensation of the trustees is undoubtedly a part of that cost. 'The main design of the act,' as stated by the Supreme Judicial Court, 'is public operation of the railway company at such rates of fare to be fixed by the trustees from time to time as shall afford revenue sufficient to defray all charges and the dividends established by the act.' Boston v. Treasurer and Receiver General, supra. The authority given to the trustees 'to regulate and fix fares,' and \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 224]\n\u00a0\n the further authority to ascertain such losses as may be incurred, which are to be borne by the commonwealth, are both incident to that main purpose.\n The immunity sought by the trustees from payment of the federal income tax has not been granted by the Congress. The definitions of income in the federal income tax acts cover income derived from 'compensation for personal service ... of whatever kind and in whatever form paid.' Revenue Act of 1926,  212(a), 213(a), 26 USCA  953(a), 954(a); Revenue Act 1928,  21, 22(a), 26 USCA  2021, 2022(a). This language is certainly broad enough to embrace the compensation of the trustees, and the immunity, if it exists, must rest upon constitutional limitation. The Treasury Regulations, manifestly in an effort to interpret and apply that limitation, provide for exemption from taxation of compensation paid by a state or political subdivision to its officers and employees only in case their services are rendered 'in connection with the exercise of an essential governmental function.' Treas. Reg. No. 69, Art. 88; No. 74, Art. 643; No. 77, Art. 643. But the Treasury Department could not by its regulation either limit the provisions of the statute or define the boundaries of their constitutional application.\n We come then to the question whether the Congress has the constitutional power to impose an income tax upon the compensation of public officers of the character here involved. We do not regard that question as answered by mere terminology. The roots of the constitutional restriction strike deeper than that. The term 'public office' undoubtedly implies a definite assignment of public activity, fixed by appointment, tenure, and duties. But whether that field of activity, in relation to a state, carries immunity from federal taxation is a question which compels consideration of the nature of the activity, apart from the mere creation of offices for conducting it, and of the fundamental reason for denying \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 225]\n\u00a0\n federal authority to tax. That reason, as we have frequently said, is found in the necessary protection of the independence of the national and state governments within their respective spheres under our constitutional system. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall 113, 125, 127; Ambrosini v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 23 S.Ct. 1; Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 575\n, 51 S.Ct. 601. The principle of immunity thus has inherent limitations. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, pages 522-524 of 269 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 172; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 226 S., 51 S.Ct. 125, 71 A.L.R. 1260; Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, supra, page 576 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 601; Fox Film Corporation v.

And one of these limitations is that the state cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend. The fact that the state has power to undertake such enterprises, and that they are undertaken for what the state conceives to be the public benefit, does not establish immunity. South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737; Flint v. Stone Tracy Company, \n220 \nU.S. 107, 172\n, 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann.Cas. 1912B, 1312; Murray v. Wilson Distilling Company, \n213 \nU.S. 151, 173\n, 29 S.Ct. 458; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra; Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, supra; Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360, 368\n, 369 S., 54 S.Ct. 725. The necessary protection of the independence of the state government is not deemed to go so far.\n In South Carolina v. United States, supra, the state undertook to establish a monopoly of the sale of intoxicating liquors and prohibited the sale except to dispensaries to be operated by the state. The dispensers had no interest in the sales and received no profit from them. The question was whether the dispensers were relieved from liability for the internal revenue tax prescribed by the Congress for dealers in intoxicating liquors because the \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 226]\n\u00a0\n dispensers were agents of the state, which in the exercise of its sovereign power had taken charge of the business. While the court recognized the power of the state to undertake the enterprise, the exemption was denied, as the state could not, by engaging in a business of that sort, withdraw it from the taxing power which the Constitution vested in the national government. Murray v. Wilson Distilling Company, supra.\n The Court reached a similar conclusion in the recent case of Ohio v. Helvering, supra, where the state had established a department of liquor control and sought an injunction to restrain the enforcement of federal statutes imposing taxes upon dealers in intoxicating liquors. The state sought to distinguish the case of South Carolina because, in Ohio, 'the state-owned stores' were operated by civil service employees of the state government, and hence the question was said to concern the taxation of the state itself. The argument was unavailing and the Court rested its ruling upon the broad ground that when the state becomes a dealer in intoxicating liquors, it falls within the reach of the tax as one validly imposed by the federal statute.\n The method which the state may adopt in organizing such an activity cannot be regarded as determinative. If the dealers in South Carolina, or those employed to operate the state stores in Ohio, had been denominated public officers, and, as such, had been assigned definite tenure and duties, the same result would have been reached, as the principle involved would be equally applicable. Nor, in such a case, would the fact that the officers were intrusted with the authority to fix prices for the sales under their charge in a manner appropriately to secure the revenue needed for the enterprise, or were charged with the duty of ascertaining the losses which, if they occurred, were to be borne by general taxation, establish a material distinction. \n\n[293 U.S. 214, 227]\n\u00a0\n The nature of the enterprise, and not the particular incidents of its management, would control.\n We see no reason for putting the operation of a street railway in a different category from the sale of liquors. In each case, the state, with its own conception of public advantage, is undertaking a business enterprise of a sort that is normally within the reach of the federal taxing power and is distinct from the usual governmental functions that are immune from federal taxation in order to safeguard the necessary independence of the state. If, in the instant case, the commonwealth had acquired the property of the company and had organized management of it in perpetuity by the state government, instead of temporarily, or had taken over all the street railways in all its cities for direct operation by the commonwealth, there would appear to be no ground, under the principles established by the decisions we have cited, for holding that this would effect the withdrawal of the enterprise from the federal taxing power. And the fact that the state has here undertaken public management and operation for a limited time, and under the particular restrictions of the agreement with the company, cannot be said to furnish a ground for immunity.\n If the business itself, by reason of its character, is not immune, although undertaken by the state, from a federal excise tax upon its operations, upon what ground can it be said that the compensation of those who conduct the enterprise for the state is exempt from a federal income tax? Their compensation, whether paid out of the returns from the business or otherwise, can have no quality, so far as the federal taxing power is concerned, superior to that of the enterprise in which the compensated service is rendered.\n We conclude that the Congress had the constitutional authority to lay the tax.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision of section 1 of chapter 159 of the Massachusetts Special Acts of 1918 that the trustees shall not be considered public officers within the meaning of section 25 of chapter 514 of the Acts of 1909, and that section 1 of chapter 7 of the Revised Laws shall not apply to the trustees, creates special limitations of such a nature as not to derogate from their general status.

Section 233(b) of that act (26 USCA  985(b) provides that, in the case of a foreign corporation, 'gross income' means only gross income from sources within the United States, determined in the manner provided in section 217 (26 USCA  958) the pertinent provisions of which follow:\n'Sec. 217. (a) In the case of a nonresident alien individual, ... the following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources within the United States:\n\n'(1) Interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations of residents, corporate or otherwise, not including (A) interest on deposits with persons carrying on \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 86]\n\u00a0\n the banking business paid to persons not engaged in business within the United States and not having an office or place of business therein. ...\n\n'(c) The following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources without the United States:\n\n'(1) Interest other than that derived from sources within the United States as provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a). ...'\n\n The question for determination is whether the interest paid upon the amount of the tax refund falls within the classification 'interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations of residents, corporate or otherwise.' The contention of respondent before the Board of Tax Appeals and in the court below was, as it is here, that such interest payment was not within the reach of the provisions of section 217(a), because (1) it was not interest upon an interest-bearing obligation, and ( 2) the United States is not a 'resident' within the meaning of the phrase 'residents, corporate or otherwise.'\n First. If the words 'interest-bearing obligations' stood alone, there would be no room for doubt as to their inclusive effect. Section 1111, 44 Stat. 115, title 26, U.S.C. App.  149 (26 USCA  149) authorizes the commissioner to refund and pay back all taxes illegally or erroneously collected. The decision of the Commissioner that a tax has been illegally or erroneously collected necessarily creates an obligation to make repayment. Section 1116(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 119, Title 26, U.S.C. App.  153 (26 USCA  153 note), provides that interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of the payment of the tax to the date of the allowance of the refund shall be allowed and paid. Obviously, an obligation upon which by express statutory direction interest must be paid is an interest-bearing obligation.\n The point is made, however, that the word 'obligations,' as it occurs in another part of the act, has been \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n given a narrower construction, and that this is persuasive of the restricted meaning contended for here. That much may be conceded, since 'there is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.' Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 433\n, 52 S.Ct. 607, 609. But, since most words admit of different shades of meaning, susceptible of being expanded or abridged to conform to the sense in which they are used, the presumption readily yields to the controlling force of the circumstance that the words, though in the same act, are found in such dissimilar connections as to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in the different parts of the act with different intent. Id. The comparison sought to be made is between the words in section 213(b)(4) of the act, 26 USCA  954(b)(4), and the same words in section 217(a), 26 USCA  958(a). The former provides that the term 'gross income,' among other things, does not include interest upon 'obligations of the United States.' It is clear from a consideration of the entire section and of the subject-matter that the purpose of Congress, in thus excluding from gross income interest upon such obligations, was to aid the borrowing power of the federal government by making its interest-bearing bonds more attractive to investors. American Viscose Corp. v. Com'r of Int. Rev. (C.C. A.) 56 F.(2d) 1033. Compare United States Trust Co. of New York v. Anderson (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 575, 577, 578, 89 A.L.R. 994. The scope of the word 'obligations' as there employed must be narrowed accordingly, and not extended to include interest upon indebtedness not incurred under the borrowing power, as the court in the Viscose Case properly held. But the use of the words 'interest on ... interest-bearing obligations' in section 217(a) is for a different purpose; namely, to produce revenue, not to encourage loans in aid of the borrowing power. The intent of Congress, therefore, in the one case, is fulfilled by giving the phrase a construction within the narrow \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n purposes of section 213(b)(4); and, in the other case, by a construction, if the phrase fairly admits of it, which will effect the obviously different statutory aim of section 217(a).\n Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, supra, was a suit brought to enjoin appellants from continuing an alleged conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in cleaning, dyeing, and otherwise renovating clothes contrary to section 3 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  3). The defense was that appellants were engaged solely in the performance of labor and service in cleaning dyeing, and renovating wearing apparel, etc., and that this did not constitute 'trade' within the meaning of the act. The argument was that, since the words 'trade or commerce' in section 1 of the act (15 USCA  1), which dealt with interstate commerce, must be construed not to include a business such as that carried on by appellant, the identical words used in section 3 dealing with restraint of trade or commerce within the District of Columbia should be given the same interpretation. Considering the subject-matter of the act, and the scope of the legislative power exercised in the one case as compared with that exercised in the other, we held otherwise. In arriving at the conclusion that the word 'trade' as used in section 3 was to be given a broader interpretation than the same word as used in section 1, we considered the history leading up to and accompanying the passage of the Sherman Act, the mischief to be remedied, and other circumstances, and held that Congress intended to exercise all the power it possessed; and, since the scope of its power in dealing with the District was more extensive than when dealing with interstate commerce, we gave to the word 'trade' its full meaning under section 3, unaffected by the narrower meaning which it might have under section 1. The considerations invoked in that case are equally applicable here.\n But it is said that the phrase in question must be restricted in accordance with the rule of ejusdem generis. The point is not without merit. The phrase reads 'in \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n terest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations.' If the rule invoked be held controlling, it would follow that the general words 'other interest-bearing obligations' must be assimilated to the particular words 'notes and bonds,' and restricted to obligations of the same kind. But, while the rule is a well-established and useful one, it is, like other canons of statutory construction, only an aid to the ascertainment of the true meaning of the statute. It is neither final nor exclusive. To ascertain the meaning of the words of a statute, they may be submitted to the test of all appropriate canons of statutory construction, of which the rule of ejusdem generis is only one. If, upon a consideration of the context and the objects sought to be attained and of the act as a whole, it adequately appears that the general words were not used in the restricted sense suggested by the rule, we must give effect to the conclusion afforded by the wider view in order that the will of the Legislature shall not fail.\n The general object of this act is to put money into the federal treasury; and there is manifest in the reach of its many provisions an intention on the part of Congress to bring about a generous attainment of that object by imposing a tax upon pretty much every sort of income subject to the federal power. Plainly, the payment in question constitutes income derived from a source within the United States; and the natural aim of Congress would be to reach it. In Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 166\n, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, this court, rejecting the contention that certain payments there involved did not constitute income, said: 'If these payments properly may be called income by the common understanding of that word and the statute has failed to hit them it has missed so much of the general purpose that it expresses at the start. Congress intended to use its power to the full extent. Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 203\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570.' Although Congress intended, as the court held in the Viscose Case, supra, to include interest \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 90]\n\u00a0\n on a tax refund made to a domestic corporation, we are asked to deny such intention in respect of a competing foreign corporation. But we see nothing in the relationship of a foreign corporation to the United States, or in any other circumstance called to our attention, which fairly shows that such a discrimination was within the contemplation of Congress. On the contrary, the natural conclusion is that, if any discrimination had been intended, it would have been made in favor of, and not against, the domestic corporation, which contributes in a much more substantial degree to the support of the people and government of the United States.\n The foregoing views are put beyond all fair doubt, if otherwise any would remain, by the consideration of a qualification contained in the section itself. After declaring that interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations shall be treated as income from sources within the United States, the section immediately proceeds to exclude from that language 'interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business paid to persons not engaged in business within the United States . ...' It is apparent from this exception that Congress understood that, unless the exception were made, the interest on such deposits would fall within the term 'interest-bearing obligations,' and, to prevent that result, it was necessary to specifically create the exception. The conclusion fairly results that the clause was intended to include all interest-bearing obligations not specifically excepted. The opinion delivered by Lord Tenterden in The King v. The Trustees for paving Shrewsbury, 3 Barnewall & Adolphus, 216, is directly in point. There a statute imposed certain charges and expenses, in connection with the operations of a gas light company, upon tenants or occupants of houses, shops, malt-houses, granaries, etc., and hereditaments within Shrewsbury, \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 91]\n\u00a0\n 'meadow and pasture ground excepted.' The contention was that the word 'hereditaments' must be confined to hereditaments ejusdem generis with those enumerated. The court, holding otherwise, said (page 220):\n'Now it is certain that meadows and pastures would have fallen within the meaning of the word 'hereditament', if they had not been excepted; it was argued, therefore, that this special exemption of meadows and pastures shewed that the other word had been previously used in its larger sense. On the other hand it was contended, that these words had been introduced merely ex majori cautela. Upon the best consideration we have been able to give this case, we are of opinion, that we ought not to consider the exception of meadow and pasture ground as made only for greater caution, but are bound to look upon it as introduced by way of special exception, and so to construe the clause: and, consequently, every thing not so specifically excepted must be understood to fall within the general liability.'\n\n Interest on deposits is no more akin to notes and bonds than is interest on tax refunds; and the fact that the former was expressly excepted from the operation of the substantive provision quite clearly justifies the conclusion that the lawmakers attached to the general clause a larger meaning than it would have if limited to things ejusdem generis with those specifically enumerated. Certainly, if it was necessary to save interest on deposits from the embrace of the general clause by an exception, it was equally necessary to save interest on tax refunds by a like exception.\n Second. Is the United States a resident within the meaning of the words 'residents, corporate or otherwise?' We think it is. It many times has been held that the United States or a state is a 'person' within the meaning of statutory provisions applying only to per- \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 92]\n\u00a0\n sons. See Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360, 370\n, 54 S.Ct. 725, and cases cited. In Martin v. State, 24 Tex. 61, 68, this was held in respect of a criminal statute, notwithstanding the general rule that such statutes are to be construed strictly. The statute (Laws Tex. 1848, c. 152,  33) there penalized the false making or fraudulent alteration of a public record when done 'with intent that any person be defrauded.' The state Supreme Court held that the state was to be taken as a 'person' within the meaning of the statute, and one who made the entry with intent to defraud the state violated the statute. The Texas decision was expressly followed by this court in Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508, 517\n, 13 S.Ct. 418, 422, where it was held that the word 'person' used in the statute there under consideration would include the United States 'as a body politic and corporate.' Blackstone, writing on the rights of persons (1 Bl. 123) says:\n'Persons also are divided by the law into either natural persons, or artificial. Natural persons are such as the God of nature formed us; artificial are such as are created and devised by human laws for the purposes of society and government, which are called corporations or bodies politic.'\n\n While it cannot be said that the United States, in its corporate capacity as an artificial person, has a bodily presence in any place, it is not unreasonable to hold that in the eye of the law it has a residence, and especially so when a contrary holding would defeat the evident purpose of a statute. This may be in the nature of a legal fiction; but legal fictions have an appropriate place in the administration of the law when they are required by the demands of convenience and justice. Thus, intangible personal property has been held to have a situs at the domicile of the owner, although intangibles ordinarily have no actual situs and the paper evidence of their existence may be elsewhere. First National Bank v. Maine, 284 \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 93]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 312, 328, 329, 52 S.Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401. If to carry out the purposes of a statute it be admissible to construe the word 'person' as including the United States, it is hard to see why, in like circumstances, it is inadmissible to construe the word 'resident' as likewise including the United States.\n And, finally, if the United States be not a 'resident' in respect of interest upon 'other interest-bearing obligations,' it is, of course, not a 'resident' in respect of interest upon its bonds held by nonresident aliens and corporations. The interest upon many of these bonds is subject to a superincome tax and to certain other taxes. If it had been intended to make an exemption in respect of such taxes in favor of nonresidents, it is reasonable to suppose that Congress would have said so in explicit terms1 instead of leaving the fate of taxes upon the large sums thus involved to depend upon the way in which a court might happen to construe the word 'resident'-a most unsatisfactory substitute, as the conflicting decisions in this and the next succeeding case bear witness. We cannot assent to the view that Congress has written into the law an exception of such importance in a manner so indirect and casual.\n In the foregoing discussion, we have not been unmindful of the rule, frequently stated by this court, that taxing acts 'are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used,' and that doubts are to be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer. The rule is a salutary one, but it does not apply here. The intention of the lawmaker controls in the construction of taxing acts as it does in the construction of other statutes, and that intention is to be ascertained, not by taking the word or clause in question from its setting and viewing it apart, but by considering it in con- \n\n[293 U.S. 84, 94]\n\u00a0\n nection with the context, the general purposes of the statute in which it is found, the occasion and circumstances of its use, and other appropriate tests for the ascertainment of the legislative will. Compare Rein v. Lane, L.R. 2 Q.B. Cases 144, 151. The intention being thus disclosed, it is enough that the word or clause is reasonably susceptible of a meaning consonant therewith, whatever might be its meaning in another and different connection. We are not at liberty to reject the meaning so established and adopt another lying outside the intention of the Legislature, simply because the latter would release the taxpayer or bear less heavily against him. To do so would be not to resolve a doubt in his favor, but to say that the statute does not mean what it means.\n'The rule of strict construction is not violated by permitting the words of a statute to have their full meaning, or the more extended of two meanings. The words are not to be bent one way or the other, but to be taken in the sense which will best manifest the legislative intent. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396; United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 30 S.Ct. 81.' Sacramento Nav. Co. v. Salz, \n273 \nU.S. 326, 329\n, 47 S.Ct. 368, 369. The rule of strict construction applies to penal laws, but such laws are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the Legislature; or so applied as to narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases which those words, in the sense that the Legislature has obviously used them, would comprehend. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95. That view, expressed by Chief Justice Marshall, has since been frequently followed by this court. See, for example, American Fur Company v. United States, 2 Pet. 358, 367; United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475; United States v. Hartwell, supra, pages 395, 396 of 6 Wall.; Donnelley v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 505, 512\n, 48 S.Ct. 400.\n\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As, for example, it did in the Act of March 3, 1919,  4, c. 100, 40 Stat. 1309, 1311 (31 USCA  750). \n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. TWIN BELL OIL SYNDICATE(1934)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. George H. Koster, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under the Revenue Act of 1926 the taxpayer is entitled, in the case of oil and gas wells, to deduct from gross income an allowance for depletion. The relevant sections \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n of the act are copied in the margin. \n1\n The present litigation calls for decision as to the total allowance permitted \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n and its apportionment between lessor and lessee where the income is derived from operation under an oil and gas lease.\n During 1925, 1926 and 1927 the respondent, as assignee of the lessee named in an oil and gas lease, extracted substantial quantities of oil. By the terms of the lease and the assignment it was obligated to pay royalties in cash or in kind, totalling one-quarter of the oil extracted. The respondent claimed that the gross proceeds of all the oil produced should form the basis for the computation of the allowance for depletion granted by section 204(c)(2), but the petitioner ruled that the deduction should be limited to 27 1\/2 per cent. of gross production less royalties paid. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the ruling. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board. \n3\n The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner construes section 204(c)(2) in pari materia with section 234(a) (8), and asserts the percentage deduction permitted by the former is subject to the requirement of equitable apportionment between the lessor and lessee required by the latter. The respondent urges that section 204(c)(2) is an independent and complete provision, to be applied without reference to section 234(a)(8), and that to attempt to apportion the allowance granted by section 204(c)(2) in the manner indicated by section 234(a)(8) would violate the plain terms of the statute.\n Reference to the structure of the successive income tax laws will aid in a solution of the problem. The Revenue Act of 19165 imposed an income tax by title 1. It divided the provisions as to tax into two parts, part 1 on individuals, and part 2 on corporations. In each part \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n the statute first lays the tax and in a subsequent section grants certain deductions, those enumerated in section 5 of part 1 being available to individuals, and those specified in section 12 of part 2 to corporations. Both sections include a reasonable allowance for depletion in the case of oil and gas wells. In the drafting of the Revenue Act of 19186 a new arrangement of the subject-matter was adopted. Title 1 is composed of definitions, title 2 treats of income tax. Part 1 of this title consists of general provisions applicable alike to individual and corporate taxpayers. Sections under this part define taxable years and dividends, and section 202 prescribes the 'basis for determining gain or loss,' but makes no reference to depletion of mines, timber, or oil and gas wells. Additional sections have to do with inventories, net losses, and other general matters. Part 2 levies the tax on individuals, defines net and gross income, and in section 214 specifies the deductions allowed from gross income. The opening sentence of subsection (a)(10) is: 'In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case, based upon cost including cost of development not otherwise deducted.'\n Then follow two provisos, one directing how cost shall be ascertained in the case of properties acquired prior to March 1, 1913, and the other allowing an alternative method of calculating depletion upon the basis of discovery value of mines and oil and gas wells. The paragraph ends with the sentence: 'In the case of leases the deductions allowed by this paragraph shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.' \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n In part 3, levying the corporation tax, section 234(a)(9) allows a deduction for depletion in the identical phraseology employed with respect to individual taxpayers in section 214(a)(10).\n The same method was followed in the Revenue Act of 1921.7 The general provisions contain no reference to depletion, but under parts 2 and 3 of title 2 the tax is fixed for individuals and corporations and the allowable deductions from gross income are set forth. The paragraphs of the prior act as to depletion of oil and gas wells are literally re- enacted, but, there is inserted in section 214(a)(10) as to individuals and section 234(a)(9) as to corporations, an additional proviso with respect to discovery value.\n In the framing of the Revenue Act of 19248 the same arrangement was observed. General definitions are found in title 1; title 2 treats of income tax, and in part 1 of that title are included general provisions applicable to both individual and corporate taxes. Amongst such general provisions in the earlier acts there had been a section entitled 'Basis for determining gain or loss.' In the 1924 Act the draftsman embodied paragraphs similar to those of the earlier act in section 204 (26 USCA  935 and note), but enlarged the caption to read 'Basis for determining gain or loss, depletion, and depreciation,' and transferred to this section that portion of the depletion provision dealing with the basis of the allowance which had formerly appeared under the heading 'Deductions' in part 2, Individuals, and part 3, Corporations. This added to the old section 204 a new subsection(c) (26 USCA  935 note), which permits the use of cost or discovery value as the basis of depletion in the case of mines and oil and gas wells. Having transferred these provisions from sections 214(a)(9) and 234(a)(8), 26 USCA  955(a)(9) and note, 986(a)(8), and note, respecting individual \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 318]\n\u00a0\n and corporate deductions, there remained in those sections the language first found in the Act of 1918, above quoted, including the concluding sentence relating to equitable apportionment between lessor and lessee. The thought apparently was that the authority for the deduction should remain in the sections dealing with all deductions and the formulae for calculating the deduction should be relegated to a general provision applicable alike to corporations and individuals.\n The depletion allowance based on discovery value was found difficult of administration, since it required a separate valuation of each well,9 and was abandoned in the Revenue Act of 1926.10 There was substituted a flat allowance of 27 1\/2 per cent. of gross income. In this act the same arrangement was followed as in that of 1924. Under title 2, Income Tax, part 1 was devoted to general provisions. As the basis for determining gain or loss, depletion and depreciation, had been embodied in section 204 of the general provisions of the Act of 1924, in which was the permitted use of discovery value as a basis for depletion, when that method was discarded in favor of the flat percentage of gross income it was logical to insert the substituted paragraph in the place where the discarded one had been. Thus we find the new formula inserted as paragraph (c)(2) of section 204 (26 USCA  935(c)(2). The authority for deduction of depletion remains where it has always been since the Act of 1918, namely, in section 214(a)(9) of part 2, Individuals (26 USCA  955(a)(9), and section 234(a)( 8) of part 3, Corporations (26 USCA  986(a)(8), and naturally there still remains in these paragraphs the limitation that the allowance shall be apportioned between lessor and lessee. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 312, 319]\n\u00a0\n This outline of the framework of the legislation demonstrates that Congress did not insert section 204(c)(2) as an independent section granting an allowance or deduction for depletion. In the earlier acts both the grant and the method of computation were embraced in a subsection under the title 'Deductions.' In the later Acts of 1924 and 1926 the grant remained in the deduction section and the taxpayer was referred to a general provision in section 204 for the method of ascertaining its amount.\n Respondent emphasizes the last clause of section 204(c)(2), which is: 'except that in no case shall the depletion allowance be less than it would be if computed without reference to this paragraph.' It is argued that as this exception gives the taxpayer an option to compute the allowance either on the cost basis or by the flat percentage method, if he elects the former he proceeds under section 234(a)(8) of the act (26 USCA  986(a)(8). Thus it is said that section applies only in case the cost basis is chosen. But an examination of the statute demonstrates the error of this position. No basis or formula for computation of the allowance is found in section 234; on the contrary all permissible procedures are covered by section 204, whether cost depletion of mines and oil \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 320]\n\u00a0\n wells (paragraph (c) 26 USCA  935(c); discovery value basis in the case of mines (c)(1), 26 USCA  935(c)(1); or flat percentage of gross income in the case of oil and gas wells (c)(2), 26 USCA  935(c)(2). If, therefore, the taxpayer does not compute under (c)(2) he must do so in accordance with the cost method prescribed by the earlier paragraph (c) of the same section, and not, as contended, under 234(a)(8).\n It follows that whichever method outlined in section 204 is chosen for computing the allowance granted by section 234, the deduction must be apportioned between lessor and lessee.\n We come, then, to consider the propriety of the procedure followed by the Commissioner. What he did, in effect, was to treat the gross production less royalties as the measure of the respondent's depletable interest in the property, and the royalties as the measure of the depletable interest of those entitled to receive them. The respondent says, however, that under section 213 (26 USCA  954) the gross production of the wells is respondent's gross income from the property, must be reported as such, and section 204(c)(2) permits him an allowance of 27 1\/2 per cent. thereof. It must follow that the royalties (one-fourth of the same gross production) are gross income to those receiving them and are subject to depletion at the rate of 27 1\/2 per cent. The result would be a total allowance of 27 1\/2 per cent. of five-fourths of the total production. Certainly this would not be a single allowance, apportioned between lessor and lessee. And we think section 204(c)(2) does not require such a result. The words used are, 'the allowance for depletion shall be 27 1\/2 per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year.' Is the italicized phrase synonymous with the taxpayer's gross income as defined in section 213? It cannot be if 'property' signifies the tract of land in all its uses, others as well as the extraction of oil and gas. Darby-Lynde Co. v. \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n Alexander (C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 56. The phrase, we think, points only to the gross income from oil and gas. Compare United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459, 461\n, 53 S.Ct. 435; Greensboro Gas Co. v. Commissioner, 30 B.T.A. 1361. So restricted it presents no difficulty where the owner of the land is also the operator, and there is none where the lessee turns over royalty oil in kind to the lessor, for the retained oil, in that case, is the base for the lessee's computation of depletion and the royalty oil that for the lessor's. We think Congress did not intend a different result where, as here, the lessee sells all the oil and pays over the royalty in the form of cash.\n At all events, as the section must be read in the light of the requirement of apportionment of a single depletion allowance, we are unable to say that the Commissioner erred in holding that for the purpose of computation 'gross income from the property' meant gross income from production less the amounts which the taxpayer was obliged to pay as royalties. The apportionment gives respondent 27 1\/2 per cent. of the gross income from production which it had the right to retain and the assignor and lessor respectively 27 1\/2 per cent. of the royalties they receive. Such an apportionment has regard to the economic interest of each of the parties entitled to participate in the depletion allowance. Compare Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 53 S.Ct. 225.\n The respondent insists that, so applied, the section may work unjust and unequal results; but it is to be remarked that this is likely to be so wherever a rule of thumb is applied without a detailed examination of the facts affecting each taxpayer. No doubt, as the petitioner points out, equally illogical results might ensue the application of the section as the respondent construes it. And it is also to be remembered that depletion upon cost or March 1, 1913 value is optional with the taxpayer, if that procedure is more favorable to him. \n\n[293 U.S. 312, 322]\n\u00a0\n Finally the respondent says that in the Revenue Act of 193212 the section corresponding to 204(c)(2) was amended so as to authorize such a procedure as the petitioner adopted in this case, and therefore the section as it stood in the Act of 1926 could not have supported the Commissioner's ruling. The amendment alters the section to read:13 'In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be 27 1\/2 per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. ...' The petitioner says that the amendment was merely clarifying in purpose and declaratory of the existing law as administered. We think this is so. When it was offered the chairman of the committee having the bill in charge so stated,14 and the conference report is to the same effect. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 14, 42.\n'Title II.-Income Tas. ...\n\n'Part III.-Corporations. ...\n\n'Deductions Allowed Corporations.\n\n'Sec. 234.

Thus under title 1 an income tax is laid on both individuals and corporations, and in subsequent portions of the act general provisions are contained. In this act the deductions from gross income are found in section 23 under part 2, 'Computation of Net Income' ( 26 USCA  2023), and the language of section 214(a)(9) and section 234(a)( 8) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  955(a)(9), 986(a)(8) is found only in this section, applicable to both sorts of taxpayers, corporate and individual, as subsection (l) (26 USCA  2023(l). A new subsection (m) (26 USCA  2023(m) is added, which states: 'The basis upon which depletion, exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence are to be allowed in respect of any property shall be as provided in section 114 (section 2114).' Section 114 is found in Supplement B (26 USCA  2114), and so far as material here is the same with respect to gas and oil wells as the analogous portions of section 204(c) of the Act of 1926 (26 USCA  935(c).\n It is quite clear, therefore, from this cross-reference, that the framers of the Act understood the deduction was allowed by section 23(l) but the method of calculating it was to be ascertained by reference to a general provision on that subject, section 114. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 47 Stat. 169 (26 USCA  3001 et seq.). \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Section 114(b)(3), 47 Stat. 202 (26 USCA  3114(b)(3). \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cong.

UNION PAC. R. CO.(1934)\nNo. 51\nArgued: November 7, 1934Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. Brian Holland, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry W. Clark, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to 1913 respondent, directly or through a subsidiary corporation, sold three issues of bonds, all maturing at dates subsequent to 1923. All were sold at a discount and petitioner paid or allowed to bankers an additional amount as commissions for marketing the bonds. The commissions and discounts, amortized over the periods \n\n[293 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n from the dates of issue to maturity of the bonds, exceeded $300,000 in each of its taxable years 1918 to 1923, inclusive. Respondent kept its books and made its tax returns on the accrual basis. Deduction from gross income, in its tax returns, of the amortized amount of the commissions and discount was disallowed by the Commissioner, who found a corresponding deficiency under the applicable Revenue Acts of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, and 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227.\n The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that the petitioner was entitled to the deduction for the discount but not commissions. 26 B.T.A. 1126. On the appeal of the taxpayer alone the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Board, holding that the commissions should be treated in the same manner as the discount and that the deductions were rightly made. 69 F.(2d) 67. This Court granted certiorari, \n293 \nU.S. 535\n, 55 S.Ct. 71, 79 L. Ed. --, on the petition of the Commissioner, which set up that the decision below conflicted with that of the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 47 F.( 2d) 990, see also Bonded Mortgage Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 70 F.(2d) 341, and is inconsistent with the decision of this Court in Old Colony Railroad Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552\n, 52 S.Ct. 211, which held that premiums received by the taxpayer upon the sale of its bonds before 1913 could not be subjected to income tax in later years by the expedient of prorating them over the period between the date of issue of the bonds and their maturity.\n In support of its petition the Government contends that the commissions are not, as the court below held, losses incurred in the taxable year which are deductible under section 234(a)(4) of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 (40 Stat. 1077, 1078, 42 Stat. 254, 255), although not to be realized until payment of the bonds at maturity. It insists instead that the commissions are expenses incurred and paid at the date of the \n\n[293 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n bond issue which cannot, on any theory, be deducted in later years. Further, it contends that the amortization of the commissions paid before 1913 and their deduction as amortized in tax returns in later years is inconsistent with the decision of this Court in Old Colony Railroad Company v. Commissioner, supra.\n\n 1. \nThere is no provision in either the 1918 or 1921 Revenue Acts specifically authorizing the deduction from gross income of commissions or discount paid or allowed by the taxpayer upon an issue of bonds. Section 234 of the 1918 and 1921 Acts, like the corresponding provisions of the acts before and since, allow deduction of expenses paid or incurred, interest paid or accrued, and losses sustained during the taxable year. Sections 212(b) and 213(a) of the 1918 and 1921 Acts (40 Stat. 1064, 1065, and 42 Stat. 237), like section 13(d) of the 1916 Act, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 771, authorize the taxpayer to make his income tax returns on the accrual basis where his books are kept on that basis and reflect true income; they require it if he fails or is unable to make his return on a cash receipts and disbursements basis. The taxpayer is thus enabled to charge against income of the taxable period expenses incurred in and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that period, although payable in a later one. See United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 440\n, 46 S.Ct. 131; Aluminum Castings Co. v. Routzahn, \n282 \nU.S. 92\n, 51 S.Ct. 11; Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 357\n, 50 S.Ct. 251. It follows that when the return is made on the accrual basis, expenses or obligations incurred by the taxpayer in connection with a bond issue, which are not discharged until the payment of the bonds at maturity, may properly be accrued or amortized over the period of the life of the bonds and allowed as annual deductions from gross income.\n By Article 150, Treasury Regulations 33, as revised, relating to the 1916 Revenue Act, both commissions and discount upon bond issues of the taxpayer were classified \n\n[293 U.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n as losses sustained on payment of the bonds at maturity, and taxpayers were permitted to amortize them over the life of the bonds and deduct them as amortized from gross income in each year. These regulations were continued under the 1918 and 1921 Acts, but the reference to commissions was omitted. \n1\n Art. 544 of T.R. 45; Art. 545 of T.R. 62. The Board of Tax Appeals has consistently applied the regulations as to bond discount allowed before 1913 and in each case, as in the present, the Government, by failing to seek review of the ruling, has acquiesced in it. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n Both commissions and discount, as the Government concedes, are factors in arriving at the actual amount of interest paid for the use of capital procured by a bond issue. The difference between the capital realized by the issue and par value, which is to be paid at maturity, must be added to the aggregate coupon payments in order to arrive at the total interest paid. Both discount and commissions are included in this difference. If the difference be viewed as a loss resulting from the funding operation, it is one which is realized only upon the payment of the bonds at maturity.\n But even if the commissions, unlike discount, may, as the Government insists, be regarded as a contemporary expense of procuring capital, it is one property chargeable to capital account. In practice it is taken out of the proceeds of the bonds by the banker. But in any case it must be deducted from the selling price to arrive at the capital realized by the taxpayer from the sale of the bonds, in return for which he must, at maturity, pay the face value of the bonds. The effect of the transaction in reducing the capital realized, whether through the payment of commissions or the allowance of discount, is the same. In this respect the commissions do not differ from brokerage commissions paid upon the purchase or sale of property. The regulations have consistently treated such commissions, not as items of current expense, but as additions to the cost of the property or deductions from the proceeds of sale, in arriving at net capital profit or loss for purposes of computing the tax. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n Here the commission, when paid, were properly chargeable against capital, and reduced by their amount the capital realized by the taxpayer from the bond issue. They come out of the pocket of the taxpayer only on payment of the bonds at maturity. But, unlike the purchase and sale of property, the transaction contemplated from the beginning a fixed date, the due date of the bonds, at which the difference between the net amount of capital realized upon the issue and the par value of the bonds must be paid to bondholders by the taxpayer. We think that the revenue acts, as they have been interpreted by this Court and the treasury regulations upon this and related subjects, require that this difference between receipts and disbursements of the taxpayer should, in some form, enter into the computation of his taxable income. It is a loss to the taxpayer, definite as to its date and amount, and represents a part of the cost of the borrowed capital during each year of the life of the bond issue. Cf. United States v. Anderson, supra. At least where the taxpayer's books are kept upon the accrual basis, its final disbursement may be anticipated by amortization and the amortized amount deducted annually from his gross income. \n\n[293 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n 2. Our decision in Old Colony Railroad Co. v. Commissioner, supra, does not require a different conclusion because the commissions in the present case were allowed before 1913. It was recognized in that case that premiums on a bond issue received after the Sixteenth Amendment might be prorated over the period of the life of the bonds and taxed annually as income during this period. In refusing to allow premiums received before 1913 to be thus prorated and taxed, the Court was moved by the consideration that the premiums, which were received as income and had become a part of the taxpayer's capital before the Sixteenth Amendment, could not be taxed as income by virtue of that amendment and legislation under it.\n No such consideration is presented here where the question is only of the deduction of an expense incurred before the amendment. Hence, the decision in the Old Colony Case can militate against our conclusion here only if returns, prepared in conformity to it, would fail to reflect true income if the rule announced in the Old Colony Case were also complied with. Plainly such is not the case. There can be no question of receipt of a premium where the bonds are sold at a discount. When sold at a premium, as in any other case, commissions must be deducted from gross proceeds in arriving at the capital realized upon the bond issue. There is no occasion for deduction of commissions from gross income at a later time unless the total amount realized by the sale of the bonds is less than their par value. In that case the difference alone is the amount to be amortized and deducted from gross income in the annual returns of the taxpayer. This would reflect his true income, where, as in the present case, his accounts are kept on the accrual basis.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Notwithstanding this change in the regulations, the Commissioner appears to have continued to permit taxpayers to amortize and deduct commissions paid on bond issues prior to 1913, as the regulations under the 1916 Act had expressly permitted. A change of practice was sanctioned in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 13 B.T.A. 988, 1034, affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, 47 F.(2d) 990, 991, where the taxpayer, while allowed to deduct bond discount, was not allowed to deduct from gross income the amortized expenses of a bond issue incurred before 1913. This refusal to allow amortization of commissions was confined to the case of bonds issued before 1913.\n Treasury regulations have also been silent as to commissions on bonds issued after that date. Art. 544 of T.R. 45; Art. 545 of T.R. 62, 65, 69; Art. 68 of T.R. 75, 77. But there are a number of Treasury rulings which permit the amortization of commissions on bonds issued after 1913.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1934)\nNo. 176\nArgued: November 16, 1934Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert Ash, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. William Stanley, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners are husband and wife and the income which gives rise to this controversy is derived from community property. We are to determine whether in computing net income under the Revenue Act of 1926 ( 44 Stat. 9) they were entitled to deduct from advance royalty or bonus received upon the execution of oil and gas leases the statutory percentage allowance for depletion, it appearing that there was no production when the leases were made, or at any time within the taxable year.\n The petitioners' community estate held a half interest in a partnership whose principal business was cattle raising. The firm owned a tract near Amarillo, Tex. In 1926 it leased portions of this land for the purpose of \n\n[293 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n mining and operating for oil and gas. In that year the lessees paid an aggregate of $683,793.75 as advance royalties or bonuses, and were obligated to pay additional royalties of one-eighth of the product or its value as oil and gas were extracted. The leases were for terms of five years and so long thereafter as oil and gas should be produced. When the instruments were executed there was no oil well within three and a half miles of the demised land. The lessors had no right to compel the drilling of wells and none were put down during 1926. In 1930 four were drilled which proved to be commercial gas wells, all made a showing of oil, and one produced from eight to ten barrels a day.\n In their tax returns for 1926 the petitioners each claimed a pro rata share of a depletion allowance of $188,043.28, being 27 1\/2 per cent. of the bonus payments to the partnership. The Commissioner disallowed the claim. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained his decision. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's action. \n1\n We granted certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The pertinent sections of the Revenue Act of 1926 are 214(a)(9) granting a reasonable deduction for depletion in the case of oil and gas wells, and 204(c) (2) permitting computation of the allowance at 27 1\/2 per centum of the gross income from the property. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n A bonus is not proceeds from the sale of property, but payment in advance for oil and gas to be extracted, and is therefore taxable income. \n4\n As such it is a part of the 'gross income from the property' as the phrase is used in section 204(c)(2) to designate the base for the application of the percentage deduction. From these premises the \n\n[293 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n petitioners argue that the bonus received does not lose its character as income subject to depletion, merely because it happens that in the year of receipt there was no production of the depletable asset.\n The respondent replies that the allowance for depletion is a matter of grace, not of right, and that the act fails to grant any allowance on income such as that here involved. The argument is that in both the relevant sections of the act, the statute says 'in the case of ... oil and gas wells' and this expression necessarily excludes a case where no well exists. In support of this asserted statutory exclusion it is urged that a depletion allowance is essentially and exclusively reimbursement for wastage or exhaustion of assets, and Congress could not have meant to permit an allowance in any year in which there was no extraction of oil or gas, and no practical assurance of production in the future. We think these arguments cannot prevail to defeat the petitioners' right to the deduction.\n Each of the Revenue Acts, 1916 to 1934, inclusive, has granted as a deduction from gross income a reasonable allowance for depletion 'in the case of ... oil and gas wells.' \n5\n The regulations under the 1926 Act and its predecessors dealing with cost depletion treated bonus or advanced royalty as subject to depletion,6 and these have been approved by reenactment of the statutory provision without alteration. That under the law and the regulations a lessor is entitled to a depletion allowance on bonus payments is settled by the decisions of this court. \n7\n It \n\n[293 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n has never been held here that the existence of a well conditioned the right to depletion. Nor, until recently, has the Treasury so ruled. After the decision of the Murphy Oil Co. Case, supra, there arose a doubt as to how the flat percentage allowance first permitted by the Act of 1926 should be applied to bonus payments. In answer to a request, the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue rendered an opinion8 in which he said:\n'The four situations to which attention is called are as follows:\n\n'(1) No oil being produced when the bonus was received, but future production practically assured because of nearby wells and geological indications.\n\n'(2) No oil being produced when the bonus was received, but property became productive within the taxable year.\n\n'(3) No oil being produced when the bonus was received, and not more than a speculative prospect of future oil production at that time, but property is now known to have become productive after the taxable year.\n\n'(4) Property has never become productive.' and held that depletion should be allowed in situations (1) and (2) and denied in situations (3) and (4).\n\n In the present case the Board of Tax Appeals followed an earlier decision in which it had referred to portions of the General Counsel's opinion with disapproval, but found it unnecessary to decide whether it was sound. \n9\n In that case no well had been drilled on the leased property within the taxable year in which the bonus was paid, and the Board, saying that depletion could not be allowed except as an incident of actual production, refused the claimed percentage deduction. In a later case10 \n\n[293 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n where it appeared the whole of the petitioner's land was proved oil and gas territory and a gas well had been drilled in a prior year and shut in for lack of pipe-line facilities, so that there was no actual production during the taxable year in which the bonus was received, the Board overruled the taxpayer's claim for depletion, adhering to its position that production during the year was prerequisite to any allowance and refusing to follow General Counsel's opinion.\n The situation presented by the administrative rulings is this: A bonus is not a receipt from a sale of a capital asset and may not be returned as such; it is income in the year received; if any depletion is to be allowed against the receipt, the allowance must be claimed for the year of receipt; it cannot be allowed in any later year;11 if the taxpayer computes depletion upon the basis of cost or March 1, 1913 value he may deduct depletion from a bonus payment, irrespective of the sinking of a well or the production of any oil or gas;12 if, however, he elects to avail himself of the alternative method of computing deduction at a per cent. of gross income, though the nature of the deduction is unchanged,13 he may not have any unless there be production within the taxable year; if the production be but trifling he may take a full percentage deduction upon the entire bonus, however disproportionate the allowance to the actual extraction of oil during the year. To condition the allowance on actual production, however small, or the imminent probability of production, and to deal in refinements as to the degree of probability of future production is in many cases to deny any deduction where the taxpayer elects to compute it under section 204(c)(2) (flat percentage of gross income from \n\n[293 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n the property) and permit it where he elects to compute it under section 204(c) (on the basis of cost). But the nature and the purpose of the allowance is the same in both cases, and we find neither statutory authority nor logical justification for withholding it in the one and granting it in the other; much less for making the decision turn upon the circumstance that no production is obtained within the year in which the bonus is paid.\n As to income tax liability in the year of termination of the lease, on account of bonus paid at the execution of the lease, if no mineral has then been extracted, we express no opinion.\n The judgments are\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 70 F.(2d) 785. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n293 \nU.S. 541\n, 55 S.Ct. 89, 79 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 44 Stat. 9, 14, 26, 27, U.S.C.

BLAISDELL(1934)\nNo. 370\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.[ Home Bldg . & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell \n290 U.S. 398\n (1934) ]\n\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Karl H. Covell and Alfred W. Bowen, both of Minneapolis, Minn ., for appellant.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry H. Peterson and Wm. S. Ervin, both of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant contests the validity of chapter 339 of the Laws of Minnesota of 1933, p. 514, approved April 18, 1933, called the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Law, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 416]\n\u00a0\n as being repugnant to the contract clause (article 1,  10) and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The statute was sustained by the Supreme Court of Minnesota (249 N.W. 334, 86 A.L.R. 1507; 249 N.W. 893), and the case comes here on appeal.\n The act provides that, during the emergency declared to exist, relief may be had through authorized judicial proceedings with respect to foreclosures of mortgages, and execution sales, of real estate; that sales may be postponed and periods of redemption may be extended. The act does not apply to mortgages subsequently made nor to those made previously which shall be extended for a period ending more than a year after the passage of the act (part 1,  8). There are separate provisions in part 2 relating to homesteads, but these are to apply 'only to cases not entitled to relief under some valid provision of Part One.' The act is to remain in effect 'only during the continuance of the emergency and in no event beyond May 1, 1935.' No extension of the period for redemption and no postponement of sale is to be allowed which would have the effect of extending the period of redemption beyond that date. Part 2,  8.\n The act declares that the various provisions for relief are severable; that each is to stand on its own footing with respect to validity. Part 1 ,  9. We are here concerned with the provisions of part 1,  4, authorizing the district court of the county to extend the period of redemption from foreclosure sales 'for such additional time as the court may deem just and equitable,' subject to the above-described limitation. The extension is to be made upon application to the court, on notice, for an order determining the reasonable value of the income on the property involved in the sale, or, if it has no income, then the reasonable rental value of the property, and directing the mortgagor 'to pay all or a reasonable part of such \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 417]\n\u00a0\n income or rental value, in or toward the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, mortgage ... indebtedness at such times and in such manner' as shall be determined by the court. \n1\n The section also provides that the time for re- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 418]\n\u00a0\n demption from foreclosure sales theretofore made, which otherwise would expire less than thirty days after the approval of the act, shall be extended to a date thirty days after its approval, and application may be made to the court within that time for a further extension as provided in the section. By another provision of the act, no action, prior to May 1, 1935, may be maintained for a deficiency judgment until the period of redemption as allowed by existing law or as extended under the provisions of the act has expired. Prior to the expiration of the extended period of redemption, the court may revise or alter the terms of the extension as changed circumstances may require. Part 1,  5.\n Invoking the relevant provision of the statute, appellees applied to the district court of Hennepin county for an order extending the period of redemption from a foreclosure sale. Their petition stated that they owned a lot \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 419]\n\u00a0\n in Minneapolis which they had mortgaged to appellant; that the mortgage contained a valid power of sale by advertisement, and that by reason of their default the mortgage had been foreclosed and sold to appellant on May 2, 1932, for $3,700.98; that appellant was the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale; that, because of the economic depression, appellees had been unable to obtain a new loan or to redeem, and that, unless the period of redemption were extended, the property would be irretrievably lost; and that the reasonable value of the property greatly exceeded the amount due on the mortgage, including all liens, costs, and expenses.\n On the hearing, appellant objected to the introduction of evidence upon the ground that the statute was invalid under the federal and state Constitutions, and moved that the petition be dismissed. The motion was granted, and a motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the state reversed the decision of the district court. 249 N.W. 334, 337, 86 A.L.R. 1507. Evidence was then taken in the trial court, and appellant renewed its constitutional objections without avail. The court made findings of fact setting forth the mortgage made by the appellees on August 1, 1928, the power of sale contained in the mortgage, the default and foreclosure by advertisement, and the sale to appellant on May 2, 1932, for $3,700.98. The court found that the time to redeem would expire on May 2, 1933, under the laws of the state as they were in effect when the mortgage was made and when it was foreclosed; that the reasonable value of the income on the property, and the reasonable rental value, was $40 a month; that the bid made by appellant on the foreclosure sale, and the purchase price, were the full amount of the mortgage indebtedness, and that there was no deficiency after the sale; that the reasonable present market value of the premises was $6,000; and that the \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 420]\n\u00a0\n total amount of the purchase price, with taxes and insurance premiums subsequently paid by appellant, but exclusive of interest from the date of sale, was $4,056.39. The court also found that the property was situated in the closely built-up portions of Minneapolis; that it had been improved by a two-car garage, together with a building two stories in height which was divided into fourteen rooms; that the appellees, husband and wife, occupied the premises as their homestead, occupying three rooms and offering the remaining rooms for rental to others.\n The court entered its judgment extending the period of redemption of May 1, 1935, subject to the condition that the appellees should pay to the appellant $40 a month through the extended period from May 2, 1933; that is, that in each of the months of August, September, and October, 1933, the payments should be $80, in two installments, and thereafter $40 a month, all these amounts to go to the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, and mortgage indebtedness. \n2\n It is this judgment, sustained by the Supreme Court of the state on the authority of its former opinion, which is here under review. 249 N.W. 893.\n The state court upheld the statute as an emergency measure. Although conceding that the obligations of the mortgage contract were impaired, the court decided that what it thus described as an impairment was, notwithstanding the contract cause of the Federal Constitution, within the police power of the state as that power was called into exercise by the public economic emergency which the Legislature had found to exist. Attention is thus directed to the preamble and first section of the \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 421]\n\u00a0\n statute which described the existing emergency in terms that were deemed to justify the temporary relief which the statute affords. \n3\n The state court, declaring that it \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 422]\n\u00a0\n could not say that this legislative finding was without basis, supplemented that finding by its own statement of conditions of which it took judicial notice. The court said:\n'In addition to the weight to be given the determination of the Legislature that an economic emergency exists which demands relief, the court must take notice of other considerations. The members of the Legislature come from every community of the state and from all the walks of life. They are familiar with conditions generally in every calling, occupation, profession, and business in the state. Not only they, but the courts must be guided by what is common knowledge. It is common knowledge that in the last few years land values have shrunk enormously. Loans made a few years ago upon the basis of the then going values cannot possibly be replaced on the basis of present values. We all know that when this law was enacted the large financial companies, which had made it their business to invest in mortgages, had ceased to do so. No bank would directly or indirectly loan on real estate mortgages. Life insurance companies, large investors in such mortgages, had even declared a moratorium as to the loan provisions of their policy contracts. The President had closed banks temporarily. The Con- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 423]\n\u00a0\n gress, in addition to many extraordinary measures looking to the relief of the economic emergency, had passed an act to supply funds whereby mortgagors may be able within a reasonable time to refinance their mortgages or redeem from sales where the redemption has not expired. With this knowledge the court cannot well hold that the Legislature had no basis in fact for the conclusion that an economic emergency existed which called for the exercise of the police power to grant relief.'\n\n\n Justice Olsen of the state court, in a concurring opinion, added the following:\n'The present nation wide and world wide business and financial crisis has the same results as if it were caused by flood, earthquake, or disturbance in nature. It has deprived millions of persons in this nation of their employment and means of earning a living for themselves and their families; it has destroyed the value of and the income from all property on which thousands of people depended for a living; it actually has resulted in the loss of their homes by a number of our people, and threatens to result in the loss of their homes by many other people in this state; it has resulted in such widespread want and suffering among our people that private, state, and municipal agencies are unable to adequately relieve the want and suffering, and Congress has found it necessary to step in and attempt to remedy the situation by federal aid. Millions of the people's money were and are yet tied up in closed banks and in business enterprises.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 424]\n\u00a0\n We approach the questions thus presented upon the assumption made below, as required by the law of the state, that the mortgage contained a valid power of sale to be exercised in case of default; that this power was validly exercised; that under the law then applicable the period of redemption from the sale was one year, and that it has been extended by the judgment of the court over the opposition of the mortgagee-purchaser; and that, during the period thus extended, and unless the order for extension is modified, the mortgagee-purchaser will be unable to obtain possession, or to obtain or convey title in fee, as he would have been able to do had the statute \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 425]\n\u00a0\n not been enacted. The statute does not impair the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness. The obligation for interest remains. The statute does not affect the validity of the sale or the right of a mortgagee- purchaser to title in fee, or his right to obtain a deficiency judgment, if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the prescribed period. Aside from the extension of time, the other conditions of redemption are unaltered. While the mortgagor remains in possession, he must pay the rental value as that value has been determined, upon notice and hearing, by the court. The rental value so paid is devoted to the carrying of the property by the application of the required payments to taxes, insurance, and interest on the mortgage indebtedness. While the mortgagee-purchaser is debarred from actual possession, he has, so far as rental value is concerned, the equivalent of possession during the extended period.\n\n In determining whether the provision for this temporary and conditional relief exceeds the power of the state by reason of the clause in the Federal Constitution prohibiting impairment of the obligations of contracts, we must consider the relation of emergency to constitutional power, the historical setting of the contract clause, the development of the jurisprudence of this Court in the construction of that clause, and the principles of construction which we may consider to be established.\n Emergency does not create power. Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions imposed upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency. Its grants of power to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency. What power was thus granted and what limitations were thus imposed are questions \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 426]\n\u00a0\n which have always been, and always will be, the subject of close examination under our constitutional system.\n While emergency does not create power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. 'Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.' Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 348\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, 302, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann.Cas. 1918A, 1024. The constitutional question presented in the light of an emergency is whether the power possessed embraces the particular exercise of it in response to particular conditions. Thus, the war power of the federal government is not created by the emergency of war, but it is a power given to meet that emergency. It is a power to wage war sucessfully, and thus it permits the harnessing of the entire energies of the people in a supreme co-operative effort to preserve the nation. But even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties. \n5\n When the provisions of the Constitution, in grant or restriction, are specific, so particularized as not to admit of construction, no question is presented. Thus, emergency would not permit a state to have more than two Senators in the Congress, or permit the election of President by a general popular vote without regard to the number of electors to which the States are respectively entitled, or permit the States to 'coin money' or to 'make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.' But, where constitutional grants and limitations of power are set forth in general clauses, which afford a broad outline, the process of construction is essential to fill in the details. That is true of the contract clause. The necessity of construction is not obviated by \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 427]\n\u00a0\n the fact that the contract clause is associated in the same section with other and more specific prohibitions. Even the grouping of subjects in the same clause may not require the same application to each of the subjects, regardless of differences in their nature. See Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505; Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 434\n, 52 S.Ct. 607\n\n\n In the construction of the contract clause. the debates in the Constitutional Convention are of little aid. \n6\n But the reasons which led to the adoption of that clause, and of the other prohibitions of section 10 of article 1, are not left in doubt, and have frequently been described with eloquent emphasis. \n7\n The widespread distress following the revolutionary period and the plight of debtors had called forth in the States an ignoble array of legislative schemes for the defeat of creditors and the invasion of contractual obligations. Legislative interferences had been so numerous and extreme that the confidence essential to prosperous trade had been undermined and the utter destruction of credit was threatened. 'The sober people of America' were convinced that some 'thorough reform' was needed which would 'inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society.' The Federalist, No. 44. It was necessary to interpose the restraining power of a central authority in order to secure the foundations even of 'private faith.' The occasion and general purpose of \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 428]\n\u00a0\n the contract clause are summed up in the terse statement of Chief Justice Marshall in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 354, 355: 'The power of changing the relative situation of debtor and creditor, of interfering with contracts, a power which comes home to every man, touches the interest of all, and controls the conduct of every individual in those things which he supposes to be proper for his own exclusive management, had been used to such an excess by the state legislatures, as to break in upon the ordinary intercourse of society, and destroy all confidence between man and man. This mischief had become so great, so alarming, as not only to impair commercial intercourse, and threaten the existence of credit, but to sap the morals of the people, and destory the sanctity of private faith. To guard against the continuance of the evil, was an object of deep interest with all the truly wise, as well as the virtuous, of this great community, and was one of the important benefits expected from a reform of the government.'\n But full recognition of the occasion and general purpose of the clause does not suffice to fix its precise scope. Nor does an examination of the details of prior legislation in the States yield criteria which can be considered controlling. To ascertain the scope of the constitutional prohibition, we examine the course of judicial decisions in its application. These put it beyond question that the prohibition is not an absolute and and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula. Justice Johnson, in Ogden v. Saunders, supra, page 286 of 12 Wheat., adverted to such a misdirected effort in these words: 'It appears to me, that a great part of the difficulties of the cause, arise from not giving sufficient weight to the general intent of this clause in the constitution, and subjecting it to a severe literal construction, which would be better adapted to special pleadings.' And, after giving his view as to the purport of the clause, 'that the states shall pass no law, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 429]\n\u00a0\n attaching to the acts of individuals other effects or consequences than those attached to them by the laws existing at their date; and all contracts thus construed, shall be enforced according to their just and reasonable purport,' Justice Johnson added: 'But to assign to contracts, universally, a literal purport, and to exact from them a rigid literal fulfilment, could not have been the intent of the constitution. It is repelled by a hundred examples. Societies exercise a positive control as well over the inception, construction and fulfilment of contracts, as over the form and measure of the remedy to enforce them.'\n The inescapable problems of construction have been: What is a contract?8 What are the obligations of contracts? What constitutes impairment of these obligations? What residuum of power is there still in the States, in relation to the operation of contracts, to protect the vital interests of the community? Questions of this character, 'of no small nicety and intricacy, have vexed the legislative halls, as well as the judicial tribunals, with an uncounted variety and frequency of litigation and speculation.' Story on the Constitution,  1375.\n The obligation of a contract is the law which binds the parties to perform their agreement. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 197; Story, op. cit.,  1378. This Court has said that 'the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 430]\n\u00a0\n is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms. This principle embraces alike those which affect its validity, construction, discharge, and enforcement. ... Nothing can be more material to the obligation than the means of enforcement. ... The ideas of validity and remedy are inseparable, and both are parts of the obligation, which is guaranteed by the Constitution against invasion.' Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550, 552. See, also, Walker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314, 317. But this broad language cannot be taken without qualification. Chief Justice Marshall pointed out the distinction between obligation and remedy. Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, 4 Wheat. 200. Said he: The distinction between the obligation of a contract, and the remedy given by the legislature to enforce that obligation, has been taken at the bar, and exists in the nature of things. Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the nation shall direct.' And in Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, supra, 4 Wall. 553, 554, the general statement above quoted was limited by the further observation that 'it is competent for the States to change the form of the remedy, or to modify it otherwise, as they may see fit, provided no substantial right secured by the contract is thereby impaired. No attempt has been made to fix definitely the line between alterations of the remedy, which are to be deemed legitimate, and those which, under the form of modifying the remedy, impair substantial rights. Every case must be determined upon its own circumstances.' And Chief Justice Waite, quoting this language in Antoni v. Greenhow, \n107 \nU.S. 769, 775\n, 2 S.Ct. 91, 96, added: 'In all such cases the question becomes, therefore, one of reasonableness, and of that the legislature is primarily the judge.' \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 431]\n\u00a0\n The obligations of a contract are impaired by a law which renders them invalid, or releases or extinguishes them9 (Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, 4 Wheat. 197, 198) and impairment, as above noted, has been predicated of laws which without destroying contracts derogate from substantial contractual rights. \n10\n In Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, a state insolvent law, which discharged the debtor from liability, was held to be invalid as applied to contracts in existence when the law was passed. See Ogden v. Saunders, supra. In Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, the legislative acts, which were successfully assailed, exempted the occupant of land from the payment of rents and profits to the rightful owner, and were 'parts of a system the object of which was to compel the rightful owner to relinquish his lands or pay for all lasting improvements made upon them, without his consent or default.' In Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, state legislation, which had been enacted for the relief of debtors in view of the seriously depressed condition of business, 11 following the panic of 1837, and which provided that the equitable estate of the mortgagor should not be extin- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 432]\n\u00a0\n guished for twelve months after sale on foreclosure, and further prevented any sale unless two-thirds of the appraised value of the property should be bid therefor, was held to violate the constitutional provision. It will be observed that in the Bronson Case, aside from the requirement as to the amount of the bid at the sale, the extension of the period of redemption was unconditional, and there was no provision, as in the instant case, to secure to the mortgagee the rental value of the property during the extended period. McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608; Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing, 3 How. 707, and Howard v. Bugbee, 24 How. 461, followed the decision in Bronson v. Kinzie; that of McCracken, condemning a statute which provided that an execution sale should not be made of property unless it would bring two-thirds of its value according to the opinion of three householders; that of Gantly's Lessee, condemning a statute which required a sale for not less than one- half the appraised value; and that of Howard, making a similar ruling as to an unconditional extension of two years for redemption from foreclosure sale. In Planter's Bank v. Sharp, 6 How. 301, a state law was found to be invalid which prevented a bank from transferring notes and bills receivable which it had been duly authorized to acquire. In Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, supra, a statute which restricted the power of taxation which had previously been given to provide for the payment of municipal bonds was set aside. Louisiana ex rel. Nelson v. Police Jury of St. Martin's Parish, \n111 \nU.S. 716\n, 4 S.Ct. 648, and Seibert v. Lewis, \n122 \nU.S. 284\n, 7 S.Ct. 1190, are similar cases. In Walker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314, the statute, which was held to be repugnant to the contract clause, was enacted in 1870, and provided that, in all suits pending on any debt or contract made before June 1, 1865, the plaintiff should not have a verdict unless it appeared that all taxes chargeable by law on the same had been \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 433]\n\u00a0\n duly paid for each year since the contract was made; and, further, that in all cases of indebtedness of the described class the defendant might offset any losses he had suffered in consequence of the late war either from destruction or depreciation of property. See Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 U.S. 415\n, 419. In Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610, and Edwards v. Kearzey, \n96 U.S. 595\n, statutes applicable to prior contracts were condemned because of increases in the amount of the property of judgment debtors which were exempted from levy and sale on execution. But, in Penniman's Case, \n103 U.S. 714\n, 720, the Court decided that a statute abolishing imprisonment for debt did not, within the meaning of the Constitution, impair the obligation of contracts previously made;12 and the Court said: 'The general doctrine of this court on this subject may be thus stated: In modes of proceeding and forms to enforce the contract the legislature has the control, and may enlarge, limit, or alter them, provided it does not deny a remedy or so embarrass it with conditions or restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right.' In Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S.Ct. 1042, the Court held that a statute which authorized the redemption of property sold on foreclosure, where no right of redemption previously existed, or which extended the period of redemption beyond the time formerly allowed, could not constitutionally apply to a sale under a mortgage executed before its passage. This ruling was to the same effect as that in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, and Howard v. Bugbee, supra. But in the Barnitz Case, the statute contained a provision for the prevention of waste, and authorized the appointment of a receiver of the premises sold. Otherwise the extension of the period for redemption was unconditional, and, in case a receiver was appointed, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 434]\n\u00a0\n the income during the period allowed for redemption, except what was necessary for repairs and to prevent waste, was still to go to the mortgagor.\n None of these cases, and we have cited those upon which appellant chiefly relies, is directly applicable to the question now before us in view of the conditions with which the Minnesota statute seeks to safeguard the interests of the mortgagee-purchaser during the extended period. And broad expressions contained in some of these opinions went beyond the requirements of the decision, and are not controlling. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399.\n Not only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the state retains over remedial processes,13 but the state also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 435]\n\u00a0\n not matter that legislation appropriate to that end 'nhas the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect.' Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 189. Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order. The policy of protecting contracts against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government by virtue of which contractual relations are worth while,-a government which retains adequate authority to secure the peace and good order of society. This principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of state power has had progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court.\n While the charters of private corporations constitute contracts, a grant of exclusive privilege is not to be implied as against the state. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420. And all contracts are subject to the right of eminent domain. West River Bridge v. Dix, 6 How. 507.14 The reservation of this necessary authority of the state is deemed to be a part of the contract. In the case last cited, the Court answered the forcible challenge of the state's power by the following statement of the controlling principle, a statement reiterated by this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer, nearly fifty years later, in Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685, 692\n, 17 S.Ct. 718, 721: 'But into all contracts, whether made between states and individuals or between individuals only, there enter conditions which arise, not out of the lit- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 436]\n\u00a0\n eral terms of the contract itself. They are superinduced by the pre- existing and higher authority of the laws of nature, of nations, or of the community to which the parties belong. They are always presumed, and must be presumed, to be known and recognized by all, are binding upon all, and need never, therefore, be carried into express stipulation, for this could add nothing to their force. Every contract is made in subordination to them, and must yield to their control, as conditions inherent and paramount, wherever a necessity for their execution shall occur.'\n The Legislature cannot 'bargain away the public health or the public morals.' Thus the constitutional provision against the impairment of contracts was held not to be violated by an amendment of the state Constitution which put an end to a lottery theretofore authorized by the Legislature. Stone v. Mississippi, \n101 U.S. 814\n, 819. See, also, Douglas v. Kentucky, \n168 U.S. 488\n, 497-499, 18 S.Ct. 199; compare New Orleans v. Houston, \n119 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 7 S.Ct. 198. The lottery was a valid enterprise when established under express state authority, but the Legislature in the public interest could put a stop to it. A similar rule has been applied to the control by the state of the sale of intoxicating liquors. Boston Beer Company v. Massachusetts, \n97 \nU.S. 25, 32\n, 33 S.. See Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 664\n, 665 S., 8 S.Ct. 273. The states retain adequate power to protect the public health against the maintenance of nuisances despite insistence upon existing contracts. Northwestern Fertilizing Company v. Hyde Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n, 667; Butchers' Union Company v. Crescent City Company, \n111 \nU.S. 746, 750\n, 4 S.Ct. 652. Legislation to protect the public safety comes within the same category of reserved power. Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 70\n, 74 S., 18 S.Ct. 513; Texas & N.O.R.R. Co. v. Miller, \n221 \nU.S. 408, 414\n, 31 S.Ct. 534; Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 34 S.Ct. 364. This principle has had recent and noteworthy application to the regulation of the use of public highways by common carriers and 'contract carriers,' where the assertion of \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 437]\n\u00a0\n interference with existing contract rights has been without avail. Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 390\n, 391 S., 52 S.Ct. 581; Stephenson v. Binford, supra.\n The economic interests of the state may justify the exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts. In Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473\n, 26 S.Ct. 127, riparian owners in South Carolina had made a contract for a clear passage through a creek by the removal of existing obstructions. Later, the Legislature of the state, by virtue of its broad authority to make public improvements, and in order to increase the taxable value of the lowlands which would be drained, authorized the construction of a dam across the creek. The Court sustained the statute upon the ground that the private interests were subservicent to the public right. The Court said ( Id. page 480 of 199 U.S., 26 S.Ct. 127, 130): 'It is the settled law of this court that the interdiction of statutes impairing the obligation of contracts does not prevent the state from exercising such powers as are vested in it for the promotion of the common weal, or are necessary for the general good of the public, though contracts previously entered into between individuals may thereby be affected. This power, which, in its various ramifications, is known as the police power, is an exercise of the sovereign right of the government to protect the lives, health, morals, comfort, and general welfare of the people, and is paramount to any rights under contracts between individuals.' A statute of New Jersey (P.L.N.J. 1905, p. 461 (4 Comp.St. 1910, p. 5794)) prohibiting the transportation of water of the state into any other state was sustained against the objection that the statute impaired the obligation of contracts which had been made for furnishing such water to persons without the state. Said the Court, by Mr. Justice Holmes (Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U.S. page 357, 28 S.Ct. 529, 531, 14 Ann.Cas. 560): 'One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the state by mak- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 438]\n\u00a0\n ing a contract about them. The contract will carry with it the infirmity of the subject-matter.' The general authority of the Legislature to regulate, and thus to modify, the rates charged by public service corporations, affords another illustration. Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, \n116 \nU.S. 307, 325\n, 326 S., 6 S.Ct. 334, 388, 1191. In Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 \nU.S. 372\n, 39 S.Ct. 117, 9 A.L.R. 1420, a statute fixing reasonable rates, to be charged by a corporation for supplying electricity to the inhabitants of a city, superseded lower rates which had been agreed upon by a contract previously made for a definite term between the company and a consumer. The validity of the statute was sustained. To the same effect are Producers' Transportation Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 40 S.Ct. 131, and Sutter Butte Canal Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n279 \nU.S. 125, 138\n, 49 S.Ct. 325. Similarly, where the protective power of the state is exercised in a manner otherwise appropriate in the regulation of a business, it is no objection that the performance of existing contracts may be frustrated by the prohibition of injurious practices. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 363\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455. See, also, St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis, \n249 \nU.S. 269, 274\n, 39 S.Ct. 274.\n The argument is pressed that in the cases we have cited the obligation of contracts was affected only incidentally. This argument proceeds upon a misconception. The question is not whether the legislative action affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end. Another argument, which comes more closely to the point, is that the state power may be addressed directly to the prevention of the enforcement of contracts only when these are of a sort which the Legislature in its discretion may denounce as being in themselves hostile to public morals, or public health, safety, or welfare, or \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 439]\n\u00a0\n where the prohibition is merely of injurious practices; that interference with the enforcement of other and valid contracts according to appropriate legal procedure, although the interference is temporary and for a public purpose, is not permissible. This is but to contend that in the latter case the end is not legitimate in the view that it cannot be reconciled with a fair interpretation of the constitutional provision.\n Undoubtedly, whatever is reserved of state power must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power. The reserved power cannot be construed so as to destroy the limitation, nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential aspects. They must be construed in harmony with each other. This principle precludes a construction which would permit the state to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them. But it does not follow that conditions may not arise in which a temporary restraint of enforcement may be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the constitutional provision and thus be found to be within the range of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community. It cannot be maintained that the constitutional prohibition should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity such as fire, flood, or earthquake. See American Land Co. v. Zeiss, \n219 \nU.S. 47\n, 31 S.Ct. 200. The reservation of state power appropriate to such extraordinary conditions may be deemed to be as much a part of all contracts as is the reservation of state power to protect the public interest in the other situations to which we have referred. And, if state power exists to give temporary relief from the enforcement of contracts in the presence of disasters due to physical causes such as fire, flood, or earthquake, that \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 440]\n\u00a0\n power cannot be said to be nonexistent when the urgent public need demanding such relief is produced by other and economic causes.\n Whatever doubt there may have been that the protective power of the state, its police power, may be exercised-without violating the true intent of the provision of the Federal Constitution-in directly preventing the immediate and literal enforcement of contractual obligations by a temporary and conditional restraint, where vital public interests would otherwise suffer, was removed by our decisions relating to the enforcement of provisions of leases during a period of scarcity of housing. Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465; Edgar A. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S.Ct. 289. The case of Block v. Hirsh, supra, arose in the District of Columbia and involved the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The cases of the Marcus Brown Company and the Levy Leasing Company arose under legislation of New York, and the constitutional provision against the impairment of the obligation of contracts was invoked. The statutes of New York,15 declaring that a public emergency existed, directly interfered with the enforcement of covenants for the surrender of the possession of premises on the expiration of leases. Within the city of New York and contiguous counties, the owners of dwellings, including apartment and tenement houses (but excepting buildings under construction in September, 1920, lodging houses for transients and the larger hotels), were wholly deprived until November 1, 1922, of all possessory remedies for the purpose of removing from their premises the tenants or occupants in possession when the laws took effect (save in certain specified instances) providing the tenants or occupants were ready, able, and willing to pay a reasonable rent or price for their use and \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 441]\n\u00a0\n occupation. People v. La Fetra, 230 N.Y. 429, 438, 130 N.E. 601, 16 A.L.R. 152; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, 230 N.Y. 634, 130 N.E. 923. In the case of the Marcus Brown Company the facts were thus stated by the District Court (269 F. 306, 312): 'The tenant defendants herein, by law older than the state of New York, became at the landlord's option trespassers on October 1, 1920. Plaintiff had then found and made a contract with a tenant it liked better, and had done so before these statutes were enacted. By them plaintiff is, after defendants elected to remain in possession, forbidden to carry out his bargain with the tenant he chose, the obligation of the covenant for peaceable surrender by defendants is impaired, and for the next two years Feldman et al. may, if they like, remain in plaintiff's apartment, provided they make good month by month the allegation of their answer, i.e., pay what 'a court of competent jurisdiction' regards as fair and reasonable compensation for such enforced use and occupancy.' Answering the contention that the legislation as thus applied contravened the constitutional prohibition, this Court, after referring to its opinion in Block v. Hirsh, supra, said: 'In the present case more emphasis is laid upon the impairment of the obligation of the contract of the lessees to surrender possession and of the new lease which was to have gone into effect upon October 1, last year. But contracts are made subject to this exercise of the power of the State when otherwise justified, as we have held this to be.' 256 U.S. page 198, 41 S. Ct. 465, 466. This decision was followed in the case of the Levy Leasing Company, supra.\n In these cases of leases, it will be observed that the relief afforded was temporary and conditional; that it was sustained because of the emergency due to scarcity of housing; and that provision was made for reasonable compensation to the landlord during the period he was \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 442]\n\u00a0\n prevented from regaining possession. The Court also decided that, while the declaration by the Legislature as to the existence of the emergency was entitled to great respect, it was not conclusive; and, further, that a law 'depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the emergency ceases or the facts change even though valid when passed.' It is always open to judicial inquiry whether the exigency still exists upon which the continued operation of the law depends. Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543, 547\n, 548 S., 44 S.Ct. 405, 406.\n It is manifest from this review of our decisions that there has been a growing appreciation of public needs and of the necessity of finding ground for a rational compromise between individual rights and public welfare. The settlement and consequent contraction of the public demain, the pressure of a constantly increasing density of population, the interrelation of the activities of our people and the complexity of our economic interests, have inevitably led to an increased use of the organization of society in order to protect the very bases of individual opportunity. Where, in earlier days, it was thought that only the concerns of individuals or of classes were involved, and that those of the state itself were touched only remotely, it has later been found that the fundamental interests of the state are directly affected; and that the question is no longer merely that of one party to a contract as against another, but of the use of reasonable means to safeguard the economic structure upon which the good of all depends.\n It is no answer to say that this public need was not apprehended a century ago, or to insist that what the provision of the Constitution meant to the vision of that day it must mean to the vision of our time. If by the statement that what the Constitution meant at the time \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 443]\n\u00a0\n of its adoption it means to-day, it is intended to say that the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the framers, with the conditions and outlook of their time, would have placed upon them, the statement carries its own refutation. It was to guard against such a narrow conception that Chief Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning: 'We must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding' (McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407); 'a constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.' Id. page 415 of 4 Wheat. When we are dealing with the words of the Constitution, said this Court in Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 433\n, 40 S.Ct. 382, 383, 11 A.L.R. 984, 'we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. ... The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.'\n Nor is it helpful to attempt to draw a fine distinction between the intended meaning of the words of the Constitution and their intended application. When we consider the contract clause and the decisions which have expounded it in harmony with the essential reserved power of the states to protect the security of their peoples, we find no warrant for the conclusion that the clause has been warped by these decisions from its proper significance or that the founders of our government would have interpreted the clause differently had they had occasion to assume that responsibility in the conditions of the later day. The vast body of law which has been developed was unknown to the fathers, but it is believed to have preserved the essential content and the spirit of the Constitution. With a growing recognition of public needs \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 444]\n\u00a0\n and the relation of individual right to public security, the court has sought to prevent the perversion of the clause through its use as an instrument to throttle the capacity of the states to protect their fundamental interests. This development is a growth from the seeds which the fathers planted. It is a development forecast by the prophetic words of Justice Johnson in Ogden v. Saunders, already quoted. And the germs of the later decisions are found in the early cases of the Charles River Bridge and the West River Bridge, supra, which upheld the public right against strong insistence upon the contract clause. The principle of this development is, as we have seen, that the reservation of the reasonable exercise of the protective power of the state is read into all contracts, and there is no greater reason for efusing to apply this principle to Minnesota mortgages than to New York leases.\n Applying the criteria established by our decisions, we conclude:\n\n 1. \nAn emergency existed in Minnesota which furnished a proper occasion for the exercise of the reserved power of the state to protect the vital interests of the community. The declarations of the existence of this emergency by the Legislature and by the Supreme Court of Minnesota cannot be regarded as a subterfuge or as lacking in adequate basis. Block v. Hirsh, supra. The finding of the Legislature and state court has support in the facts of which we take judicial notice. Atchison, T. & S.F. Rwy. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 52 S.Ct. 146. It is futile to attempt to make a comparative estimate of the seriousness of the emergency shown in the leasing cases from New York and of the emergency disclosed here. The particular facts differ, but that there were in Minnesota conditions urgently demanding relief, if power existed to give it, is beyond cavil. As the Supreme Court of Minnesota said (249 N.W. 334, 337), the economic emergency which threatened 'the \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 445]\n\u00a0\n loss of homes and lands which furnish those in possession the necessary shelter and means of subsistence' was a 'potent cause' for the enactment of the statute.\n\n 2. \nThe legislation was addressed to a legitimate end; that is, the legislation was not for the mere advantage of particular individuals but for the protection of a basic interest of society.\n\n 3. \nIn view of the nature of the contracts in question-mortgages of unquestionable validity-the relief afforded and justified by the emergency, in order not to contravene the constitutional provision, could only be of a character appropriate to that emergency, and could be granted only upon reasonable conditions.\n\n 4. \nThe conditions upon which the period of redemption is extended do not appear to be unreasonable. The initial extension of the time of redemption for thirty days from the approval of the act was obviously to give a reasonable opportunity for the authorized application to the court. As already noted, the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness is not impaired; interest continues to run; the validity of the sale and the right of a mortgagee-purchaser to title or to obtain a deficiency judgment, if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the extended period, are maintained; and the conditions of redemption, if redemption there be, stand as they were under the prior law. The mortgagor during the extended period is not ousted from possession, but he must pay the rental value of the premises as ascertained in judicial proceedings and this amount is applied to the carrying of the property and to interest upon the indebtedness. The mortgagee-purchaser during the time that he cannot obtain possession thus is not left without compensation for the withholding of possession. Also important is the fact that mortgagees, as is shown by official reports of which we may take notice, are predominantly corporations, such as \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 446]\n\u00a0\n insurance companies, banks, and investment and mortgage companies. 16 These, and such individual mortgagees as are small investors, are not seeking homes or the opportunity to engage in farming. Their chief concern is the reasonable protection of their investment security. It does not matter that there are, or may be, individual cases of another aspect. The Legislature was entitled to deal with the general or typical situation. The relief afforded by the statute has regard to the interest of mortgagees as well as to the interest of mortgagors. The legislation seeks to prevent the impending ruin of both by a considerate measure of relief.\n In the absence of legislation, courts of equity have exercised jurisdiction in suits for the foreclosure of mortgages to fix the time and terms of sale and to refuse to confirm sales upon equitable grounds where they were found to be unfair or inadequacy of price was so gross as to shock the conscience. \n17\n The 'equity of redemption' is the creature of equity. While courts of equity could not alter the legal effect of the forfeiture of the estate at common law on breach of condition, they succeeded, operating on the conscience of the mortgagee, in maintaining that it was unreasonable that he should retain for his own benefit what was intended as a mere security, that the breach of condition was in the nature of a penalty, which ought to be relieved against, and that the mortgagor had an equity to redeem on payment of principal, interest and costs, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 447]\n\u00a0\n notwithstanding the forfeiture at law. This principle of equity was victorious against the strong opposition of the common-law judges, who thought that by 'the Growth of Equity on Equity the Heart of the Common Law is eaten out.' The equitable principle became firmly established, and its application could not be frustrated even by the engagement of the debtor entered into at the time of the mortgage, the courts applying the equitable maxim 'once a mortgage, always a mortgage, and nothing but a mortgage.' \n18\n Although the courts would have no authority to alter a statutory period of redemption, the legislation in question permits the courts to extend that period, within limits and upon equitable terms, thus providing a procedure and relief which are cognate to the historic exercise of the equitable jurisdiction. If it be determined, as it must be, that the contract clause is not an absolute and utterly unqualified restriction of the state's protective power, this legislation is clearly so reasonable as to be within the legislative competency.\n\n 5. \nThe legislation is temporary in operation. It is limited to the exigency which called it forth. While the postponement of the period of redemption from the foreclosure sale is to May 1, 1935, that period may be reduced by the order of the court under the statute, in case of a change in circumstances, and the operation of the statute itself could not validly outlast the emergency or be so extended as virtually to destroy the contracts.\n We are of the opinion that the Minnesota statute as here applied does not violate the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. Whether the legislation is wise or \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 448]\n\u00a0\n unwise as a matter of policy is a question with which we are not concerned.\n What has been said on that point is also applicable to the contention presented under the due process clause. Block v. Hirsh, supra.\n Nor do we think that the statute denies to the appellant the equal protection of the laws. The classification which the statute makes cannot be said to be an arbitrary one. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283\n, 18 S.Ct. 594; Clark v. Tutusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329\n, 22 S.Ct. 382; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146\n, 50 S.Ct. 310; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374\n, 52 S.Ct. 581.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n Few questions of greater moment than that just decided have been submitted for judicial inquiry during this generation. He simply closes his eyes to the necessary implications of the decision who fails to see in it the potentiality of future gradual but ever-advancing encroachments upon the sanctity of private and public contracts. The effect of the Minnesota legislation, though serious enough in itself, is of trivial significance compared with the far more serious and dangerous inroads upon the limitations of the Constitution which are almost certain to ensue as a consequence naturally following any step beyond the boundaries fixed by that instrument. And those of us who are thus apprehensive of the effect of this decision would, in a matter so important, be neglectful of our duty should we fail to spread upon the permanent records of the court the reasons which move us to the opposite view.\n A provision of the Constitution, it is hardly necessary to say, does not admit of two distinctly opposite inter- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 449]\n\u00a0\n pretations. It does not mean one thing at one time and an entirely different thing at another time. If the contract impairment clause, when framed and adopted, meant that the terms of a contract for the payment of money could not be altered in invitum by a state statute enacted for the relief of hardly pressed debtors to the end and with the effect of postponing payment or enforcement during and because of an economic or financial emergency, it is but to state the obvious to say that it means the same now. This view, at once so rational in its application to the written word, and so necessary to the stability of constitutional principles, though from time to time challenged, has never, unless recently, been put within the realm of doubt by the decisions of this court. The true rule was forcefully declared in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120, 121, in the face of circumstances of national peril and public unrest and disturbance far greater than any that exist to-day. In that great case this court said that the provisions of the Constitution there under consideration had been expressed by our ancestors in such plain English words that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, but that after the lapse of more than seventy years they were sought to be avoided. 'Those great and good men,' the Court said, 'foresaw that troublous times would arise, when rules and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future.' And then, in words the power and truth of which have become increasingly evident with the lapse of time, there was laid down the rule without which the Constitution would cease to be the 'supreme law of the land,' binding equally upon governments and governed at all times \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 450]\n\u00a0\n and under all circumstances, and become a mere collection of political maxims to be adhered to or disregarded according to the prevailing sentiment or the legislative and judicial opinion in respect of the supposed necessities of the hour:\n'The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism. ...'\n\n Chief Justice Taney, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How, 393, 426, said that, while the Constitution remains unaltered, it must be construed now as it was understood at the time of its adoption; that it is not only the same in words but the same in meaning, 'and as long as it continues to exist in its present form, it speaks not only in the same words, but with the same meaning and intent with which it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers, and was voted on and adopted by the people of the United States. Any other rule of construction would abrogate the judicial character of this court, and make it the mere reflex of the popular opinion or passion of the day.' And in South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 448\n, 449 S., 26 S.Ct. 110, 111, 4 Ann.Cas. 737, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brewer, this court quoted these words with approval and said:\n'The Constitution is a written instrument. As such its meaning does not alter. That which it meant when adopted, it means now. ... Those things which are within its grants of power, as those grants were understood when made, are still within them; and those things not within them remain still excluded.' \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 451]\n\u00a0\n The words of Judge Campbell, speaking for the Supreme Court of Michigan in People ex rel. Twitchell v. Blodgett, 13 Mich. 127, 139, 140, are peculiarly apposite. 'But it may easily happen,' he said, 'that specific provisions may, in unforeseen emergencies, turn out to have been inexpedient. This does not make these provisions any less binding. Constitutions can not be changed by events alone. They remain binding as the acts of the people in their sovereign capacity, as the framers of Government, until they are amended or abrogated by the action prescribed by the authority which created them. It is not completent for any department of the Government to change a constitution, or declare it changed, simply because it appears ill adapted to a new state of things.\n\n'... Restrictions have, it is true, been found more likely than grants to be unsuited to unforeseen circumstances. ... But, where evils arise from the application of such regulations, their force cannot be denied or evaded; and the remedy consists in repeal or amendment, and not in false constructions.'\n\n The provisions of the Federal Constitution, undoubtedly, are pliable in the sense that in appropriate cases they have the capacity of bringing within their grasp every new condition which falls within their meaning. \n1\n But, their meaning is changeless; it is only their application which is extensible. See South Carolina v. United States, supra, 199 U.S. pages 448, 449, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737. Constitutional grants of \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 452]\n\u00a0\n power and restrictions upon the exercise of power are not flexible as the doctrines of the common law are flexible. These doctrines, upon the principles of the common law itself, modify or abrogate themselves whenever they are or whenever they become plainly unsuited to different or changed conditions. Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, decided December 11, 1933. The distinction is clearly pointed out by Judge Cooley, 1 Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) 124:\n'A principal share of the benefit expected from written constitutions would be lost if the rules they established were so flexible as to bend to circumstances or be modified by public opinion. It is with special reference to the varying moods of public opinion, and with a view to putting the fundamentals of government beyond their control, that these instruments are framed; and there can be no such steady and imperceptible change in their rules as inheres in the principles of the common law. Those beneficent maxims of the common law which guard person and property have grown and expanded until they mean vastly more to us than they did to our ancestors, and are more minute, particular, and pervading in their protections; and we may confidently look forward in the future to still further modifications in the direction of improvement. Public sentiment and action effect such changes, and the courts recognize them; but a court or legislature which should allow a change in public sentiment to influence it in giving to a written constitution a construction not warranted by the intention of its founders, would be justly chargeable with reckless disregard of official oath and public duty; and if its course could become a precedent, these instruments would be of little avail. ... What a court is to do, therefore, is to declare the law as written, leaving it to the people themselves to make such changes as new circumstances may require. The meaning of the constitution is fixed when it is adopted, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 453]\n\u00a0\n and it is not different at any subsequent time when a court has occasion to pass upon it.'\n\n The whole aim of construction, as applied to a provision of the Constitution, is to discover the meaning, to ascertain and give effect to the intent of its framers and the people who adopted it. Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 9 S.Ct. 651. The necessities which gave rise to the provision, the controversies which preceded, as well as the conflicts of opinion which were settled by its adoption, are matters to be considered to enable us to arrive at a correct result. Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 95\n, 20 S.Ct. 747. The history of the times, the state of things existing when the provision was framed and adopted should be looked to in order to ascertain the mischief and the remedy. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 723; Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 410, 431, 432. As nearly as possible we should place ourselves in the condition of those who framed and adopted it. In re Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 7 S.Ct. 781. And, if the meaning be at all doubtful, the doubt should be resolved, wherever reasonably possible to do so, in a way to forward the evident purpose with which the provision was adopted. Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581, 602\n, 20 S. Ct. 448, 494; Jarrolt v. Moberly, \n103 U.S. 580\n, 586.\n An application of these principles to the question under review removes any doubt, if otherwise there would be any, that the contract impairment clause denies to the several states the power to mitigate hard consequences resulting to debtors from financial or economic exigencies by an impairment of the obligation of contracts of indebtedness. A candid consideration of the history and circumstances which led up to and accompanied the framing and adoption of this clause will demonstrate conclusively that it was framed and adopted with the specific and studied purpose of preventing legislation designed to relieve debtors especially in time of financial distress. In- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 454]\n\u00a0\n deed, it is not probable that any other purpose was definitely in the minds of those who composed the framers' convention or the ratifying state conventions which followed, although the restriction has been given a wider application upon principles clearly stated by Chief Justice Marshall in the Dartmouth College Case, 4 Wheat. 518, 644, 645.\n Following the Revolution, and prior to the adoption of the Constitution, the American people found themselves in a greatly impoverished condition. Their commerce had been well-nigh annihilated. They were not only without luxuries, but in great degree were destitute of the ordinary comforts and necessities of life. In these circumstances they incurred indebtedness in the purchase of imported goods and otherwise far beyond their capacity to pay. From this situation there arose a divided sentiment. On the one hand, an exact observance of public and private engagements was insistently urged. A violation of the faith of the nation or the pledges of the private individual, it was insisted, was equally forbidden by the principles of moral justice and of sound policy. Individual distress, it was urged, should be alleviated only by industry and frugality, not by relaxation of law or by a sacrifice of the rights of others. Indiscretion or imprudence was not to be relieved by legislation, but restrained by the conviction that a full compliance with contracts would be exacted. On the other hand, it was insisted that the case of the debtor should be viewed with tenderness; and efforts were constantly directed toward relieving him from an exact compliance with his contract. As a result of the latter view, state laws were passed suspending the collection of debts, remitting or suspending the collection of taxes, providing for the emission of paper money, delaying legal proceedings, etc. There followed, as there must always follow from such a course, a long trail of ills; one of the direct \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 455]\n\u00a0\n consequences being a loss of confidence in the government and in the good faith of the people. Bonds of men whose ability to pay their debts was unquestionable could not be negotiated except at a discount of 30, 40, or 50 per cent. Real property could be sold only at a ruinous loss. Debtors, instead of seeking to meet their obligations by painful effort, by industry and economy, began to rest their hopes entirely upon legislative interference. The impossibility of payment of public or private debts was widely asserted, and in some instances threats were made of suspending the administration of justice by violence. The circulation of depreciated currency became common. Resentment against lawyers and courts was freely manifested, and in many instances the course of the law was arrested and judges restrained from proceeding in the execution of their duty by popular and tumultuous assemblages. This state of things alarmed all thoughtful men, and led them to seek some effective remedy. Marshall, Life of Washington (1807), vol. 5, pp. 88-131.\n That this brief outline of the situation is entirely accurate is borne out by all contemporaneous history, as well as by writers of distinction of a later period. \n2\n Compare \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 456]\n\u00a0\n Edwards v. Kearzey, \n96 U.S. 595\n, 604-607. The appended note might be extended for many pages by the addition of similar quotations from the same and other writers, but enough appears to establish beyond all ques- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 457]\n\u00a0\n tion the extreme gravity of the emergency, the great difficulty and frequent impossibility which confronted debtors generally in any effort to discharge their obligations. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 458]\n\u00a0\n In an attempt to meet the situation, recourse was had to the Legislatures of the several states under the Confederation; and these bodies passed, among other acts, the following: Laws providing for the emission of bills of credit and making them legal tender for the payment of debts, and providing also for such payment by the delivery of specific property at a fixed valuation; installment laws, authorizing payment of overdue obligations at future intervals of time; stay laws and laws temporarily closing access to the courts; and laws discriminating against British creditors, I have selected, out of a vast number, a few historical comments upon the character and effect of these legislative devices. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 459]\n\u00a0\n In the midst of this confused, gloomy, and seriously exigent condition of affairs, the Constitutional Convention of 1787 met at Philadelphia. The defects of the Articles of Confederation were so great as to be beyond all hope of amendment, and the Convention, acting in technical excess of its authority, proceeded to frame for submission to the people of the several states an entirely new Constitution. Shortly prior to the meeting of the Convention, Madison had assailed a bill pending in the Virginia Assembly, proposing the payment of private debts in three annual installments, on the ground that 'no legislative principle could vindicate such an interposition \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 460]\n\u00a0\n of the law in private contracts.' The bill was lost by a single vote. \n4\n Pelatiah Webster had likewise assailed similar laws as altering the value of contracts; and William Paterson, of New Jersey, had insisted that 'the legislature should leave the parties to the law under which they contracted.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In the plan of government especially urged by Sherman and Ellsworth there was an article proposing that the Legislatures of the individual states ought not to possess a right to emit bills of credit, etc., 'or in any manner to obstruct or impede the recovery of debts, whereby the \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 461]\n\u00a0\n interests of foreigners or the citizens of any other state may be affected.' 6 And on July 13, 1787, Congress in New York, acutely conscious of the evils engendered by state laws interfering with existing contracts,7 passed the Northwest Territory Ordinance, which contained the clause: 'And, in the just preservation of rights and property, it is understood and declared, that no law ought ever to be made or have force in the said territory, that shall, in any manner whatever, interfere with or affect private contracts, or engagements, bona fide, and without fraud previously formed.' \n8\n It is not surprising, therefore, that, after the Convention had adopted the clauses, no state shall 'emit bills of credit,' or 'make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts,' Mr. King moved to add a 'prohibition on the states to interfere in private contracts.' This was opposed by Gouverneur Morris and Colonel Mason. Colonel Mason thought that this would be carrying the restraint too far; that cases would happen that could not be foreseen where some kind of interference would be essential. This was on August 28. But Mason's view did not prevail, for, on September 14 following, the first clause of article 1,  10, was altered so as to include the provision: 'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts,' and in that form it was adopted. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Luther Martin, in an address to the Maryland House of Delegates, declared his reasons for voting against the provision. He said that he considered there might be times of such great public calamity and distress as should ren- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 462]\n\u00a0\n der it the duty of a government in some measure to interfere by passing laws totally or partially stopping courts of justice, or authorizing the debtor to pay by installments; that such regulations had been found necessary in most or all of the states 'to prevent the wealthy creditor and the moneyed man from totally destroying the poor, though industrious debtor. Such times may again arrive.' And he was apprehensive of any proposal which took from the respective states the power to give their debtor citizens 'a moment's indulgence, however necessary it might be, and however desirous to grant them aid.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n On the other hand, Sherman and Ellsworth defended the provision in a letter to the Governor of Connecticut. \n11\n In the course of the Virginia debates, Randolph declared that the prohibition would be promotive of virtue and justice, and preventive of injustice and fraud; and he pointed out that the reputation of the people had suffered because of frequent interferences by the state Legislatures with private contracts. \n12\n In the North Carolina debates, Mr. Davie declared that the prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts and other restrictions ought to supersede the laws of particular states. He thought the constitutional provisions were founded on the strongest principles of justice. \n13\n Pinckney, in the South Carolina debates, said that he considered the section including the clause in question as 'the soul of the Constitution,' teaching the states 'to cultivate those principles of public honor and private honesty which are the sure road to national character and happiness.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[290 U.S. 398, 463]\n\u00a0\n The provision was strongly defended in The Federalist, both by Hamilton in No. 7 and Madison in No. 44. Madison concluded his defense of the clause by saying: \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 464]\n\u00a0\n '... One legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish speculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society.'\n Contemporaneous history is replete with evidence of the sharp conflict of opinion with respect to the advisability of adopting the clause. Dr. Ramsay (The History of South-Carolina (1809), vol. 2, pp. 431- 433), already referred to, writing of the action of South Carolina and especially referring to the contract impairment clause, says that this Constitution was accepted and ratified on behalf of the state, and speaks of it as an act of great self-denial:\n'The power thus given up by South-Carolina, was one she thought essential to her welfare, and had freely exercised for several preceding years. Such a relinquishment she would not have made at any period of the last five years; for in them she had passed no less than six acts interfering between debtor and creditor, with the view of obtaining a respite for the former under particular circumstances of public distress. To tie up the hands of future legislatures so as to deprive them of a power of repeating similar acts on any emergency, was a display both of wisdom and magnanimity. It would seem as if experience had convinced the state of its political errors, and induced a willingness to retrace its steps and relinquish a power which had been improperly used.'\n\n There is an old case, Glaze v. Drayton, 1 Desaus. (S.C.) 109, decided in 1784, where the South Carolina court of chancery entered a decree for the specific performance of a contract for the purchase of land, but providing for the payment of the balance due under the con- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 465]\n\u00a0\n tract 'by instalments, at the times mentioned in the acts of assembly respecting the recovery of old debts.' In reporting that case soon after the adoption of the Constitution, Chancellor De Saussure added the following explanatory and illuminating note:\n'The legislature, in consideration of the distressed state of the country, after the war, had passed an act, preventing the immediate recovery of debts, and fixing certain periods for the payment of debts, far beyond the periods fixed by the contract of the parties. These interferences with private contracts, became very common with most of the state legislatures, even after the distresses arising from the war had ceased in a great degree. They produced distrust and irritation throughout the community, to such an extent, that new troubles were apprehended; and nothing contributed more to prepare the public mind for giving up a portion of the state sovereignty, and adopting an efficient national government, than these abuses of power by the state legislatures.'\n\n If it be possible by resort to the testimony of history to put any question of constitutional intent beyond the domain of uncertainty, the foregoing leaves no reasonable ground upon which to base a denial that the clause of the Constitution now under consideration was meant to foreclose state action impairing the obligation of contracts primarily and especially in respect of such action aimed at giving relief to debtors in time of emergency. And, if further proof be required to strengthen what already is inexpugnable, such proof will be found in the previous decisions of this court. There are many such decisions; but it is necessary to refer to a few only which bear directly upon the question, namely: Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311; McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608; Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing, 3 How. 707; Howard v. Bugbee, 24 How. 461; Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610; Walker v. Whitehead, \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 466]\n\u00a0\n 16 Wall. 314, 318; Edwards v. Kearzey, \n96 U.S. 595\n, 604; Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S.Ct. 1042, and Bradley v. Lightcap, \n195 \nU.S. 1\n, 24 S.Ct. 748.\n Bronson v. Kinzie was decided at the January term, 1843. The case involved an Illinois statute, extending the period of redemption for a period of twelve months after a sale under a decree in chancery, and another statute preventing a sale unless two-thirds of the amount at which the property had been valued by appraisers should be bid therefor. This Court held both statutes invalid, when applied to an existing mortgage, as infringing the contract impairment clause. No more need now be said as to the points decided. The opinion of the court says nothing about an emergency; but it is clear that the statute was passed for the purpose of meeting the panic and depression which began in 1837 and continued for some years thereafter. \n15\n And, in the light of what is now to be said, it is evident that the question of that emergency as a basis for the legislation was so definitely involved that it must have been considered by the Court.\n The emergency was quite as serious as that which the country has faced during the past three years. Indeed, it was so great that in one instance, at least, a state repudiated a portion of its public debt, and others were strongly tempted to do so.16 Mr. Warren, in his book, 'The Supreme Court in United States History,' vol. 2, pp. 376-379, gives a vivid picture of the situation. After referring to Bronson v. Kinzie and the statute extending the period of redemption therein dealt with, he points to the prevailing state of business and finance \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 467]\n\u00a0\n which had called the statute into existence; to the bank failures, state debt repudiations, scarcity of hard money, the inability to pay debts except by disposing of property at ruinous prices; to the enactment of statutes for the relief of debtors, stay laws postponing collection of debts, etc., which had been passed by state after state; and to the action of this court in striking down the state statute in the face of these conditions.\n'Unquestionably,' he continues, 'the country owes much of its prosperity to the unflinching courage with which, in the face of attack, the Court has maintained its firm stand in behalf of high standards of business morale, requiring honest payment of debts and strict performance of contracts; and its rigid construction of the Constitution to this end has been one of the glories of the Judiciary. That its decisions should, at times, have met with disfavor among the debtor class was, however, entirely natural; and while, ultimately, these debtor-relief-laws have always proved to be injurious to the very class they were designed to relieve and to increase the financial distress, fraud and extortion, temporarily, debtors have always believed such laws to be their salvation and have resented judicial decisions holding them invalid. Consequently, this opinion of the Court in the Bronson Case aroused great antagonism in the Western States. In Illinois, a mass meeting was held which resolved that the decision ought not to be heeded. ... Later, deference to the antagonism aroused against the Court by this decision was made when the Senator from Illinois, James Semple, introduced in the Senate in 1846, a joint resolution proposing a Constitutional Amendment to prohibit the Supreme Court from declaring void 'any Act of Congress or any State regulation on the ground that it is contrary to the Constitution of the United States. ...\"\n\n McMaster (supra, note 2) vol. 7, pp. 44-48, is to the same effect. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 468]\n\u00a0\n McCracken v. Hayward, decided at the January term, 1844, dealt with the same Illinois statute; but involved a sale on execution after judgment, whereas Bronson v. Kinzie involved a mortgage. The decision simply followed the Bronson Case. What has been said in respect of the background and setting of that case is equally applicable and need not be repeated.\n Gantly's Lessee v. Ewing was decided at the January term, 1845. It held unconstitutional, as applied to a pre-existing mortgage, an act of Indiana providing that no real property should be sold on execution for less than half its appraised value. The statute, like those of Illinois, was enacted for the benefit of hard-pressed debtors as a result of the same emergency. It is referred to by McMaster, supra, as one of the 'marks on the statute books' which the 'evil times through which the people were passing' had left.\n Howard v. Bugbee, decided at the December term, 1860, dealt with an Alabama statute authorizing a redemption of mortgaged property in two years after the sale under a decree. The statute was declared unconstitutional principally upon the authority of Bronson v. Kinzie. The opinion is very short, and does not refer to the question of emergency. The statute was passed, however, in 1842 (the mortgage having been executed prior thereto), and was therefore one of the emergency statutes of that period. The Alabama Supreme Court, whose decision was under review here, so treated it, and justified the statute upon that ground. 32 Ala. 713, 716, 717. It is worthy of note that, after the decision of this court in the Bugbee Case, Judge Walker, who delivered the opinion therein for the Alabama court, filed a dissenting opinion in Ex parte Pollard (Ex parte Woods), 40 Ala. 77, 110, in the course of which he said that his former opinion had been overruled by this court, and he could no longer perceive \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 469]\n\u00a0\n any ground upon which the convictions of a Legislature as to the welfare of the people could enlarge the authority to interfere, through the manipulation of the remedy, with the obligation of contracts. The basis of the legislation was, and is shown by the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court sustaining it to be, the existence of the great emergency beginning in 1837; and that question, since the Alabama decision was reviewed, was quite plainly before this court for consideration.\n Walker v. Whitehead, decided at the December term, 1872, held unconstitutional a Georgia statute requiring the plaintiff, suing on a debt or contract, to prove as a condition precedent to the entry of judgment in his favor that all legal taxes chargeable by law thereon had been duly paid for each year since the making of the debt or contract. The Georgia Supreme Court, 43 Ga. 538, 544-546, had sustained the act as a measure made necessary by the desperate financial and economic conditions in that state due to the Civil War. This court, making no response to the somewhat fervid presentation of this view of the matter by the state court, simply said that the degree of impairment was immaterial; that any impairment of the obligation of a contract is within the prohibition of the Constitution; that 'a clearer case of a law impairing the obligation of a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution, can hardly occur.'\n Edwards v. Kearzey, decided at the October term, 1877, held invalid, as applied to a preexisting debt, the provision of the North Carolina Constitution of 1868 increasing the exemptions to which a debtor was entitled. The North Carolina Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, had sustained the state constitutional provision, principally upon the ground ( Garrett v. Chesire, 69 N.C. 396, 405, 12 Am.Rep. 647) that it was adopted at a time when 'probably one-half of the debtor class are owing more old debts than \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 470]\n\u00a0\n they can pay'; and that, 'if under our circumstances our people are to be left without any exemptions, the policy of christian civilization is lost sight of. ...' In the brief of defendant in error in this court (pp. 7, 8), the view was strongly urged that the provision was not so much for the benefit of the debtor as for that of the state to prevent the evils of almost universal pauperism. Attention was called to the desperate condition of the people of the state following the Civil War, and it was said that one-third of the whole population were paupers, all their property except lands having disappeared; that one-half of the people did not own and enough to afford burial for that proportion of the population; and against those who did own land the antewar debts were piled mountain high. It was submitted that the state, on being rehabilitated, was not bound to allow the creditor to strip the few self-supporting landowners of their means of existence and thereby add them to the vast army of the impoverished; but that it had the right to defer a portion of the creditor's claim until the prostrated community had opportunity to recoup some of its losses.\n This court, in response, reviewed the history of the adoption of the contract impairment clause and held the state constitutional provision invalid. \"Policy and humanity,\" it said, 'are dangerous guides in the discussion of a legal proposition. He who follows them far is apt to bring back the means of error and delusion. The prohibition contains no qualification, and we have no judicial authority to interpolate any. ( Italics added.) Our duty is simply to execute it.'\n Barnitz v. Beverly was decided May 18, 1896. A law of Kansas extended the period of redemption from a sale under a mortgage for a period of eighteen months, during which time the mortgagor was to remain in possession and receive rents and profits, except as necessary for repairs. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 471]\n\u00a0\n The act was passed in 1893 in the midst of another panic, the severity of which, still within the memory of the members of this court, is a matter of common knowledge. The effects of that panic extended into every form of industry; bank failures were on an unprecedented scale; more than half the railroads of the country were in the hands of receivers; securities fell to 50 per cent., often to 25 per cent., of their former value; commercial failures and unemployment became general; heavy inroads were made upon public and private resources in caring for the hungry and destitute;17 great bodies of idle men-the so-called 'industrial armies'-marched toward Washington, feeding like locusts upon the country through which they passed.\n These conditions were brought to the attention of this court. In addition, the Supreme Court of Kansas, 55 Kan. 466, 484, 485, 42 P. 725, 731, 31 L.R.A. 74, 49 Am.St.Rep. 257, had relied upon them as a justification for the legislation, and had inquired why the state Legislature in a time of general depression could not 'extend the indefinite estate impliedly reserved by the mortgagor, as the federal courts of equity do in particular cases, beyond the six months allowed by the general practice?'\n In response to all of which, this court, after reviewing its former decisions, held the statute invalid as applied to a sale under a mortgage executed before its bassage.\n The present exigency is nothing new. From the beginning of our existence as a nation, periods of depression, of industrial failure, of financial distress, of unpaid and unpayable indebtedness, have alternated with years of plenty. The vital lesson that expenditure beyond income begets poverty, that public or private extrava- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 472]\n\u00a0\n gance, financed by promises to pay, either must end in complete or partial repudiation or the promises be fulfilled by self-denial and painful effort, though constantly taught by bitter experience, seems never to be learned; and the attempt by legislative devices to shift the misfortune of the debtor to the shoulders of the creditor without coming into conflict with the contract impairment clause has been persistent and oft-repeated.\n The defense of the Minnesota law is made upon grounds which were discountenanced by the makers of the Constitution and have many times been rejected by this Court. That defense should not now succeed because it constitutes an effort to overthrow the constitutional provision by an appeal to facts and circumstances identical with those which brought it into existence. With due regard for the processes of logical thinking, it legitimately cannot be urged that conditions which produced the rule may now be invoked to destroy it.\n The lower court, and counsel for the appellees in their argument here, frankly admitted that the statute does constitute a material impairment of the contract, but contended that such legislation is brought within the state power by the present emergency. If I understand the opinion just delivered, this court is not wholly in accord with that view. The opinion concedes that emergency does not create power, or increase granted power, or remove or diminish restrictions upon power granted or reserved. It then proceeds to say, however, that, while emergency does not create power, it may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power. I can only interpret what is said on that subject as meaning that, while an emergency does not diminish a restriction upon power, it furnishes an occasion for diminishing it; and this, as it seems to me, is merely to say the same thing by the use of another set of words, with the effect of affirming that which has just been denied. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 473]\n\u00a0\n It is quite true that an emergency may supply the occasion for the exercise of power, dependent upon the nature of the power and the intent of the Constitution with respect thereto. The emergency of war furnishes an occasion for the exercise of certain of the war powers. This the Constitution contemplates, since they cannot be exercised upon any other occasion. The existence of another kind of emergency authorizes the United States to protect each of the states of the Union against domestic violence. Const. art. 4,  4. But we are here dealing, not with a power granted by the Federal Constitution, but with the state police power, which exists in its own right. Hence the question is, not whether an emergency furnishes the occasion for the exercise of that state power, but whether an emergency furnishes an occasion for the relaxation of the restrictions upon the power imposed by the contract impairment clause; and the difficulty is that the contract impairment clause forbids state action under any circumstances, if it have the effect of impairing the obligation of contracts. That clause restricts every state power in the particular specified, no matter what may be the occasion. It does not contemplate that an emergency shall furnish an occasion for softening the restriction or making it any the less a restriction upon state action in that contingency than it is under strictly normal conditions.\n The Minnesota statute either impairs the obligation of contracts or it does not. If it does not, the occasion to which it relates becomes immaterial, since then the passage of the statute is the exercise of a normal, unrestricted, state power and requires no special occasion to render it effective. If it does, the emergency no more furnishes a proper occasion for its exercise than if the emergency were nonexistent. And so, while, in form, the suggested distinction seems to put us forward in a straight line, in reality it simply carries us back in a \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 474]\n\u00a0\n circle, like bewildered travelers lost in a wood, to the point where we parted company with the view of the state court.\n If what has now been said is sound, as I think it is, we come to what really is the vital question in the case: Does the Minnesota statute constitute an impairment of the obligation of the contract now under review?\n In answering that question, we must first of all distinguish the present legislation from those statutes which, although interfering in some degree with the terms of contracts, or having the effect of entirely destroying them, have nevertheless been sustained as not impairing the obligation of contracts in the constitutional sense. Among these statutes are such as affect the remedy merely, as to which this court said in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, 1 How. at page 316, and repeated in Edwards v. Kearzey, supra, 96 U.S. page 604: 'Whatever belongs merely to the remedy may be altered according to the will of the state, provided the alteration does not impair the obligation of the contract. But if that effect is produced, it is immaterial whether it is done by acting on the remedy or directly on the contract itself. In either case it is prohibited by the Constitution.'\n Another class of statutes is illustrated by those exempting from execution and sale certain classes of property, like the tools of an artisan. Chief Justice Taney, in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, speaking obiter, said that a state might properly exempt necessary implements of agriculture, or the toold of a mechanic, or articles of necessity in household furniture. But this court, in Edwards v. Kearzey, supra, struck down a provision of the North Carolina Constitution which exempted every homestead, and the dwelling and buildings used therewith, not exceeding in value $1,000, on the ground of its unconstitutionality as applied to a contract already in existence. Referring to the opinion in Bronson v. Kinzie, the court said (page 604 of 96 U.S.) \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 475]\n\u00a0\n that the Chief Justice seems to have had in his mind the maxim 'de minimis,' etc. 'Upon no other ground can any exemption be justified.'\n It is quite true also that 'the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts'; and that the Legislature cannot 'bargain away the public health or the public morals.' General statutes to put an end to lotteries, the sale or manufacture of intoxicating liquors, the maintenance of nuisances, to protect the public safety, etc., although they have the indirect effect of absolutely destroying private contracts previously made in contemplation of a continuance of the state of affairs then in existence but subsequently prohibited, have been uniformly upheld as not violating the contract impairment clause. The distinction between legislation of that character and the Minnesota statute, however, is readily observable. It may be demonstrated by an example. A, engaged in the business of manufacturing intoxicating liquor within a state, makes a contract, we will suppose, with B to manufacture and deliver at a stipulated price and at some date in the future a quantity of whisky. Before the day arrives for the performance of the contract, the state passes a law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor. The contract immediately falls because its performance has ceased to be lawful. This is so because the contract is made upon the implied condition that a particular state of things shall continue to exist, 'and when that state of things ceases to exist the bargain itself ceases to exist.' Marshall v. Glanvill, (1917) 2 K.B. 87, 91. In that case the plaintiff had been employed by the defendants upon a contract of service. While the contract was in force, the country became involved in the World War, and plaintiff was called into the military service. The court held that this rendered performance unlawful and that the contract was at an end. It said: \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 476]\n\u00a0\n 'Here the parties clearly made their bargain on the footing that it should continue lawful for the plaintiff to render and for the defendants to accept his services. The rendering and acceptance of these services ceased to be lawful in July, 1916, and thereupon the bargain came to an end.'\n In Re Shipton, Anderson & Co., (1915) 3 K.B. 676, a parcel of wheat then lying in a warehouse was sold for future payment and delivery. The wheat was subsequently requisitioned by the English government, and the sellers became unable to deliver. The Court of King's Bench Division held that the sellers were not liable. Darling, Justice, agreeing with the opinion of Lord Reading, said (pages 683, 684 of (1915) 3 K.B.):\n'If one contracts to do what is then illegal, the contract itself is altogether bad. If after the contract has been made it cannot be performed without what is illegal being done, there is no obligation to perform it. In the one case the making of the contract, in the other case the performance of it, is against public policy. It must be here presumed that the Crown acted legally, and there is no contention to the contrary. We are in a state of war; that is notorious. The subject-matter of this contract has been seized by the State acting for the general good. Salus populi suprema lex is a good maxim, and the enforcement of that essential law gives no right of action to whomsoever may be injured by it.'\n\n The general subject is discussed by this court in Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 502\n, page 513, 43 S.Ct. 437, and it is there pointed out that the effect of such a requisition is not to appropriate the contract but to frustrate it-an essentially different thing.\n The same distinction properly may be made as to the contract impairment clause, in respect of subsequent state legislation rendering unlawful a state of things which was lawful when an obligation relating thereto was contracted. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 477]\n\u00a0\n By such legislation the obligation is not impaired in the constitutional sense. The contract is frustrated-it disappears in virtue of an implied condition to that effect read into the contract itself. Thus, in F. A. Tamplin Steamship Co., Ltd., v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co., Ltd ., (1916) 2 A.C. 397, the House of Lords had before it a case where a steamer, then subject to a charter party having nearly three years to run, had been requisitioned by the Admiralty. The applicable rule was there stated to be that the court should examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made in order to see whether or not from their nature the parties must have made their bargain on the footing that a particular state of things would continue to exist. And, if they must have done so, a term to that effect would be implied, though not expressed in the contract. In Metropolitan Water Board v. Dick, Kerr & Company, ( 1918) A.C. 119, 127, 128, 137, that rule was reaffirmed, with the additional statement that a subsequent law might be the cause of an impossibility of performance, by taking away something from the control of the party as to which thing he had contracted to do or not to do something else; and that the court must determine whether this contingency is of such a character that it can reasonably be implied to have been in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made.\n Bearing in mind these aids toward determining whether such an implied condition may be read into a particular contract, let us revert to the example already given with respect to an agreement for the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor. And let us suppose that the state, instead of passing legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of the commodity, in which event the doctrine of implied conditions would be pertinent, continues to recognize the general lawfulness of the business, but, because of what it conceives to be a justifying emergency, provides that the time for the performance of existing \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 478]\n\u00a0\n contracts for future manufacture and sale shall be extended for a specified period of time. It is perfectly admissible, in view of the state power to prohibit the business, to read into the contract an implied proviso to the effect that the business of manufacturing and selling intoxicating liquors shall not, prior to the date when performance is due, become unlawful; but in the case last put, to read into the contract a pertinent provisional exception in the event of intermeddling state action would be more than unreasonable, it would be absurd, since we must assume that the contract was made on the footing that, so long as the obligation remained lawful, the impairment clause would effectively preclude a law altering or nullifying it however exigent the occasion might be.\n That, in principle, is precisely the case here. The contract is to repay a loan within a fixed time, with the express condition that upon failure the property given as security shall be sold, and that, in the absence of a timely redemption, title shall be vested absolutely in the purchaser. This contract was lawful when made; and it has never been anything else. What the Legislature has done is to pass a statute which does not have the effect of frustrating the contract by rendering its performance unlawful, but one which, at the election of one of the parties, postpones for a time the effective enforcement of the contractual obligation, notwithstanding the obligation, under the exact terms of the contract, remains lawful and possible of performance after the passage of the statute as it was before.\n The rent cases-Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S.Ct. 289-which are here relied upon, dealt with an exigent situation due to a period of scarcity of housing caused by the war. I do not stop to consider the distinctions between them and the present case or to do more than point out that the question of contract im- \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 479]\n\u00a0\n pairment received little, if any, more than casual consideration. The writer of the opinions in the first two cases, speaking for this Court in a later case, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 416\n, 43 S.Ct. 158, 160, 28 A.L.R. 1321, characterized all of them as having gone 'to the verge of the law.' It therefore seems pertinent to say that decisions which confessedly escape the limbo of unconstitutionality by the exceedingly narrow margin suggested by this characterization should be applied toward the solution of a doubtful question arising in a different field with a very high degree of caution. Reasonably considered, they do not foreclose the question here involved, and it should be determined upon its merits without regard to those cases.\n We come back, then, directly, to the question of impairment. As to that, the conclusion reached by the court here seems to be that the relief afforded by the statute does not contravene the constitutional provision because it is of a character appropriate to the emergency and allowed upon what are said to be reasonable conditions.\n It is necessary, first of all, to describe the exact situation. Appellees obtained from appellant a loan of $3,800; and, to secure its payment, executed a mortgage upon real property consisting of land and a fourteen-room house and garage. The mortgage contained the conventional Minnesota provision for foreclosure by advertisement. The mortgagors agreed to pay the debt, together with interest and the taxes and insurance on the property. They defaulted; and, in strict accordance with the bargain, appellant foreclosed the mortgage by advertisement and caused the premises to be sold. Appellant itself bought the property at the sale for a sum equal to the amount of the mortgage debt. The period of redemption from that sale was due to expire on May 2, 1933; and, assuming no redemption at the end of that day, under the law in force \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 480]\n\u00a0\n when the contract was made and when the property was sold and in accordance with the terms of the mortgage, appellant would at once have become the owner in fee and entitled to the immediate possession of the property. The statute here under attack was passed on April 18, 1933. It first recited and declared that an economic emergency existed. As applied to the present case, it arbitrarily extended the period of redemption expiring on May 2, 1933, to Mary 18, 1933-a period of sixteen days; and provided that the mortgagor might apply for a further extension to the district court of the county. That court was authorized to extend the period to a date not later than May 1, 1935, on the condition that the mortgagor should pay to the creditor all or a reasonable part of the income or rental value, as to the court might appear just and equitable, toward the payment of taxes, insurance, interest and principal mortgage indebtedness, and at such times and in such manner as should be fixed by the court. The court to whom the application in this case was made extended the time until May 1, 1935, upon the condition that payment by the mortgagor of the rental value, $40 per month, should be made.\n It will be observed that, whether the statute operated directly upon the contract or indirectly by modifying the remedy, its effect was to extend the period of redemption absolutely for a period of sixteen days, and conditionally for a period of two years. That this brought about a substantial change in the terms of the contract reasonably cannot be denied. If the statute was meant to operate only upon the remedy, it nevertheless, as applied, had the effect of destroying for two years the right of the creditor to enjoy the ownership of the property, and consequently the correlative power, for that period, to occupy, sell, or otherwise dispose of it as might seem fit. This postponement, if it had been unconditional, undoubtedly would have constituted an unconstitutional \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 481]\n\u00a0\n impairment of the obligation. This Court so decided in Bronson v. Kinzie, supra, where the period of redemption was extended for a period of only twelve months after a sale under a decree; in Howard v. Bugbee, supra, where the extension was for two years; and in Barnitz v. Beverly, supra, where the period was extended for eighteen months. Those cases, we may assume, still embody the law, since they are not overruled.\n The only substantial difference between those cases and the present one is that here the extension of the period of redemption and postponement of the creditor's ownership is accompanied by the condition that the rental value of the property shall, in the meantime, be paid. Assuming, for the moment, that a statute extending the period of redemption may be upheld if something of commensurate value be given the creditor by way of compensation, a conclusion that payment of the rental value during the two-year period of postponement is even the approximate equivalent of immediate ownership and possession is purely gratuitous. How can such payment be regarded, in any sense, as compensation for the postponement of the contract right? The ownership of the property to which petitioner was entitled carried with it, not only the right to occupy or sell it, but, ownership being retained, the right to the rental value as well. So that in the last analysis petitioner simply is allowed to retain a part of what is its own as compensation for surrendering the remainder. Moreover, it cannot be foreseen what will happen to the property during that long period of time. The buildings may deteriorate in quality; the value of the property may fall to a sum far below the purchase price; the financial needs of appellant may become so pressing as to render it urgently necessary that the property shall be sold for whatever it may bring.\n However these or other supposable contingencies may be, the statute denies appellant for a period of two years \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 482]\n\u00a0\n the ownership and possession of the property-an asset which, in any event, is of substantial character, and which possibly may turn out to be of great value. The statute, therefore, is not merely a modification of the remedy; it effects a material and injurious change in the obligation. The legally enforceable right of the creditor when the statute was passed was, at once upon default of redemption, to become the fee-simple owner of the property. Extension of the time for redemption for two years, whatever compensation be given in its place, destroys that specific right and the correlative obligation, and does so none the less though it assume to create in invitum another and different right and obligation of equal value. Certainly, if A should contract with B to deliver a specified quantity of wheat on or before a given date, legislation, however much it might purport to act upon the remedy, which had the effect of permitting the contract to be discharged by the delivery of corn of equal value, would subvert the constitutional restriction.\n A statute which materially delays enforcement of the mortgagee's contractual right of ownership and possession does not modify the remedy merely; it destroys, for the period of delay, all remedy so far as the enforcement of that right is concerned. The phrase 'obligation of a contract' in the constitutional sense imports a legal duty to perform the specified obligation of that contract, not to substitute and perform, against the will of one of the parties, a different, albeit equally valuable, obligation. And a state, under the contract impairment clause, has no more power to accomplish such a substitution than has one of the parties to the contract against the will of the other. It cannot do so either by acting directly upon the contract or by bringing about the result under the guise of a statute in form acting only upon the remedy. If it could, the efficacy of the constitutional restriction would, in large measure, be made to disappear. \n\n[290 U.S. 398, 483]\n\u00a0\n As this court has well said, whatever tends to postpone or retard the enforcement of a contract, to that extent weakens the obligation. According to one Latin proverb, 'He who gives quickly, gives twice,' and according to another, 'He who pays too late, pays less.' 'Any authorization of the postponement of payment, or of means by which such postponement may be effected, is in conflict with the constitutional inhibition.' Louisiana ex rel. Ranger v. New Orleans, \n102 U.S. 203\n, 207. I am not able to see any real distinction between a statute which in substantive terms alters the obligation of a debtor-creditor contract so as to extend the time of its performance for a period of two years and a statute which, though in terms acting upon the remedy, is aimed at the obligation (as distinguished, for example, from the judicial procedure incident to the enforcement thereof), and which does in fact withhold from the creditor, for the same period of time, the stipulated fruits of his contract.\n I quite agree with the opinion of the Court that whether the legislation under review is wise or unwise is a matter with which we have nothing to do. Whether it is likely to work well or work ill presents a question entirely irrelevant to the issue. The only legitimate inquiry we can make is whether it is constitutional. If it is not, its virtues, if it have any, cannot save it; if it is, its faults cannot be invoked to accomplish its destruction. If the provisions of the Constitution be not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be abandoned. Being unable to reach any other conclusion than that the Minnesota statute infringes the constitutional restriction under review, I have no choice but to say so.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That section is as follows:\n'Sec. 4. Period of Redemption May be Extended.-Where any mortgage upon real property has been foreclosed and the period of redemption has not yet expired, or where a sale is hereafter had, in the case of real estate mortgage foreclosure proceedings, now pending, or which may hereafter be instituted prior to the expiration of two years from and after the passage of this Act, or upon the sale of any real property under any judgment or execution where the period of redemption has not yet expired, or where such sale is made hereafter within two years from and after the passage of this Act, the period of redemption may be extended for such additional time as the court may deem just and equitable but in no event beyond May 1st, 1935; provided that the mortgagor, or the owner in possession of said property, in the case of mortgage foreclosure proceedings, or the judgment debtor, in case of sale under judgment, or execution, shall prior to the expiration of the period of redemption, apply to the district court having jurisdiction of the matter, on not less than 10 days' written notice to the mortgagee or judgment creditor, or the attorney of either, as the case may be, for an order determining the reasonable value of the income on said property, or, if the property has no income, then the reasonable rental value of the property involved in such sale, and directing and requiring such mortgagor or judgment debtor, to pay all or a reasonable part of such income or rental value, in or toward the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, mortgage or judgment indebtedness at such times and in such manner as shall be fixed and determined and ordered by the court; and the court shall thereupon hear said application and after such hearing shall make and file its order directing the payment by such mortgagor, or judgment debtor, of such an amount at such times and in such manner as to the court shall, under all the circumstances, appear just and equitable. Provided that upon the service of the notice or demand aforesaid that the running of the period of redemption shall be tolled until the court shall make its order upon such application. Provided, further, however, that if such mortgagor or judgment debtor, or personal representative, shall default in the payments, or any of them, in such order required, on his part to be done, or commits waste, his right to redeem from said sale shall terminate 30 days after such default and holders of subsequent liens may redeem in the order and manner now provided by law beginning 30 days after the filing of notice of such default with the clerk of such District Court, and his right to possession shall cease and the party acquiring title to any such real estate shall then be entitled to the immediate possession of said premises. If default is claimed by allowance of waste, such 30 day period shall not begin to run until the filing of an order of the court finding such waste. Provided, further, that the time of redemption from any real estate mortgage foreclosure or judgment or execution sale heretofore made, which otherwise would expire less than 30 days after the passage and approval of this Act, shall be and the same hereby is extended to a date 30 days after the passage and approval of this Act, and in such case, the mortgagor, or judgment debtor, or the assigns or personal representative of either, as the case may be, or the owner in the possession of the property, may, prior to said date, apply to said court for and the court may thereupon grant the relief as hereinbefore and in this section provided. Provided, further, that prior to May 1, 1935, no action shall be maintained in this state for a deficiency judgment until the period of redemption as allowed by existing law or as extended under the provisions of this Act, has expired.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A joint statement of the counsel for both parties, filed with the court on the argument in this court, shows that, after providing for taxes, insurance, and interest, and crediting the payments to be made by the mortgagor under the judgment, the amount necessary to redeem May 1, 1935, would be $4,258.82. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The preamble and the first section of the act are as follows:\n'Whereas, the severe financial and economic depression existing for several years past has resulted in extremely low prices for the products of the farms and the factories, a great amount of unemployment, an almost complete lack of credit for farmers, business men and property owners and a general and extreme stagnation of business, agriculture and industry, and\n\n'Whereas, many owners of real property, by reason of said conditions, are unable, and it is believed, will for some time be unable to meet all payments as they come due of taxes, interest and principal of mortgages on their properties and are, therefore, threatened with loss of such properties through mortgage foreclosure and judicial sales thereof, and\n\n'Whereas, many such properties have been and are being bid in at mortgage foreclosure and execution sales for prices much below what is believed to be their real values and often for much less than the mortgage or judgment indebtedness, thus entailing deficiency judgments against the mortgage and judgment debtors, and\n\n'Whereas, it is believed, and the Legislature of Minnesota hereby declares its belief, that the conditions existing as hereinbefore set forth has created an emergency of such nature that justifies and validates legislation for the extension of the time of redemption from mortgage foreclosure and execution sales and other relief of a like character; and\n\n'Whereas, The State of Minnesota passesses the right under its police power to declare a state of emergency to exist, and\n\n'Whereas, the inherent and fundamental purposes of our government is to safeguard the public and promote the general walfare of the people; and\n\n'Whereas, Under existing conditions the foreclosure of many real estate mortgages by advertisement would prevent fair, open and competitive bidding at the time of sale in the manner now contemplated by law, and\n\n'Whereas, it is believed, and the Legislature of Minnesota hereby declares its belief, that the conditions existing as hereinbefore set forth have created an emergency of such a nature that justifies and validates changes in legislation providing for the temporary manner, method, terms and conditions upon which mortgage foreclosure sales may be had or postponed and jurisdiction to administer equitable relief in connection therewith may be conferred upon the District Court, and\n\n'Whereas, Mason's Minnesota Statutes of 1927, Section 9608, which provides for the postponement of mortgage foreclosure sales, has remained for more than thirty years, a provision of the statutes in contemplation of which provisions for foreclosure by advertisement have been agreed upon.\n\n'Section 1. Emergency Declared to Exist.-In view of the situation hereinbefore set forth, the Legislature of the State of Minnesota hereby declares that a public economic emergency does exist in the State of Minnesota.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Attorney General of the state in his argument before this court made the following statement of general conditions in Minnesota: 'Minnesota is predominantly an agricultural state. A little more than one half of its people live on farms. At the time this law was passed the prices of farm products has fallen to a point where most of the persons engaged in farming could not realize enough from their products to support their families, and pay taxes and interest on the mortgages on their homes. In the fall and winter of 1932 in the villages and small cities where most of the farmers must market their produce, corn was quoted as low as eight cents per bushel, oats two cents and wheat twenty-nine cents per bushel, eggs at seven cents per dozen and butter at ten cents per pound. The industry second in importance is mining. In normal times Minnesota produces about sixty per cent of the iron of the United States and nearly thirty per cent of all the iron produced in the world. In 1932 the production of iron fell to less than fifteen per cent of normal production. The families of idle miners soon became destitute and had to be supported by public funds. Other industries of the state, such as lumbering and the manufacture of wood products, the manufacture of farm machinery and various goods of steel and iron have also been affected disastrously by the depression. Because of the increased burden on the state and its political subdivisions which resulted from the depression, taxes on lands, which provide by far the major portion of the taxes in this state, were increased to such an extent that in many instances they became confiscatory. Tax delinquencies were alarmingly great, rising as high as 78% in one county of the state. In seven counties of the state the tax delinquency was over 50%. Because of these delinquencies many towns, school districts, villages and cities were practically bankrupt. In many of these political subdivisions of the state local government would have ceased to function and would have collapsed had it not been for loans from the state.' The Attorney General also stated that serious breaches of the peace had occurred. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120-127; United States v.

The commerce clause is a good example. When that was adopted, its application was necessarily confined to the regulation of the primitive methods of transportation then employed; but railroads, automobiles, and aircraft automatically were brought within the scope and subject to the terms of the commerce clause the moment these new means of transportation came into existence, just as they were at once brought within the meaning of the word 'carrier,' as defined by the dictionaries. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thus McMaster (History of the People of the United States, vol. 1, p. 425), after referring to the conditions in Rhode Island, where 'the bonds of society were dissolved by paper money and tender laws'; in New Jersey, where the people nailed up the doors of their courthouses; in Virginia, where the debtors 'set fire to theirs in order to stop the course of justice,' says:\n'The newspapers were full of bankrupt notices. The formers' taxes amounted to near the rent of their farms. Mechanics wandered up and down the streets of every city destitute of work. Ships, shut out from every port of Europe, lay rotting in the harbors.'\n\n Channing (History of the United States, vol. 3, pp. 410-411, 482-483) paints this graphic picture of the situation:\n'Nowhere was the immediate prospect more gloomy than in South Carolina. ... In Massachusetts, at the other end of the line, the \n\n case was as bad, if not worse ... the resources of New England were insufficient to pay even what was then owing. The case of New York was even more desperate, and for the moment Philadelphia alone seemed prosperous, for the wastage of the later years of the war had been severely felt in Virginia. ...\n'... Virginia was honeycombed with debt. ...\n\n'In South Carolina, the planters were even more heavily in debt. ... The case of Thomas Bee is to the point. His creditors had secured executions against him; the sheriff had seized his property and had sold it at one-thirteenth of what it would have brought at private sale in ordinary times.'\n\n Nevins (The American States During and After the Revolution, p. 536), says:\n'The town of Greenwich computed that during each of the five years preceding 1786 the farmers had paid in taxes the entire rental value of their land.'\n\n John Fiske (The Critical Period of American History (8th Ed.) pp. 175, 180) thus describes conditions:\n'... About the market-places men spent their time angrily discussing politics, and scarcely a day passed without street-fights, which at times grew into riots. In the country, too, no less than in the cities, the goddess of discord reigned. The farmers determined to starve the city people into submission, and they entered into an agreement not to send any produce into the cities until the merchants should open their shops and begin selling their goods for paper (money) at its face value . ... The farmers threw away their milk, used their corn for fuel, and let their apples rot on the ground. ...\n\n'... The courts were broken up by armed mobs. At Concord one Job Shattuck brought several hundred armed men into the town and surrounded the court-house, while in a flerce harangue he declared that the time had come for wiping out all debts.'\n\n Dr. David Ramsay (History of the United States (2d Ed.) 1818, vol. 3, pp. 46, 47), a member of the old Congress under the Confederation, and who lived in the midst of the events of which he speaks, says: \n'The non-payment of public debts sometimes inferred a necessity, and always furnished an apology, for not discharging private contracts. Confidence between man and man received a deadly wound. Public faith being first violated, private engagements lost much of their obligatory force . ...\n\n'From the combined operation of these causes trade languished; credit expired; gold and silver vanished; and real property was depreciated to an extent equal to that of the depreciation of continental money. ...'\n\n And, finally, George Ticknor Curtis, in his History of the Origin, Formation, and Adoption of the Constitution of the United States, vol. 1, pp. 332, 333:\n'All contemporary evidence assures us that this (1783 to 1787) was a period of great pecuniary distress, arising from the depreciation of the vast quantities of paper money issued by the Federal and State governments; from rash speculations; from the uncertain and fluctuating condition of trade; and from the great amount of foreign goods forced into the country as soon as its ports were opened. Naturally, in such a state of things, the debtors were disposed to lean in favor of those systems of government and legislation which would tend to relieve or postpone the payment of their debts; and as such relief could come only from their State governments, they were naturally the friends of State\n\n'Maryland, ... In 1782 ... enacted a not friendly to any enlargement of the powers of the Federal Constitution. The same causes which led individuals to look to legislation for irregular relief from the burden of their private contracts, led them also to regard public obligations with similar impatience. Opposed to this numerous class of persons were all those who felt the high necessity of preserving inviolate every public and private obligation; who saw that the separate power of the States could not accomplish what was absolutely necessary to sustain both public and private credit; and they were as naturally disposed to look to the resources of the Union for these benefits, as the other class were to look in an opposite direction. These tendencies produced, in nearly every State, a struggle, not as between two organized parties, but one that was all along a contest for supremacy between opposite opinions, in which it was at one time doubtful to which side the scale would turn.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Charles Warren, The Making of the Constitution, pp. 5, 6:\n'The actual evils which led to the Federal Convention of 1787 are familiar to every reader of history and need no detailed description here. As is well known, they arose, in general; ... second, from State legislation unjust to citizens and productive of dissensions with neighboring States-the State laws particularly complained of being those staying process of the Courts, making property a tender in payment of debts, issuing paper money, interfering with foreclosure of mortgages. ... '\n\n Fiske, supra, note 2, p. 168:\n'By 1786, under the universal depression and want of confidence, all trade had well-nigh stopped, and political quackery, with its cheap and dirty remedies, had full control of the field. ... A craze for fictitious wealth in the shape of paper money ran like an epidemic through the country. There was a Barmecide feast of economic vagaries. ... And when we have threaded the maze of this rash legislation, we shall the better understand that clause in our federal constitution which forbids the making of laws impairing the obligation of contracts.'\n\n Beard, An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, pp. 31, 32:\n'Money capital was ... being positively attacked by the makers of paper money, stay laws, pine barren acts, and other devices for depreciating the currency or delaying the collection of debts. In addition there was a wide-spread derangement of the monetary system. ...\n\n'Creditors, naturally enough, resisted all of these schemes in the state legislatures, and ... turned to the idea of a national government so constructed as to prevent laws impairing the obligation of contract, emitting paper money, and otherwise benefiting debtors. It is idle to inquire whether the rapacity of the creditors or the total depravity of the debtors ... was responsible for this deep and bitter antagonism. It is sufficient for our purposes to discover its existence and to find its institutional reflex in the Constitution.'\n\n\n Fisher Ames, 'Eulogy on Washington,' The Life and Works of Fisher Ames, vol. 2, p. 76:\n'Accordingly, in some of the States, creditors were treated as outlaws; bankrupts were armed with legal authority to be persecutors; and by the shock of all confidence and faith, society was shaken to its foundations.'\n\n Illuminating comment upon some of this state legislation is to be found in chapter VI (volume 1) of Bancroft's 'History of the Formation of the Constitution of the United States,' under the heading, 'State Laws Impairing the Obligation of Contracts Prove the Need of an Overruling Union,' pp. 230-236.\n'(In Massachusetts) Repeated temporary stay-laws gave no real relief; they flattered and deceived the hope of the debtor, exasperating alike him and his creditor. ...\n\n'... (In Pennsylvania) in December, 1784, debts contracted before 1777 were made payable in three annual instalments. ...\n\n'Mayland, ... in 1782 ... enacted a stay-law extending to January, 1784, ...\n\n'Georgia, in August, 1782, stayed execution for two rears from and after the passing of the act. ...\n\n'... (In South Carolina in 1782) the commencement of suits was suspended till ten days after the sitting of the next general assembly . ... On the twenty-sixth day of March, 1784, came the great ordinance for the payment of debts in four annual instalments. ...'\n\n Ramsay, supra, note 2, vol. 3, pp. 65, 66, 106:\n'The distrust which prevailed among the people, respecting the punctual fulfilment of contracts, arose from the powers claimed, and, in too many instances, exercised by the state legislatures, for impairing the obligation of contracts. ... These prolific sources of evil were completely done away by the new constitution. ... (continued on p. 460) \n\n'... State legislatures, in too many instances, yielded to the necessities of their constituents, and passed laws, by which creditors were compelled, either to wait for payment of their just demands, on the tender of security, or to take property, at a valuation, or paper money falsely purporting to be the representative of specie. These laws were considered, by the British, as inconsistent with ... the treaty. ... The Americans palliated these measures, by the plea of necessity. ...'\n\n Ramsay, The History of South-Carolina (1809) vol. 2, pp. 429, 430:\n'The effects of these laws, interfering between debtors and creditors, were extensive. They destroyed public credit and confidence between man and man; injured the morals of the people, and in many instances ensured and aggravated the final ruin of the unfortunate debtors for whose temporary relief they were brought forward.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Bancroft, supra, note 3, Vol. I, p. 239. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id. vol. 1, p. 241. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Id. vol. 2, p. 136. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Curtis, supra, note 2, volume 2, pp. 366, 367. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio, art.

He says in part:\n'The Convention then was asked to perfect their action in favor of honesty and morality, by adding a prohibition on the States which would put an end to statutes enacting laws for special individuals, setting aside Court judgments, repealing vested rights, altering corporate charters, staying the bringing or prosecution of suits, preventing foreclosure of mortgages, altering the terms of contracts, and allowing tender in payment of debts of something other than that contracted for. The State Legislatures had hitherto passed such laws in abundant measure, and the situation was graphically described later by Chief Justice Marshall in one of his most noted decisions (Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 354), as follows: \n\n\"The power of changing the relative situation of debtor and creditor, of interfering with contracts, a power which comes home to every man, touches the interest of all, and controls the conduct of every individual in those things which he supposes to be proper for his own exclusive management, had been used to such an excess by the State Legislatures as to break in upon the ordinary intercourse of society and destroy all confidence between man and man. The mischief had become so great, so alarming, as not only to impair commercial intercourse and threaten the existence of credit, but to sap the morals of the people and destroy the sanctity of private faith. To guard against the continuance of the evil was an object of deep interest with all the truly wise as well as virtuous of this great community, and was one of the important benefits expected from a reform of the government.'\n\n'To obviate the conditions thus described, King of Massachusetts proposed the insertion of a new restriction on the States. ... Wilson and Madison supported his motion. Mason and G. Morris, however, believed that it went too far in interfering with the powers of the States. ... There was also a genuine belief by some delegates that, under some circumstances and in financial crises, such stay and tender laws might be necessary to avert calamitous loss to debtors. ... The other delegates had been deeply impressed by the disastrous social and economic effects of the stay and tender laws which had been enacted by most of the States between 1780 and 1786, and they decided to make similar legislation impossible in the future.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Dewey, Financial History of the United States, p. 229 et seq.; Schouler, History of the United States, vol. 4, p. 276 et seq; McMaster, supra, note 2, vol. 6, pp. 389 et seq., 523 et seq., 623 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] See Dewey, supra, note 15, p. 243 et seq.; McMaster, supra, note 2, vol. 6, p. 627 et seq., vol. 7, p. 19 et seq.; Centennial History of Illinois, vol. 2, p. 231 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See Dewey, supra, note 15, p. 444 et seq.; Andrews, The Last Quarter Century in the United States, vol. 2, p. 301 et seq. \n\n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUNT v.

Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220 (28 USCA  47), from a decree of a District Court for Northern Illinois, three judges sitting, which dismissed the complaint upon which appellants sought to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The order, made under section 13(3)(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 USCA  13(3, 4), directed the removal of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce, resulting from disparity of the intrastate and interstate switching rates of interstate rail carriers in the Chicago Switching District, lying partly in Illinois and partly in Indiana. It provided that the intrastate rate should be not less than the interstate switching rates prescribed in an earlier order \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission in Switching Rates in Chicago Switching District, 177, I. C.C. 669, of 3 cents per 100 pounds for one-line hauls, 3.5 cents for two- line hauls, and 4 cents for three or more line hauls, of carloads of minimum weight of 60,000 pounds. The rates, both interstate and intrastate, which were thus displaced were commodity rates of 2.5 cents per 100 pounds for one and two line hauls, and 3 cents for three or more line hauls. The rates are for district intrastate switching movements, having no relation to main line movements. They are chiefly between local industries, involve a complete service originating and terminating within the district, and embrace a loaded and empty car movement and two complete terminal services.\n The Commission, of its own motion, began the first proceeding in Switching Rates in Chicago Switching District, supra, in which the carriers, interested shippers, and the state commissions of Illinois and Indiana were parties, and in the course of which extensive hearings were conducted jointly by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the two state commissions. Pending this proceeding, the carriers were directed by the Interstate Commerce Commission to make a cost study of switching movements in the District. This study, which involved the preparation of statistics showing the longest, shortest and average hauls within the District and detailed cost data for selected periods in 1926-1927, was completed and submitted to the Commission and was an important part of the evidence on which it based its d cision.\n In its report and order, made July 31, 1931, the Commission found the rates which it prescribed for interstate switching service to be reasonable for future application on all commodities shipped within the District, except railway equipment on its own wheels. It also stated that a large percentage of the traffic was intrastate in character, but that the record did not disclose any difference \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n in the conditions surrounding the handling of the interstate and intrastate movements. It made no order with respect to the intrastate traffic, bt expressed the hope that the two state commissions would bring the intrastate rates into harmony with the interstate rates which it had prescribed.\n The state commissions failed to prescribe a higher level of intrastate rates, and the carriers of the District, shortly after the new rates became effective, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a petition to establish an increased rate for intrastate traffic, whereupon the Commission, on November 2, 1931, reopened the proceeding for further hearing with respect to the relationship of intrastate and interstate rates. A complaint filed with the Commission by numerous shippers attacking the lawfulness of the interstate switching rates was assigned for hearing with the proceeding already pending.\n At the hearings, the state commission in one proceeding and the shippers in the other offered evidence which, by stipulation, was treated as received in both, to show that the interstate switching rates were unreasonably high, and in support of allegations that the cost study made in the first proceeding was defective because of changed conditions. The Commission consolidated the two dockets in one report, and by its report and order of July 3, 1933, 195 I.C.C. 89, assailed here, it dismissed the complaint of the shippers with respect to the interstate rates and placed the intrastate rates on the same basis as the interstate rates already in effect. Before the hearings were closed motions of the state commissions and shippers, appellants here, that a further and more detailed cost study be made, which it was contended would be more representative of the traffic, and which would reflect conditions in 1932, five years after the period selected for study, were denied. The same questions were raised by motions to reopen the proceedings in the two dockets, or \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n for reargument, to reconsider the cost study, which were also denied.\n In the District Court below the case was submitted upon the pleadings, the two reports and orders of the Commission, and certified copies of the evidence and exhibits before the Commission in the second proceeding. The court dismissed the complaint upon findings of fact and law, rejecting the several contentions which appellants make before us.\n The scope and application of section 13(4) Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 USCA  13(4), have so recently been fully considered in opinions of this Court in United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70\n, 54 S.Ct. 28; State of Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 78 L. Ed. --, decided April 2, 1934; see also Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765\n, 51 S.Ct. 619; Florida v. United States , \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, that it is unnecessary to repeat that discussion here. Under section 13(4) the Interstate Commerce Commission is given plenary power to remove the discrimination created by intrastate rates against interstate commerce, by raising intrastate rates so that the intrastate traffic may produce its fair share of the revenue required to meet maintenance and operating costs and to yield a fair return on the value of property devoted to the transportation service. The question for decision is whether the order of the Commission directing the removal of the discrimination is supported by the findings, based upon substantial evidence.\n The numerous objections to the order are grounded for the most part on an elaborate anal sis and discussion of the evidence. All have received our attention, but so far as they require our discussion they may be summarized as follows: (1) The order of the Commission is void because of its abuse of discretion in denying the motions for an order requiring that the original cost study be supplemented by a further and more detailed study which would reflect conditions in 1932 and in denying \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n the petition for reopening the proceedings or reargument for reconsideration of the effect to be given the cost study. (2) The order is not supported by the findings. (3) Certain essential findings are not supported by evidence. (4) The order is too indefinite to be applied.\n\n 1. \nThe alleged abuse of discretion by the Commission is not that it refused to consider the contention of appellants as to the sufficiency of the cost study in the light of the facts relied upon, see Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146, but that it decided these contentions wrongly. There can be no serious doubt that the cost study faithfully represented conditions obtaining during the periods in 1926-1927 selected for study. It was characterized by the Commission as 'perhaps more exhaustive' than any previously undertaken in proceedings involving switching charges. To the seven carriers of the thirty-five serving the District, originally chosen for study during selected periods, eight others were added on the initiative of the Commission. A request of certain of the appellants that the Chicago Junction Railway be included in the study was denied, the Commission pointing out in both reports that because of the short hauls on this line it did not regard the traffic as representative. Appellants urge specifically that if all the lines in the District were not to be included, this line should have been, in order to make the study fairly representative; but the Commission considered the issue of fact so raised and decided to the contrary.\n The principal contention is that conditions since 1927 have so changed that a new study should be made. The changes emphasized are (1) falling off in volume of traffic; (2) improvement of highways in the District resulting in diversion of traffic from the rail lines for movement by truck; (3) the decline in value of many of the articles transported; (4) reduction in wages and cost of supplies; and (5) curtailment of the amount of service rendered by \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n carriers to industries within the District. In considering these changes on the basis of the data already in the record, the Commission pointed out that they had resulted in increased unit costs because unaccompanied by a corresponding or proportionate decrease in operating expense. It also concluded, upon the basis of data before it, that in view of the improement of highways and trucking facilities and other changes in conditions affecting traffic the Commission could not, even though it were its duty to do so, provide a rate which would enable the railroads to compete successfully with trucking movements, by which the traffic had been diverted. The Commission decided that, on the record before it, it was able to consider the effect of the factors suggested by appellants and that a new cost study was unnecessary.\n Whether or not the cost study was representative, whether the study should have been more refined, and whether it should have been supplemented as appellants desired, are questions of fact, the determination of which is within the competence of the Commission. The Commission reached its conclusion after full hearing and thorough consideration of all questions presented. As the record affords a sufficient basis for the Commission's determination, it is not subject to review in the courts. See Manufacturers' Railway Company v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S.Ct. 383; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 580\n, 47 S.Ct. 727\n\n\n 2. The Commission's findings are to be read in the light of traffic cond tions, fully disclosed in the evidence and described in the Commission's report. The Chicago Switching District comprises an area of more than 600 square miles, served by 35 railroads, which maintain there more than 5,000 miles of track, serving 4,000 private industries. The District is essentially a unit, so far as switching movements are concerned. Interstate and intrastate traffic are commingled in switching movements and handled in the same manner indiscriminately, \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n often in the same trains and by the same crews. As already noted, the movements have no relation to main line hauls, are chiefly between local industries, involve a complete service originating and terminating within the District, a loaded and empty car movement, and two complete terminal services.\n In the original proceeding, no party took the position that a rate should apply on intrastate traffic within the District different from that applied to interstate traffic, the only substantial issue being whether the rates finally adopted and applied to interstate traffic were too high. In the second proceeding, after considering and stating at length the evidence showing the effect upon interstate commerce of the lower rates prevailing upon intrastate traffic of the same general character, and the probable effect in an increased return to the carriers if the intrastate rate were raised to the interstate level, the Commission found that the transportation conditions throughout the Chicago Switching District are substantially similar; that they are no more favorable to interstate movements than to intrastate movements within the District; that the established interstate scale of rates was reasonable and not shown, when applied to intrastate, to have or cause any undue preference and advantage to the persons or localities in intrastate commerce, or any undue preference and advantage to persons and localities in interstate commerce; that the lower intrastate rates had resulted and would for the future result in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. The report dealt at length with the evidence showing probable increase in revenue which would result if the intrastate rates were raised to the interstate level; comparisons based on the recorded traffic in 1926 and in November, 1931, and January, 1932, indicated a loss of revenue by the maintenance of the lower intrastate rate in excess of $1,000,000. These findings, which are supported by detailed subsidiary findings \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n in the report, are ample to support the order. State of Florida v. United States, supra. They disclose no such defects as were found in Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, or urged in United States v. Louisiana, supra.\n Specific objections to the sufficiency of the findings, so far as they are not already disposed of by what has been said, are that there is no finding that the intrastate rates, before the increase, were less than maximum reasonable rates, and there was no finding which separated interstate and intrastate property, revenues and expenses of the carriers so as to make it possible to compare revenues with cost for the two classes of traffic considered separately. But these objections, and others which we need not stop to consider in detail, leave out of account the nature of the traffic and the significance of the principal and subsidiary findings showing that the conditions throughout the District were substantially the same for both classes of traffic, which were handled in the same manner. The inquiry in both proceedings was directed to the commerce of the District as a unit. The decision in the first proceeding, that the increase in interstate rates was reasonable, was made in the hope that the state commissions would bring intrastate rates into harmony. When they failed to do so, the Commission reaffirmed its finding that the new interstate rates were reasonable and found that the intrastate rates must be raised in order that the intrastate traffic may bear its fair hare of the revenue burden. It is plain from the nature of the inquiry that the rate level, to which both classes of traffic were raised, was found reasonable on the basis of the traffic as a whole. Where the conditions under which interstate and intrastate traffic move are found to be substantially the same with respect to all factors bearing on the reasonableness of the rate, and the two classes are shown to be intimately bound together, there is no occasion to deal with the reasonableness of the intrastate \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 484]\n\u00a0\n rates more specifically, or to separate intrastate and interstate costs and revenues. Compare American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617\n, 37 S.Ct. 656; United States v. Louisiana, supra; State of Florida v. United States, supra.\n\n 3. \nAppellants contend there is no evidence in the record to support the Commission's findings that the pescribed interstate rate was reasonable or that after the increase in that rate the old intrastate rate unjustly discriminated against interstate commerce. Appellants reach their conclusion as to the reasonabless of the interstate rate by disregarding the cost study as evidence because, as is contended, it was erroneously considered by the Commission. But as we have already said it was for the Commission to determine whether the cost study was adequate or whether it was necessary to refine or supplement it in order to make it dependable evidence for the purpose of rate making. The study itself afforded evidence of the reasonableness of the rate fixed, and upon the whole record there was abundant support for the Commission's finding, which was carefully and thoroughly considered in its report. There is no basis upon which the courts, not authoized to weigh evidence, could reexamine or disregard its conclusion.\n The increased intrastate rate applied to grain, to which specific objection is made, does not stand on a different footing. This objections is also predicated upon the mistaken assumption that the Commission should have disregarded the cost study and traffic analysis as evidence. It is true that the rates on grain were not included in the all-commodity rate prevailing in the District before the first proceeding was initiated, and were not uniform throughout the District, but the proceeding was reopened by the Commission to investigate the lawfulness of 'all rates and charges ... of all carload traffic' interstate, and their relationship to like rates and charges intrastate. \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n It acted upon a record showing that the grain moved intra-District, under the same conditions as other commodities, and the Commission had before it evidence showing that the cost of the traffic largely exceeded the revenue derived from the old rates and that a rate on a distance or zoning basis was impracticable.\n Similarly, the finding of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce made in the second report rests upon evidence. The effect of maintaining a lower rate, intrastate, than the reasonable interstate rate is necessarily discriminatory wherever the two classes of traffic, inextricably intermingled, are carried on, as in the District, under substantially the same conditions. Compare United States v. Louisiana, supra. Moreover, it appeared that many of the railroads cannot move traffic between points of origin and destination in Indiana and between points of origin and destination in Illinois without crossing the state line, and thus subjecting the shippers to the interstate rate; that some of the industries are located on both sides of the state line and that some of the assembling yards and interchange tracks overlap state lines. On the other hand, many industries, in preference to a more direct interstate route, resort to intrastate routes to obtain lower rates, although they are so-called 'unnatural' routes, against the flow of traffic, and therefore entail additional expense in handling. Evidence to show the extent of the burden upon the carriers' revenues, and the diversion of traffic from interst te to 'unnatural' intrastate movements, is found both in the testimony of the carrier witnesses and in exhibits of record.\n Appellants recur to their criticism of the cost study and insist that in view of differences between average lengths of haul in intrastate and in interstate movements, costs and revenues intrastate and interstate should have been segregated. But this objection is directed not only to the conclusion of the Commission, already con- \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n sidered, that the cost study was representative and dependable evidence, but is based upon the assumption that the Commission should disregard the long history of rates in the Switching District, in the course of which a commodity rate, generally applicable without regard to distance, had been built up through the District, and that upon a review of the evidence we are free to reject the Commission's conclusion that a distance or zone rate should not apply. Upon this subject there was substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of uniform commodity rates in preference to a distance or zone rate. So far as this objection is of any force it goes only to the weight of the evidence and not to the want of it. Treating an area as a unit and applying a uniform blanket or group rate within it, as is the common practice with respect to switching rates, is within the competence of the Commission. See St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 138, Note 1, 141, 38 S.Ct. 49; United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n263 U.S. 515\n, 518, Note 1, 44 S.Ct. 189; Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 660\n, 664 S., 47 S.Ct. 222.\n\n 4. \nAppellants contend that the order cannot be applied to certain carriers whose rails extend only into the Illinois section of the District. As in terms it directs that intrastate rates be established on the level of the interstate switching rates maintained by the carriers who are parties to the proceeding, it is said to be inapplicable to those carriers which because they do not cross state lines in their switching operations have filed no interstate switching rates. But we think the order is not to be read so narrowly. It is made applicable to all the carriers in the District and directs that the intrastate switching rates shall be maintained on a parity with the interstate rates 'contemporaneously applied by the said carriers.' On its face it would seem that the quoted phrase was intended only to describe the intrastate rates \n\n[292 U.S. 474, 487]\n\u00a0\n maintained by such of the carriers as had occasion to establish interstate switching rates. But if this were doubtful the order is to be read with the report. Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, supra, 771 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 619; American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, supra, p. 627, of 244 U.S., 37 S.T. 656. So read there can be no doubt that it was intended to prescribe for all intrastate traffic within the District the same rate as that prescribed for all interstate traffic there, and that interstate carriers whose rails are confined to either state and which for that reason have filed no interstate switching rates are nevertheless required to adopt the prescribed intrastate rate.\n Appellants also urge that interstate carriers whose rails reach only the Illinois part of the District cannot be required to remove a discrimination against interstate commerce unless they participate in both the prejudicial and preferential rates, as was said in Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 627\n, 53 S.Ct. 768, with respect to discriminations between localities forbidden by section 3 of the act (49 USCA  3). But this restriction has no relevance to proceedings under section 13(4) directed to the removal of discriminatory intrastate rates maintained by state authority. By that section the Interstate Commerce Commission is expressly authorized to prescribe the intrastate rates which will remove the discrimination.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No opinion filed in court below. \n\n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINDIANA FARMER'S GUIDE PUB.

The respondents answered separately by general denial. At the close of all the evidence they submitted a written motion that the court direct a verdict in their favor. The court granted the motion and entered judgment. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 70 F.(2d) 3.\n Section 1 of the Sherman Act denounces 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.' 15 U.S.C.  1 (15 USCA  1). Section 2 declares: 'Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States ... shall be deemed \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n guilty of a misdemeanor.' 15 U.S.C.  2 (15 USCA  2). Section 7 provides: 'Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor ... and shall recover three fold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.' 26 Stat. 210 (15 USCA  15 note).\n For a number of years, 1928 to 1932 inclusive, next prior to the commencement of this action, the petitioner and each respondent other than the Midwest Farm Paper Unit, Inc., was a publisher of one or more farm papers. Each is a general, and not a vocational, paper; the larger part of its circulation is in the State where printed; it does not circulate in any substantial number throughout the country as a whole and is called a state or sectional paper in order to distinguish it from publications having a wider and what is referred to as a national circulation. Petitioner publishes weekly 'The Indiana Farmer's Guide' at Huntington, Ind. Its circulation is about 160,000, of which over two-thirds is in Indiana and approximately 50,000 in other States. The respondent Prairie Company publishes in Illinois 'The Prairie Farmer' and the 'Indiana Edition' of the same, which has a large circulation in Indiana. The Wallace Company publishes in Iowa 'Wallace's Farmer and Iowa Homestead.' The Wisconsin Company publishes in Wisconsin the 'Wisconsin Agriculturist and Farmer.' The McKelvie Company publishes in Nebraska 'The Nebraska Farmer.' The Webb Company publishes in Minnesota 'The Farmer and Farm, Stock and Home' and the 'Dakota Edition' of the same. Advertising matter carried by each of these publishers includes classified and display or commercial advertisements. The latter only is involved in this case. Each is largely dependent for financial success upon revenue derived from \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n these advertisements. Most of the advertisers are located in States other than those in which the papers are published. About ninety per cent. of petitioner's advertisements comes from points outside Indiana and is obtained by correspondence, traveling solicitors, and representatives located in different parts of the country. Advertisers, in order to enable petitioner to print their advertisements as desired, send to it from outside Indiana electrotypes which, after being used, are returned to the advertiser or held subject to his order.\n The Midwest Unit is an agency incorporated in 1931 and the successor of an organization formed in 1928. Its officers and directors are representatives of the other respondents which make use of that agency, as similarly use was made of its predecessor, to procure at combination rates identical advertisements to be published in their seven farm papers. The gist of the complaint is that respondents entered into a contract, combination, and conspiracy for the purpose of obtaining a monopoly of the farm paper business including the publication, circulation, and distribution of advertisements of peculiar interest to farmers 'within the territory covered' by their publications; that in furtherance of this contract, combination and conspiracy they conceived a plan and design calculated to break down and destroy 'competition with other farm publications within said territory'; and that in order to effectuate that purpose they agreed upon a combination schedule of advertising rates for all their publications materially below the total of the separate rates of each.\n There was evidence tending to show: That the combination rate for advertisements in respondents' seven papers was much less than the total of the separate charges for the same advertisements in any six; that respondents acting separately and in concert sought and obtained ad- \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n vertisements for all seven papers at rates much less than the charges would have been for identical advertisements, if omitting the 'Indiana Edition' of 'The Prairie Farmer,' they were published in the other six and in petitioner's 'Indiana Farmer's Guide.' Thus, at least according to petitioner's contention, it appears that by means of the combination rate, respondents, acting together pursuant to agreement to that end, gave a substantial financial advantage to advertisers choosing the 'Indiana Edition' instead of the 'Farmer's Guide.'\n Petitioner contends that the ground upon which the district court directed the verdict was that its activities were not shown by the evidence to constitute interstate commerce. The record is ambiguous. Respondents' motion did not specify any grounds upon which they claimed to be entitled to the peremptory instruction. There is nothing to indicate the arguments submitted or authorities cited by either party. The court orally instructed the jury: 'There has been, in my opinion, a failure on the part of the plaintiff in this case to show that there has been any restraint of trade as between the different states .... That being true, this court would not have jurisdiction to entertain the case, at all, and your finding, under that state of facts, should be for the defendants.'\n Respondents take no issue with the petitioner's assertion of fact. But, impliedly assuming its correctness, they argue that, while petitioner and respondents are engaged in interstate commerce in the circulation of their papers, the subject-matter of the suit is not that business but the making of contracts by respondents for the insertion of advertising matter in their papers and that therefore the case is ruled by Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., \n252 \nU.S. 436, 438\n, 40 S.Ct. 385. And they say the trial court did not err in holding that 'there can be no restraint \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n or monopoly of interstate commerce when the subject matter of the complaint does not relate to interstate commerce at all.' Thus, by a construction of the complaint that is utterly untenable, they support the very basis upon which petitioner maintains the district court rested its decision. Inferentially their contentions go far to show-and in the light of all the circumstances we find-that the trial court's direction of verdict and its judgment rests solely upon the ground that petitioner failed to introduce evidence that its business or that of respondents included interstate commerce.\n Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., supra, gives no support to that ruling. There, an advertising agency sued a publishing company under section 7 of the Sherman Act for damages alleged to have been caused to the agency by the publisher's violation of section 2. Defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint did not allege a cause of action within the provisions of the act. The district court granted the motion and entered judgment dismissing the suit for want of jurisdiction over the defendant or the action, and included in the record a certificate in accordance with section 238 of the Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1157, that the question involved was whether the facts alleged constituted a cause of action under the act.\n We said (page 442 of 252 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 385, 387): 'In the present case ... the subject-matter dealt with was the making of contracts for the insertion of advertising matter in certain periodicals belonging to the defendant. It may be conceded that the circulation and distribution of such publications throughout the country would amount to interstate commerce, but the circulation of these periodicals did not depend upon or have any direct relation to the advertising contracts which the plaintiff offered and the defendant refused to receive except upon the term stated in the \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n declaration. The advertising contracts did not involve any movement of goods or merchandise in interstate commerce, or any transmission of intelligence in such commerce. This case is wholly unlike International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91\n, 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.( N.S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103, wherein there was a continuous interstate traffic in text-books and apparatus for a course of study pursued by means of correspondence, and the movements in interstate commerce were held to bring the subject-matter within the domain of federal control, and to exempt it from the burden imposed by state legislation.' And after reviewing earlier decisions the opinion continued (page 444 of 252 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 385, 388): 'Applying the principles of these cases, it is abundantly established that there is no ground for claiming that the transactions which are the basis of the present suit, concerning advertising in journals to be subsequently distributed in interstate commerce, are contracts which directly affect such commerce.'\n The business that is here alleged to have been damaged is the publication and circulation of these farm papers. That business includes the obtaining of advertising, the transportation between States of electrotypes sent respectively to petitioner and respondents by their customers to be used in setting up advertisements, and the transportation of substantial quantities of the papers in interstate commerce. Advertising at compensatory rates is an essential element. The opinion in Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., supra, assumed that a publishing business such as that now under consideration would amount to interstate commerce. There is no ground for the contention that the evidence in this case is not sufficient to go to the jury on the question of interstate commerce. International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, supra, pages 106, 107 of 217 U.S., 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.(N. S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103; Pensacola Tel. Co. v. West., etc., Tel. Co., \n96 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S.; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v.

Deer Lodge County, \n231 U.S. 495\n, 510, et seq., 34 S. Ct. 167.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider the ground upon which the district court put the judgment. It impliedly assumed that petitioner's business does include interstate commerce. It accepted the assertion that, due to the combination rate of respondents, petitioner lost commercial advertisers. In decision of the case, the court said (page 5 of 70 F.(2d): 'We are, however, not satisfied that appellant has established a fact which rested upon it to prove; viz., that through this combination there was effected such a restraint of interstate commerce as would materially affect the entire farm journal advertising business. Such is the requirement laid down in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163\n, 51 S.Ct. 421. The facts in that case indicated a much greater control of the gasoline production industry than is present in the case before us. ... Likewise, it seems the facts in Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S.Ct. 471, presented a case of much stronger domination by the combinations that had formed than the one before us. ... We cannot escape the force of appellees' statement-'... If, as held in Standard Oil Co. v. United States ... the owners of 55 per cent of the gasoline in the United States could not by combination obtain a monopoly in violation of the Sherman Act, and if, as held in Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States , ... the owners of 74 per cent of the coal mined in a certain territory could not obtain a monopoly in violation of the Sherman Act, then how can it be held that 5 out of approximately 300 newspapers can obtain a monopoly of advertising, and how can it be held that newspapers which do only approximately 15 per cent of the advertising in the farm journal field can obtain a monopoly?' In the face of these two decisions we agree with Judge Baltzell that a proper case for the application of sections \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 278]\n\u00a0\n 1, 2, and 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was not established.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals makes the relation between the amount of farm journal advertising controlled by respondents to the total in the entire country a basis of its judgment affirming that of the district court. But the complaint charges restraint and attempt to monopolize only in the territory served by respondents' publications, being five-or seven if the Indiana and Dakota editions are separately counted-out of a total of 23 papers in that territory. \n1\n Petitioner claims that during the five- year period respondents' advertisements ranged from 44.37 per cent. to 66. 92 per cent. of the total in the territory properly to be taken into account. \n2\n The record \n[]\n Illinois 36 5 31 Indiana 10 4 6 Iowa 10 5 5 Minnesota 8 2 6 Nebraska 3 1 3 North Dakota 1 0 1 South Dakota 1 1 0 Wisconsin 8 5 3\n[]\n Total 77 23 54\n[]\n Total Per Cent Total Lineage of Respondents' Lineage Carried by Lineage Carried by all Respondents' to Papers Papers Total 1928 7,490,806 3,323,256 44.37 1929 6,844,629 3,235,364 47.26 1930 5,172,535 2,980,963 57.63 1931 3,562,695 2,207,650 61.97 1932 2,151,376 1,439,753 66.92\n[] \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 279]\n\u00a0\n contains no suggestion by respondents or by either court that petitioner's allegations are not sufficient to charge a violation of sections 1 and 2. Its right to recover does not depend upon the proportion that respondents control of the total farm paper advertisements in the entire country, and it was not required to prove that respondents imposed a restraint or attempted monopolization that would affect all commercial advertisements in all farm papers wherever published or circulated. The provisions of sections 1 and 2 have both a geographical and distributive significance and apply to any part of the United States as distinguished from the whole and to any part of the classes of things forming a part of interstate commerce. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 61\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734.\n Our decision in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163\n, 51 S. Ct. 421, has little if any bearing upon the question whether the facts alleged in the complaint and supported by the evidence in this case reasonably may be held to constitute a violation of section 1 or section 2 (15 USCA  1, 2). That was a suit for injunction, section 4 (15 USCA  4), to prevent an alleged combination from creating a monopoly or restraining interstate commerce by control of the part of gasoline produced by cracking. The district court granted some of the relief sought. The case came here on defendants' appeal. Slight notice of the principal features of the case is sufficient to distinguish it from the one now before us. Three producers, owning patents for cracking by which the yield of gasoline is greatly increased, joined with the owner of similar patents in agreements for the exchange of patent rights and division of royalties which were challenged by the government as a violation of the act, chiefly upon the ground that they enabled the parties to the agreement to maintain existing royalties. Cracked gasoline is not distinguishable from the straight run. They are mixed or sold interchangeably. The output of cracked gasoline was about 26 per cent. of the total. The record did not show \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 280]\n\u00a0\n the production of cracked by licensees. It was not shown that by agreeing on royalties defendants could control price or supply. We held that the United States was not entitled to any relief and reversed the decree of the district court.\n Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S.Ct. 471, was brought here on appeal from a decree of the district court granting an injunction against a combination of producers of bituminous coal in a suit by the United States under the Sherman Act. It may be taken for present purposes that the defendants' production was 74.4 per cent. of the total in the territory in which they operated. But this was only about 12 per cent. of the production east of the Mississippi. It was shown that relatively little bituminous coal is consumed in the district in which the defendants operate mines. They marketed most of their coal in highly competitive territory. We held, in view of the condition disclosed by the record, that there was no basis for concluding that competition anywhere would be injuriously affected by the cooperative plan adopted by the combination, and reversed the decree.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (70 F.(2d) 3, 5) while recognizing that 'there are essential fact differences which make comparisons of different industries of little value,' rested its judgment upon respondents' arguments based upon these cases. But the abridged statements of issues there involved and decided are sufficient to show that respondents' contention reflected inadequate ascertainment and appreciation of the facts and considerations there held controlling and that these decisions turned upon the government's failure to prove restraint of competition and that they are not in point here. It results therefore that the ground on which the Circuit Court of Appeals rested its judgment cannot be sustained. \n\n[293 U.S. 268, 281]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner sought this writ upon the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals held it bound to prove that respondents effected such a restraint of interstate commerce as would materially affect the farm journal advertising business in the entire country and misapplied our decisions in the Standard Oil Company Case and the Appalachian Coals Case. Respondents had opportunity here to show that, although given on untenable grounds, the judgment below is right and should be affirmed. And, if by the record they could so demonstrate, this court, if satisfied beyond doubt that it could do so without prejudice to petitioner, properly might refrain from reversal. Deery v. Cray, 5 Wall. 795, 807; Vicksburg & Meridian Railr'd v. O'Brien, \n119 \nU.S. 99, 103\n, 7 S.Ct. 172; Peck v. Heurich, \n167 \nU.S. 624, 629\n, 17 S.Ct. 927. But respondents suggest nothing to justify the direction of verdict and judgment in their favor. Certainly, in the absence of a claim on their part that, conceding the errors exposed by this opinion, the judgment is right, we will not examine the record to discover grounds to sustain it. Cf. Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., R'y v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 179\n, 20 S.Ct. 336; Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 U.S. 164\n, 170 et seq., 48 S.Ct. 66. We intimate no opinion whether, upon the question of restraint or monopoly or upon the question of injury to petitioner or its business, the evidence is sufficient to warrant a verdict in its favor.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case remanded to the district court with directions that petitioner be granted a new trial.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n293 \nU.S. 633\n, 55 S.Ct. 345, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition contains the following computation to show the number and type of farm papers published in the eight states in which petitioner's and respondents' papers principally circulate:\n Total Vocational Number or of Papers General Technical\n\n\n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL MILL. CO. v. COLUMBIA TRANSP. CO.(1934)\nNo. 561\nArgued: February 16, 1934Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James G. Nye, Oscar Mitchell, and Albert C. Gilletee, all of Duluth, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edgar W. MacPherran, of Duluth, Minn., for respondent.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, plaintiff in the court below, is a Delaware corporation, a dealer in grain, with its principal office and place of business in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Respondent, defendant below, is also a Delaware corporation, a carrier by water, with its principal office in Cleveland, Ohio. We are to determine whether in the circumstances exhibited in the record a suit between the parties in the courts of Minnesota is an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce.\n On January 1, 1930, petitioner loaded a cargo of grain on one of the vessels of respondent's predecessor for transportation and storage. This vessel was the W. C. Richardson, and the termini of the voyage were Chicago and Buffalo. At one of those points or somewhere between them the grain was negligently handled while in the carrier's possession with ensuing damage discovered about the end of 1930. The defendant in this suit is a successor corporation, which took over the business in December, 1931, and assumed its liabilities.\n The new corporation, like predecessor, is a carrier of merchandise in interstate and foreign commerce, picking up cargoes where it can get them, but principally along the Great Lakes and in tributary waters. It has a fleet of ten steamers which it uses for that purpose as occasion requires. Owing to slack business, the only vessel in commission during the first half of 1932 was \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n the C. Russell Hubbard, which operated principally between ports on Lakes Superior and Michigan. On July 1, 1932, this vessel arrived at Duluth, Minnesota, carrying a cargo of coal from Sandusky, Ohio. While unloading in neighboring waters she was seized by the sheriff under a writ of attachment sued out by the petitioner in a District Court of the state. The summons and the attachment writ were served on the master of the vessel, who made report of the proceeding to the respondent's agents at Duluth. These agents, a firm of vessel brokers, were employed by the respondent as its Duluth representatives to act for it as might be necessary when its boats were at the dock. They saw to it that the cargoes were loaded and unloaded, reported to their principal the coming and going of the vessels, and issued bills of lading. Notice of an expected cargo came to them by telegraph, for there was no regular schedule to put them on the watch. Payment was by the job, $10 for each cargo. Like services had been rendered by the same agents since 1928, and, it may be, even earlier. Just how often they had acted, the record does not tell us, though presumably the facts were within the knowledge of the principal. If there may be inferences from silence, we draw them against the party who bears the burden of persuasion.\n Promptly upon the seizure of the vessel, the respondent filed an undertaking in th sum of $40,000, whereupon the levy was released. Then, appearing specially, it moved to vacate the attachment and the summons upon the ground that the prosecution of the action in the state of Minnesota would impose a serious and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce, in contravention of article 1,  8, of the Constitution of the United States. The district court granted the motion. The Supreme Court of Minnesota affirmed, three judges dissenting. 189 Minn. 507, 250 N.W. 186. Later there was a final judgment in the district court and again an affirmance \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n on appeal. 189 Minn. 516, 250 N.W. 190. A writ of certiorari has brought the case here. \n290 \nU.S. 622\n, 54 S.Ct. 228, 78 L.Ed. --.\n Our point of departure is the decision of this court in Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co. (1923) \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S.Ct. 556. There a Kansas corporation brought suit in Minnesota against the Director General of Railroads, representing the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, also a Kansas corporation. The plaintiff was not a resident of Minnesota, nor engaged in business there. The railway company was not a resident of Minnesota, and did no business there, except to solicit traffic. The cause of action had no relation to any local activity. Service of process was made in reliance upon a Minnesota statute (Laws 1913, c. 218, p. 274) whereby every foreign interstate carrier was compelled 'to submit to suit there as a condition of maintaining a soliciting agent within the state.' 262 U.S. at pages 313, 315, 43 S.Ct. 556, 557. Upon those facts the ruling of this court was that the effect of the statute, when applied to a carrier so situated, was an unreasonable obstruction of interstate commerce. The decision was confined narrowly within the bounds of its own facts. 'It may be,' the court said ( 262 U.S. at page 316, 43 S.Ct. 556, 558), 'that a statute like that here assailed would be valid, although applied to suits in which the cause of action arose elsewhere, if the transaction out of which it arose had been entered upon within the state, or if the plaintiff was, when it arose, a resident of the state.' The facts in the Davis Case were substantially identical with those in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469, decided a year later. Then, in 1929, Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mix, \n278 \nU.S. 492\n, 49 S.Ct. 207, enforced the same conclusion where the plaintiff, a resident of Michigan at the time of an accident, sued a Michigan railway company in Missouri upon a Michigan cause of action, though the defendant's only activity in Missouri was the maintenance of an agency for the solicitation of business. The suit \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 518]\n\u00a0\n was not saved because the plaintiff had moved into Missouri 'after the injury complained of, but before instituting the action.' 'For aught that appears, her removal to St. Louis shortly after the accident was solely for the purpose of bringing the suit, and because she was advised that her chances of recovery would be better there than they would be in Michigan.' 278 U.S. at page 495, 49 S.Ct. 207, 209. There was no proof of such a relation between the residence or activities of the suitor and the forum chosen for the suit as to make the choice a natural or suitable one, and rid the burden on the carrier of at least a measure of its hardship.\n To be contrasted with these cases where jurisdiction was denied because of the necessities of commerce is another series of cases where differentiating circumstances led to a different result. Thus, in State of Missouri ex rel. St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico R. Co. v. Taylor (1924) \n266 \nU.S. 200\n, 45 S.Ct. 47, 42 A.L.R. 1232, a Delaware corporation with a usual place of business in Missouri brought suit in a Missouri court against the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway Company, a Texas corporation, operating a railroad in Texas and nowhere else, jurisdiction being asserted sole y by reason of the garnishment of traffic balances due from a connecting carrier. The cause of action was for damages to freight originating in Texas on lines of the Brownsville Company and shipped on through bills of lading to points in Missouri as well as other states. This court rejected the carrier's contention that Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., supra, and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Wells, supra, supplied the applicable rule. The opinion pointed out (1) that for anything made to appear the negligence of the connecting carrier may have occurred in Missouri where the goods were to be delivered, and (2) that 'the plaintiff consignee is a resident of Missouri-that is, has a usual place of business within the state.' \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 519]\n\u00a0\n 'To require that, under such circumstances, the foreign carrier shall submit to suit within a state to whose jurisdiction it would otherwise be amenable by process of attachment does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.' 266 U.S. at page 207, 45 S.Ct. 47, 48, 42 A.L.R. 1232. In line with that decision is Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte (1931) \n284 \nU.S. 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 152, where the plaintiff, a resident of Missouri, had brought suit in a Missouri court upon a cause of action for personal injuries suffered in Colorado. There were two defendants, the Rio Grande Railway Company and the Santa Fe. The first, a Delaware corporation, did not operate a railroad in Missouri, but had a traffic agency only. As to it the suit was dismissed upon the authority of the Davis Case. The other defendant had part of its line in Missouri, though the accident occurred elsewhere. Cf. Hoffman v. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S.Ct. 485. As to the defendant so situated, jurisdiction was upheld. The groups are clearly marked, and also the reasons for the grouping.\n The question now is whether the defendant with its steamship business shall be placed in the one group or the other. At the outset, we mark the fact that the petitioner, though a Delaware corporation, is suing in the state of its business activities. For many purposes, its domicile in law is in the state of its creation (Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 444\n, 12 S.Ct. 935; Seaboard Rice Milling Co. v. Chicago, R.I. & P. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 363\n, 46 S.Ct. 247), but it is living its life elsewhere. In a very real and practical sense, it is a resident of the forum, like the plaintiff in the Taylor Case, \n266 \nU.S. 200, 207\n, 45 S. Ct. 47, 42 A.L.R. 1232, who was domiciled in one state and resided in another. Certainly its relation to the locality was so permanent and intimate as to relieve it of the opprobrium of an impertinent intruder when it went into the local courts. In saying this we do not hold that the residence of the suitor will fix the proper forum without reference to other considerations, such as the nature \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 520]\n\u00a0\n of the business of the corporation to be sued. Denver, Rio Grande & Western R. Co. v. Terte, supra, is opposed to such a holding. Residence, however, even though not controlling, is a fact of high significance. Our next inquiry must be whether there is anything in the nature of the activities of the defendant to overcome its force.\n The defendant, though an interstate carrier, does not do business like a railroad company along a changeless route. It is engaged in transportation in Minnesota as much as it is engaged in transportation anywhere, if we exclude the activities of management that have their centre in Ohio. Its vessels navigate the waters of Lake Superior, not merely occasionally, but by long continued practice, and Minnesota and Wisconsin maintain over the boundary waters of that lake a concurrent jurisdiction. Constitution of Minnesota, art. 2,  2; Constitution of Wisconsin, art. 9,  1. At Duluth a designated agent does whatever is necessary to facilitate the work of loading and unloading cargoes, and in the waters near at hand there was a levy of an attachment up n property brought into the state in the usual course of business. When subjected to this levy, the carrier was not engaged in some incidental or collateral activity, such as the solicitation of freight to be carried at other times and places. It was engaged, when thus subjected, in the very act of transportation, the dominant end and aim of its corporate existence.\n Viewing all these circumstances together, we find ourselves unable to conclude that by the prosecution of this suit there has been laid upon the carrier a burden so heavy and so unnecessary as to be oppressive and unreasonable. Rather we find a situation where the defendant, chargeable with knowledge of the attachment laws of Minnesota, brought its property into that state, not fortuitously or by a rare accident, but in furtherance of a \n\n[292 U.S. 511, 521]\n\u00a0\n systematic course of business, and thereby subjected itself to suit, quasi in rem, at the instance of a local creditor, who could not with equal convenience or facility have sued it anywhere else. Such a suit may be a burden, but oppressive and unreasonable it is not. There is no occasion to determine whether the conclusion would be the same if an attachment had been levied upon property brought within the state through the voluntary act of the defendant, but in an isolated instance, dissevered from a course of dealing. In the circumstances of this case, Missouri ex rel. St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico R. Co. v. Taylor, supra, and Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, supra, to the extent that the latter case involved a suit against the Santa Fe, supply, when read together, the applicable rule, and sustain the jurisdiction of the Minnesota courts.\n The forum being in other respects appropriate, jurisdiction is not lost because the property subjected to the attachment is an instrumentality of commerce (Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Wells, supra, page 103, of \n265 U.S. 44\n S.Ct. 469; Davis v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L.R. Co., \n217 \nU.S. 157\n, 30 S.Ct. 463, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 823, 18 Ann.Cas. 907), nor because the chief witnesses on the trial reside in other states, most of them, it seems, in Chicago, Illinois. 'As a practical matter, courts could not undertake to ascertain in advance of trial the number and importance of probable witnesses within and without the state and retain or refuse jurisdiction according to the relative inconvenience of the parties.' Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, supra, page 287 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 152, 153; Hoffman v. Foraker, supra, page 22 of 274 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 485.\n The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Minnesota for further proceeding not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIRVING TRUST CO. v.

Perry, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent was lessor in a lease having a number of years to run at the date of the tenant's bankruptcy. The writing stipulated:\n'... For the more effectual securing to the Lessor of the rent and other payments herein provided, it is agreed \n\n[293 U.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n as a further condition of this lease that the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or insolvency by or against the Lessee shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this lease, and thereupon, ipso facto and without entry or other action by the Lessor, this lease shall become and be terminated; and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this lease, the Lessor shall forthwith upon such termination be entitled to recover damages for such breach in an amount equal to the amount of the rent reserved in this lease for the residue of the term hereof less the fair rental value of the premises for the residue of said term.'\n\n Respondent filed a proof of claim, based upon this clause, which the referee expunged. The District Court affirmed the order. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the decree of the District Court, directed that the claim should be allowed. \n1\n The case is here upon writ of certiorari.\n Decision is to be made under sections 1(11) and 63(a) and (b) of the Act of July 1, 1898, as they stood prior to the filing of the petition on September 30, 1932, and the presentation of respondent's proof of claim on March 29, 1933.2 The subsequent amendments of June 7 and 18, 1934,3 are by their terms inapplicable.\n In Manhattan Properties, Inc., v. Irving Trust Company, \n291 \nU.S. 320\n, 54 S.Ct. 385, we reserved the question of the provability of a claim for liquidated damages arising upon such a covenant. The petitioner's contention is that, inasmuch as claims for future rent, or for damages for the breach of the covenant to pay rent, or claims upon contracts of indemnity conditioned upon reentry by the landlord subsequent to bankruptcy, were there held not provable, it logically follows that a claim for stipulated damages for \n\n[293 U.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n breach of the lease may not be proved. We hold otherwise.\n By the terms of the contract, the filing of the petition in bankruptcy was, of itself, and irrespective of the election of lessor or lessee, a breach of the lease. The claim of the landlord, consequent upon the breach, arose and matured at the moment of the filing of the petition. The claim is not for rent reserved or upon the lease as such, but is founded upon an independent express contract, and hence within the very words of section 63(a)(4) of the act, 11 USCA  103(a)(4).\n The Circuit Court construed the stipulation as an agreement on the part of the tenant to pay as liquidated damages, in the event of the specified breach, an amount equal to the difference between the present fair value of the remaining rent due under the lease and the present fair rental value of the premises for the balance of the term. The covenant is fairly susceptible of this construction. So read, the court held the clause provided a reasonable formula for ascertaining the damages of the landlord, did not smack of a penalty, and was therefore enforceable. See Wm. Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597\n, 38 S.Ct. 211. We concur in the view that the contract, as its terms were interpreted and applied, supports a provable claim for the stipulated damages.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In re Outfitters' Operating Realty Co., 69 F.(2d) 90. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S.C., tit. 11,  1 and 103, 11 USCA  1(11), 103(a, b). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Public No. 296 and Public No. 387, 73d Congress (11 USCA  103(a). \n\n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAING v.

Petioner sought recov- \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 495]\n\u00a0\n ery of amounts stipulated, in one policy, to be paid if death should result 'directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means, and not directly or indirectly, wholly or partly from disease or physical or mental infirmity,' and, in the other policy, if death should result 'from bodily injuries effected directly and independently of all other causes through external, violent and accidental means.'\n Both declarations, in each of four counts, alleged that the deceased in the month of August, while in good health and while playing golf in his accustomed manner at a place where many others were playing without injury, was suddenly and unexpectedly overcome from the force of the sun's rays upon his head and body and that shortly afterward he died; that an autopsy revealed that there was no bodily infirmity or disease which could have been a contributing cause of his death. In one count of each declaration it was alleged that, at the time the insured received the injury resulting in his death, there was, unknown to him, a temporary disorder or condition of his body, not amounting to a physical or mental infirmity within the meaning of the policies, which, for the time being, rendered him more than ordinarily sensitive to the heat of the sun, and that this temporary and unknown condition 'intervened between his intentional act of playing golf, which he intended and expected to perform safely and which others did perform safely at the same time and place, and the injury which followed.'\n Petitioner argues that the death, resulting from voluntary exposure to the sun's rays under normal conditions, was accidental in the common or popular sense of the term, and should therefore be held to be within the liability clauses of the policies. But it is not enough, to establish liability under these clauses, that the death or injury \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 496]\n\u00a0\n was accidental in the understanding of the average man-that the result of the exposure 'was something unforeseen, unexpected, extraordinary, an unlooked-for mishap, and so an accident,' see Lewis v. Ocean Accident & Guarantee Corp., 224 N.Y. 18, 21, 120 N.E. 56, 57, 7 A.L.R. 1129; see, also, AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Portland Gas & Coke Co. (C.C.A.) 229 F. 552, L.R.A. 1916D, 1027, for here the carefully chosen words defining liability distinguish between the result and the external means which produces it. The insurance is not against an accidental result. The stipulated payments are to be made only if the bodily injury, though unforeseen, is effected by means which are external and accidental. The external means is stated to be the rays of the sun, to which the insured voluntarily exposed himself. Petitioner's pleadings do not suggest that there was anything in the sun's rays, the weather, or other circumstances external to the insured's own body and operating to produce the unanticipated injury, which was unknown or unforeseen by the insured.\n We do not intimate that injuries resulting from as impalpable a cause as the inadvertent introduction into the body of noxious germs may not be deemed to be effected by external accidental means. See Western Commercial Travelers' Ass'n v. Smith (C.C.A.) 85 F. 401, 40 L.R.A. 653; Jensma v. Sun Life Assur. Co. (C.C.A.) 64 F.(2d) 457. Nor do we say that in other circumstances an unforeseen and hence accidental result may not give rise to the inference that the external means was also accidental. Compare Jensma v. Sun Life Assur. Co., supra; Gustafson v. New York Life Insurance Co. (D.C.) 55 F.(2d) 235. But, in the light of such knowledge as we have, no such inference can arise from the bare allegation of death by sunstroke, compare Pope v. Prudential Insurance Co. (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 185; Ryan v. Continental Casualty Co. (C.C.A.) 47 F.(2d) 472, with no indication that some unforeseen or unintended condition or combination of circumstances, external to the state of the victim's body, contributed to the \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 497]\n\u00a0\n accidental result. The petitioner has thus failed to plead facts establishing the liability defined by the policy.\n In United States Mutual Accident Association v. Barry, \n131 \nU.S. 100\n, 9 S.Ct. 755, 759, the insured suffered an internal injury caused by his jumping voluntarily from a platform to the ground, a distance of four or five feet. Recovery was allowed of amounts stipulated by the policy to be paid upon proof of bodily injury 'effected through external, violent, and accidental means.' There was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the insured alighted in a manner not intended, causing a jar or shock of unexpected severity. This Court held that the trial judge correctly left to the jury the question whether the insured jumped or alighted in the manner he intended, and properly charged that, if he did not, it might find that the injury was caused by accidental means, pages 109, 110, 121 of 131 U.S., 9 S.Ct. 755, 759.\n This distinction between accidental external means and accidental result has been generally recognized and applied where the stipulated liability is for injury resulting from an accidental external means. See AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Brand (C.C.A.) 265 F. 6, 13 A.L.R. 657; Lincoln National Ins. Co. v. Erickson (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 997; Jensma v. Sun Life Assur.

And injury from sunstroke, when resulting from voluntary exposure by an insured to the sun's rays, even though an accident, see Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson (1908) A.C. 437, has been generally held not to have been caused by external accidental means. Nickman v. New York Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 39 F.(2d) 763; Paist v. AEtna Life Insurance Co.

Law, 426, 168 A. 592.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n I am unable to concur in the decision of the Court.\n\n 1. \nA cause does not cease to be violent and external because the insured has an idiosyncratic condition of mind or body predisposing him to injury. Silverstein v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 254 N.Y. 81, 171 N. E. 914; Leland v. Order of U.C. Travelers, 233 Mass. 558, 564, 124 N.E. 517; Collins v. Casualty Co., 224 Mass. 327, 112 N.E. 634, L.R.A. 1916E, 1203; Taylor v. N.Y. Life Insurance Co., 176 Minn. 171, 222 N.W. 912, 60 A. L.R. 959. Under a policy phrased as this one, the insurer may be relieved of liability if the predisposing condition is so acute as to constitute a disease. See cases supra. Here the complaint alleges that the idiosyncrasy was not a physical or mental disease, and that it appeared from an autopsy that there was no bodily infirmity or disease which could have been a contributing cause of death. Since the case is here on demurrer, those allegations must be accepted as true. The plaintiff may be unable to prove them at the trial. She should have the opportunity. There has been no failure to 'plead facts establishing the liability defined by the policy.'\n\n 2. \nSunstroke, though it may be a disease according to the classification of physicians, is none the less an accident in the common speech of men. Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, (1908) A.C. 437, 439. Lane v. Horn & H. Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329, 104 A. 615, 13 A.L.R. 963. The suddenness of its approach and its catastrophic nature (Matter of Connelly v. Hunt Furniture Co., 240 N.Y. 83, 87, 147 N.E. 366, 39 A.L.R. 867) have made that quality stand out when thought is uninstructed in the mysteries of science. Lower v. Metropolitan Life \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 499]\n\u00a0\n Insurance Co. (1933) 111 N.J. Law, 426, 168 A. 592, 593, collating the decisions. Violent it is for the same reason, and external because the train of consequences is set in motion by the rays of the sun beating down upon the body, a cause operating from without.\n'In my view this man died from an accident. What killed him was a heat-stroke coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon him while at work. Such a stroke is an unusual effect of a known cause, often, no doubt, threatened, but generally averted by precautions which experience, in this instance, had not taught. It was an unlooked for mishap in the course of his employment. In common language, it was a case of accidental death.' Per Loreburn, L.C., in Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, supra.\n\n\n 3. \nThe attempted distinction between accidental results and accidental means will plunge this branch of the law into a Serbonian Bog. 'Probably it is true to say that in the strictest sense and dealing with the region of physical nature there is no such thing as an accident.' Halsbury, L.C., in Brintons v. Turvey, L.R. (1905) A.C. 230, 233. Cf. Lewis v. Ocean Accident & Guaranty Corp., 224 N.Y. 18, 21, 120 N.E. 56, 7 A.L.R. 1129; Innes v. Kynoch, (1919) A.C. 765, 775. On the other hand, the average man is convinced that there is, and so certainly is the man who takes out a policy of accident insurance. It is his reading of the policy that is to be accepted as our guide, with the help of the established rule that ambiguities and uncertainties are to be resolved against the company. Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hurni Packing Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 44 S.Ct. 90, 31 A.L.R. 102; Stipcich v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., \n277 \nU.S. 311, 322\n, 48 S.Ct. 512. The proposed distinction will not survive the application of that test.\n When a man has died in such a way that his death is spoken of as an accident, he has died because of an accident, and hence by accidental means. So courts of high authority have held. Lower v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 500]\n\u00a0\n supra (a case of sunstroke); Gallagher v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 163 App. Div. 556, 148 N.Y.S. 1016; Id., 221 N.Y. 664, 117 N.E. 1067 (sunstroke); Jensma v. Sun Life Assurance Co. (C.C.A.) 64 F.(2d) 457; Western Commercial Travelers' Association v. Smith (C.C.A.) 85 F. 401, 40 L.R.A. 653; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge (C.C.A.) 11 F.(2d) 486, 59 A.L.R. 1290; Lewis v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Association (D.C.) 248 F. 602.1 So the holder of this policy might reasonably assume.\n If he had thought about the subject, he might have had his impressions fortified by the ruling of the House of Lords that a workman who suffers a heat stroke has a claim for relief under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, supra. The British act ( 6 Edw. 7, c. 58,  1) gives compensation for personal injury 'by accident' arising out of and in the course of the employment. Injury by heat stroke was held to be injury 'by accident.' The result would hardly have been different, certainly one insured would not have looked for any difference, if for the phrase 'injury by accident' the lawmakers had substituted the words injury 'by means of accident,' or injury by accidental means.\n The principle that should govern the interpretation of the policy in suit was stated with clarity and precision by Sanborn, J., in a case quoted in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The insured did not do anything which in its ordinary consequences was fraught with danger. The allegations \n\n[291 U.S. 491, 501]\n\u00a0\n of the complaint show that he was playing golf in the same conditions in which he had often played before. The heat was not extraordinary; the exertion not unusual. By misadventure or accident, an external force, which had hitherto been beneficent, was transformed into a force of violence, as much so as a stroke of lightning. The opinion of the court concedes that death 'from sunstroke, when resulting from voluntary exposure to the sun's rays,' is 'an accident.' Why? To be sure, the death is not intentional, but that does not make it an 'accident,' as the word is commonly understood, any more than death from indigestion or pneumonia. If there was no accident in the means, there was none in the result, for the two were inseparable. No cause that reasonably can be styled an accident intervened between them. The process of causation was unbroken from exposure up to death. There was an accident throughout, or there was no accident at all.\n The judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decisions are collated in 17 A.L.R. 1197, with the comment that by the weight of authority sunstroke suffered unexpectedly is within the coverage of a policy insuring against injury by external, violent, and accidental means.

Smith, supra, page 405 of 85 F.: 'An effect which is the natural and probable consequence of an act or course of action is not an accident, nor is it produced by accidental means. It is either the result of actual design, or it falls under the maxim that every man must be held to intend the natural and probable consequence of his deeds. On the other hand, an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means which produced it, an effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot be reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, \n an effect which the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged with the design of producing under the maxim to which we have adverted, is produced by accidental means. It is produced by means which were neither designed nor calculated to cause it. Such an effect is not the result of design, cannot be reasonably anticipated, is unexpected, and is produced by an unusual combination of fortuitous circumstances; in other words, it is produced by accidental means.'\n The principle thus formulated has been accepted in many of the decisions cited in footnote 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLARSEN v. NORTHLAND TRANSP. CO.(1934)\nNo. 614\nArgued: March 14, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel B. Bassett, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward G. Dobrin, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For personal injuries negligently inflicted, petitioner Larsen sought judgment in the superior court, King county, Wash., against respondent transportation company, alleged owner and operator of motor ship Norco. The complaint contained no reference to other claimants or creditors. The company made general denial; also set up contributory negligence and assumption of risk. It said nothing concerning any other creditor or claimant or desire to limit liability.\n After verdict, September 22, 1932, judgment for $12,500 against the company followed, October 1. It then petitioned the United States District Court for limitation of liability. The petition recited the circumstances leading to the judgment, prayed for an appraisement of the company's interest as charterer and the pending freight, monition against all persons claiming damages, an appropriate decree.\n Larsen moved to dismiss this petition because: The facts alleged are not sufficient. 'There is only one possible claimant and one charterer of the motor vessel Norco and, therefore, the petitioner might have claimed and ob- \n\n[292 U.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n tained the advantage and benefit of the limitation of liability statute by proper pleading in the action which has been determined in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County.' 'The petitioner failed and refused to claim the advantage and benefit of the limitation of liability statute, in said Superior Court of the State of Washington, and thereby waived its right to claim and obtain the advantage and benefit of said statute.'\n The trial court sustained this motion and dismissed the petition; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The cause is here by certiorari granted upon Larsen's application which set out the following specifications of error:\n Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S.Ct. 243, and Ex parte Green, \n286 \nU.S. 437\n, 52 S.Ct. 602, were misconstrued; it was wrongly held that the District Court, sitting in admiralty, has exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions involved in a proceeding for the limitation of liability where there is only one claimant and only one owner, and where the owner's right to limit liability is not disputed. It was wrongly held that the state court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the shipowner for limitation of liability where there is only one claimant and only one owner, and where the owner's right to limit liability was not disputed. Also, that in such cases, the shipowner was under no obligation to submit his claim to limited liability to the state court, and the judgment of the state court was not res judicata as to all issues which might have been submitted for its decision.\n In substance the argument here presented for petitioner is this: Prior to Langnes v. Green and Ex parte Green, decisions by inferior federal courts undoubtedly sustained the view that, while the state court might have determined the value of respondent's interest in vessel and pending freight and limited liability thereto, it was not \n\n[292 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n obligatory upon it to claim such limitation there, and after judgment for damages the right remained to institute limitation proceedings in the federal court. But those opinions have affirmed another view, and clearly establish that the state court had jurisdiction and was competent finally to consider all necessary facts and limit the liability. Consequently, after the adverse judgment respondent could not seek limitation elsewhere; it was bound to present the whole matter to the state court.\n We think it true to say that before Langnes v. Green and Ex parte Green the commonly approved doctrine permitted a shipowner, even when there was only one claimant, to seek limitation of liability in a federal court after judgment against him for damages by a state court. And, unless those cases are to the contrary, that rule must apply here. White v. Island Transp. Co., \n233 \nU.S. 346\n, 34 S.Ct. 589; In re East River Co., \n266 \nU.S. 355\n, 45 S.Ct. 114; The S.

Green, the injured employee brought an action for damages in the state court. Pending that, the employer instituted proceedings in the federal court to limit liability. The injured man was the only claimant, and cause existed for regarding the limitation proceeding as intended to defeat trial by jury. This Court held, in the circumstances, the federal court should not have enjoined the state court proceeding; but that it should have retained jurisdiction. When thereafter it appeared, Ex parte Green, that in the state court the injured party insisted on denying the owner's right to limitation, we said \n\n[292 U.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n the federal court properly enjoined further proceedings. Neither of these causes supports the suggestion that when sued for damages in a state court a shipowner must at his peril claim limitation of liability in that suit.\n Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255\n, 42 S.Ct. 475, 477, replying to alleged error because the trial court refused to charge as requested, said: 'Petitioner asked an instruction that section 4283 of the Revised Statutes (46 USCA  183) applied, and that under it the verdict could not exceed the value of the vessel. In a state court, when there is only one possible claimant and one owner, the advantage of this section may be obtained by proper pleading. The Lotta (D.C.) 150 F. 219, 222; Delaware River Ferry Co. v. Amos (D.C.) 179 F. 756. Here the privilege was not set up or claimed in the answer, and it could not be first presented upon request for a charge to the jury.'\n This lends no support to the view that, sued in a state court for damages, the shipowner must set up his claim for limitation; otherwise it is waived.\n Statutory provisions (46 USCA  182-188) for limitation of liability should be construed liberally in order to effectuate their beneficent purposes.

This view does not harmonize with the suggestion that to obtain limitation a shipowner must initiate steps to that end before any liability has been made to appear. The Benefactor, \n103 U.S. 239\n. While in certain circumstances the shipowner may ask limitation in the state court, he is not compelled so to do. \n\n[292 U.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n Here the shipowner recognized the judgment; said nothing against its validity. The proceedings in the two courts looked towards entirely different ends.\n The established rule in this Court is that if in a second action between the same parties, a claim or demand different from the one sued upon in the prior action is presented, then the judgment in the former cause is, an estoppel 'only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.'

BICKELL(1934)\nNo. 944\nArgued: May 10, 1934Decided: May 21, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Florida.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. V. Keen, H. E. Carter, Cary D. Landis, and Robert J. Pleus, all of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellant.\n Mr. Charles A. Carroll, of Miami, Fla., for appellees. \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellees, complainants in the court below, have brought this suit against the appellant, the comptroller of the state of Florida, to restrain the enforcement of a Florida statute for the levy and collection of stamp taxes upon the documents described in the bill of complaint.\n Their contention has been and is that the statute, properly construed, does not apply to the transactions stated in the bill, and that, if so applied, it is in conflict with the due process and commerce provisions of the Constitution of the United States. Amendment 14; art. 1,  8.\n A District Court of three judges granted an interlocutory injunction ( 5 F.Supp. 720), which thereafter was made permanent. The case is in this court upon an appeal by the state comptroller. Judicial Code,  266, 28 U. S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n The Florida statute (chapter 15787, Laws of Florida 1931 (Ex. Sess.)) imposes a stamp tax upon all bonds or certificates of indebtedness issued in Florida; upon each original issue of certificates of stock; and upon all sales of stock or certificates of stock, agreements to sell, memoranda of sales or deliveries, or transfers of title, the stamps to be placed upon the certificates if the assignment of the certificate is to a person named therein, and upon a written memorandum which the seller is required to execute and deliver to the buyer if there is either an agreement to sell or a transfer of title by delivery of a certificate assigned in blank. The provisions of the statute so far as material are printed in the margin. 1 \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n The appellees are stockbrokers engaged in business in the city of New York with branch offices in Florida. Orders to buy or sell received from Florida customers are transmitted by the Florida branches, and are executed in New York in accordance with the customs of the Stock Exchange. The comptroller does not contend that any document signed by the brokers in New York is subject to the tax. To the contrary, there is a concession that the stamp taxes applicable to such transactions are those imposed by the New York statute (New York Tax Law (Consol. Laws c. 60),  270) and by a statute of the United States (26 U.S.C.  901(3), 26 USCA  901(3), which are substantially the same as the stamp tax law of Florida. What the comptroller contends is this, that after the transaction is executed in New York, where certificates and memoranda are stamped under the New York and federal statutes, there are certain supplementary papers, copies of the original memoranda, or receipts, or entries in the books, which are signed by the managers or employees of the Florida branches, or on occa- \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n sion by the customers. These, it is said, are memoranda of sales or deliveries within the meaning of the Florida statute. A tax is also claimed where a written order for the sale of shares is signed by a Florida customer and delivered to the Florida agent for transmission to the central office.\n The application of the statute to these and similar situations will be determined more easily when the course of business, first in respect of purchases, and next in respect of sales, has been traced in greater detail. What that course of business is appears very clearly from the stipulated facts.\n Upon the transmission to New York of an order for the purchase of shares of stock and after the execution of the order upon the floor of the Exchange, the buying and selling brokers sign and exchange what is known as an 'exchange contract.' There is no contention by the comptroller that this is taxable in Florida. When the shares are delivered, the rules call for the exchange of what is known as a 'sales ticket,' a memorandum of the transaction, which bears the stamps required by the Federal Stamp Tax Act and by the statute of New York. 26 U.S.C.  901(3), 26 USCA  901(3); New York Tax Law,  270. There is no contention that the sales ticket is taxable in Florida. After the execution of the order, the New York office reports the transaction by telegraph over its private wire to the Florida branch, where an employee receives the telegram and reduces it to writing. This copy according to the contention of the comptroller is a memorandum of sale within the meaning of the Florida statute, and must be stamped accordingly. Another copy of the telegram is commonly, but not invariably, delivered by the branch office to the customer. This too is claimed by the comptroller to be a taxable memorandum, though a stamp is not required if one has been affixed to the copy retained for the office files. In addition to the \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n telegraphic notice to its Florida representatives, the New York office follows the practice of sending notice of the purchase by mail directly to the customer. No stamp is r quired for this notice, which is signed and transmitted in New York. Finally when the purchase has been completed by delivery, there are times when the New York office, instead of holding the certificates for the account of its Florida customer, forwards them to him by registered mail. When this is done, a form of receipt is inclosed, which the customer is asked to sign. The comptroller contends that this receipt, if signed in Florida, is subject to a stamp tax as a memorandum of delivery.\n The course of dealing upon an order for the sale of shares does not differ in essentials, so far as the present subject of inquiry is concerned, from that upon an order to buy. By concession the 'exchange contracts,' and the 'sales tickets' are not taxable in Florida. Taxes are claimed, however, upon the telegraphic report of the sale when written out by employees in the Florida office or by them transmitted in writing to the Florida customer. Taxes are claimed also when the Florida branch delivers a receipt to the customer for certificates to be sold, or receives a written order to sell, the theory being that this last is an agreement to sell within the meaning of the statute.\n If stamp taxes due in connection with any of these memoranda are not affixed when payable, they must be affixed, in the view of the comptroller, to the corresponding entry upon the books of account, but the tax is payable only once in respect of the same transaction, duplicate documents or entries being held to be exempt.\n The failure to pay the tax by affixing and canceling stamps of the prescribed value is declared to be a crime and is punishable accordingly. \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n Upon these facts the District Court held that the complainants, who were nonresidents of Florida, were without an adequate remedy at law, and that the threatened acts of the comptroller, if illegal, should be restrained by a court of equity. As to this we are not in doubt, the multiplicity of actions necessary for redress at law being sufficient, without reference to other considerations, to uphold the remedy by injunction. Wilson v. Illinois Southern R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 574\n, 44 S.Ct. 203; Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 62\n, 42 S.Ct. 453. The taxes claimed by the comptroller and resisted by the complainants exceed the amount necessary to sustain the federal jurisdiction. Several hundred transactions are affected every day.\n The District Court held also (1) that the writings signed in Florida were not agreements or memoranda of sale or delivery within the meaning of the Florida statute; and (2) that the effect of a different construction would be to bring the statute into conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The two grounds are not sharply separated in the opinion of the District Court, the second being brought in to reinforce the first. We propose in what follows to keep them distinct.\n First. The evidence drawn from the wording of the statute combines with the administrative interpretation of like statutes in other jurisdictions and with the practical interpretation of this one for nearly two years in Florida to exclude the transactions from the operation of the tax.\n The scheme of the statute is to tax the transfer of shares of stock, whether executory or executed, by stamps to be affixed to those writings, and those only, which in a practical sense are the repository of the agreement or the instruments or vehicles for the ensuing change of title. Thus, if a transfer has been made and the only evidence of its making is on the books of the corporation, it is on such books and nowhere else that the stamps are to be placed. \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n The statute does not say or mean that they shall be placed also upon the memoranda of the transaction in the office of the brokers or that there shall be an election to affix them either at one place or the other. Again, 'if the change of ownership is by transfer of the certificate' to a stated assignee, it is on the certificate and nowhere else that the stamps are to be placed. Only in two classes of cases is a different rule prescribed. 'In case of an agreement to sell' (as distinguished from an executed transfer) 'or where the transfer is made by delivery of the certificate assigned in blank,' then a memorandum in a prescribed form must be executed by the seller, and this prescribed memorandum is the one to be stamped. In brief, the memorandum of sale or delivery to be taxed under the statute is not every note or entry made in Florida recording a transaction elsewhere. It is the kind of note or entry exacted by the statute where there is an executory agreement or a transfer by delivery, a note or entry to be handed by the seller to the buyer as an evidence of contract or as a muniment of title. If another view were to prevail, the tax could be multiplied repeatedly as the product of the same transaction. Not only the first memorandum would be taxable, but every copy of a copy, and every entry of the transaction in one book or in many. There is significance in the unwillingness of the comptroller to press his claim so far. Refusing to concede that he is not at liberty under the statute to tax as many entries as he can find, he has none the less chosen in the administration of his office to tax the same transaction only once. The choice supplies a gloss upon the intention of the lawmakers. It is an illuminating token that the memoranda to be taxed are the mandatory memoranda only, the customary sales tickets of the brokers, tickets subject to a tax in Florida if ancillary to a transaction consummated there, but free from that burden if signed and delivered somewhere else. In this instance the sales \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n tickets were ancillary to a transaction consummated in New York, were signed and delivered in that state, and when signed and delivered carried stamps in the amount required by the laws of New York and the laws of the United States. We perceive nothing in the law of Florida indicative of a purpose that other memoranda, not the repository of the contract nor exchanged between the parties, should be subject to a tax anywhere.\n One finds it hard, indeed, to see how the collection of the tax would be workable as an administrative problem if a broker were free to choose between stamping his own copy of a document and stamping the duplicate delivered as a memorandum to his customer. The taxing officials could never learn through an inspection of the files whether the mandate of the statute had been followed or ignored. One of the major merits of a stamp tax is to make the evidence of payment visible and almost automatic. That benefit is lost if the collector is uncertain whether the document to be stamped is on the files of the taxpayer or in the possession of another. A court will be slow to hold that the lawmakers had in view a method of collection so awkward and unwieldy. To tax every copy may be oppressive. To tax any one of them indifferently is ineffective. The intention of the lawmakers was to tax a particular set of documents identified with certainty.\n Like statutes outside of Florida have had administrative interpretation pointing to a like conclusion. By section 270 of the Tax Law of New York, a stamp tax is imposed upon 'all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales and all deliveries or transfers of shares or certificates of stock ... in any domestic or foreign association, company or corporation ... whether made upon or shown by the books of the association, company, corporation or trustee, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n other evidence of sale or transfer, whether intermediate or final. ...' The Attorney General of New York has ruled that this statute does not apply to an assignment in blank in New York for delivery to a purchaser in Canada under a sale previously executed upon a Canadian exchange. Opinions of Attorney General 1928, p. 125. Cf., People ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, 110 App.Div. 821, 832, 97 N.Y.S. 535, affirmed 184 N. . 431, 77 N.E. 970, 8 L.R.A.(N.S.) 314, 112 Am.St.Rep. 628, 6 Ann.Cas. 515; Id., \n204 \nU.S. 152\n, 27 S.Ct. 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 736. By a statute of the United States (Revenue Act of 1926,  800, Schedule A, subd. 3, as amended by the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932, 26 U.S.C.  901(3), and Supp. VII, U.S.C.  901 note, 26 USCA  901(3), and section 901 note), a stamp tax is imposed upon sales or memoranda in almost the same words as those of the New York statute. Regulation No. 71, Article 36, of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, makes it clear that only the mandatory memorandum is required to bear a stamp. See, also, article 35. Finally in Florida itself, the very statute now in controversy was ruled by the appellant's predecessor in the office of comptroller to be inapplicable to these transactions or to others not to be distinguished. Counsel for the appellees, uncertain as to his clients' duty, put the case to the comptroller, and received a favorable ruling. For nearly two years the statute was so administered till the present appellant, reaching out, it seems, for new sources of public revenue, found or thought he had found the evidence of an intention to tax a copy made in Florida of a memorandum in New York.\n A word must be said in response to the suggestion that an order to sell, delivered by a customer in Florida to the manager of a Florida branch is an agreement to sell, and therefore subject to the tax. Clearly, we think it is nothing of the kind. It is a grant of authority by customer to broker, by principal to agent, revocable till executed, like agencies in general. There was no agreement to sell till the selling broker and the buying one came to \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n gether on the floor of the stock exchange in New York, and made a contract there.\n The directive force of all these signposts of intention is little less than irresistible when the series is viewed together. The meaning ascribed to the statute by the judges of the court below gives it coherence and simplicity. The meaning read into it by the comptroller splits it into jarring fragments, one a plan for the taxation of the operative documents, all executed in one place, and the other a plan for the taxation of casual reports and copies, executed in another. These plans, to be sure, might be held to coexist if the purpose to combine them were unmistakably disclosed, yet disclosure short of that would be too weak to make the combination plausible. The Florida decisions tell us that doubts, if nicely balanced, will be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. State ex rel. Packard v. Cook, 108 Fla. 157, 146 So. 223; State ex rel. Rogers v. Sweat (Fla.) 152 So. 432; cf., Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280, 286\n, 53 S.Ct. 369. There is little need to summon to our aid that canon of construction invoked by the complainants. The meaning of the statute as we read it is too plain to be swayed by favor or disfavor for one class or another.\n Second. The taxation of the documents being without warrant in the statute, there is no duty to determine whether the constitution would be infringed if the meaning were something else. As to that we do not indicate an opinion, even by indirection. It will be soon enough to set a value upon the arguments of counsel when a statute is before us that requires us to choose between them. At the same time the parties to the controversy should have adequate protection in the possible contingency of a decision by the state Supreme Court at variance with ours in respect of the meaning of the statute, a meaning that will then be declared with ultimate authority. \n\n[292 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Nelson Mfg. Co., February 5, 1934, \n291 \nU.S. 352\n, 54 S.Ct. 392. There should be an appropriate opportunity in such circumstances to terminate or modify the restraints of the decree. There should also be an opportunity to renew the litigation in respect of the issue of constitutional validity, now held to be irrelevant. The reservations proper to that end wi l follow the practice indicated in Glenn v. Field Packing Co., \n290 \nU.S. 177\n, 54 S.Ct. 138, and Wald Transfer & Storage Co. v. Smith, \n290 \nU.S. 602\n, 54 S.Ct. 227, 78 L.Ed . --.\n In conformity with those decisions, the decree will be modified by striking therefrom any conclusion of law or other adjudication as to the validity of the Documentary Stamp Tax Act of Florida under the Constitution of the United States, and by adding a provision, that the parties to the suit or any of them may apply at any time to the court below, by bill or otherwise, as they may be advised, for a further order or decree, in case it shall appear that the statute has been then construed by the highest court of Florida as applicable to the transactions in controversy here. With this modification the decree will be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'On all sales, agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, transfers of legal title to shares, or certificates of stock or profits or interest in property or accumulations in any corporation, or to rights to subscribe for or to receive such shares or certificates, whether made upon or shown by the books of the corporation, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer or sale, whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such stock interests, rights, or not, on each $100.00 of face value or fraction thereof 10\u00f5; and where such shares are without par or face value, the tax shall be 10\u00f5 on the transfer or sale or agreement to sell on each share: Provided, that in case of sale, where evidence of transfer is shown only by the books of the corporation, the stamps shall be placed upon such books of the corporation; and where the change of ownership is by transfer of the certificate, the stamps shall be placed upon the certificates; and in case of an agreement to sell or where the transfer is made by delivery of the certificate assigned in blank, there shall be made and delivered by the seller to the buyer a bill or memorandum of such sale, to which the stamp shall be affixed; and every bill or memorandum of sale or agreement to sell before mentioned, shall show the date thereof, the name of the seller, the amount of the sale, and the matter or things to which it refers.' \n\n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEWIS v. FIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO. OF MARYLAND(1934)\nNo. 802\nArgued: May 4, 1934Decided: June 4, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wallace Miller, of Macon, Ga., and George P. Barse and J. F. Anderson, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. M. F. Goldstein, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the o inion of the Court.\n Under statutes of Georgia, in force since 1879, a bank, state or national, may be appointed depository of state funds. To qualify it must give a bond for the faithful performance of its duty. A bond with surety creates a lien on all the bank's assets, both those held at the time of the execution of the bond and those subsequently acquired. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 559, 562]\n\u00a0\n In July, 1928, the Governor of Georgia appointed the Hancock National Bank of Sparta, Ga., a state depository for the term of four years. It gave a bond with the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland as surety in the sum of $10,000 for the faithful discharge of its duties. From time to time thereafter, until May 23, 1932, the tax collector of Hancock county deposited in the bank moneys collected on account of state taxes. On that day the Comptroller of the Currency declared the bank insolvent and appointed a receiver for whom the petitioner, John C. Lewis, was later substituted. The amount of state funds then on deposit was $6,157.41. This sum, and the accrued interest, the company paid to the state and received an assignment of its rights arising out of the deposit. Then, the company brought in the federal court for the Middle District of Georgia this suit in equity against the receiver to enforce a lien for the amount upon all the assets in his hands, claiming priority according to the date of the bond.\n The District Court, after denying a motion to dismiss, heard the cause substantially upon agreed facts. It ruled that the company was entitled to the rights of the state by subrogation and by transfer; held that neither the state nor the company was entitled to a lien or to preferential treatment; and allowed the claim as one entitled merely to a pro rata dividend. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings, holding that \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 563]\n\u00a0\n the asserted lien was valid, subsisting in favor of the company, and entitled to the priority claimed. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Howard, 67 F.( 2d) 961. This court granted certiorari. Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n291 \nU.S. 658\n, 54 S.Ct. 563, 78 L.Ed. --.\n That court, following Pottorff v. El Paso-Hudspeth Counties Road District, 62 F.(2d) 498, ruled, as matter of federal law, that national banks had under National Bank Act, as enacted in 1864, power to pledge assets to secure public deposits. It ruled as matter of state law that the lien is a contractual one arising, not proprio vigore by reason of the statutes, but by contract of the bank as an incident of giving a personal bond; that these statutes apply to both state and national banks and the scope of the lien is the same in respect to both; declared, in describing its character, that from the date of the bond the lien attaches to all property real and personal then owned or thereafter acquired; that a grantee of real estate having constructive notice would take subject to the lien; that, as to money, bonds, stocks, notes, drafts, and other choses in action, the lien of the state is inferior to the rights of third persons who receive the property bona fide in the ordinary course of business prior to insolvency or sequestration; and that the lien is inferior even to the right of depositors to set off against their own indebtedness that of the bank to them.\n The court took judicial notice of the fact that throughout the fifty- three years since the enactment of the law both national and state banks had acted as state depositories; that the lien had been enforced against money and choses in action when captured by a receivership, but had never been asserted as to commercial assets transferred in due course of business; that the existence of the lien had presented no obstacle to the ordinary operations of the banking business or interfered in any way with the performance by national banks of their federal functions; and that a bank's appointment as state depository is customarily advertised and accepted as evi- \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 564]\n\u00a0\n dence of soundness and credit. Compare In re Blalock (D,.c.) 31 F.(2d) 612.\n In Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. L. O. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, and City of Marion v. Ben Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S. Ct. 421, decided after the entry of the judgment below, we held that a national bank had, prior to the Act of June 25, 1930, no power to make any pledge to secure deposits except the federal deposits specifically provided for by acts of Congress. It follows that, in 1928, no lien arose when the bank was appointed depository; and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed unless the Act of June 25, 1930, c. 604, 46 Stat. 809 (12 USCA  90), authorizes a national bank to give as security a general lien of the character prescribed by the Georgia statutes.\n That act provides:\n'Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof, give security for the safe- keeping and prompt payment of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State.'\n\n First. The receiver contends that the act of 1930 should be construed as authorizing merely a pledge of specific assets to secure public deposits; and that the giving of a general lien upon the bank's assets is still ultra vires. The language of the act is broad enough to authorize giving a general lien on present and future assets, wherever banks organized under the laws of the state have such power; and it should be given that construction. For the main purpose of the 1930 act was to equalize the position of national and state banks; and without such power national banks would not in Georgia be upon an equality with state banks in competing for deposits. The policy of equalization was adopted in the National Bank Act \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 565]\n\u00a0\n of 1864, and has ever since been applied, in the provision concerning taxation. \n2\n In amendments to that act and in the Federal Reserve Act and amendments thereto the policy is expressed in provisions conferring power to establish branches;3 in those conferring power to act as fiduciary;4 in those concerning interest on deposits;5 and in those concerning capitalization. \n6\n It appears also to have been of some influence in securing the grant in 1913 of the power to loan on mortgage. \n7\n Compare Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Kokrda (C.C.A.) 66 F.(2d) 641, 642.\n Second. The receiver insists that, even if the act of 1930 authorizes the giving of a general lien, the lien here asserted must fail because there are provisions in the Georgia law inconsistent with the National Bank Act \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 566]\n\u00a0\n and because obligations are imposed upon state depositories with which no national bank may comply.\n\n 1. \nAttention is called specifically to the terms of the statutory bond which is conditioned 'for the faithful performance of all such duties as shall be required' of the depository 'by the General Assembly or the laws of this State.' The argument is that a national bank is an instrumentality of the United States and cannot subject itself by contract to the laws of a state. But a national bank is subject to state law unless that law interferes with the purposes of its creation, or destroys its efficiency, or is in conflict with some paramount federal law. First National Bank v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 362; McClellan v. Chipman, \n164 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 17 S.Ct. 85; First National Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, \n263 \nU.S. 640, 656\n, 44 S.Ct. 213. What obligations to the state the bank assumes may be defined by the law of that state. It is quite possible that the Legislature might attempt to impose, under the conditions of the bond, a duty which the bank would be without authority to undertake; and to that extent the contract would be unenforceable. But it is not shown that the obligations as now defined by the courts of Georgia are contrary to anything in the National Bank Act. Moreover, the state court, which would be the controlling authority on the question, might decide that the failure of part of the consideration to be given would not invalidate the appointment.\n\n 2. \nIt is urged that acceptance of the appointment as state depository is incompatible with the functions of a national bank, because, under section 224 of the Georgia Civil Code, it has been held that the Governor may issue a fieri facias against the depository bank for the amount due to the state, whereas, Revised Statutes,  5242, provides that 'no attachment, injunction or execution, shall be issued against such association or its property before final judg- \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 567]\n\u00a0\n ment in any suit, action, or proceeding, in any State, county, or municipal court.' \n8\n Assuming, without deciding, that there is such conflict, it is not material here. Section 224 of the Code provides merely a method of enforcing the bond which has not been used here, and hence against which there is at present no occasion for complaint.\n\n 3. \nIt is contended that the lower court erred in its rulings on the Georgia law; that under the state statutes, properly construed, the lien attaches to all kinds of property from the date of the bond; that it applies to real estate and other tangible property, to money, bonds, stocks, notes, drafts, and other choses in action then owned or thereafter acquired by the bank, and that it is not defeated even by a bona fide sale or other disposition of such property in the ordinary course of business; that, consequently, the general lien would present an insuperable obstacle to the bank's serving the public in its ordinary business operations; that the bank could not sell the property it was authorized to acquire, for no one would take it subject to the lien; that the general lien would prevent the pledge of specific bonds or other securities required in order to secure the deposits of the United States and federal agencies pursuant to provisions of the National Bank Act as amended;9 and that it would prevent the pledge of specific security required to authorize the issue of circulating notes. \n10\n The lower court took judicial notice of the fact that for more than half a century the general lien described has been in force, and has not interfered with the performance by banks of their duties to the public; and that national banks while serving as depositories have not, so far as appears, ever been \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 568]\n\u00a0\n confronted with a conflict between their duties to the state and to the United States. The reasons given by that court for its conclusions as to the operation and effect of the lien under the law of Georgia are set forth fully and persuasively in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. We cannot say that it erred in the conclusions reached either as to the state law, or as to the facts. Compare City of Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262, 270\n, 271 S., 54 S.Ct. 421.\n\n 4. \nThe receiver contends that the lien, if limited in its operation upon commercial assets to such moneys, stocks, bonds, notes, drafts, and other choses in action as are captured by a receivership, is not a true security at all; that, if so limited, the alleged lien would, in the event of insolvency, be legally a preference; that to give it effect would conflict with the policy expressed in section 50 of the National Bank Act 11 which forbids preferences made in view of insolvency; and that Congress cannot be assumed to have sanctioned a transaction which, though in form a security, is in essence a preference.\n Sections 50 and 52 (see 12 USCA  194 and  91 and note) do not prohibit liens given prior to insolvency and not in contemplation thereof, whether they arise from express agreements, or are implied from the nature of the dealings between parties, or arise by operation of law. Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 13 S.Ct. 148; Earle v. Pennsylvania, \n178 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 20 S.Ct. 915. The lien here asserted arises out of an agreement executed at a time when there was no question of insolvency; nor is it restricted in its operation to the event of insolvency. It may be exercised by execution or otherwise whenever the bank refuses to pay. It resembles the lien which is enforced when seizure is made by the creditor, within four months of bankruptcy, of property claimed under an after-acquired property clause of a mortgage. Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 \nU.S. 516\n, 25 S.Ct. 306, 49 L.E . 577; Humphrey v. Tatman, 198 \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 569]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 91, 25 S.Ct. 567.12 It resembles also those cases where, under the common law of distress or under a statutory lien, described by the courts as 'inchoate' or 'dormant,' a landlord, within four months of bankruptcy, seizing or levying upon whatever property was on the tenant's promises, was held to have a valid lien. Henderson v. Mayer, \n225 \nU.S. 631\n, 32 S.Ct. 699; Richmond v. Bird, \n249 \nU.S. 174\n, 39 S.Ct. 186. Compare Minnich v. Gardner, \n292 \nU.S. 48\n, 54 S.Ct. 567, 78 L. Ed. --, decided April 2, 1934. The case at bar is unlike Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275\n, 16 S.Ct. 502, relied upon by the receiver, where a New York statute dealing with the administration of insolvent banks provided that, in the event of insolvency, the deposits of a savings bank would be entitled to a preference.\n\n 5. \nThe receiver contends that, under a proper intepretation of the state depository statute, no lien whatever is intended or arises when a national bank gives a bond to secure state deposits, because the bond required of a national bank is more onerous than that required of a state bank.\n The bond of the national bank must be double the amount of the deposit; of the state bank only equal to it. The lien is security for the bond, not the deposit; thus, in the case of a national bank, if the provision were applicable, the lien would be twice the amount of the deposit. As the court below noted, the double bond may have been throught necessary because the state has not the power to examine national banks. But whatever the occasion for the difference, it does not appear to conflict with or cloud the clear statement of the statute attaching the lien to depository bonds as such and without qualifications. The ultimate decision of this question is for the Supreme Court of Georgia, but, until it decides otherwise, \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 570]\n\u00a0\n we see no reason for not accepting the holding of the court below as correct.\n Third. The receiver contends that, even if national banks are authorized under the 1930 act to give a general lien upon their assets of the character described by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgment should be reversed because the bond antedated the act. It appears that the balance on hand June 25, 1930, was withdrawn soon thereafter; that between June 25, 1930, and the appointment of the receiver, May 23, 1932, deposits were regularly made aggregating a large sum; that from time to time checks were drawn against these deposits; and that all of the balance in bank when the receiver was appointed represented deposits made after the passage of the act. \n13\n The appointment of the bank as depository in 1928 and the bond were to cover a period of four years. Though the lien was in form security for the bond, the extent of liability was to be measured by the unpaid balance. Thus, the transaction was not completed in 1928; it was contemplated that there would be continuous dealings between the parties for four years. In fact, the relation continued until the appointment of the receiver. Throughout the whole period the parties intended that the lien should be operative and supposed that it was. The appointment was within the power of the state to confer and of the bank to accept, but, by reason of the paramount federal law, one of the anticipated incidents of the relation, the lien, could not arise. When that obstacle was removed by the Act of June 25, 1930, the original agreement could as to the future be given the effect intended by the parties; and the lien became operative as to deposits thereafter made and is entitled to priority from \n\n[292 U.S. 559, 571]\n\u00a0\n the date of the act. A statute is not retroactive merely because it draws upon ntecedent facts for its operation. Compare Cox v. Hart, \n260 \nU.S. 427, 435\n, 43 S.Ct. 154; Ewell v. Daggs, \n108 \nU.S. 143\n, 2 S.Ct. 408; Petterson v. Berry (C.C.A.) 125 F. 902; Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. (C.C.) 62 F. 904, 910; Rosenplanter v. Provident Savings, etc., Soc. (C.C.A.) 96 F. 721, 46 L.R.A. 473. It was not necessary to go through the form of executing a new bond. Compare Jones v. New York Guaranty & Indemnity Co., \n101 U.S. 622\n, 627. We have no occasion to consider whether the Act of June 25, 1930, would have validated the lien also in respect to deposits made before that date. Compare Gross v. United States Mortgage Co., \n108 \nU.S. 477, 488\n, 2 S.Ct. 940; West Side Belt R. Co. v. Pittsburgh Construction Co., \n219 \nU.S. 92\n, 31 S.Ct. 196; Charlotte Harbor & Northern R. Co. v. Welles, \n260 \nU.S. 8\n, 43 S.Ct. 3.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The bond to be made by the State depositories may be a personal bond or may be made by a deposit with the state treasurer of United States bonds or Georgia State bonds, or either one or both of said methods.' Section 1256, Civil Code of Georgia (1910). Section 1252 provides that the depository bond shall have 'the same binding force and effect as the bond required by law to be given by State treasurers, and, in case of default, shall be enforced in like manner.' Section 218 of the Code relating to the treasurer's bond provides that 'a lien is hereby created in favor of the State upon the property of the treasurer to the amount of said bond, and upon the property of the securities upon his said bond to the amount for which they may be severally liable, from the date of the execution thereof.' The Supreme Court of Georgia held, in cases involving state banks, that under these statutes the state acquires a lien on all the assets of a depository bank, both those at the time of the execution of the bond and those subsequently acquired.

CO. OF TENNESSEE v. MCCRAY(1934)\nNo. 89\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas. \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 567]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Moreau P. Estes and P. M. Estes, both of Nashville, Tenn., and Myron T. Nailling, of Memphis, Tenn., for appellant.\n Messrs. Joseph M. Hill and Henry L. Fitzhugh, both of Fort Smith, Ark ., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 3, 1930, the appellant, an insurance company, issued to Jonas McCray a policy of life insurance for $500 \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 568]\n\u00a0\n payable to his wife, the appellee in this court. The policy lapsed in June, 1931, for nonpayment of a premium within the period of grace, but in August, 1931, it was reinstated with the company's consent. On May 10, 1932, the insured committed suicide. If suicide occurred within a year from the date of issue of the policy, the insurer's liability was limited to a return of any premiums paid by the insured. If suicide occurred after the expiration of the year, the liability was the same as upon a death from other causes. The appellee made proof of claim against the insurer, insisting that the year was to be calculated from the original date of issue. The company refused payment upon the ground that the year was to be calculated from the time of reinstatement. Judgment went against the insurer in the trial court, and again, upon appeal, in the Supreme Court of the state. (Ark.) 58 S.W.(2d) 199. The controversy here grows out of the amount of the recovery. To the face of the policy with interest at 6 per cent. there were added certain statutory allowances, which are contested in this court. One of the additions was an attorney's fee of $ 200 ($100 for the trial and $100 for the appeal). The other was an award of 12 per cent. computed on the payments due under the contract. These increments are authorized by a statute of Arkansas which is quoted in the margin. \n1\n The \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 569]\n\u00a0\n insurer contests the validity of the statute, insisting that it is condemned by the Fourteenth Amendment. The case is here upon appeal.\n\n 1. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit the award of an attorney's fee, moderate in amount, when payment of a policy of life insurance has been wrongfully refused.\n We assume in accordance with the assumption of the court below that payment was resisted in good faith and upon reasonable grounds. Even so, the unsuccessful defendant must pay the adversary's costs, and costs in the discretion of the lawmakers may include the fees of an attorney. There are systems of procedure neither arbitrary nor unenlightened, and of a stock akin to ours, in which submission to such a burden is the normal lot of the defeated litigant, whether plaintiff or defendant. The taking master in the English courts may allow the charges of the barrister as well as the fees of the solicitor. \n2\n Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a like procedure here. The assurance of due process has not stereotyped bills of costs at the rates known to the Fathers. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. v. Nye Schneider Fowler Co., \n260 \nU.S. 35\n, 43 S.Ct. 55; Dohany v. Rogers, \n281 \nU.S. 362, 368\n, 50 S.Ct. 299, 68 A. L.R. 434. Nor is there an unjust discrimination, an arbitrary denial of the equal protection of the laws, in laying the burden on insurers and not on all defendants. Diversity of treatment in respect of the costs of litigation has its origin and warrant in diversity of social needs. Dohany v. Rogers, supra. Dependents left without a breadwinner will be exposed to sore distress if life insurance payments are extracted slowly and painfully, after costly contests in the courts. Health and accident insurance will often be \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 570]\n\u00a0\n the sources from which the sick and the disabled are to meet their weekly bills. Fire insurance moneys, if withheld, may leave the business man or the householder without an office or a home. Classification prompted by these needs is not tyrannical or arbitrary. As to that, the judgments of this court in situations precisely apposite have set a closure to debate. Fidelity Mutual Life Association v. Mettler, \n185 \nU.S. 308\n, 22 S.Ct. 662; Iowa Life Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n187 \nU.S. 335\n, 23 S.Ct. 126; Farmers' & Merchants' Insurance Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301\n, 23 S.Ct. 565.\n\n 2. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit a fixed award of damages, moderate in amount, in addition to the costs and the fees of the attorney, when the payment of a policy of life insurance has been wrongfully refused.\n The appellant concedes that such an allowance is permissible when the refusal to pay is wanton or malicious. Supreme Ruling of the Fraternal Mystic Circle v. Snyder, \n227 \nU.S. 497\n, 33 S.Ct. 292. The argument is that the allowance is to be condemned as a denial of due process when the defense is in good faith and on grounds not wholly frivolous. We find a different meaning in the Constitution and the precedents. The same social needs that sustain the award of an attorney's fee when payment is resisted, sustain in like circumstances an increment to the policy within the bounds of moderation. This is not a case where the increment has been authorized after the writing of the policy. The statute was enacted in 1905, and the insurance was written in 1930. Here at the delivery of the policy, the insurer was informed that if it failed to make payment in accordance with its contract, 'twelve per cent damages' would be owing to the insured. We discover nothing arbitrary or oppressive in imposing such a contract upon the business of insurance, a business subject, as all agree, to control and regulation. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151\n, 52 S.Ct. 69; O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hart- \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 571]\n\u00a0\n ford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L. R. 1163. There has been no failure to give heed to 'the rudiments of fair play' (Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Polt, \n232 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 34 S.Ct. 301), as there was in St. Louis, I.M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Wynne, \n224 \nU.S. 354\n, 32 S.Ct. 493, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 102, where the damages were imposed though the insured had rejected a tender of what was due and had made demand for more, or in Polt's Case, supra, a suit against a railroad for loss of property destroyed by fire where the damages were unliquidated and yet the recovery was to be doubled if the verdict exceeded by a penny what was offered by the wrongdoer. To nullify this statute the appellant must be able to show that an award of 12 per cent. is so extravagant in amount as to outrun the bounds of reason and result in sheer oppression. This we cannot bring ourselves to say in the face of a contrary finding by the framers of the statute, with all the presumptions of correctness attaching to their judgment. Still less can we bring ourselves to say it in the face of kindred statutes in force in other states.\n The legislation now challenged is a sample of a type. Statutes very similar have been adopted in Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, and South Dakota. The Texas act, like this one, calls for damages of 12 per cent. in addition to attorney's fees. Texas Revised Civil Statutes, 1925, art. 4736 ( amended by Acts Tex. 1931, c. 91,  1 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Tex. art. 47 ,  36)). In Arizona, the increment is as high as 15 per cent., though it is limited to policies of insurance against fire. Arizona Revised Code, 1928,  1828. In Louisiana, the percentage for fire policies is 12 per cent. and 25 per cent. for fire and theft losses affecting automobiles. Louisiana General Statutes, 1932,  4179, 4246. In South Dakota there is an increment of 10 per cent., confined to loss by fire. South Dakota Compiled Laws, 1929,  9195\n\n\n These statutes and others not unlike them have been considered by this court without complaint or suggestion that the percentage was too high. Thus, in Fidelity Mutual Life Association v. Mettler, \n185 \nU.S. 308, 325\n, 326 S., 22 S.Ct. 662, \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 572]\n\u00a0\n the Texas statute was before us. Carried forward now into the revised codes, it was enacted for the first time in 1879. The attack upon its validity was confined to its discriminatory features, the burden being laid upon some forms of insurance, though inapplicable to others. This court upheld the act as valid, and in so doing repeated with apparent approval the ruling of the Supreme Court of Texas (Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. v. Chowning, 86 Tex. 654, 26 S.W. 982, 24 L.R.A. 504) that the 12 per cent. was given as damages for the failure to comply with the contract by payment, and the fee as compensation for the cost of collection. 185 U.S. at page 325, 22 S.Ct. 662. During the half century and more in which the act has been in force, no one, it seems, has protested to any court that the percentage is immoderate. The same statute came before us again in Iowa Life Insurance Co. v. Lewis, supra, at page 355 of 187 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 126. We renewed our approval, and said of our earlier opinion (Fidelity Mutual Life Association v. Mettler): 'We are ... entirely satisfied with the case and its reasoning.' Page 355 of 187 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 126, 133. Cf. Farmers' & Merchants' Insurance Co. v. Dobney, supra, at page 305 of 189 U.S., 23 S.Ct. 565. The presumption of validity which applies to legislation generally is fortified by acquiescence continued through the years. Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, \n280 \nU.S. 218\n, 50 S.Ct. 94; Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94\n, 41 S.Ct. 433, 17 A.L.R. 873.\n The argument is made that the statutory percentage, though it might be legitimate as an award of damages, is illegitimate if intended as a penalty, a clog upon the privilege of access to the courts. The statute speaks of it as 'damages.' There are places here and there in the opinions of the Supreme Court of Arkansas where the word penalty is used. Arkansas Insurance Co. v. McManus, 86 Ark. 115, 124, 125, 110 S.W. 797; Security Insurance Co. of New Haven v. Smith, 183 Ark. 255, 258, 35 S.W.(2d) 581; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Marsh, 185 Ark. 332, 47 S.W.(2d) 585. How little weight is to be given to this use is perceived when we discover that upon one page of an opinion the percentage is spoken of as a penalty and \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 573]\n\u00a0\n on another page of the same opinion is described as an award of damages. See Arkansas Insurance Co. v. McManus, supra, with its quotation from Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. Seegers, \n207 \nU.S. 73, 77\n, 28 S.Ct. 28, 29. There is little doubt that the terms were thought of as equivalents.\n The result will not be changed, however, though the increment to the judgment be classified as penal, if the amount is not immoderate. The measure, not the name, controls. The insurer is not penalized for taking the controversy into court. It is penalized (if penalty there is) for refusing to make payment in accordance with its contract, and penalized in an amount that bears a reasonable proportion to the loss or inconvenience likely to be suffered by the creditor. Repeated judgments of this court bear witness to the truth that such a tax upon default is not put beyond the pale by calling it a penalty. Thus, in Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 \nU.S. 217\n, 33 S.Ct. 40, 41, the court had before it a Mississippi statute whereby a common carrier was required to settle claims within a stated time. If this was not done, there was to be a liability to the consignee for 'twenty-five dollars damages in each case, in addition to actual damages' (Laws Miss. 1908, c. 196), whenever the amount of the claim was $200 or less. This court upheld the additional exaction though describing it as a penalty. The statute did no more than provide 'a reasonable incentive for the prompt settlement, without suit, of just demands,' and demands 'of a class admitting of special legislative treatment.' Cf. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Polt, supra, page 168 of 232 U.S., 34 S.Ct. 301. In Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Seegers, supra, the penalty for delay was $50, and the court was not deterred by the label from enforcing the statute and adjudging its validity. There was approval of the statement of the court below that 'the penalty, in case of a recovery in a court' would operate 'as a deterrent of the carrier in refusing to settle just claims, \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 574]\n\u00a0\n and as compensation of the claimant for ... trouble and expense.' More recently, in Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co. v. Nye Schneider Fowler Co., supra, a statute of Nebraska prescribing the liability of carriers imposed a charge of 7 per cent. on the amount of the recovery as well as reasonable attorney's fees. We held that 'a reasonable penalty' (pages 43, 45 of 260 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 58, 59) might be assessed against the wrongdoer as a stimulus to settlement without vexatious delay.\n'Penalty' is a term of varying and uncertain meaning. There are penalties recoverable in vindication of the public justice of the state. There are other penalties designed as reparation to sufferers from wrongs. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 668\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Brady v. Daly, \n175 \nU.S. 148, 154\n, 157 S., 20 S.Ct. 62; St. Louis, I.M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Williams, \n251 \nU.S. 63, 66\n, 40 S.Ct. 71; Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224 N.Y. 99, 103, 120 N.E. 198.3 One who refuses to pay when the law requires that be shall, acts at his peril, in the sense that he must be held to the acceptance of any lawful consequences attached to the refusal. It is no answer in such circumstances that he has acted in good faith. 'The law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree.' Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 781. Reparation may still be due, for all his good intentions, yet reparation within bounds. It is all 'a question of more or less.' Sexton v. Kessler & Co., \n225 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 32 S.Ct. 657, 659. The price of error may be so heavy as to erect an unfair barrier against the endeavor of an honest litigant to obtain the judgment of a court. In that event, the Constitution intervenes and keeps the \n\n[291 U.S. 566, 575]\n\u00a0\n courtroom open. Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 661\n, 662 S., 35 S.Ct. 214. On the other hand, the penalty may be no more than the fair price of the adventure. St. Louis, I. M. & S.R. Co. v. Williams, supra, page 66 of 251 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 71. In that event, the litigant must pay for his experience, like others who have tried and lost.\n\n\n 3. \nOther objections affecting the merits of the recovery have been put before us by the appellant in briefs and in oral argument.\n Our jurisdiction upon appeal from a judgment of a state court does not permit us to review them.\n\n 4. \nTo the extent that Standard Accident Insurance Co. v. Rossi (C.C.A .) 35 F. (2d) 667, and Inter-Southern Life Insurance Co. v.

It presents the question of the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of rates prescribed by the Illinois Commerce Commission for telephone service in the city of Chicago. The commission's order, made on August 16, 1923, to be effective October 1, 1923, reduced rates applicable to a large part of the intrastate service of the appellee, Illinois Bell Telephone Company. \n1\n In this suit, brought by that company in September, 1923, an interlocutory injunction was granted upon the condition that, if the injunction were dissolved, the company should refund the amounts charged in excess of the challenged rates. We affirmed that order. Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n269 \nU.S. 531\n, 46 S.Ct. 22. The final hearing was not had until April, 1929, a delay found to be attributable to the city of Chicago.

We reversed that decree and remanded the case for further proceedings. Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, \n282 \nU.S. 133\n, 51 S.Ct. 65. Further evidence was then taken, and the District Court made \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n new findings and entered a final decree which permanently restrained the enforcement of the commission's order and released the company from obligation to refund the moneys which had been collected pending the suit. Illinois Bell Tel. Co. v. Gilbert, 3 F.Supp. 595. The state authorities and the city bring this direct appeal. Jud. Code  266 (28 USCA  380). The company brings a cross-appeal to review the findings below, insisting that its property has been undervalued and that substantial amounts of its operating expenses have been disallowed. \n No. 440.\n The Appeal of the State Officers and the City of Chicago.-On the former appeal, it appeared that no distinction had been made by the commission or by the District Court between the intrastate and the interstate property and business of the company. We found that separation was essential to the appropriate recognition of the competent governmental authority in each field of regulation. Accordingly, we directed that, as to the value of the property employed in the intrastate business in Chicago and as to the amounts of revenue and expenses incident to that business, separately considered, there should be specific findings. And as a rate order which is confiscatory when made may cease to be confiscatory, and one which is valid when made may become confiscatory at a later period, we held that there should be appropriate findings for each of the years since the date of the commission's order. Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 149, 162\n, 51 S.Ct. 65. On the further hearing, that difficult task was so well performed that no question is now raised as to the allocation of property to the intrastate and interstate services, respectively, in the Chicago area, the allocation being made on the basis of use. \n2\n Nor is there dispute with respect to the \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 156]\n\u00a0\n separation of expenses. Appellants object to the separation of revenues, insisting that certain revenues were improperly assigned to the interstate, instead of the intrastate, business. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Considering the fact that 99 per cent. of the stock of appellee is owned by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company which also owns substantially the same proportion of the stock of the Western Electric Company, we directed that there should be further examination of the purchases made by appellee from the Western Electric Company and of the payments made by appellee to the American Company. As it appeared that the Western Electric Company, through the organization and control of the American Company, was virtually the manufacturing department for the Bell system, we directed specific findings to be made as to the net earnings of the Western Electric Company in that department and as to the extent to which, if at all, such profit figured in the estimates upon which the charge of confiscation was predicated. We also held that there should be specific findings with regard to the cost to the American Company of the services which it rendered to appellee and the reasonable amount which should be allocated in that respect to the operating expenses of appellee's intrastate business. Id. pp. 153, 157 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 65. The District Court entered into an exhaustive examination of these questions and made detailed findings. The court found that the equipment and supplies furnished by the Western Electric Company had been sold to appellee at fair and reasonable prices, and that the earnings of the Western Electric Company on its investment allocated to the business done \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n with appellee, and its profits on sales, had been fair and reasonable, with the exception of an advance in prices of 10.2 per cent. effective on November 1, 1930. That advance the court disapproved, and, in determining the reasonable outlays to be allowed to appellee after that date, the court made a reduction of 10 per cent. from the prices charged by the Western Electric Company. \n4\n Appellee contests this reduction, and appellants object to the amounts allowed.\n The District Court made specific findings as to the character of the services rendered by the American Company under its license contracts with appellee and the amounts of the cost of these services which should be allocated to the operating expenses of the latter's intrastate business. In the years 1923 to 1928, inclusive, when the court found that the payments under the license contracts charged on appellee's books exceeded the cost as thus determined and allocated, only the cost was held to be chargeable to operating expenses, but in the years 1929 to 1931, inclusive, when the license payments as so charged were less than the cost, only the amount of the license payments was allowed as an operating expense. \n5\n Appellants raise many questions in opposition to these determinations of costs and allocations, while appellee contends that the costs as found were less than the true costs and that the full amounts paid under the license contracts should have been allowed. \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n The evidence with respect to the value of appellee's property employed in its intrastate business at Chicago is voluminous. The evidence shows the original or book cost of this property, the market value of land, and estimates of the cost of reproduction new of the other physical property constituting appellee's telephone plant. There was also evidence of the condition of the property, together with estimates of accrued depreciation. Appellants submitted no valuations since one made by the commission in 1923,6 but presented detailed criticisms of appellee's estimates. The District Court found that the method adopted by appellee's witness in ascertaining the cost of reproduction new was reliable and that appellee's estimates were substantially correct. The court encountered difficulties in making its valuations for the years 1931 and 1932. It took notice of the general fall in values which had accompanied the depression in business. And for that reason the court fixed values for 1931 and 1932 which in its opinion 'gave due consideration to the element of the present decline.' The court found that the fair rate of depreciation to be applied to reproduction cost new was 16 per cent. for the years 1923 to 1928, inclusive, and 15 per cent. for the succeeding years, and that the amount to be added to reproduction cost new on account of going value was 8 per cent. of that cost. The court also made findings as to the appellee's working cash capital, the amounts invested in materials and supplies and in property in course of construction, and as to these three items there is no controversy.\n The court's findings, for each year, of the fair value of appellee's property, used and useful in its intrastate business in the Chicago area, including working cash capital, materials and supplies, construction work in progress, and going value, taking the average amount for the year, and \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 159]\n\u00a0\n the court's findings as to the original or average book cost of the same property, but without going value, are as follows:\n Fair Value Book cost 1923 $124,200,000 $ 95,074,135 1924 136,500,000 105,291,980 1925 148,500,000 117,730,536 1926 151,500,000 130,857,355 1927 167,000,000 146,173,197 1928 173,000,000 159,622,212 1929 184,000,000 168,988,816 1930 187,120,000 178,157,620 1931 179,100,000 181,925,963 1932 166,500,000 181,925,963\n Appellants contend that the findings as to fair value are excessive. Appellee insists that they are too low. In particular, appellee says that the property was undervalued through excessive deductions for existing depreciation. Appellee maintains that the evidence shows a maximum depreciation of 9 per cent. for the years 1923 to 1928, and of 8 per cent. thereafter, instead of the 16 per cent. and 15 per cent. deducted by the court.\n In computing the net revenue from the intrastate business in Chicago, the court made adjustments in operating expenses with respect to the payments to the Western Electric Company and the American Company, as above stated, and also reduced to some extent the annual charges for depreciation. By these adjustments, the amount of the net revenue as found by the court largely exceeded that shown by appellee's books. For example, the amount available for return in the year 1923 under the existing rates appears to have been $5,347,533 according to appellee's books, while the amount found by the court to have been available for return in that year is $6,646,183. We shall presently refer to the comparison for the other years.\n The court found that, if the rates in suit had been effective, appellee's net earnings on its intrastate business \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 160]\n\u00a0\n would have thereby been reduced to the extent of $1,541,668 for 1923, and by somewhat greater amounts in later years except in 1931 and 1932. As thus estimated, the net revenue available for return from the intrastate business in Chicago under the rates in suit would have been as follows: 1923, $5,104,515; 1924, $5,932,959; 1925, $6,297,890; 1926, $6,402,128; 1927, $6,686,503; 1928, $6,914,459; 1929, $8,939,602; 1930, $8,492,385; 1931, $8,392,555; 1932, $6,750,000.\n The court found that the fair rate of return on the average fair value of the intrastate property was 7 1\/2 per cent. for each of the years 1923 to 1927, inclusive, 7 per cent. for each of the years 1928, 1929, and 1930, 6 1\/2 per cent. for 1931, and 5 1\/2 per cent. for 1932. On the basis of these findings of fact, the court concluded that the rates in suit were confiscatory at all times from the date of the commission's order.\n\n 1. \nThe Experience of the Company under the Existing Rates.-The effect of the decision below, and of the findings upon which it is based, strikingly appears if we put aside for the moment the rates in suit and consider that effect in relation to the existing rates under which the Illinois Company has conducted its business since 1920; that is, if we compare the amounts available for return-the net intrastate income in Chicago under existing rates-as shown (1) by appellee's statement from its books and (2) by the court's adjustments, with (3) the amount of the net income which, under the findings of fair value, income, expenses, and rate of return, would be necessary to avoid confiscation. The following table, with columns correspondingly designated, gives the comparison:7 \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 161]\n\u00a0\n (1) (2) (3) 1923 $5,347,533 $ 6,646,183 $ 9,315,000 1924 6,230,178 7,483,954 10,237,500 1925 6,650,718 7,880,451 11,137,500 1926 6,887,012 8,052,698 11,362,500 1927 6,877,089 8,363,580 12,525,000 1928 7,601,567 8,627,760 12,110,000 1929 9,490,091 10,679,602 12,880,000 1930 9,152,490 10,138,263 13,098,400 1931 8,494,616 9,826,299 11,641,500 1932 ..... 8,000,000 9,157,500\n On this showing, the findings if accepted would compel the conclusion that, when the commission's order was made in 1923, not only the new rates, but the existing rates as well, were grossly confiscatory; that appellee was receiving under the existing rates, according to its books, a net return of $5,347,533 when it was entitled to nearly $4,000,000 more, or $9, 315,000, to prevent its property from being confiscated. The table shows a similar situation in the succeeding years. Again, the inference would be irresistible that the existing rates were confiscatory when they were prescribed by the Public Utilities Commission of Illinois (the predecessor of the present commission) in December, 1920, to be effective January 1, 1921. In the comprehensive disclosure of appellee's financial condition there is nothing to permit an inference of any radical change which would have made rates, compensatory in 1921, confiscatory in 1923\n\n\n But, instead of challenging the existing rates as constituting an invasion of constitutional right, appellee when summoned by the commission, in September, 1921, in the proceeding which led to the order now under review, asserted that the existing rates were just and reasonable. In its answer to the commission, appellee alleged 'that its rates and charges heretofore approved and authorized by the aforesaid order of the Public Utilities Commission \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 162]\n\u00a0\n of Illinois, entered on the 20th day of December, 1920, and now in full force and effect, are just and reasonable, and that the burden of proof is upon whomsoever avers, or seeks to show, that said rates and charges are unjust or unreasonable.' And when this suit was brought in September, 1923, to prevent the enforcement of the new rates, appellee did not seek to enjoin the existing rates.\n The financial history of the Illinois Company repels the suggestion that during all these years it was suffering from confiscatory rates. Its capital stock rose from $9,000,000 in 1901, to $70,000,000 in 1923, $80, 000,000 in 1925, $110,000,000 in 1927, $130,000,000 in 1929, and $150,000, 000 in 1930. Its funded debt, which was somewhat less than $50,000,000 in 1923, continued at about the same amount until 1930. During this period appellee paid the interest on its debt and 8 per cent. dividends on its stock. Its 'fixed capital reserves,'8 which embraced the depreciation reserve presently to be mentioned, rose from $37,575,004 in 1923, to $63, 966,748 in 1930, and to $69,242,667 in 1931. The company's surplus and undivided profits over and above these capital reserves increased from $5, 600,326 in 1923, to $22,907,654 in 1930, and to $23,767,381 in 1931. Its 'fixed capital,' that is, the book cost of 'total plant and general equipment,' which was $145,984,084 at the end of 1923, increased to $288, 381,090 at the end of 1930, and to $291,259,580 at the end of 1931.9 We do not lose sight of the fact that this showing embraces the entire business of the Illinois Company, both interstate and intrastate. But it appears that the intrastate investment in the Chicago area ap- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 163]\n\u00a0\n proximated 60 per cent. of the entire investment of appellee in the state. The book cost of the plant in service and general equipment in intrastate business in Chicago increased from $95,582,266 at the end of 1923 to $174, 160,314 at the end of 1930, and to $177,384,652 at the end of 1931.10 'The gross additions' to the company's property in the Chicago area, the company states, 'were spread fairly evenly over the period.' 'The business expanded with great rapidity. The number of telephones in Chicago increased from 690,000 at the end of 1923 to 940,000 at the end of 1931, and was 987,000 at the peak in 1929.' During the nine years 'a greater amount of plant was added new to the property than was in service at the beginning of the term.' The company informs us that the property was kept 'at a high and even standard of maintenance throughout the years involved' and 'was at all times capable of giving adequate telephone service abreast of the art.' The property has been efficiently and economically operated, and the company has enjoyed excellent credit.\n This actual experience of the company is more convincing than tabulations of estimates. In the face of that experience, we are unable to conclude that the company has been operating under confiscatory intrastate rates. Yet, as we have said, the conclusion that the existing rates have been confiscatory-and grossly confiscatory-would be inescapable if the findings below were accepted. In that event, the company would not only be entitled to resist reduction through the rates in suit, but to demand, as a constitutional right, a large increase over the rates which have enabled it to operate with out- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 164]\n\u00a0\n standing success. Elaborate calculations which are at war with realities are of no avail. The glaring incongruity between the effect of the findings below as to the amounts of return that must be available in order to avoid confiscation and the actual results of the company's business makes it impossible to accept those findings as a basis of decision.\n\n 2. \nThe Effect of the Reduction through the Rates in Suit.-The foregoing considerations limit our inquiry. It is not necessary to traverse the wide field of controversy to which we are invited and to review the host of contested points presented by counsel. In the view that the existing rates cannot be regarded as inadequate, the question is simply as to the effect of the reduction in net income by the rates in suit. The question is whether the company has established, with the clarity and definiteness befitting the cause, that this reduction would bring about confiscation. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637. The amounts of the reduction for the respective years are not in dispute. \n11\n It would have been $1,541,668 for 1923, would have been greatest, at $1,740, 000, for 1929, and least, at $1,270,000, for 1932.\n Operating Expenses.-In determining the effect of these reductions, and what amounts would still be available to the company for net return, we come to the questions raised by the company's charges to operating expenses. Charges to operating expenses may be as important as valuations of property. Thus, excessive charges of $1,500,000 to operating expenses would be the equivalent of 6 per cent. on $25,000,000 in a rate base. In this in- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 165]\n\u00a0\n stance, against the reductions which the rates in suit would have effected, are the considerable sums which would be added to the amounts available for return by the adjustments in operating expenses made by the District Court. \n12\n These adjustments embraced overpayments found to have been made by the Illinois Company in its transactions with the American Telegraph & Telephone Company and the Western Electric Company. In 1923, the overpayment to the former company, treating its outlay or the cost of its service to its subsidiary as the measure of the operating expense, was found to be $573,819; the average of the annual overpayments, as found for the years 1923 to 1927, inclusive, amounted to $545,443.13 It should be noted that on the same basis of adjustment there would have been an increase (averaging $256,036) in operating expenses for the years 1929 to 1931, when the cost of the service exceeded the license payments. 14 The court below found overpayments to the Western Electric Company of $332,470 in 1931 and 1932, respectively. \n15\n There are numerous contentions presented by each of the parties in relation to these adjustments-by appellants, to decrease, and by appellee, to increase, the amounts of expense allowed-but we shall not undertake to pass upon them in view of the determinative nature, for the present purpose, of the remaining question as to the sums which the company has annually charged to operating expenses for depreciation.\n Annual Allowances for Depreciation.-The commission, in the order under review, concluded that the depreciation reserve (amounting, at the end of 1922, for the Chi- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 166]\n\u00a0\n cago property, interstate and intrastate, to about $26,000,000) had been built up by annual additions that were in excess of the amounts required. The commission provided for 'a combined maintenance and replacement allowance' which it considered sufficient to protect the investment in the property and to permit the company 'to accrue a reserve in the anticipation of property retirements.' On the first hearing, the District Court considered that the effect of that ruling was to reduce the amount charged for depreciation to the operating expenses in 1923 to the extent of about $1,800,000.16 The company did not comply with the commission's requirement, but continued its own method of computing the annual allowances. We adverted to this question on the former appeal. We said that the recognition of the ownership of the property represented by the depreciation reserve did not justify the continuance of excessive charges to operating expenses. We thought that the experience of the Illinois Company, together with a careful analysis of the results shown under comparable conditions, by other companies which are part of the Bell system, should afford a sound basis for judgment as to the amount which in fairness both to public and private interest should be allowed as an annual charge. Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 U.S. 157\n-159, 51 S.Ct. 65. The District Court in making its findings stated that it had considered the data to which we referred, but we are not advised as to the precise method of its calculations. \n17\n The annual amounts allowed by the court for depreciation, as compared with those which appellee charged on its books to operating expenses,18 are as follows: \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 167]\n\u00a0\n Court's Allowances. Book Charges. 1923 $4,000,000 $4,222,000 1924 4,250,000 4,470,000 1925 4,750,000 5,048,000 1926 5,400,000 5,767,000 1927 6,000,000 6,335,000 1928 6,650,000 7,009,000 1929 7,000,000 7,436,000 1930 7,200,000 7,865,000 1931 7,400,000 8,133,000\n Broadly speaking, depreciation is the loss, not restored by current maintenance, which is due to all the factors causing the ultimate retirement of the property. These factors embrace wear and tear, decay, inadequacy, and obsolescence. \n19\n Annual depreciation is the loss which takes place in a year. In determining reasonable rates for supplying public service, it is proper to include in the operating expenses, that is, in the cost of producing the service, an allowance for consumption of capital in order to maintain the integrity of the investment in the service rendered. \n20\n The amount necessary to be provided annually for this purpose is the subject of estimate and computation. In this instance, the company has used the 'straight line' method of computation, a method ap- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 168]\n\u00a0\n proved by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 177 I.C.C. pp. 408, 413. By this method the annual depreciation charge is obtained by dividing the estimated service value by the number of years of estimated service life. The method is designed to spread evenly over the service life of the property the loss which is realized when the property is ultimately retired from service. According to the principle of this accounting practice, the loss is computed upon the actual cost of the property as entered upon the books, less the expected salvage, and the amount charged each year is one year's pro rata share of the total amount. \n21\n Because of the many different classes of plant, some with long and some with short lives, some having large salvage and others little salvage or no salvage, and because of the large number of units of a class, the company employs averages, that is, average service life, average salvage of poles, of telephones, etc.\n While property remains in the plant, the estimated depreciation rate is applied to the book cost and the resulting amounts are charged currently as expenses of operation. The same amounts are credited to the account for depreciation reserve, the 'Reserve for Accrued Depreciation.' When property is retired, its cost is taken out of the capital accounts, and its cost, less salvage, is taken out of the depreciation reserve account. According to the practice of the company, the depreciation reserve is not held as a separate fund, but is invested in plant and equipment. As the allowances for depreciation, credited to the depreciation reserve account, are charged to operating expenses, the depreciation reserve invested in the property thus represents, at a given time, the amount of the investment which has been made out of the proceeds of telephone rates for the ostensible purpose of replacing capital consumed. If the predictions of service life were entirely accurate and retirements were made when and as these predictions were \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 169]\n\u00a0\n precisely fulfilled, the depreciation reserve would represent the consumption of capital, on a cost basis, according to the method which spreads that loss over the respective service periods. But if the amounts charged to operating expenses and credited to the account for depreciation reserve are excessive, to that extent subscribers for the telephone service are required to provide, in effect, capital contributions, not to make good losses incurred by the utility in the service rendered and thus to keep its investment unimpaired, but to secure additional plant and equipment upon which the utility expects a return.\n Confiscation being the issue, the company has the burden of making a convincing showing that the amounts it has charged to operating expenses for depreciation have not been excessive. That burden is not sustained by proof that its general accounting system has been correct. The calculations are mathematical, but the predictions underlying them are essentially matters of opinion. \n22\n They proceed from studies of the 'behavior of large groups' of items. These studies are beset with a host of perplexing problems. Their determination involves the examination of many variable elements and oppor- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 170]\n\u00a0\n tunities for excessive allowances, even under a correct system of accounting, the always present. The necessity of checking the results is not questioned. The predictions must meet the controlling test of experience.\n In this instance, the evidence of expert computations of the amounts required for annual allowances does not stand alone. In striking contrast is the proof of the actual condition of the plant as maintained-proof which the company strongly emphasizes as complete and indisputable in its sharp criticism of the amount of accrued depreciation found by the District Court in valuing the property. The company insists that 'the existing depreciation in the property, physical and functional, does not exceed 9 per cent. in the years 1923 to 1928 and 8 per cent. thereafter.' The existing depreciation as thus asserted by the company, and the amounts it shows as the depreciation reserve allocated to the intrastate business in Chicago (taking in each case the average amounts per year), are as follows:\n Existing Depreciation Years. Depreciation. Reserve. \n23\n 1923 $11,992,000 $26,797,000 1924 12,865,000 29,316,000 1925 13,775,000 32,155,000 1926 14,621,000 35,572,000 1927 15,360,000 39,352,000 1928 16,241,000 42,769,000 1929 15,300,000 44,515,000 1930 15,863,000 45,829,000 1931 15,828,000 48,362,000\n In explanation of this large difference, the company urges that the depreciation reserve in a given year does \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 171]\n\u00a0\n not purport to measure the actual depreciation at that time; that there is no regularity in the development of depreciation; that it does not proceed in accordance with any fixed rule; that as to a very large part of the property there is no way of predicting the extent to which there will be impairment in a particular year. Many different causes operating differently at different times with respect to different sorts of property produce the ultimate loss against which protection is sought. As the accruals to the depreciation reserve are the result of calculations which are designed evenly to distribute the loss over estimated service life, the accounting reserve will ordinarily be in excess of the actual depreciation. Further, there are the special conditions of a growing plant; 'there are new plant groups in operation on which depreciation is accruing but which are not yet represented, or are but slightly represented, in the retirement losses.' Where, as in this instance, there has been a rapid growth, retirements at one point of time will relate for the most part to the smaller preceding plant, while the depreciation reserve account is currently building up to meet the 'increased eventual retirement liability' of the enlarged plant.\n Giving full weight to these considerations, we are not persuaded that they are adequate to explain the great disparity which the evidence reveals. As the company's counsel say: 'The reserve balance and the actual depreciation at any time can be compared only after examining the property to ascertain its condition; the depreciation, physical and functional, thus found can be measured in dollars and the amount compared with the reserve.' Here we are dealing not simply with a particular year, but with a period of many years-a fairly long range of experience-and with careful and detailed examinations made both at the beginning and near the end of that period. The showing of the condition of the property, and \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 172]\n\u00a0\n of the way in which it has been maintained, puts the matter in a strong light. In substance, the company tells us: The property in Chicago is a modern Bell system plant. Through the process of current maintenance, worn, damaged, or otherwise defective parts were being constantly removed before their impairment affected the telephone service. The factors of 'inadequacy' and 'obsolescence' were continuously anticipated by the company, so that the telephone service might not be impaired, 'and no depreciation of that character was ever present in the plant, except to the slight extent that obsolete items of plant were found,' as stated by the company's witnesses. One of these witnesses testified that, in his examination of the plant to determine existing depreciation, he understood 'that anything that was obsolete or inadequate was to be depreciated accordingly.' We are told by the company that in that investigation 'Condition new was assumed to be free from defects or impairment of any kind, that is, perfect or 100% condition, and the thing as it stood in actual use in the plant was compared with the same thing new.' 'All existing depreciation, both physical and functional, was reduced to a percentage, and subtracted from 100 per cent.' The service measured up to the standards of the telephone art at all times. The plant capable of giving such service 'was not functionally deficient, in any practical sense. This is not to say that parts of the plant did not from time to time become inadequate or obsolete, but that the Company continuously anticipates and forestalls inadequacy and obsolescence. Before a thing becomes inadequate or obsolete it is removed from the plant.' But little variation was found in the percentage of existing depreciation during the years 1923 to 1931.24 The com- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 173]\n\u00a0\n pany points out that the commission found, in its order of 1923, that the property was then 'in at least 90 per cent condition.' 'The weighted total or overall condition,' the company shows, 'is 91 per cent. for the years 1923-1928 and 92 per cent. for subsequent years.'\n This condition, kept at a nearly constant level, directs attention to the amounts expended for current maintenance. In the process of current maintenance, 'new parts' are 'installed to replace old parts' in units of property not retired. Such 'substitutions or 'repairs\" are separate from the amounts which figure in the depreciation reserve. The distinction between expenses for current maintenance and depreciation is theoretically clear. Depreciation is defined as the expense occasioned by the using up of physical property employed as fixed capital; current maintenance, as the expense occasioned in keeping the physical property in the condition required for continued use during its service life. But it is evident that the distinction is a difficult one to observe in practice with scientific precision, and that outlays for maintenance charged to current expenses may involve many substitutions of new for old parts which tend to keep down the \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 174]\n\u00a0\n accrued depreciation. The amounts charged by the company to current maintenance year by year, the amounts credited to the depreciation reserve, and the total of the two sets of charges to operating expenses for the intrastate property in Chicago are as follows:\n Current Maintenance. Depreciation. Total. 1923 $ 5,643,623 $4,222,000 $ 9,865,623 1924 6,043,737 4,470,000 10,513,737 1925 6,563,193 5,048,000 11,611,193 1926 7,714,364 5,767,000 13,481,364 1927 8,849,550 6,335,000 15,184,550 1928 9,941,143 7,009,000 16,950,143 1929 10,671,576 7,436,000 18,107,576 1930 11,372,858 7,865,000 19,237,858 1931 10,842,053 8,133,000 18,975,053\n These aggregate amounts range from over 30 per cent. to nearly 40 per cent. of the total amounts charged by the company to operating expenses. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of the evidence as to the expenditures for current maintenance and the proved condition of the property-in the face of the disparity between the actual extent of depreciation, as ascertained according to the comprehensive standards used by the company's witnesses, and the amount of the depreciation reserve-it cannot be said that the company has established that the reserve merely represents the consumption of capital in the service rendered. Rather it appears that the depreciation reserve to a large extent represents provision for capital additions, over and above the amount required to cover capital consumption. This excess in the balance of the reserve account has been built up by excessive \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 175]\n\u00a0\n annual allowances for depreciation charged to operating expenses.\n In answer to appellants' criticism, the company suggests that an adjustment might be made by giving credit in favor of the telephone users 'in an amount equal to 3 1\/2 per cent. upon the difference between the depreciation reserve and the amount deducted from the valuation for existing depreciation.' The suggestion is beside the point. The point is as to the necessity for the annual charges for depreciation, as made or claimed by the company, in order to avoid confiscation through the rates in suit. On that point the company has the burden of proof. We find that this burden has not been sustained. Nor is the result changed by figuring the allowances at the somewhat reduced amounts fixed by the court below. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n We find this point to be a critical one. The questionable amounts annually charged to operating expenses for depreciation are large enough to destroy any basis for holding that it has been convincingly shown that the reduction in income through the rates in suit would produce confiscation.\n The case has long been pending and should be brought to an end. The company has had abundant opportunity to establish its contentions. In seeking to do so, the company has submitted elaborate estimates and computations, but these have overshot the mark. Proving too much, they fail of the intended effect. It is not the function of the court to attempt to construct out of this voluminous record independent calculations to invalidate the challenged rates. It is enough that the rates have been established by competent authority and that their invalidity has not been satisfactorily proved.\n The decree below is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with direction to dissolve the interlocutory injunction, to \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 176]\n\u00a0\n provide for the refunding, in accordance with the terms of that injunction and of the bonds given pursuant thereto, of the amounts charged by the company in excess of the rates in suit, and to dismiss the bill of complaint.\n No. 548. The Appeal of the Company.-The company was successful in the District Court and has no right of appeal from the decree in its favor. The company is not entitled to prosecute such an appeal for the purpose of procuring a review of the findings of the court below with respect to the value of the company's property or the other findings of which it complains. Its contentions in these respects have been considered in connection with the appeal of the state authorities and the city. The appeal of the Company is dismissed. New York Telephone Co. v. Maltbie, \n291 \nU.S. 645\n, 54 S.Ct. 443, 78 L.Ed. -- (February 19, 1934).\n Decree in No. 440 reversed.\n Appeal in No. 548 dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (concurring).\n The evidence does not show that the amounts taken by the company from revenue and charged to the depreciation reserve were required for the maintenance of the property or that the amounts allowed by the lower court for that purpose were needed. The ruling in condemnation of the charges to the depreciation reserve is so important that, even at the risk of duplication, emphasis should be laid upon some facts and reasons that may be cited in its support.\n The court's opinion discloses the principle followed for the ascertainment of the amounts annually so charged. It is the straight line method calculated on cost less salvage. \n1\n That method was prescribed by the Interstate \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 177]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission by an order effective January 1, 1913, establishing the uniform system of accounts for telephone companies. \n2\n The evidence requires a finding that the company faithfully followed the prescribed system. The state commission continuously watched over the \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 178]\n\u00a0\n company's handling of the depreciation reserve account.\n The table next below shows by years in column (1) the intrastate reserve balances, in (2) the intrastate book cost of the property, and in ( 3) percentages that the balances are of the cost.\n Table I.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) 1923 $26,797,000 $95,074,135 28.1% 1924 29,316,000 105,291,980 27.8 1925 32,155,000 117,730,536 27.3 1926 35,572,000 130,857,355 27.1 1927 39,352,000 146,173,197 26.9 1928 42,769,000 159,622,212 26.7 1929 44,515,000 168,988,816 26.2 1930 45,829,000 178,157,620 25.9 1931 48,362,000 181,925,963 26.\n The cost of the property includes from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 paid for land which is not depreciable, and $13,000,000 to $18,000,000 paid for buildings having a long service life. There are other important and relatively permanent plant elements. These facts suggest that the percentages shown in the table are considerably lower than the actual relation of reserve balances to cost of depreciable parts of the property. While much of the plant is new, the reserve was piled up at about the rate that the cost of plant increased. The balances held in respect of all property, interstate and intrastate, increased from about $4,000,000 in 1911 to about $26,000,- \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 179]\n\u00a0\n 000 in 1922. The amounts attributable to the intrastate property alone show an average annual increase of more than $2,300,000. That amount is greatly in excess of the reduction of revenue that would have resulted if the rate order had been enforced.\n The table below shows by years in column (1) the amounts actually expended for current maintenance, in column (2) the amounts charged to depreciation reserve, in column (3) the total of both.\n Table II.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) 1923 $5,643,623 $4,222,000 $ 9,865,623 1924 6,043,737 4,470,000 10,513,737 1925 6,563,193 5,048,000 11,611,193 1926 7,714,364 5,767,000 13,481,364 1927 8,849,550 6,335,000 15,184,550 1928 9,941,143 7,009,000 16,950,143 1929 10,671,526 7,436,000 18,107,526 1930 11,372,858 7,865,000 19,237,858 1931 10,842,053 8,133,000 18,975,053\n The importance of the amounts involved is illustrated by the following table, which shows by years (1) expenditures for current maintenance plus charges to depreciation reserve, in (2) revenues, in (3) the percentages that the former are of the latter.\n Table III.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) 1923 $9,865,623 $37,146,181 26.5% 1924 10,513,737 39,653,954 26.5 1925 11,611,193 42,560,451 27.2 1926 13,481,364 45,932,698 29.3 1927 15,184,550 49,163,580 30.8 1928 16,950,143 53,677,760 31.5 1929 18,107,526 58,279,602 31. 1930 19,237,858 58,698,263 32.7 1931 18,975,053 56,496,299 33.5 \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 180]\n\u00a0\n The next table gives similar information. It shows by years in column ( 1) actual expenditures for maintenance plus charges to the reserve, in (2) the total of all operating expenses, and in (3) the percentages that the former are of the latter.\n Table IV.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) 1923 $ 9,865,623 $31,550,286 31.2% 1924 10,513,737 33,275,574 31.5 1925 11,611,193 35,649,160 32.5 1926 13,481,364 38,893,042 34.6 1927 15,184,550 42,142,649 36 1928 16,950,143 45,704,899 37 1929 18,107,526 48,489,647 39.4 1930 19,237,858 49,319,993 39 1931 18,975,053 47,904,196 39.5\n The actual annual expenditures to keep the plant in proper condition for service are made up of the amounts included in current maintenance and those taken from the depreciation reserve. The table next below is illustrative and is intended to show by years in column (1) that total, in column (2) the revenue, in (3) the percentage that the former is of the latter.\n Table V.\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) 1924 $ 7,994,737 $39,653,954 20.1% 1925 8,772,193 42,560,451 20.6 1926 10,064,364 45,163,580 21.8 1927 11,404,550 49,163,580 23.1 1928 13,533,143 53,677,760 25.2 1929 16,361,526 58,279,602 28 1930 17,923,858 58,698,263 30.5 1931 16,442,053 56,496,299 29.1\n The purpose of this table is to compare the percentage in each year with the percentage in each of the other years. It is to be observed that the lowest is 20.1 per cent. (1924) and the highest 30.5 per cent (1930). This comparison \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 181]\n\u00a0\n serves to test the claim that the depreciation reserve is needed in order to equalize annual cost of upkeep in relation to revenue. If the period covered is typical, the last statement strongly suggests that no reserve account is necessary for that purpose. And that impression is confirmed by a similar comparison of the percentages in table IV. It shows the relation of current maintenance plus depreciation reserve charges to revenue. Comparing the percentage in each year (during the period covered by table V) with the percentage in each of the other years, the lowest is 31.5 per cent. (1924), the highest is 39.5 (1931).\n From the foregoing it justly may be inferred that charges made according to the principle followed by the company create reserves much in excess of what is needed for maintenance. The balances carried by the company include large amounts that never can be used for the purposes for which the reserve was created. In the long run the amounts thus unnecessarily taken from revenue will reach about one-half the total cost of all depreciable parts of the plant. The only legitimate purpose of the reserve is to equalize expenditures for maintenance so as to take from the revenue earned in each year its fair share of the burden. To the extent that the annual charges include amounts that will not be required for that purpose, the account misrepresents the cost of the service.\n The company's properties constitute a complex and highly developed instrumentality containing many classes of items that require renewal from time to time. But, taken as a whole, the plant must be deemed to be permanent. It never was intended to be new in all its parts. It would be impossible to make it so. Expenditures in an attempt to accomplish that would be wasteful. Amounts sufficient to create a reserve balance that is the same percentage of total cost of depreciable items as their age is of their total service life cannot be accepted as legitimate \n\n[292 U.S. 151, 182]\n\u00a0\n additions to operating expenses. In the absence of proof definitely establishing what annual deductions from revenues were necessary for adequate maintenance of the property, the company is not entitled to have the rate order set aside as confiscatory. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The order reduced rates for four classes of coin box service. Otherwise it kept in force the rates which were fixed by an order of December 20, 1920. The coin boxes are in private residences and places of business and are not public pay stations. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It appears that in 1923 there was used in the intrastate service approximately 95 per cent. of appellee's total property in the Chicago area. This percentage progressively decreased in the succeeding years, and in 1931 was somewhat less than 91 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The amounts of net revenue thus involved, which appellants contend should not have been allocated (under the rates in suit) to the interstate service for the respective years, are as follows: 1923, $245,042; 1924, $ 262,398; 1925, $309,505; 1926, $317,915; 1927, $354,372; 1928, $427,655; 1929, $486,875; 1930, $472,469; 1931, $431,580. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Appellee states that this effected a reduction in the operating expenses of appellee of $67,167 for the last two months of 1930, $332,470 for 1931, and an equal amount for 1932. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The amounts of the license payments thus disallowed by the court, as being in excess of the cost of the service, for the years 1923 to 1928, inclusive, are as follows: 1923, $573,819; 1924, $631,549; 1925, $531,233; 1926, $432,704; 1927, $558,011; 1928, $31,553. The amounts by which the cost to the American Company exceeded the license payments, for the years 1929 to 1931, are as follows: 1929, $206,253; 1930, $327,751; 1931, $234, 104. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Smith v.

It would seem that we should have first: investigations of past service life and salvage through sound accounting and statistical methods; second: investigations of the conditions surrounding the employment of such plant in the past and of the extent to which such conditions still prevail; third: the best possible forecast of conditions looming in the future which should exert a modifying influence upon either life or salvage. And then, the active judgment which fuses the experience of the past, so far as it is still pertinent, and the expectation for the future, so far as it is presently pertinent, into a just and reasonable determination of the current rate of depreciation for the time being.' \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The company obtains these average amounts from the total Chicago depreciation reserve at the end of each year, multiplied by the percentage found to be applicable to the intrastate business, with a deduction of one- half of the increase during the year in order to obtain the average. The balance in the depreciation reserve for the entire Chicago property, interstate and intrastate, increased from $4,384,828 at the end of 1911 to $ 29,306,122 at the end of 1923. \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Referring to the period 1923 to 1931, and to the company's exhibit, the company's counsel state that 'the percentage of depreciation in the various classes of plant did not vary materially during the period, with the exception of three classes, namely, central office equipment, private branch exchanges and booths and special fittings. In the case of central office equipment, there were large installations of new equipment in 1929 which had the effect of raising the per cent. condition for the entire class from 92 per cent. for prior years to 93 per cent. for 1929 and subsequent years. In the case of private branch exchanges, the percentage condition improved gradually from 88 per cent. in 1923 to 94 per cent. in 1930 due to the large proportion of new installations and correspondingly large retirements of the old. In the case of booths and special fittings, the percentage condition gradually improved from 78 per cent. in 1923 to 85 per cent. at the end of the period, in this case also because of abnormally large changes of booths at pay stations. These are the changes which in the main account for the fact that the overall condition of the plant rose from 91 per cent. for the years 1923-1928 to 92 per cent. thereafter.' \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The total amounts charged by the company for operating expenses in the intrastate business at Chicago appear to be as follows: 1923, $31,550, 286; 1924, $33,275,574; 1925, $35,649,160; 1926, $38,893,042; 1927, $42, 142,649; 1928, $45,704,899; 1929, $48,489,647; 1930, $49,319,993; 1931, $ 47,904,196. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] See, supra, p. 167. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is not in harmony with the principle of our decision in United Railways & Electric Co. v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 253\n, 254 S., 50 S.Ct. 123, which requires replacement cost to be taken as the basis of calculation. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The following is section 23, Uniform System of Accounts for Telephone Companies, promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, effective January 1, 1913. It will serve to disclose the underlying principle on which the reserve charges are made.\n'Depreciation of Plant and Equipment.-Telephone companies should include in operating expenses depreciation charges for the purpose of creating proper and adequate reserves to cover the expenses of depreciation currently accruing in the tangible fixed capital. By expense of depreciation is meant-\n\n'(a) The losses suffered through the current lessening in value of tangible property from wear and tear (not covered by current repairs).\n\n'(b) Obsolescence or inadequacy resulting from age, physical change, or supersession by reason of new inventions and discoveries, changes in popular demand, or public requirements, and\n\n'(c) Losses suffered through destruction of property by extraordinary casualties.\n\n'The amount charged as expense of depreciation should be based upon rules determined by the accounting company. Such rules may be derived from a consideration of the company's history and experience. Companies should be prepared to furnish the Commission, upon demand, the rules and a sworn statement of the facts, expert opinions, and estimates upon which they are based.\n\n'The estimate for depreciation of physical property should take into account-\n\n'(a) The gradual deterioration and ultimate retirement of units of property which may be satisfactorily individualized, such as buildings, machines, valuable instruments, etc., to the end that by the time such units of property go out of service there shall have been accumulated a reserve equal to the original money cost of such property plus expenses incident to retirement less the value of any salvage.\n\n'(b) The depreciation accruing in property which cannot be readily individualized, such as pole lines, wires, cables, or other continuous structures, where expenditures for repairs or replacements of individual parts ordinarily are not actually made until the later years of the life in service of such property, and when made may, therefore, be classed as extraordinary repairs.\n\n'The rate of depreciation should be fixed so as to distribute, as nearly as may be, evenly throughout the life of the depreciating property the burden of repairs and the cost of capital consumed in operations during a given month or year, and should be based upon the average life of the units comprised in the respective classes of property. ...' \n\n\n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOCAL 167 v. UNITED STATES(1934)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 294]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel H. Kaufman and Nathan D. Perlman, both of New York City, for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Harold M. Stephens, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decree appealed from is an injunction against a conspiracy commenced in May, 1927, by the appellants and others to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in live and freshly dressed poultry in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.,  1, 2 (15 USCA  1, 2). Most of the issues were litigated before the same court in a criminal prosecution commenced August 28, 1928. Sixty-five of the defendants in this case were there convicted November 21, 1929. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This suit was commenced February 7, 1930. The defendants are the Greater New York Live Poultry Chamber of Commerce, Local 167 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Jobbers & Stablemen of America, the Official Orthodox Poultry Slaughterers of America, Inc., called the shochtim union, and 100 individuals, 75 of whom are wholesalers, hereafter called marketmen. The chamber is an association of marketmen. The members of Local 167 haul live poultry. Shochtim are the only persons qualified to slaughter poultry in accordance with Jewish dietary laws; they are employed by the marketmen. \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 295]\n\u00a0\n Live poultry for sale and consumption in the New York metropolitan area continuously moves in great volume from points in distant states to commission men, called receivers, at railroad terminals in Manhattan and Jersey City. The receivers sell to marketmen. The larger part of the poultry is delivered directed from the cars; the remainder from stands maintained by the receivers. The purchasers have the coops loaded on trucks and hauled to their places of business where, without avoidable delay, they sell, slaughter, and deliver to retailers. Marketmen organized the Chamber of Commerce and allocated retailers among themselves and agreed to and did increase prices. The chamber, through a levy of a cent a pound upon poultry sold by the marketmen, raised money-more than $1,000, 000 in the first year-to pay for enforcement activities. To accomplish various purposes of the conspiracy, the conspirators hired men to obstruct the business of dealers who resisted. They spied on wholesalers and retailers and by violence and other forms of intimidation prevented them from freely purchasing live poultry. And, for like purpose and to extort money for themselves and their associates, members of Local 167 refused to handle poultry for recalcitrant marketmen, and members of the shochtim union refused to slaughter.\n The petition contains allegations identical with those of the indictment as to the conspiracy and the means used to carry it into effect. The convicted defendants denied all the material allegations. On the government's motion the court struck out as sham their denials of the conspiracy prior to the commencement of the criminal prosecution but let stand their denials of its continuance after that date. Decree was entered against 52 defendants by consent. Among the 49 resisting were the Chamber of Commerce, Local 167, the shochtim union, and 29 individuals who had been convicted. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge in an oral opinion stated that, except as to two individual defendants, every mate- \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 296]\n\u00a0\n rial allegation had been proved. In accordance with that ruling the court later made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and entered a comprehensive decree. Only Local 167, the shochtim union and 14 individuals, members of the one or the other union, have appealed.\n In their brief and oral argument appellants contend: (1) There is no proof that they intended to restrain or did interfere with interstate commerce; (2) if ever concerned in the conspiracy, they voluntarily abandoned it before this suit was commenced, and there is no probability of resumption; (3) there is no credible evidence against Weiner, Rosenman, and Markman; (4) the court erred in striking out as sham the denials of convicted defendants; (5) the decree should be modified by eliminating a paragraph that enjoins them in respect of both interstate and intrastate commerce and by limiting the injunction to interstate commerce.\n The assignment of errors includes more than 250 specifications and occupies more than 35 pages of the record. While it is possible to find among them bases for the five points indicated, they contain so much that is irrelevant that they tend to confuse rather than to define the issues to be presented. They do not appropriately serve the convenience of the appellee or of the court. Phillips, etc., Const. Co. v. Seymour, \n91 U.S. 646\n, 648; Central Vermont Ry. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 508\n, 35 S.Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252; Chesapeake & Del. Canal Co. v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 123, 124\n, 39 S.Ct. 407; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 86 A.L.R. 174. In view of the omission of appellee to object and the lack of precedent definitely in point, we refrain from dismissing the appeal for failure substantially to comply with the statute and our rule in respect of the assignment of errors. 28 U.S.C.  862 (28 USCA  862). Rule 9 (28 USCA  354). But what is here said is to be understood as an announcement that in the future a failure of that sort may be taken as sufficient ground for dismissal. \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 297]\n\u00a0\n Appellants' contention that there is no proof that they intended to restrain or did interfere with interstate Commerce has no merit.\n The evidence shows that they and other defendants conspired to burden the free movement of live poultry into the metropolitan area. It may be assumed that some time after delivery of carload lots by interstate carriers to the receivers the movement of the poultry ceases to be interstate commerce. Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, 39 S.Ct. 268; Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298, 309\n, 44 S.Ct. 544; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm., \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 471 S., 51 S.Ct. 499. But we need not decide when interstate commerce ends and that which is intrastate begins. The control of the handling, the sales and the prices at the place of origin before the interstate journey begins or in the state of destination where the interstate movement ends may operate directly to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce. United States v. Brims, \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, 47 S.Ct. 169; Coronado Co. v. U.M. Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551; United States v. Swift & Co. (C.C.) 122 F. 529, 532, 533. Cf. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S.Ct. 276. The Sherman Act denounces every conspiracy in restraint of trade including those that are to be carried on by acts constituting intrastate transactions. Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters' Ass'n, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 46\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791; Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 301\n, 28 S.Ct. 301, 13 Ann.Cas. 815. The interference by appellants and others with the unloading, the transportation, the sales by marketmen to retailers, the prices charged, and the amount of profits exacted operates substantially and directly to restrain and burden the untrammelled shipment and movement of the poultry while unquestionably it is in interstate commerce.\n Appellants' contention that the proof shows that they abandoned the conspiracy before the commencement of this suit cannot be sustained.\n The conspiracy was not for a temporary purpose but to dominate a great and permanent business. It was \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 298]\n\u00a0\n highly organized and maintained by the levy, collection, and expenditure of enormous sums. In the absence of definite proof to that effect, abandonment will not be presumed. Hyde v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 347, 369\n, 32 S.Ct. 793, Ann.Cas. 1914A, 614; Nyquist v. United States ( C.C.A.) 2 F.(2d) 504, 505. The government introduced substantial evidence which uncontradicted and unexplained tends to show that the conspiracy and appellants' participation continued until the filing of the amended complaint. They were present in court but failed to testify in their own defense. It justly may be inferred that they were unable to show that they had abandoned the conspiracy and did not intend further to participate in it. Under the circumstances of this case their silence rightly is to be deemed strong confirmation of the charges brought against them. Mammoth Oil Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 13, 52\n, 48 S.Ct. 1; U.S. ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 \nU.S. 149\n, 44 S.Ct. 54.\n There was evidence tending to show that Weiner, Rosenman, and Markman were connected with the conspiracy. All were present but none testified. As on cross-examination full disclosure would have been called for, failure to take the witness stand strongly suggests that they could not give an account of their conduct that would be consistent with the denial interposed by answer ortend to repel what had been shown against them. The District Court rightly held them to be parties to the conspiracy.\n The judgment in the criminal case conclusively established in favor of the United States and against those who were found guilty that within the period covered by the indictment the latter were parties to the conspiracy charged. The complaint in this suit includes the allegations on which that prosecution was based. The defendants in this suit who had been there convicted could not require proof of what had been duly adjudged between the parties. And, to the extent that the answers attempted to deny participation of convicted defendants in the conspiracy of which they had been found guilty, \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 299]\n\u00a0\n they are false and sham and the District Court rightly so treated them. Oklahoma v. Texas, \n265 \nU.S. 76\n, 44 S.Ct. 457. Cf. Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 436, 442\n, 6 S.Ct. 437; Stone v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 178, 184\n, 17 S.Ct. 778.\n Appellants seek elimination of the provision of the decree that enjoins them from using any of the offices or positions in Local 167 or the shochtim union 'for the purpose of coercing marketmen to buy poultry, poultry feed, or other commodities necessary to the poultry business from particular sellers thereof.' The United States is entitled to effective relief. To that end the decree should enjoin acts of the sort that are shown by the evidence to have been done or threatened in furtherance of the conspiracy. It should be broad enough to prevent evasion. In framing its provisions doubts should be resolved in favor of the government and against the conspirators. Warner & Co. v. Lilly & Co., \n265 \nU.S. 526, 532\n, 44 S.Ct. 615. The evidence shows that delegates of the unions coerced marketmen to use coops of a company that had or sought to secure a monopoly of such facilities and charged excessive rentals for them. The lack of specific evidence that coercion has been practiced or is threatened in respect of every detail or commodity is no adequate ground for striking out the clause or for limiting it to a mere specification of the coops. Having been shown guilty of coercion in respect of the coops in which poultry is kept and fed, appellants may not complain if the injunction binds generally as to related commodities including feed and the like. When regard is had to the evidence disclosing the numerous purposes of the conspiracy and the acts of coercion customarily employed by defendants, it is plain that the clause referred to cannot be condemned as unnecessary or without warrant.\n And, maintaining that interstate commerce ended with the sales by receivers to marketmen, appellants insist that the injunction should only prevent acts that restrain commerce up to that point. But intrastate acts will be en- \n\n[291 U.S. 293, 300]\n\u00a0\n joined whenever necessary or appropriate for the protection of interstate commerce against any restraint denounced by the act. Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters' Ass'n, ubi supra. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 438\n, 31 S.Ct. 492, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 874.

HUNT(1934)\nNo. 783\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Federic Burnham and David F. Rosenthal, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lloyd A. Faxon and Harry F. Wiggins, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On September 17, 1930, respondent borrowed from petitioner the sum of $ 300, and assecurity for its payment executed an assignment of a portion of his wages thereafter to be earned. On March 3, 1931, respondent filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in a federal District Court in Illinois, including in his schedule of liabilities the foregoing loan, which constituted a provable claim against the estate. Respondent was adjudicated a bankrupt; and, on October 10, 1932, an order was entered discharging him from all provable debts and claims. On October 18, 1932, petitioner brought an action in the municipal court of Chicago against respondent's employer to enforce the assignment in respect of wages earned after the adjudication. Thereupon, respondent commenced this proceeding in the court which had adjudicated his bankruptcy and ordered his discharge, praying that petitioner be enjoined from further prosecuting said action or attempting to enforce its claim therein made against respondent under the wage assignment. The bankruptcy court, upon consideration, entered a decree in accordance with the prayer; and this decree on appeal was affirmed by the court below (In re Hunt (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 998), following its decision in Re Skorcz (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 187.\n Challenging this decree, petitioner contends that the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to entertain \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n a proceeding to enjoin the prosecution of the action in the municipal court; that, assuming such jurisdiction, the rule is that an assignment of future wages constitutes an enforceable lien; but that, in any event, the highest court of the state of Illinois has so decided, and by that decision this court is bound.\n First. The pleading by which respondent invoked the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court in the present case is in substance and effect a supplemental and ancillary bill in equity, in aid of and to effectuate the adjudication and order made by the same court. That a federal court of equity has jurisdiction of a bill ancillary to an original case or proceeding in the same court, whether at law or in equity, to secure or preserve the fruits and advantages of a judgment or decree rendered therein, is well settled. Root v. Woolworth, \n150 U.S. 401\n, 410-412, 14 S. Ct. 136; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 U.S. 93\n, 112-114, 24 S.Ct. 399; Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Manufacturing Co., \n198 U.S. 188\n, 194 et seq., 25 S.Ct. 629; Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450, 460. And this, irrespective of whether the court would have jurisdiction if the proceeding were an original one. The proceeding being ancillary and dependent, the jurisdiction of the court follows that of the original cause, and may be maintained without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount involved, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 265 of the Judicial Code (Rev. St.  720), U.S.C., title 28,  379 (28 USCA  379).1 Julian v. Central Trust Co., supra, 112 of 193 U.S., 24 S.Ct. 399; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, \n103 U.S. 494\n, 497; Root v. Woolworth, supra, 413 of 150 U.S., 14 S.Ct. 136; McDonald v. Seligman (C.C.) 81 F. 753; St. Louis, I.M. & S.R. Co. v. Bellamy (D.C.) 211 F. 172, 175-177; Brun v. Mann (C.C.A.) 151 F. 145, 150, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) 154. \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n These principles apply to proceedings in bankruptcy. In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co. (D.C.) 180 F. 549, 554; Sims v. Jamison (C.C.A.) 67 F.( 2d) 409, 410; Pell v. McCabe (C.C.A.) 256 F. 512, 515, 516; Seaboard Small Loan Corporation v. Ottinger (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 856, 859, 77 A.L.R. 956. Petitioner relies upon a number of decisions where other federal courts sitting in bankruptcy have declined to entertain suits similar in character to the present one, on the ground that the effect of a discharge in bankruptcy is a matter to be determined by any court in which the discharge may be pleaded. See, for example, Hellman v. Goldstone (C.C.A.) 161 F. 913; In re Marshall Paper Co. (C.C.A.) 102 F. 872, 874; In re Weisberg (D.C.) 253 F. 833, 835; In re Havens (C.C.A.) 272 F. 975. To the extent that these cases conflict with the view just expressed they are clearly not in harmony with the general rule in equity announced by this court. And we find nothing, either in the nature of the bankruptcy court or in the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, which necessitates the application of what would amount to a special rule on this subject in respect of bankruptcy proceedings. Courts of bankruptcy are constituted by sections 1 and 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, amended by Act May 27, 1926 (U.S.C., title 11 ,  1 and 11 (11 USCA  1, 11)), and are invested 'with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings,' etc. The words 'at law' were probably inserted to meet clause (4) of section 2, 11 USCA  11(4), which empowers such courts to arraign, try, and punish certain designated persons for violations of the act. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 534-536, 20 S.Ct. 1000. But otherwise courts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, supra, 535 of 178 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 1000; In re Rochford (C.C.A.) 124 F. 182, 187; In re Siegel-Hillman Dry Goods Co. (D.C.) 111 F. 980, 983; Swarts v. Siegel (C.C.A.) 117 F. 13, 16; Dodge v. Norlin (C.C.A.) 133 F. 363, 368, 369; In re Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., supra, at page 553 of 180 F.; In re Lahongrais (C.C.A.) 5 F.( 2d) 899, 901; French v. \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n Long (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 45, 47. And, generally, proceedings in bankruptcy are in the nature of proceedings in rem, adjudications of bankruptcy and orders of discharge being, as this court clearly has treated them, in every essential particular decrees in equity determining a status. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181, 192\n, 22 S.Ct. 857; Commercial Bank of Manchester v. Buckner, 20 How. 108, 118, 119.\n What has now been said establishes the authority of the bankruptcy court to entertain the present proceeding, determine the effect of the adjudication and order, and enjoin petitioner from its threatened interference therewith. It does not follow, however, that the court was bound to exercise its authority. And it probably would not and should not have done so except under unusual circumstances such as here exist. So far as appears, the municipal court was competent to deal with the case. It is true that respondent was not a party to that litigation; but undoubtedly it was open to him to intervene and submit to that court the question as to the effect upon the subject-matter of the action of the bankruptcy decrees. And it may be conceded that the municipal court was authorized in the law action to afford relief the equivalent of that which respondent now seeks in equity. Nevertheless, other considerations aside, it is clear that the legal remedy thus afforded would be inadequate to meet the requirements of justice. As will be shown in a moment, the sole question at issue is one which the highest court of the state of Illinois had already resolved against respondent's contention. The alternative of invoking the equitable jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court was for respondent to pursue an obviously long and expensive course of litigation, beginning with an intervention in a municipal court and followed by successive appeals through the state intermediate and ultimate Courts of Appeal, before reaching a court whose judgment upon the merits of the question had not been predetermined. The \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 242]\n\u00a0\n amount in suit is small, and, as pointed out by Judge Parker in Seaboard Small Loan Corporation v. Ottinger, supra, at page 859, of 50 F.(2d), such a remedy is entirely inadequate because of the wholly disproportionate trouble, embarrassment, expense, and possible loss of employment which it involves.\n Second. Whether an assignment of future earned wages constitutes a lien within the meaning of section 67d of the Bankruptcy Act,2 is a matter upon which the decisions of the state and federal courts are not in complete accord; although by far the larger number of cases and the greater weight of authority are in the negative. We do not stop to review the state decisions. Among those which deny the existence of the lien are Leitch v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 95 Minn. 35, 38, 103 N.W. 704, 5 Ann. Cas. 63; Levi v. Loevenhart & Co., 138 Ky. 133, 136, 127 S.W. 748, 30 L.R. A.(N.S.) 375, 137 Am.St.Rep. 377; Public Finance Co. v. Rowe, 123 Ohio St. 206, 174 N.E. 738, 74 A.L.R. 900; Hupp v. Union Pac. R. Co., 99 Neb. 654, 157 N.W. 343, L.R.A. 1916E, 247. The only state cases definitely to the contrary which have been called to our attention are certain Illinois cases, mentioned later, and Citizens' Loan Ass'n v. Boston & Maine R.R., 196 Mass. 528, 82 N.E. 696, 14 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1025, 124 Am.St.Rep. 584, 13 Ann.Cas. 365. The lower federal courts which have had occasion to consider the question concur in the view that the lien has no existence or is ineffective as against an adjudication and discharge in bankruptcy. Judge Bellinger, in Re West (D.C.) 128 F. 205, 206, sucsinctly stated the ground of his ruling in accordance with that view as follows:\n'The discharge in bankruptcy operated to discharge these obligations as of the date of the adjudication, so that the obligations were discharged before the wages intended \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 243]\n\u00a0\n as security were in existence. The law does not continue an obligation in order that there may be a lien, but only does so because there is one. The effect of the discharge upon the prospective liens was the same as though the debts had been paid before the assigned wages were earned. The wages earned after the adjudication became the property of the bankrupt clear of the claims of all creditors.'\n\n This conclusion finds ample support in the following decisions among others. In re Home Discount Co. (D.C.) 147 F. 538, 547 et seq.; In re Lineberry (D.C.) 183 F. 338; In re Voorhees (D.C.) 41 F.(2d) 81; In re Fellows (D.C.) 43 F.(2d) 122; In re Potts (D.C.) 54 F.(2d) 144, and especially Seaboard Small Loan Corporation v. Ottinger, supra.\n The earning power of an individual is the power to create property; but it is not translated into property within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act until it has brought earnings into existence. An adjudication of bankruptcy, followed by a discharge, releases a debtor from all previously incurred debts, with certain exceptions not pertinent here; and it logically cannot be supposed that the act nevertheless intended to keep such debts alive for the purpose of permitting the creation of an enforceable lien upon a subject not existent when the bankruptcy became effective or even arising from, or connected with, preexisting property, but brought into being solely as the fruit of the subsequent labor of the bankrupt.\n Third. To the foregoing array of authority petitioner opposes the decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois in Mallin v. Wenham, 209 Ill. 252, 70 N.E. 564, 65 L.R.A. 602, 101 Am.St.Rep. 233, and Monarch Discount Co. v. C. & O.R. Co., 285 Ill. 233, 120 N.E. 743. Undoubtedly, these cases hold, as petitioner asserts, that in Illinois an assignment of future wages creates a lien effective from the date of the assignment, which is not invalidated by the assignor's discharge in bankruptcy. The contention is that even if the general rule be otherwise, this court is bound to follow the Illinois \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 244]\n\u00a0\n decisions, since the question of the existence of a lien depends upon Illinois law.\n We find it unnecessary to consider whether this contention would in a different case find support in section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, now section 725, title 28, U.S.C., 28 USCA  725,3 since we are of opinion that it is precluded here by the clear and unmistakable policy of the Bankruptcy Act. It is important to bear in mind that the present case is one not within the jurisdiction of a state court, but is a dependent suit brought to vindicate decrees of a federal court of bankruptcy entered in the exercise of a jurisdiction essentially federal and exclusive in character. And it is that situation to which we address ourselves, and to which our decision is confined.\n One of the primary purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is to 'relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes.' Williams v. U.S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n236 \nU.S. 549, 554\n, 555 S., 35 S.Ct. 289, 290. This purpose of the act has been again and again emphasized by the courts as being of public as well as private interest, in that it gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor who surrenders for distribution the property which he owns at the time of bankruptcy, a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt. Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 617\n, 38 S.Ct. 215; Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra; Swarts v. Fourth National Bank (C.C.A.) 117 F. 1, 3; United States v. Hammond (C.C.A.) 104 F. 862, 863; Barton Bros. v. Texas Produce Co. (C.C.A.) 136 F. 355, 357; Hardie v. Swafford Bros. Dry Goods Co. (C.C.A.) 165 F. 588, 591, 20 L.R.A.( N.S.) 785; Gilbert v. \n\n[292 U.S. 234, 245]\n\u00a0\n Shouse (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 398. The various provisions of the Bankruptcy Act were adopted in the light of that view and are to be construed when reasonably possible in harmony with it so as to effectuate the general purpose and policy of the act. Local rules subversive of that result cannot be accepted as controlling the action of a federal court.\n When a person assigns future wages, he, in effect, pledges his future earning power. The power of the individual to earn a living for himself and those dependent upon him is in the nature of a personal liberty quite as much if not more than it is a property right. To preserve its free exercise is of the utmost importance, not only because it is a fundamental private necessity, but because it is a matter of great public concern. From the viewpoint of the wage-earner there is little difference between not earning at all and earning wholly for a creditor. Pauperism may be the necessary result of either. The amount of the indebtedness, or the proportion of wages assigned, may here be small, but the principle, once established, will equally apply where both are very great. The new opportunity in life and the clear field for future effort, which it is the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act to afford the emancipated debtor, would be of little value to the wage-earner if he were obliged to face the necessity of devoting the whole or a considerable portion of his earnings for an indefinite time in the future to the payment of indebtedness incurred prior to his bankruptcy. Confining our determination to the case in hand, and leaving prospective liens upon other forms of acquisitions to be dealt with as they may arise, we reject the Illinois decisions as to the effect of an assignment of wages earned after bankruptcy as being destructive of the purpose and spirit of the Bankruptcy Act.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon the provisions of this title, and for a present consideration, which have been recorded according to law, if record thereof was necessary in order to impart notice, shall, to the extent of such present consideration only, not be affected by anything herein.'

Ansell, a resident of the District of Columbia, brought in the Supreme Court of \n\n[293 U.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n the District, an action for libel against Huey P. Long of Louisiana. The summons was served on the defendant within the District. It directed him to answer and show cause why the plaintiff should not have judgment for the cause of action stated in his declaration. The defendant, appearing specially, and solely for the purpose, filed on April 25, 1933, a motion to quash the summons and the service thereof on the following ground:\n'The summons was issued on Monday, March 27, 1933 and served on the defendant on Monday, April 3, 1933, whereas the first session of the Seventy-third Congress was convened on the ninth day of March, 1933 and has remained continuously in session since that date, and was in session on the dates of the issuance and service of said summons (of which fact defendant prays the court to take judicial notice) and the defendant as alleged is a United States Senator who was in attendance upon the meetings of the first session of the Seventy-third Congress of the United States and the summons and service thereof is invalid and of no legal effect whatever because in violation of Article I, Section 6, Clause 1, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that Senators and Representatives of the United States 'shall in all cases except treason, felony and breach of the peace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same.\"\n\n On May 9, 1933, the Supreme Court of the District denied the motion, but stayed further proceedings for twenty days pending application to the Court of Appeals of the District for a special appeal. That court allowed the appeal. On February 5, 1934, it affirmed the order denying the motion to qaush. 63 App.D.C. 68, 69 F.(2d) 386. This Court granted certiorari. \n292 \nU.S. 619\n, 54 S.Ct. 774\n\n\n Senator Long contends that article 1,  6, cl. 1 of the Constitution, confers upon every member of Con- \n\n[293 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n gress, while in attendance within the District, immunity in civil cases not only from arrest, but also from service of process. Neither the Senate, nor the House of Representatives, has ever asserted such a claim in behalf of its members. Clause 1 defines the extent of the immunity. Its language is exact and leaves no room for a construction which would extend the privilege beyond the terms of the grant. In Kimberly v. Butler, Fed. Cas. No. 7,777, Mr. Chief Justice Chase, sitting in the Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, held that the privilege was limited to exemption from arrest. Compare Mr. Justice Grier, sitting in the Circuit Court of the District of New Jersey in Nones v. Edsall, 1 Wall.Jr. 189, Fed. Cas. No. 10,290. The courts of the District of Columbia, where the question has been raised from time to time since 1868, have consistently denied the immunity asserted. Merrick v. Giddings, McArthur & M. (11 D.C.) 55, 67; Howard v. Citizens' Bank & Trust Co., 12 App.D.C. 222.1 State cases passing on similar provisions so hold. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n History confirms the conclusion that the immunity is limited to arrest. See opinion of Mr. Justice Wylie in Merrick v. Giddings. The cases cited in support of the contrary view rest largely upon doubtful notions as to the historic privileges of members of Parliament before the enactment in 1770 of the statute of 10 George III, c. 50.3 That act declared that members of Parliament \n\n[293 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n should be subject to civil process, provided that they were not 'arrested or imprisoned.' When the Constitution was adopted, arrests in civil suits were still common in America. \n4\n It is only to such arrests that the provision applies. Williamson v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 425\n, 28 S.Ct. 163.\n The constitutional privilege here asserted must not be confused with the common-law rule that witnesses, suitors, and their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the conduct of one suit, are immune from service in another. That rule of practice is founded upon the needs of the court, not upon the convenience or preference of the individuals concerned. And the immunity conferred by the court is extended or withheld as judicial necessities require. See Lamb v.

McNeill, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. E. Leahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari (290 U.S. --, 54 S.Ct. 209, 78 L.Ed . --) to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. It is a suit in equity brought in the Supreme Court of the District in 1932, by Ruth Loughran, then resident there. The defendants are John Loughran and others, trustees of real estate there located. The estate of Daniel Loughran, Jr., deceased, is a beneficiary. The plaintiff alleges that she is Daniel's widow; and she seeks to enforce as such rights in the nature of dower and to recover unpaid alimony. She alleges that in 1926 she married Daniel in Florida after living there more than two years; that in 1927 she and her said husband established their domicile in Virginia; that in 1929, while they were residing in Virginia, she obtained there a decree of divorce from him a mensa et thoro, with an award of alimony payable monthly; and that in 1931, while she remained Daniel's wife, he died, leaving a part of the alimony unpaid.\n The trustees defend on the ground that, before her marriage to Daniel, the plaintiff had been married to Henry Daye; that in 1924, while she and Daye were domiciled in the District, he had secured there an absolute divorce for her adultery with Daniel; that being the guilty party, she was by section 966 of the Code of the District 1901 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 14,  63) prohibited from remarrying; and that, having married in violation of the statute, she is not in a position to enforce in a court of the District the alleged rights in the estate of the deceased. A copy of the record of the Daye divorce proceeding is annexed to the answer.\n Section 966 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 14,  63) provides:\n'A divorce from the bond of marriage may be granted only where one of the parties has committed adultery during the marriage: Provided, That in such case the \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n innocent party only may remarry, but nothing herein contained shall prevent the remarriage of the divorced parties to each other. ...'\n\n On motion of the plaintiff, the case was heard on bill and answer. The trial court entered a decree for the plaintiff in respect to the claim in the nature of dower. That decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District. It ordered that the cause be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion, 62 App.D.C. 262, 66 F.(2d) 567, 568, saying:\n'It is unnecessary for us to concern ourselves with the legality of the Florida marriage in that state, or with the subsequent divorce proceedings in the state of Virginia, since the disposition of the case is dependent entirely upon the law of the District of Columbia. In so far as the law of the District is concerned, the marriage between plaintiff and Daniel Loughran, Jr., in Florida, if performed in the District of Columbia, would be absolutely void, and the plaintiff, being the offending party against the law of the District, is in no position to enforce any claim against the estate of Daniel Loughran, Jr., growing out of the marriage in Florida.'\n\n Disclaiming consideration of the doctrine of clean hands, the court added:\n'Plaintiff by her own unlawful conduct has placed herself without the pale of the law, and cannot be heard in a court of equity to take advantage of her own wrong.'\n\n The trustees insist that the bill was properly dismissed because the plaintiff, retaining her domicile in the District, went to Florida and married there in order to evade the prohibition of section 966. The plaintiff contends that the admitted facts constitute no defence; that because the marriage was legal in Florida, its legality should, under the established doctrines governing conflict of laws, have been recognized by the courts of the District ; and, more \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n over, that this was required by the full faith and credit clause, since the validity of the Florida marriage had been adjudicated by the Virginia decree of divorce a mensa et thoro.\n First. Marriages not polygamous or incestuous, or otherwise declared void by statute,1 will, if valid by the law of the state where entered into, be recognized as valid in every other jurisdiction. Meister v. Moore, \n96 U.S. 76\n; Travers v. Reinhardt, \n205 \nU.S. 423, 440\n, 27 S.Ct. 563. The mere statutory prohibition by the State of the domicile either generally of the remarriage of a divorced person, or of remarriage within a prescribed period after the entry of the decree, is given only territorial effect. Such a statute does not invalidate a marriage solemnized in another state in conformity with the laws thereof. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Second. We have no occasion to decide what the rights of the parties would be if it appeared that the plaintiff and her paramour, retaining at all times their domicile in the District, had gone to Florida for the purpose of evading section 966 by a marriage there; and had then returned to the District to live as man and wife. \n3\n It is argued that marriage within the District would have been illegal because prohibited by section 966; and that a marriage which would be illegal if entered into within the District must be treated under section 1287 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 14,  5) as void, even if valid under the law of the state in which it was solemnized. But section 1287 \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n has no application to marriages in violation of the prohibition of section 966. Section 1287 provides:\n'If any marriage declared illegal by the aforegoing sections shall be entered into in another jurisdiction by persons having and retaining their domicile in the District of Columbia, such marriage shall be deemed illegal, and may be decreed to be void in said District in the same manner as if it had been celebrated therein.'\n\n The sections preceding section 1287 relate solely to marriages void, because incestuous or polygamous, and to those which are voidable, because entered into by a person who was a lunatic, under the age of consent, or impotent, and those which are voidable because procured by force or fraud. In the case at bar, there is no suggestion of any such obstacle to the validity of the marriage. The only objection urged is that by marrying in Florida the plaintiff violated section 966. But the preceding sections do not refer to section 966; and they contain no reference to remarriage of divorced persons. Their only reference to divorce is in paragraph third of section 1283 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 14,  1) which declares void:\n'The marriage of any persons either of whom has been previously married and whose previous marriage has not been terminated by death or a decree of divorce.'\n\n Since the plaintiff had been legally divorced from Daye in the District while the parties were domiciled there, and the decree became effective under section 983a (D.C. Code 1929, T. 14,  81) unconditionally and irrevocably, she was thereafter an unmarried woman; and, if she had cohabited with Daniel in the District after the Florida marriage, she would not have been guilty of polygamy. Commonwealth v. Lane, 113 Mass. 458, 460, 462, 18 Am.Rep. 509.\n Moreover, it does not appear that the plaintiff and Daniel did retain their domiciles in the District after her divorce, or that after the Florida marriage they ever lived in the District as man and wife. The trustees argue that it must be assumed on the pleadings that plaintiff's resi- \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n dence in Florida and the marriage there were not in good faith. \n4\n But the bill alleged the good faith of the residence and marriage in Florida; and the answer contains no specific denial of that allegation. Nor does it contain any averment that the residence in Florida and marriage there were with the intent of evading the prohibition against remarriage. \n5\n The Court of Appeals did not pass upon the issue sought to be raised. It expressly disclaimed deciding whether the Florida marriage was valid or what the effect of the Virginia decree was. And the question whether the marriage in Florida should be deemed void within the District because the parties went to Florida to evade the prohibition of section 966 was not presented by the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n Third. The Court of Appeals stated that 'the single question for determination here is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to her dower interest'; and it held that the bill should be dismissed, regardless of whether the marriage was valid under the law of Florida. The requisites of dower are a valid marriage; seizin of the husband; and his death. It may be assumed that the law of the situs of real estate determines whether a widow is entitled to dower. Compare De Vaughn v. Hutchinson, \n165 \nU.S. 566, 570\n, 17 S.Ct. 461. But, if the marriage was valid under the laws of Florida, the plaintiff was, under established doctrines of the conflict of laws, Daniel's widow. As such she was entitled, as an incident of the marriage, to dower in the property within the District. For, while a statute of the \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 226]\n\u00a0\n District provides for forfeiture of dower in case of the wife's adultery during marriage,6 none denies dower to a widow because she had been guilty of adultery prior to the marriage with her late husband.\n Section 966 is not extraterritorial in its operation. It does not purport to prohibit remarriage outside the District; and no other statute denies dower to a widow because by remarrying elsewhere she had disregarded the prohibition contained in section 966. It does not make remarriage a crime, or in terms impose any penalty, even if contracted within the District; and obviously it could not make criminal remarriage elsewhere. Nor does it in terms declare the remarriage void. Apparently, it is the law of the District that a remarriage elsewhere in disregard of the prohibition of section 966, even where both parties remained domiciled in the District, is not void ab initio, but, at most, voidable; and that a voidable marriage cannot be annulled after the death of either spouse. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n No case has been found in which, independently of statutory direction, a widow has been denied dower on the ground that a remarriage, legal by the law of the place where celebrated, had been entered into in violation of some prohibition imposed by the law of the state in \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 227]\n\u00a0\n which the divorce was granted and the property was situated. \n8\n Ordinarily the operation of a statute of descent and distribution is held not affected even by the fact that the death of the decedent was caused by a crime of the heir;9 and by the common law dower is not barred even by misconduct during marriage. Since, as matter of substantive law, the plaintiff is entitled to dower in property within the District, if the marriage in Florida was valid, and its validity was assumed by the Court of Appeals, we have no occasion to consider whether the decree in the Virginia divorce proceedings made that matter res judicata.\n Fourth. The relief sought by the bill includes, besides dower rights, a claim under the Virginia decree for the alimony which had accrued and remained unpaid at the time of Daniel's death. The right to recover the alimony is independent of the right to dower. It rests upon a judgment to which, so far as appears, full faith and credit must be given by the courts of the District. It is true that, under rules of law generally applicable, these courts may refuse to enforce a mere right of contract if it provides for doing within the District things prohibited by its laws. Bothwell v. Buckbee Mears Co., \n275 \nU.S. 274, 278\n, 48 S.Ct. 124. It may, in the exercise of the police power, prohibit the enjoyment by persons within its borders of many rights acquired elsewhere and refuse to lend the aid of its courts to enforce them.

But when rights, however arising, have ripened into a judgment of a court of another state, the full faith \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 228]\n\u00a0\n and credit clause (article 4,  1) applies. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 260\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Kenney v.

And courts of the District are bound, equally with courts of the states, to observe the command of the full faith and credit clause, wherever applicable. Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 155\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696. Thus, the facts stated afford no basis in the substantive law for dismissal of the bill so far as it seeks to recover unpaid alimony. Whether the fact that this claim has been presented also in the probate court constitutes a reason for denying relief here was not discussed below, and on this matter we express no opinion.\n Fifth. It remains to consider whether the denial of relief can be justified on some principle of adjective law. The Court of Appeals holds that the 'plaintiff by her own unlawful conduct has placed herself without the pale of the law'; but it does not state specifically the ground for that conclusion. The bar applied is not the plea of illegality commonly interposed in suits brought to enforce contracts tainted by illegality. In those suits the illegality relied on is inherent in the cause of action; is directly connected with the relief sought; and constitutes a substantive defense. Here, the relation of the illegality to the relief sought is indirect and remote. The wrong done is a thing of the past and is collateral. By the long line of cases following Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540\n, 22 S.Ct. 431, it is settled that illegality constitutes no defense when merely collateral to the cause of action sued on. A 'person does not become an out-law and lose all rights by doing an illegal act.' National Bank & Loan Co. v. Petrie, \n189 \nU.S. 423, 425\n, 23 S.Ct. 512, 513. Courts grant relief against present wrongs and to enforce an existing right, although the property involved was acquired by some past illegal act. Brooks v. Martin, 2 Wall. 70, 79, 80; Planters' Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 499, 500. \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 229]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals, while it disclaimed acting on the doctrine of clean hands,10 declared that Olverson v. Olverson, 54 App.D.C. 48, 293 F. 1015, 1016 (decided by it in 1923), is decisive of the case at bar. But both the facts and the relief sought are different in the two cases. In the first place, the parties in the Olverson Case were at the time of the marriage domiciled in the District; remained so when they went to Baltimore for the marriage ceremony with the purpose of evading the prohibition of section 966; returned immediately thereafter to the District; and then lived in the District as man and wife. On the other hand, in the case at bar it does not appear that the plaintiff and Daniel were domiciled in the District at the time of the marriage; or that they went to Florida in order to evade the prohibition of section 966; or that during their marriage they lived in the District; or that they ever cohabited there as man and wife. In the second place, the Olverson suit was brought by a wife for a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro with a motion for alimony; and was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff could not 'ask the courts of this jurisdiction to relieve her of the obligations of a relation which she willfully and wrongfully assumed.'\n The suit at bar was brought after termination of the marriage by death to enforce existing property rights growing out of the marriage in Florida and the decree entered in Virginia. It was not brought to enforce any transaction had within the District; nor was it brought to enforce an illegal contract; or to further an illegal relation. \n11\n Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives. Neither the doctrine of clean \n\n[292 U.S. 216, 230]\n\u00a0\n hands, nor any kindred principle on which courts refuse relief, is applicable here. The decree of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For collection of statutes, see Vernier, American Family Laws,  32, 45, 92.

UNITED STATES(1934)\nNo. 152\nArgued: November 17, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., and Consuelo B. Northrop, of Burlington, Vt., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Will G. Beardslee, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was a private in the army of the United States from July 14, 1917, to April 29, 1919. In September, 1917, he obtained war risk insurance against death or total permanent disability. May 31, 1919, the policy lapsed for nonpayment of premiums. November 30, 1931, he brought this suit in the federal District Court for Vermont, alleging that before May 31, 1919, the policy was matured by his total permanent disability. Issue having been joined, there was trial by jury. At the close of all the evidence respondent requested the court to direct a verdict in its favor. The court denied the motion, and, the jury having found for petitioner, entered judgment in his favor. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 63 F.( 2d) 796.\n Petitioner's claim is that while the policy was in force he became subject to recurring spells of headache, dizziness, epileptic seizures, and other illness constituting total permanent disability. The Circuit Court of Appeals held \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n the evidence not sufficient to show total permanent disability of petitioner while the insurance was in force. The question presented is whether there was any evidence upon which a verdict for petitioner might properly be found. And, for its decision, we assume as established all the facts that the evidence supporting petitioner's claims reasonably tends to prove, and that there should be drawn in his favor all the inferences fairly deducible from such facts. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 94\n, 50 S. Ct. 231.\n Before joining the army petitioner was a laborer and worked cutting logs, building roads, and as a farm and factory hand. When enrolled he was a healthy and strong man of 25 years. He served overseas in a machine gun company. One of his ankles was injured June 16, 1918, and two days later he was taken for treatment to a base hospital where he remained about a month. It was there recorded that while going into a dugout, he had slipped and severely sprained his ankle, that there was no fracture, and that his general condition, heart, lungs, and nervous system were satisfactory. When discharged from the hospital he joined his company and remained with it until mustered out at Camp Devens, Mass., April 29, 1919. The official record shows that upon a careful examination at that time by an army surgeon he was found mentally and physically sound; that he declared he had no reason to believe he was impaired in health or was suffering from the effects of any wound, injury, or disease, and that his company commander had no reason to believe he then had any wound, injury, or disease.\n In 1920, petitioner several times consulted Dr. Frank B. Hunt who certified, December 7, 1920, he found petitioner suffering from rheumatism, chronic bronchitis, and nervousness. At the trial Dr. Hunt testified that petitioner was not when examined totally incapacitated and did not complain of having had epileptic seizures of any \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n kind. It seems that the certificate was intended for use in support of an application to the United States for compensation. \n1\n And, apparently in connection with such an application, petitioner was examined by Dr. Byron Herman of the Public Health Service. Under date of December 10, 1920, Dr. Herman reported that while in the army petitioner was never sick, although in the hospital once for a sprained ankle, that he became ill after getting home, and that he then complained of rheumatism, throat trouble, and husky voice. The doctor's diagnosis was chronic rheumatism and chronic laryngitis, his prognosis was: 'Good.' He reported that petitioner was able to resume his former occupation; that the degree of vocational handicap was negligible; and that vocational training was feasible. January 17, 1921, petitioner verified an application for compensation stating that he was suffering from bronchial troubles, rheumatism, and nervousness which commenced about a year earlier and were caused by gas and exposure in France. And, in March, 1922, claiming to be partially disabled by reason of ailments of the lungs and throat, petitioner made application for compensation and training.\n In April, 1924, and in January, 1925 and 1926, petitioner was examined by Dr. Waldo J. Upton, a specialist in nervous and mental diseases. He represented that he had no injury or illness during his military service and was in good physical condition when discharged, but that a few months later he became nervous, weak, and unable to endure noise. The doctor diagnosed the case as one of mild neurasthenia characterized by weakness, irritability, and \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n quick fatigue under stress. He found petitioner able to work at any occupation involving light labor with reasonable regularity and without danger. He also examined petitioner in 1928, 1929, and 1930. At the first examination petitioner reported that in 1926 and 1927 he had suffered attacks of unconsciousness. The doctor found petitioner suffering from severe neurasthenia and severe hysteria. In 1930 he found petitioner had pronounced psychoneurosis, and that his condition suggested he was developing grand malepilepsy. The doctor's testimony indicates that from 1924 petitioner's condition became progressively worse.\n In 1926, Dr. Herman found petitioner was having grand malepileptiform seizures. He prescribed medicine and sent petitioner to a government hospital where he remained a month. In August, 1927, Dr. James O'Neill examined him. Petitioner said he had not been sick in the army and had sustained no injury except to his ankle and a slight gassing, but that he had been nervous practically from the time he left the army. Within the previous year he had suffered infrequent fits and had not then worked for nine weeks. His ailment was diagnosed as severe hysteria and the doctor was of opinion he could have worked. In March, 1929, Dr. Alan Davidson made a diagnosis of epilepsy. Petitioner then said he had been having uncontrollable nervous attacks which began when he was in the hospital in France.\n Petitioner had no medical treatment between 1920 and 1926. From that time to 1930 he was sent to the hospital seven times and received treatment for periods ranging from two to eight weeks. The government granted petitioner's applications for compensation. Commencing in 1924 he was rated 10 per cent. disabled and paid $9 or $10 a month. Later, increases for disability were found and more compensation was allowed until in August, 1930, his disability was rated at 100 per cent. and he was given \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n $94.50 per month in addition to $10.50 allowed for his child.\n From July, 1919, until the beginning of March, 1929, it appears that petitioner was employed more or less regularly except for periods aggregating about two years for which he does not account. Until January, 1921, he worked in a veneer factory. He was discharged, he testified, because he lost too much time by reason of weakness and dizzy spells. Then he helped on his sister's farm for three or four months. The next definite information as to his employment is that in July, 1922, he commenced as a machinist's helper in the shops of the Central Vermont Railway Company. He worked about two-thirds of full time until May 15, 1923, when he was laid off on account of force reduction. It does not appear what he did from then until February 18, 1924. At that time he was again employed by the Central Vermont, and worked nearly full time as a laborer until May when he quit in order to work in the Boston & Maine Railroad shops. In the following November he was discharged because, as he said, illness caused him to lose too much time. In December, 1924, he was employed for the third time by the Central Vermont. He worked about 85 per cent. of the time until August 23, 1926. Then he went to the hospital for a month, but he did not return until November; he worked nearly full time for the remainder of the year. In 1927, he worked about half time; that is, until the end of June he worked about 85 per cent. of full time, he then went to the hospital for an undisclosed period, and in October and November he worked about 70 per cent. of full time. Then he was out until the end of January, 1928. Thereafter, until he was discharged in March, 1929, he worked about 80 per cent. of full time.\n On each of the three occasions he went to work for the Central Vermont, he made application for employment in which he represented himself to be free from bodily \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n complaints and of a strong constitution. The record contains testimony that throughout the period of this employment petitioner seemed tired and ill, that he was transferred a number of times to lighter work, and that, had he not been a veteran, he would have been discharged.\n The substance of petitioner's testimony, in so far as it adds materially to the facts and evidence above referred to, may be stated briefly:\n June 16, 1918, a shell explosion threw him, injured his ankle, shocked him severely, and caused him to lose consciousness for a time and to suffer spells of dizziness, headaches, weakness, and great perspiration at least once a week during the month he remained in the hospital. Desiring to leave the hospital, he refrained from disclosing his illness to attending physicians or others. After he resumed active service, the spells became worse. He disclosed his condition to the company commander and because of it was assigned to work in the kitchen. He did not get better while in France. After discharge, April 29, 1919, he went to his mother's home in Vermont and rested for some months. The spells continued, grew worse, and sometimes would last a day. After commencing work in July, 1919, he was unsteady and weak, lost much time, and on account of his condition was given lighter work and finally discharged in January, 1921. Early in 1923, he suffered a seizure in which he lost consciousness for about 15 minutes. So for as appears, this was the first seizure in which petitioner fell or became unconscious. Later he suffered such attacks with increasing frequency and intensity.\n At the trial, medical men gave opinion evidence which, when considered in connection with the facts and circumstances rightly to be taken as proved, is sufficient to sustain a finding that petitioner's illness before and after the lapse of the policy resulted from injuries and exposure \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n while in the military service, and that the epileptiform and epileptic fits, such as that suffered March 1, 1923, and later, are not curable.\n The war risk contract unqualifiedly insures against 'total permanent disability.' The occasion, source, or cause of petitioner's illness is therefore immaterial. \n2\n His injuries, exposure, and illness before the lapse of the policy and his condition in subsequent years have significance, if any, only to the extent that they tend to show whether he was in fact totally and permanently disabled during the life of the policy. 3 March 9, 1918, in pursuance of the authorization contained in the War Risk Insurance Act,4 the director of the Bureau ruled (T.D. 20 W.R.): 'Any impairment of mind or body which renders it impossible for the disabled person to follow continuously any substantially gainful occupation shall be deemed ... to be total disability. Total disability shall be deemed to be permanent whenever it is founded upon conditions which render it reasonably certain that it will continue throughout the life of the person suffering from it.'\n The phrase 'total permanent disability' is to be construed reasonably and having regard to the circumstances of each case. As the insurance authorized does not extend to total temporary or partial permanent disability, the \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n tests appropriate for the determination of either need not be ascertained. The various meanings inhering in the phrase make impossible the ascertainment of any fixed rules or formulae uniformly to govern its construction. That which sometimes results in total disability may cause slight inconvenience under other conditions. Some are able to sustain themselves, without serious loss of productive power, against injury or disease sufficient totally to disable others. It cannot be said that injury or disease sufficient merely to prevent one from again doing some work of the kind he had been accustomed to perform constitutes the disability meant by the act, for such impairment may not lessen or affect his ability to follow other useful, and perchance more lucrative, occupations. Frequently serious physical impairment stimulates to successful effort for the acquisition of productive ability that theretofore remained undeveloped.\n The above-quoted administrative decision is not, and manifestly was not intended to be, an exact definition of total permanent disability or the sole guide by which that expression is to be construed. If read literally, every impairment from time to time compelling interruption of gainful occupation for any period, however brief, would be total disability. And, if such impairment were shown reasonably certain not to become less, it would constitute total permanent disability. Persons in sound health occasionally suffer illness requiring them to remain in bed for a time. It is not inaccurate to describe such illness as 'total disability' while it lasts. But, clearly it is not right to say that, if they remain sound but reasonably certain throughout life occasionally to have like periods of temporary illness, they are suffering from 'total permanent disability.' Such a construction would be unreasonable and contrary to the intention of Congress. 'Total disability' does not mean helplessness or com- \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n plete disability, but it includes more than that which is partial. 'Permanent disability' means that which is continuing as opposed to what is temporary. Separate and distinct periods of temporary disability do not constitute that which is permanent. The mere fact that one has done some work after the lapse of his policy is not of itself sufficient to defeat his claim of total permanent disability. He may have worked when really unable and at the risk of endangering his health or life. \n5\n But manifestly work performed may be such as conclusively to negative total permanent disability at the earlier time. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n It requires no discussion to show that the evidence in respect of petitioner's condition during the life of the policy has no substantial tendency to prove total permanent disability at the time of the lapse. The evidence as to his subsequent condition may be considered only for the purpose of determining his condition while the contract was in force. His conduct following the alleged accrual of his claim reflects his own opinion as to whether he was totally and permanently disabled at the time of the lapse. His own statements to medical men, their diagnoses, his repeated applications to the government for compensation, and his failure earlier to assert any claim, show that for a decade he did not believe that he was totally and permanently disabled when he let his policy lapse May 31, 1919. And in the absence of clear and satisfactory evidence explaining, excusing, or justifying it, petitioner's long delay before bringing suit is to be taken \n\n[290 U.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n as strong evidence that he was not totally and permanently disabled before the policy lapsed. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It may be assumed that occasional work for short periods by one generally disabled by impairment of mind or body does not as a matter of law negative total permanent disability. But that is not this case. Petitioner, while claiming to be weak and ill and, contrary to the opinion and diagnoses of examining physicians, that he was really unable to work, did in fact do much work. For long periods amounting in the aggregate to more than five years out of the ten following the lapse of the policy he worked for substantial pay. No witness, lay or expert, testified to matters of fact or expressed opinion tending to support petitioner's claim that he had suffered 'total permanent disability' before his policy lapsed. Unless by construction these words are given a meaning far different from that they are ordinarily used and understood to convey, the evidence must be held not sufficient to support a verdict for petitioner. The trial court should have directed a verdict for the United States. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 93\n, 50 S.Ct. 231; Stevens v.

The Court of Appeals of the state affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, but without opinion (263 N.Y. 533, 189 N.E. 684), and the grounds of its decision are left to conjecture. It may be surmised, from the quotations in its opinion, that the Appellate Division intended to rest its decision upon a determination of the application of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the affirmance by the Court of Appeals went upon the same ground, and not upon the nonfederal ground of the application of the Constitution and laws of the state. But jurisdiction cannot be founded upon surmise. Nor can claim of jurisdiction be sustained by reference to briefs and statements which are not part of the record.\n It is essential to the jurisdiction of this Court in reviewing a decision of a court of a state that it must appear affirmatively from the record, not only that a federal question was presented for decision to the highest court of the state having jurisdiction, but that its decision of the federal question was necessary to the determination of the cause, and that it was actually decided or that the judgment as rendered could not have been given without deciding it.

U.S.(1934)\nNo. 855\nArgued: May 7, 1934Decided: June 4, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rowland W. Fixel and Arthur E. Fixel, both of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner Lynch.\n Mr. Edward H. S. Martin, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner Wilner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which are here on certiorari, present for decision the same question. In each, the plaintiff is the beneficiary under a policy for yearly renewable term insurance1 issued during the World War pursuant to the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n article 4,  400-405 (40 Stat. 409). The actions were brought in April, 1933, in federal District Courts to recover amounts alleged to be due. In each case it is alleged that the insured had, before September 1, 1919, and while the policy was in force, been totally and permanently disabled; that he was entitled to compensation sufficient to pay the premiums on the policy until it matured by death; that no compensation had ever been paid; that the claim for payment was presented by the beneficiary after the death of the insured; that payment was refused; and that thereby the disagreement arose which the law makes a condition precedent to the right to bring suit. In No. 855, which comes here from the Fifth Circuit, the insured died November 27, 924. In No. 861, which comes here from the Seventh Circuit, the insured died May 15, 1929\n\n\n In each case, the United States demurred to the petition on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, because the consent of the United States to be sued had been withdrawn by the Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 8, commonly called the Economy Act (38 USCA  701 et seq.).\n The plaintiffs duly claimed that the act deprived them of property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The District Courts overruled the objection, sustained the demurrers, and dismissed the complaints. Their judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Courts of Appeals. 67 F.(2d) 490; 68 F.(2d) 442. The only question requiring serious consideration relates to the construction and effect to be given to the clause of section 17 of the Economy Act (38 USCA  717) upon which the government relies; for the character and incidents of War Risk Insurance and the applicable rules of constitutional law have been settled by decisions of this Court. The clause in question is:\n'... All laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed. ...' \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n First. War Risk Insurance policies are contracts of the United States. As consideration for the government's obligation, the insured paid prescribed monthly premiums. White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175, 180\n, 46 S.Ct. 274. True, these contracts, unlike others, were not entered into by the United States for a business purpose. The policies granted insurance against death or total disability without medical examination, at net premium rates based on the american Experience Table of Mortality and 3 1\/2 per cent. interest; the United States bearing both the whole expense of administration and the excess mortality and disability cost resulting from the hazards of war. In order to effect a benevolent purpose, heavy burdens were assumed by the Government. \n2\n But the policies, although not entered into for gain, are legal obligations of the same dignity as other contracts of the United States and possess the same legal incidents.\n\n War risk insurance, while resembling in benevolent purpose pensions, compensation allowances, hospital and other privileges accorded to former members of he Army and Navy or their dependents, differs from them funda- \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 577]\n\u00a0\n mentally in legal incidents. Pensions, compensation allowances, and privileges are gratuities. They involve no agreement of parties; and the grant of them creates no vested right. The benefits conferred by gratuities may be redistributed or withdrawn at any time in the discretion of Congress. United States v. Teller, \n107 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 2 S.Ct. 39; Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 15 S.Ct. 586; United States v. Cook, \n257 \nU.S. 523, 527\n, 42 S.Ct. 200. On the other hand, war risk policies, being contracts, are property and create vested rights. The terms of these contracts are to be found in part in the policy, in part in the statutes under which they are issued and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\n In order to promote efficiency in administration and justice in the distribution of war risk insurance benefits, the administration was given power to prescribe the form of policies and to make regulations. The form prescribed provided that the policy should be subject to all amendments to the original act, to all regulations then in force or thereafter adopted. Within certain limits of application, this form was deemed authorized by the act, White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175, 180\n, 46 S.Ct. 274, and, as held in that case, one whose vested rights were not thereby disturbed could not complain of subsequent legislation affecting the terms of the policy. Such legislation has been frequent. \n3\n Moreover, from time to time, privileges granted \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 578]\n\u00a0\n were voluntarily enlarged and new ones were given by the government. 4 But no power to curtail the amount of the benefits which Congress contracted to pay was reserved to Congress; and none could be given by any regulation promulgated by the Administrator. Prior to the Economy Act, no attempt was made to lessen the obligation of the government. \n5\n Then, Congress, by a clause of thirteen words included in a very long section dealing with gratuities, repealed 'all laws granting or pertaining \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 579]\n\u00a0\n to yearly renewable term insurance.' The repeal, if valid, abrogated outstanding contracts and relieved the United States from all liability on the contracts without making compensation to the beneficiaries.\n Second. The Fifth Amendment commands that property be not taken without making just compensation. Valid contracts are property, whether the obligor be a private individual, a municipality, a state, or the United States. Rights against the United States arising out of a contract with it are protected by the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Central Pacific R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 235, 238\n, 6 S.Ct. 1038; United States v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n256 \nU.S. 51, 64\n, 67 S., 41 S.Ct. 439. When the United States enters into contract relations, its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals. \n6\n That the contracts of war risk insurance were valid when made is not questioned. As Congress had the power to authorize the Bureau of War Risk Insurance to issue them, the due process clause prohibits the United States from annulling them, unless, indeed, the action taken falls within the federal police power or some other paramount power. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The Solicitor General does not suggest either in brief or argument that there were supervening conditions \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 580]\n\u00a0\n which authorized Congress to abrogate these contracts in the exercise of the police or any other power. The title of the Act of March 20, 1933, repels any such suggestion. Although popularly known as the Economy Act, it is entitled an 'Act to maintain the credit of the United States.' Punctilious fulfillment of contractual obligations is essential to the maintenance of the credit of public as well as private debtors. No doubt there was in March, 1933, great need of economy. In the administration of all government business economy had become urgent because of lessened revenues and the heavy obligation to be issued in the hope of relieving widespread distress. Congress was free to reduce gratuities deemed excessive. But Congress was without power to reduce expenditures by abrogating contractual obligations of the United States. To abrogate contracts, in the attempt to lessen government expenditure, would be not the practice of economy, but an act of repudiation. 'The United States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a State or a municipality or a citizen.' The Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 719.\n Third. Contracts between individuals or corporations are impaired within the meaning of the Constitution (article 1,  10, cl. 1) whenever the right to enforce them by legal process is taken away or materially lessened. \n8\n A different rule prevails in respect to contracts of sovereigns. Compare Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313\n, 54 S.Ct. 745, 78 L.Ed. --, decided May 21, 1934. 'The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 581]\n\u00a0\n pretensions to compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.' \n9\n The rule that the United States may not be sued without its consent is all-embracing.\n In establishing the system of war risk insurance, Congress vested in its administrative agency broad power in making determinations of essential facts-power similar to that exercised in respect to pensions, compensation, allowances, and other gratuitous privileges provided for veterans and their dependents. But, while the statutes granting gratuities contain no specific provision for suits against the United States,10 Congress, as if to emphasize the contractual obligation assumed by the United States when issuing war risk policies, conferred upon beneficiaries substantially the same legal remedy which beneficiaries enjoy under policies issued by private corporations. The original act (40 Stat. 410) provided in section 405:\n'That in the event of disagreement as to a claim under the contract of insurance between the bureau and any beneficiary or beneficiaries thereunder, an action on the claim may be brought against the United States in the district court of the United States in and for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of them resides.'11\n\n Although consent to sue was thus given when the policy issued, Congress retained power to withdraw the consent at any time. For consent to sue the United States is a privilege accorded, not the grant of a property right protected by the Fifth Amendment. The consent may be withdrawn, although given after much deliberation and for a pecuniary consideration. De Groot v. United States, \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 582]\n\u00a0\n 5 Wall. 419, 432. Compare Darrington v. State Bank of Alabama, 13 How. 12, 17; Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527-529; Gordon v. United States, 7 Wall. 188, 195; Memphis & C. Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, \n101 U.S. 337\n; South & N. A. Railroad Co. v. Alabama, \n101 U.S. 832\n; In re Ayers, \n123 \nU.S. 443, 505\n, 8 S.Ct. 164; Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 10 S.Ct. 504; Baltzer v. North Carolina, \n161 \nU.S. 240\n, 16 S.Ct. 500; Baltzer & Taaks v. North Carolina, \n161 \nU.S. 246\n, 16 S.Ct. 502 12 The sovereign's immunity from suit exists whatever the character of the proceeding or the source of the right sought to be enforced. It applies alike to causes of action arising under acts of Congress, De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 431; United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S.Ct. 464, and to those arising from some violation of rights conferred upon the citizen by the Constitution, Schillinger v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 163, 166\n, 168 S., 15 S.Ct. 85. The character of the cause of action-the fact that it is in contract as distinguished from tort-may be important in determining (as under the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505)) whether consent to sue was given. Otherwise it is of no significance. For immunity from suit is an attribute of sovereignty which may not be bartered away.\n Mere withdrawal of consent to sue on policies for yearly renewable term insurance would not imply repudiation. When the United States creates rights in individuals against itself, it is under no obligation to provide a remedy through the courts. United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S.Ct. 464. It may limit the Individual to administrative remedies. Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 576\n, 46 S.Ct. 425. And withdrawal of all remedy, administrative as well as legal, would not necessarily imply repudiation. So long as the contractual obligation is recognized, Congress may direct its fulfillment without the interposition of either a court or an administrative tribunal. \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 583]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The question requiring decision is, therefore, whether in repealing 'all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance' Congress aimed at the right or merely at the remedy. It seems clear that it intended to take away the right; and that Congress did not intend to preserve the right and merely withdraw consent to sue the United States. \n13\n As Congress took away the contractual right, it had no occasion to provide for withdrawal of the remedy. Moreover, it appears both from the language of the repealing clause and from the context of section 17 that Congress did not aim at the remedy. The clause makes no mention of consent to sue. The consent to sue had been given originally by section 405 of the Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 410) which, like the later substituted sections, applied to all kinds of insurance, making no specific reference to yearly renewable term policies. Obviously, Congress did not intend to repeal generally the section providing for suits. \n14\n For, in March, 1933, most of the policies then outstanding were 'converted' policies, in no way affected by the Economy Act. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n That Congress sought to take away the right of beneficiaries of yearly renewable term policies and not to withdraw their privilege to sue the United States, appears also from an examination of the other provisions of section 17 (38 USCA  717, 718). The section reads:\n'All public laws granting medical or hospital treatment, domiciliary care, compensation and other allowances, pen- \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 584]\n\u00a0\n sion, disability allowance, or retirement pay to veterans and the dependents of veterans of the Spanish-American War, including the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine Insurrection, and the World War, or to former members of the military or naval service for injury or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the military or naval service (except so far as they relate to persons who served prior to the Spanish-American War and to the dependents of such persons, and the retirement of officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) are hereby repealed, and all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed, but payments in accordance with such laws shall continue to the last day of the third calendar month following the month during which this chapter is enacted.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 571, 585]\n\u00a0\n That section deals principally with the many grants of gratuities to veterans and dependents of veterans. Congress apparently assumed that there was no difference between the legal status of these gratuities and the outstanding contracts for yearly renewable term insurance. It used in respect to both classes of benevolences the substantially same phrase. It repealed 'all public laws' relating to the several categories of gratuities; and it repealed 'all laws granting or pertaining to' such insurance. No right to sue the United States on any of these gratuities had been granted in the several statutes conferring them; and the right to the gratuity might be withdrawn at any time. The dominant intention was obviously to abolish rights, not remedies.\n\n That Congress intended to take away the right under outstanding yearly renewable term policies, and was not concerned with the consent to sue the United States thereon, appears also from the saving clauses in section 17 (38 USCA  717). These provide that 'all allowed claims under the above referred to laws' are to be reviewed and the benefits are to be paid 'where a person is found entitled under this chapter;' and that 'nothing contained in this section shall interfere with payments ... to be made under contrac  of yearly renewable term insurance ... under which payments have been commenced, or on any judgment heretofore rendered in a court of competent jurisdiction in any suit on a contract of yearly renewable term insurance, or which may hereafter be rendered in any such suit now pending.' \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 586]\n\u00a0\n That is, the rights under certain yearly renewable term policies are excepted from the general repealing clause. \n 17\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. There is a suggestion that although, in repealing all laws 'granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance,' Congress intended to take away the contractual right, it also intended to take away the remedy; that, since it had power to take away the remedy, the statute should be given effect to that extent, even if void in so far as it purported to take away the contractual right. The suggestion is at war with settled rules of construction. It is true that a statute bad in part is not necessarily void in its entirety. A provision within the legislative power may be allowed to stand if it is separable from the bad. But no provision, however unobjectionable in itself, can stand unless it appears both that, standing alone, the provision can be given legal effect and that the Legislature intended the unobjectionable provision to stand in case other provisions held bad should fall. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 288\n, 290 S., 44 S.Ct. 323. Here both those essentials are absent. There is no separate provision in section 17 dealing with the remedy; and it does not appear that Congress wished to deny the remedy if the repeal of the contractual right was held void under the Fifth Amendment.\n War risk insurance and the war gratuities were enjoyed, in the main, by the same classes of persons, and were administered by the same governmental agency. In respect of both, Congress had theretofore expressed its benevolent purpose perhaps more generously than would have been warranted in 1933 by the financial condition of the Nation. When it became advisable to reduce the nation's existing expenditures, the two classes of benevolences were associated in the minds of the legislators; and it was natural that they should have wished to sub- \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 587]\n\u00a0\n ject both to the same treatment. But it is not to be assumed that Congress would have resorted to the device of withdrawing the legal remedy from beneficiaries of outstanding yearly renewable term policies if it had realized that these had contractual rights. It is at least as probable that Congress overlooked the fundamental difference in legal incidents between the two classes of benevolences dealt with in section 17 as that it wished to evade payment of the nation's legal obligations.\n Sixth. The judgments below appear to have been based, in the main, not on section 17 of the Economy Act, but on section 5 (38 USCA  705), which provides:\n'All decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under the provisions of this chapter, or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law and fact, and no other official or court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision.'\n\n This section, as the Solicitor General concedes, does not relate to war risk insurance. It concerns only grants to veterans and their dependents-to pensions, compensation allowances, and special privileges all of which are gratuities. The purpose of the section appears to have been to remove the possibility of judicial relief in that class of cases even under the special circumstances suggested in Crouch v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 180\n, 45 S.Ct. 71; Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221\n, 45 S.Ct. 69; United States v. Williams, \n278 \nU.S. 255\n, 49 S.Ct. 97; Smith v. United States (C.C.A.) 57 F(2d) 998. Compare Meadows v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 271\n, 50 S.Ct. 279, 73 A.L.R. 310.\n Seventh. The Solicitor General oncedes that in No. 861 no question is presented except that of jurisdiction dependent upon the construction of the clause in section 17 of the Economy Act discussed above. He contends in No. 855 that, if jurisdiction is entertained, the demurrer \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 588]\n\u00a0\n should be sustained on the ground that the complaint fails to set forth a good cause of action, since it fails to show that the suit was brought within the period allowed by law. This alleged defect was not pleaded or brought to the attention of either of the courts below. Nor was it brought by the Solicitor General to the attention of this Court when opposing the petition for a writ of certiorari. We do not pass upon that question, which, like others relating to the merits, will be open for consideration by the lower courts upon the remand.\n Eighth. Mention should be made of legislation by Congress enacted since the commencement of these suits.\n\n 1. \nAct of June 16, 1933, c. 101,  20, 48 Stat. 309 (38 USCA  722), provides:\n'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 17, title I, Public Numbered 2, Seventy-third Congress (section 717 of this chapter), any claim for yearly renewable term insurance on which premiums were paid to the date of death of the insured ... under the provisions of laws repealed by said section 17 (section 717 of this chapter), wherein claim was duly filed prior to March 20, 1933, may be adjudicated by the Veterans' Administration on the proofs and evidence received by the Veterans' Administration prior to March 20, 1933, and any person found entitled to the benefits claimed shall be paid such benefits in accordance with and in the amounts provided by such prior laws. ...'\n\n\n 2. \nSection 35 of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1935, passed on March 27, 28, 1934 (38 USCA  511a), over the President's veto, provides:\n'That notwithstanding the provisions of section 17 of title I of an Act entitled 'An Act to maintain the credit of the United States Government', approved March 20, 1933, and section 20 of an Act entitled 'An Act making appropriations for the Executive Office ...', approved June 16, 1933, any claim for yearly renewable term insurance under the provisions of laws repealed by said section 17, wherein claim was duly filed prior to \n\n[292 U.S. 571, 589]\n\u00a0\n March 20, 1933, and on which maturity of the insurance contract had been determined by the Veterans' Administration prior to March 20, 1933, and where payments could not be made because of the provisions of the Act of March 20, 1933, or under the provisions of the Act of June 16, 1933, may be adjudicated by the Veterans' Administration, and any person found entitled to yearly renewable term insurance benefits claimed shall be paid such benefits in accordance with and in the amounts provided by such prior laws.'18\n\n The provision in the Act of June 16, 1933, which was enacted before the entry of judgments by the district courts, does not appear to have been considered by the lower courts. The provision in the Act of March 27- 28, 1934, was enacted after the filing in this Court of the petitions for certiorari but before the writs were granted. As neither of these Acts was referred to by the Solicitor General or by counsel for the petitioners, we assume that there is nothing in them or in any action taken thereunder, which should affected the disposition of the cases now before us. Any such matter also will be open for consideration by the lower courts upon the remand.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 404 provides: 'That during the period of war and thereafter until converted the insurance shall be term insurance for successive terms of one year each. Not later than five years after the date of the termination of the war as declared by proclamation of the President of the United States, the term insurance shall be converted, without medical examination, into such form or forms of insurance as may be prescribed by regulations and as the insured may request. Regulations shall provide for the right to convert into ordinary life, twenty payment life, endowment maturing at age sixty-two and into other usual forms of insurance. ...' ( 40 Stat. 410). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The disbursements to June 33, 1933, for term and automatic insurance (the latter provided for those who were permanently and totally disabled or who died within 120 days after entrance into the service and before making application for term insurance) exceeded the premium receipts by $4,166,939,057. Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, Report for Year 1933, p. 28. The annual cost of administration was estimated at $1, 744,038.56. Report of United States Veterans' Bureau for 1922, p. 465. War risk insurance was devised in the hope that it would, in large measure, avoid the necessity of granting pensions. Term insurance was issued at a very low premium rate. Over 4,684,000 persons applied before the Armistice to the amount of about $40,000,000,000 for war risk term insurance; but over 75 per cent. of the men who carried term insurance while in the service never paid a premium after the war.

IRVING TRUST CO.(1934)\nNo. 505\nArgued: December 10, 1933Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 320, 321]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Mitchell and Charles Dickerman Williams, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 320, 326]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 320, 328]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the question whether a landlord may prove in bankruptcy for loss of rents payable in the future, where the claim is founded upon the bankrupt's covenant to pay rent, and, in the alternative, upon his breach of a covenant that, in event of bankruptcy, the landlord may re-enter, and, if he does, the tenant will indemnify him against loss of rents for the remainder of the term.\n In No. 505 it appears that Oliver A. Olson Co., Inc., was the lessee of premises for a term of nine years and eight months beginning February 1, 1928, and expiring October 1, 1937. Defaults in payment of rent due February and March, 1932, were followed by an involuntary proceeding in which the company was, on March 18, 1932, adjudicated a bankrupt. The total rent reserved for the portion of the term subsequent to bankruptcy was $58,000, and, as the claimant asserted, the present rental value of the leased premises for the remainder of the term was $33,000. The lessor filed its claim, one item being damages for loss of future rentals, which it asked to have liquidated at $25,000, the difference between the rent reserved and the present rental value.\n The lease contained a covenant that, if the tenant should default in the payment of rent, or abandon the premises, or if they should become vacant, the tenant become insolvent, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if bankruptcy proceedings should be instituted by or against the tenant, the landlord might without notice re-enter the premises; and, after obtaining possession, relet as agent for the tenant, for the whole or any part of the term, and from time to time, and:\n'The Tenant further agrees to pay each month to the Landlord the deficit accruing from the difference between the amount to be paid as rent as herein reserved and the \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 329]\n\u00a0\n amount of rent which shall be collected and received from the demised premises for such month during the residue of the term herein provided for after the taking possession by the Landlord; the overplus, if any, at the expiration of the full term herein provided for shall be paid to the Tenant unless the Landlord within a period of six months from the termination of this lease as provided herein shall, by a notice in writing, release the Tenant from any and all liability created by this provision of the lease, which it is agreed the Landlord shall, at the Landlord's option, have the right to do, in which event it is agreed that the Landlord and the Tenant shall have no further rights and liabilities hereunder.'\n\n The referee expunged so much of the claim as sought damages for loss of future rents, holding that it did not constitute a provable debt. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals were of the same opinion. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In No. 506 premises owned by the petitioners were held by the bankrupt under a lease dated June 14, 1920, for a term to expire June 30, 1945. There was a covenant that, on default by the lessee, or if it should be adjudicated a bankrupt, the lessor might enter and repossess the premises, '... and upon entry as aforesaid this lease shall determine, and the Lessee covenants that in case of such termination it will indemnify the Lessor against all loss of rent which the Lessor may incur by reason of such termination, during the residue of the term above specified.'\n A voluntary petition was filed and an adjudication entered August 29, 1932. November 23, 1932, the trustee disaffirmed the lease, and three days later the lessors took possession and proceeded to collect rents from the occupants of the demised premises; and January 13, 1933, \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 330]\n\u00a0\n they filed a proof of claim which as amended included an item of $4,404.40, representing the difference between the rent accrued to the date of re- entry and the collections from occupants during that period, and an item of $14o,615.80, representing the difference between the alleged rental value for the remainder of the term after re-entry and the rent reserved in the lease. Petitioners made application for liquidation of their claim under section 63b of the Bankruptcy Act 11 USCA  103(b). The trustee moved to have the claim expunged and disallowed. The referee disallowed both items, and his action was affirmed by the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The controversy hinges upon the interpretation of the following sections of the Bankruptcy Act:\n'Sec. 63. Debts which may be proved. (a) Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that date or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest; ... (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or implied. ...\n\n'(b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved and allowed against the estate.'3\n\n'Section 1. (11) 'Debt' shall include any debt, demand, or claim provable in bankruptcy.'4\n\n'Sec. 17. A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts. ...'5 \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 331]\n\u00a0\n A majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals felt bound to follow its earlier decision In re Roth & Appel, 181 F. 667, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 270, which denied a landlord's right to prove a claim for future rents arising under a similar lease. The view there expressed was that the occupation of the land is the consideration for the rent, and, if the right to occupy terminates, the obligation to pay ceases; and the covenant to pay rent creates no debt until the time stipulated for payment arrives. Since many events may occur which will absolve the tenant from further obligation for rent, the claim is said to be too contingent, both because of the uncertainty at the date of adjudication that the lessor will re-enter, and the doubt as to his suffering loss of rent if he should re-enter.\n\n In the present case, one of the judges of the Court of Appeals held that Maynard v. Elliott, \n283 \nU.S. 273\n, 51 S.Ct. 390, has settled the provability of claims contingent in the sense that no sum is presently payable, thus destroying the principal ground of decision in Re Roth & Appel, and that the estimation of the present worth of payments to be made in the future is no obstacle to the proof of a claim based upon an anticipatory breach. Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Association, \n240 \nU.S. 581\n, 36 S.Ct. 412.\n The petitioners say the provability of claims for future rent is a subject on which the lower federal courts have been in disagreement. They argue that a claim for rent is founded upon a lease which is an express contract within the words of section 63a(4), 11 USCA  103(a)(4). They rely upon the purpose of the Bankruptcy Law to bring in all contract creditors and to discharge all debts of the bankrupt, so that he may start afresh unembarrassed by old indebtedness, and point to the hardship to an individual bankrupt of not discharging claims for rent which might well prevent his financial rehabilitation, and the unfairness to the landlord of a corporate bankrupt who, under the decision below, cannot prove upon his lease along with other cred- \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 332]\n\u00a0\n itors, but must look solely for redress for loss of future rents to a corporate debtor whom bankruptcy has stripped of all assets.\n The respondent asserts a substantial difference between rent and other kinds of indebtedness, and presents equitable considerations thought to weigh in its favor, but especially stresses the legislative history of the bankruptcy laws passed by Congress, and insists that the preponderant construction of them by the courts excludes claims for future rents from the class of provable debts.\n The issue is not one of power, for plainly Congress may permit such claims or exclude them. The sole inquiry is the intent of the act. The construction for which the petitioners contend is, as a matter of logic, an admissible one. But that construction is contrary to the great weight of authority as to the effect of similar provisions in earlier acts, and section 63 of the present act.\n In England such claims were not provable under the Act of 7 Geo. I, c. 31; Mayor v. Steward, 4 Burr. 2439; and a discharge could not be pleaded in defense of an action for rent accruing subsequent to bankruptcy. Boot v. Wilson, 8 East, 311. The landlord's claim for loss of future rent was made provable by the Act of 32 and 33 Vict., c. 71,  23 (1869), and more explicit provisions to the same effect were embodied in that of 46 and 47 Vict., ch. 52,  37 and 55 (1883).\n The act of Congress, approved April 4, 1800,6 permitted proof of a limited class of contingent claims, but did not mention rents. Apparently the latter were not considered provable debts under that statute. Hendricks v. \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 333]\n\u00a0\n Judah, 2 Caines (N.Y.) 25, 2 Am.Dec. 213; Lansing v. Prendergast, 9 Johns.( N.Y.) 127.\n The Act of August 19, 1841,  5, 5 Stat. 440, 444, expressly allowed proof of contingent claims,7 specifying certain classes and adding a general description of contingent debts, but said nothing about rent. The courts held that the latter was not a provable debt within this section, because neither a present debt nor a contingent claim susceptible of liquidation. Bosler v. Kuhn, 8 Watts & S.(Pa.) 183; Stinements v. Ainslie, 4 Denio (N.Y.) 573; Savory v. Stocking, 4 Cush. (Mass.) 607.\n The Act of March 2, 1867,  19, 14 Stat. 517, 525, authorized the proof and liquidation of contingent claims and also proof of a claim for a proportionate part of any rent up to the date of bankruptcy. \n8\n The courts uniformly \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 334]\n\u00a0\n held that claims for future rent or for damages for breach of covenant to pay rent were not provable under the act, though differing as to the reason; some holding them not contingent claims within the statutory definition, and others thinking the express permission of proof for rent past due at the date of bankruptcy impliedly excluded claims for rents thereafter falling due.

No. 9, 325; In re Hufnagel, Fed. Cas. No. 6,837; Bailey v. Loeb, Fed. Cas. No. 739.\n In the year 1880, Circuit Judge John Lowell, of Massachusetts, at the suggestion of several mercantile associations, drafted a proposed bankruptcy law, which, after revision, was introduced in Congress, but failed of passage. It contained a section (60) which allowed proof of damages suffered by a landlord by reason of the trustee's rejection of a lease, and another (61) permitting any creditor to compel the trustee to elect to accept or decline any lease, and upon declination the landlord was to have 'any damages he shall suffer thereby assessed, as the court shall direct, and prove the amount as a debt in the bankruptcy.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n After much agitation by trade associations and commercial bodies, and after prolonged consideration (see Schall v. Camors, \n251 \nU.S. 239, 250\n, 40 S.Ct. 135), Congress adopted the act now in force, that of July 1, 1898. 10 The committee reports do not disclose the origin of the phraseology of section 63 (11 USCA  103), nor discuss the classes of claims intended to be included. But it is clear that Congress was familiar with analogous sections of the earlier acts and the court decisions interpreting them, and with the test of the\n___ 9 The bill in full appears in the Congressional Record, vol. 14, pp. 43-48.\n 10 30 Stat. 544, c. 541. \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 335]\n\u00a0\n Lowell Bill and the English act then in force. In view of the extended consideration and discussion which preceded the passage of the act, the failure to include a provision for claims for loss of rent or for damages consequent on the abrogation of leases is significant of an intent not to depart from the precedents disallowing them. Schall v. Camors, supra, pages 250, 251 of 251 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 135.\n Soon after the passage of the act several federal courts were called upon to decide the question, and they uniformly held such claims were not provable debts under section 63.

Since 1900 the Circuit Courts of Appeals in six circuits, and the District Courts in another, have agreed with these early adjudications. Slocum v. Soliday, (C.C.A. 1) 183 F. 410; McDonnell v. Woods, 298 F. 434 (C.C.A. 1); In re Roth & Appel, supra; In re Mullings Clothing Co. (C.C.A.2) 238 F. 58, L.R.A. 1918A, 539; In re Metropolitan Chain Stores Inc., 66 F.(2d) 482 (C.

The decisions in the Third Circuit turn upon a special form of lease drawn to take advantage of a local statutory provision, and, while establishing a rule differing from that elsewhere recognized, are not inconsistent with it. See Wilson v. Pennsylvania Trust Co., 114 F. 742; South Side Trust Co. v. Watson, 200 F. 50; In re H. M. Lasker Co., 251 F. 53; Rosenblum v. Uber, 256 F. 584. The Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit has not discussed the question at length, but at least one of its decisions supports the view that a claim for loss of future rentals may be proved. In re Chakos, 24 F.(2d) \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 336]\n\u00a0\n 482; compare In re Desnoyers Shoe Co., 227 F. 401; In re National Credit Clothing Co., 66 F.(2d) 371.\n This court has never had occasion to pass upon the precise point. It has not, however, expressed disapproval of the rulings of the great majority of the lower federal courts, and has cited many of their decisions with apparent approbation. See Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Association, \n240 \nU.S. 581, 589\n, 590 S., 36 S.Ct. 412; Wm. Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597\n, 38 S.Ct. 211; Gardiner v.

From 1898 to 1932 the Bankruptcy Act was amended seven times11 without alteration of the section. This is persuasive that the construction adopted by the courts has been acceptable to the legislative arm of the government. B. & O. Railroad Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 372\n, 13 S.Ct. 914.\n In this situation 'only compelling language in the statute itself would warrant the rejection of a construction so long and so generally accepted.'

If the rule is to be changed, Congress should so declare.\n The petitioners call attention to the last clause of section 74(a), which is one of the sections added to the Act in 1933:12 'A claim for future rent shall constitute a \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 337]\n\u00a0\n provable debt and shall be liquidated under section 63b (section 103(b)) of this title.' Sections 73 to 76, inclusive, were enacted to permit extensions and compositions not theretofore possible. They apply only to individuals. It is highly unlikely that, if the quoted sentence had been intended as an amendment of section 63a, it would have been placed in context dealing only with the novel procedure authorized by the new sections. Moreover, the discussion on the floor of the Senate relative to the insertion of the sentence, indicates that it was not intended to alter section 63a as it then stood. \n13\n The petitioners insist the clause is declaratory of the law, as understood by the Congress; but there is no evidence to support this view, and it is inconsistent with the long- standing contrary judicial construction.\n It remains to consider the effect of the indemnity covenants in the leases. These do not provide for liquidation of damages (compare Wm. Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed, supra), nor indeed for any right to damages for breach of the covenant to pay rent.\n In No. 505, the agreement is, in the event of re-entry and reletting by the landlord, to pay each month the deficit accruing from the difference between the amount to be paid as rent under the lease and the amount received by the landlord from the premises throughout the residue of the original term; and, further, that the overplus, if any, at the expiration of the term, shall be paid to the tenant, unless the landlord, within six months from re-entry, release the tenant from all liability under the covenant, which the landlord is authorized to do, thus terminating all rights and liabilities under the agreement of lease.\n In No. 506, the stipulation is that upon bankruptcy the landlord may re-enter and thereby terminate the lease, and \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 338]\n\u00a0\n the lessee covenants that, in such case, 'it will indemnify the Lessor against all loss of rent which the Lessor may incur by reason of such termination, during the residue of the term. ...'\n In both cases the lessor has the choice whether he will terminate the lease. Neither the bankrupt nor the trustee has any such option, except as the trustee may be entitled by law to disclaim. And upon the exercise of the option by the landlord, a new contract, distinct from that involved in the original letting, becomes operative. While there is some color for the claim that bankruptcy is an anticipatory breach of the lease contract, entailing a damage claim against the estate, this cannot be true as respects these independent covenants of indemnity. For here, the landlord does not rely upon the destruction of his contract by the bankruptcy; he initiates a new contract of indemnity by the affirmative step of re-entry. And this new contract comes into being not by virtue of the bankruptcy proceeding, but by force of the act of re-entry, which must occur at a date subsequent to the filing of the petition. Obviously this contract of indemnity is not breached by bankruptcy, and cannot be breached until the duty of indemnifying the landlord arises. That obligation cannot be complete until the expiration of the original term. There can be no debt provable in bankruptcy arising out of a contract which becomes effective only at the claimant's option and after the inception of the proceedings, the fulfillment of which is contingent on what may happen from month to month or up to the end of the original term. Compare In re Ells, supra; Slocum v. Soliday, supra; In re Roth & Appel, supra. Such a covenant is not, as petitioners contend, the equivalent of an agreement that bankruptcy shall be a breach of the lease and the consequent damages to the lessor be measured by the difference between the present value of the remainder \n\n[291 U.S. 320, 339]\n\u00a0\n of the term and the total rent to fall due in the future. The covenants appearing in the leases in question cannot be made the basis of a proof of debt against the estate.\n The judgments are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n292 \nU.S. 607\n, 54 S.Ct. 771, 78 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 66 F.(2d) 470.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Brown v.

KALT-ZIMMERS(1934)\nNo. 148\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leon E. Kaumheimer, George A. Affeldt, and George D. Van Dyke, all of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioners. \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Irving A. Fish, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondents.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In bankruptcy proceedings pending in Wisconsin, the petitioners, two Milwaukee banks, prayed an order of the court for permission to sell collateral securities pledged by the bankrupt. The subject of the pledge was bonds payable to bearer, secured by a deed of trust. The District Court refused the relief (6 F.Supp. 638), and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 70 F.(2d) 815. Two questions are in the case: First, whether the bonds are negotiable in form; and, second, whether the petitioners are holders in good faith. We granted certiorari.\n On October 9, 1929, Kalt-Zimmers Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, Wis., made its deed of trust to Hackett, Hoff & Thiermann, Incorporated, trustee, to secure bonds of the total amount of $115,000. The bonds are payable to bearer. They are stated to be secured by a deed of trust to the above-named trustee, 'to which deed of trust reference is hereby made with the same effect as though recited at length herein, for the description of the property mortgaged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of the holders of the bonds, and the terms and conditions upon which the said bonds are issued, held and secured, and may, before their fixed maturities, be declared at once due and payable, and the manner of prepayment before maturity.' They are to pass by delivery, but they are not to be valid for any purpose or be secured by the deed of trust until certified by the trustee to be bonds covered by the mortgage.\n The deed of trust thus referred to states the duty of the trustee in the disposition of the bonds and the application of the proceeds. The directions are precise and full. As soon as practicable after certifying the bonds the trustee is to negotiate and sell them. The proceeds are to be used, first, for the discharge of an underlying mortgage of $35,000 on real estate in Milwaukee belonging to the mort- \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n gagor; second, to pay the cost of a building then about to be constructed; 'the balance,' if any, 'to be at the disposal of the party of the first part,' the maker of the deed. 'The trustee, or any of its officers, agents or stockholders may acquire, own and deal in said bonds and coupons with the same rights as if not trustee hereunder and shall not be obliged to account to any one for any profits made thereby.'\n Hackett, Hoff & Thiermann, the trustee, did not dispose of the bonds in controversy in accordance with the deed of trust. Instead it pledged them with the petitioners ($6,000 of bonds with the Marine Bank and $8,500 with the West Side Bank) as security for its own indebtedness, receiving back in some instances additional loans and in other instances securities of equal value previously pledged. On June 8, 1931, the trustee was adjudicated a bankrupt, whereupon the banks petitioned for authority to sell the bonds in their possession. The courts below have ruled that upon the face of the bonds the bankrupt held them not in its own right, but as trustee for the mortgagor or others, and that by reason of this disclosure the pledgees had been put upon inquiry and were chargeable with constructive notice of the provisions of the trust. All the transactions took place in Wisconsin, where the law of negotiable instruments is governed by statute. Wis. St. 1929,  116.01 et seq.\n First. Under the Wisconsin statute, as construed by the highest court of that state, the bonds are negotiable.\n Section 116.02, Wis. St. 1929, provides as follows:\n'An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements:\n\n'(1) It must be in writing and signed by the maker or drawer.\n\n'(2) Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money. \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n '(3) Must be payable on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time.\n\n'(4) Must be payable to order or to bearer.\n\n'(5) Where the instrument is addressed to a drawee, he must be named or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainty.'1\n\n The bonds in controversy are payable to bearer. They are obviously negotiable, unless the reference, already quoted, to the terms of the deed of trust makes the promise of payment conditional. An identical provision was considered by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Pollard v. Tobin, 211 Wis. 405, 247 N.W. 453, 456. The ruling of the court was that negotiability was not impaired. Cf. Enoch v. Brandon, 249 N.Y. 263, 164 N. E. 45; Siebenhauer v. Bank of California Nat. Asso., 211 Cal. 239, 294 P. 1062; Pflueger v. Broadway Trust & Savings Bank, 351 Ill. 170, 184 N.E. 318; Paepcke v. Paine, 253 Mich. 636, 235 N.W. 871, 75 A.L.R. 1205; Merchants' National Bank v. Detroit Trust Co., 258 Mich. 526, 242 N.W. 739, 85 A.L.R. 350; Bank of California v. National City Co., 138 Wash. 517, 244 P. 690. This construction of a Wisconsin statute is binding upon the national courts, though the statute upon have been intended to be declaratory of the rule a common law. Burns Mortgage Co. v. Fried, \n292 \nU.S. 487\n, 54 S.Ct. 813, 92 A.L.R. 1193\n\n\n Second. The bonds being negotiable, the petitioners under the Wisconsin law have the privileges accorded to holders in good faith.\n Section 116.61, Wis. St. 1929, provides as follows:\n'Actual knowledge of infirmity necessary to notice. To constitute notice of an infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating the same, the person to whom it is negotiated must have had actual \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the infirmity or defect, or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith.'\n\n The effect of this section was considered in Pollard v. Tobin, supra. There the same bankrupt, Hackett, Hoff & Thiermann, Incorporated, was trustee under another deed of trust, made by one Tobin. The bonds had the same provisions contained in the bonds in suit. There, as here, the bankruptcy pledged the bonds with a bank as security for loans. The court held that the bank was a holder in due course. It was a holder for value, for it had given up other collateral upon the pledge of the new security ( citing American Savings Bank & Trust Co. v. Helgesen, 64 Wash. 54, 116 P. 837, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 390). It was a holder in good faith, for there was 'no evidence of actual knowledge on the part of the bank of any infirmity in the bonds or any defect in the Hackett Corporation's title to them' ( citing section 116.61, Negotiable Instruments Law of Wisconsin).\n We interpret that decision as a ruling that under the Wisconsin statute notice of facts tending to put a cautious buyer upon inquiry will not defeat the title of a holder of negotiable paper, if in truth, there was neither actual knowledge of an infirmity nor conscious joinder in a fraud. Cf. Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110, 121; Swift v. Smith, \n102 U.S. 442\n, 444; Crittenden v. Widrevitz (C.C.A.) 272 F. 871, 873; Cheever v. Pittsburgh, S. & L.E.R. Co., 150 N.Y. 59, 65, 66, 44 N.E. 701, 34 L.R.A. 69, 55 Am.St.Rep. 646; Nickey Bros., Inc., v. Lonsdale Mfg. Co., 149 Tenn. 1, 257 S.W. 403, 31 A.L.R. 1383.2 As applied to the case at hand, the reasoning, it seems, is this: A trustee under a mortgage may or may not be a trustee of bonds payable to bearer, accompanying the mortgage. The existence of the one trust does not lead as a necessary inference to the \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n existence of the other. If title or possession as a fiduciary is not apparent from the bonds themselves or is not otherwise made known, there is no duty resting upon the buyer to examine the deed of trust, or explore other avenues of inquiry, to discover the concealed relation. We are not required for present purposes to approve this doctrine or disapprove it. Enough that we accept it as the law of the Wisconsin court. Whether the same result will follow if a pledgee, making a loan upon bonds for the private use of the pledgor, is aware that a trust has been attached to what is taken as security, we do not now consider. There are decisions at common law that acceptance of a pledge upon such terms amounts to bad faith or to evidence thereof, or even to actual knowledge of an infirmity of title. Cf. Duncan v. Jaudon, 15 Wall. 165; Manhattan Bank v. Walker, \n130 \nU.S. 267, 278\n, 9 S.Ct. 519; Smith v. Ayer, \n101 U.S. 320\n, 328; Ward v. City Trust Co., 192 N.Y. 61, 69, 70, 84 N.E. 585; City of Newburyport v. Fidelity Mutual Life Ins. Co., 197 Mass. 596, 84 N.E. 111; Empire Trust Co. v. Cahan, \n274 \nU.S. 473\n, 47 S.Ct. 661, 57 A.L.R. 921.3 We do not understand that any ruling yet made as to the effect of the Wisconsin statute extends to such a state of facts. Pollard v. Tobin, as we read it, is authority for this, that a bond payable to bearer is not sullied upon its face because tendered by a holder who is known to be a trustee under the mortgage and to have certified the issue. From that knowledge without more, a buyer in Wisconsin is not chargeable with actual notice that the title of the seller is subject to a trust, or with a fraudulent participation in the abuse of a trust relation.\n What we have written as to the meaning of Pollard v. Tobin is not at variance with the construction given to that judgment in the opinion of the court below. Referring to the Wisconsin case, the Circuit Court of Appeals said \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n that it 'involved the identical question now under consideration, arising out of a transaction between the same bankrupt and another bank, in which there were pledged, under similar circumstances, bonds practically identical in form and terms with the bonds herein involved.' 70 F.(2d) 815 at page 817. With this concession there was none the less a refusal to follow the Wisconsin rule, the court expressing the opinion that the rule had its origin in the misconstruction of a declaratory statute. 'The federal courts are not bound,' it was said, 'by a decision of a state court in the interpretation or application of a provision of a uniform law contrary to the weight of authority as established by decisions of other states.' 70 F.(2d) 815 at page 818. By our judgment in Burns Mortgage Co. v. Fried, supra, a case decided shortly after the decision of this case below, the law is settled to the contrary.\n The point is made for the respondent that adherence is not owing to Pollard v. Tobin for the reason that at the date of the transactions in controversy the meaning of the Wisconsin statute was still undermined. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S.Ct. 140, is cited in support of that contention. What was involved in that case was the application of a local decision affecting interests in real estate that were untouched by any statute. The opinion of the court (page 369 of 215 U.S., 30 S.Ct. 140) does not deny (citing Brine v. Insurance Co., \n96 U.S. 627\n, 636), that the conclusion would have been different if the contested interests had been dependent upon a statute preceding their creation, though not construed till afterwards. In that event the later construction would have been read into the act as if there from the beginning. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co. v. Risty, \n276 \nU.S. 567, 570\n, 48 S.Ct. 396; Sioux County v. National Surety Co., \n276 \nU.S. 238, 240\n, 48 S.Ct. 239; Hawks v. Hamill, \n288 \nU.S. 52, 58\n, 53 S.Ct. 240, 77 L.D. 610. Cf. Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358\n, 53 S.Ct. 145, 85 A.L.R. 254. \n\n[293 U.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n The Negotiable Instruments Law of Wisconsin was part of the law of that state when the bonds in controversy were pledged. This being so, the decision in Pollard v. Tobin supplies the governing rule irrespective of the date when the decision was announced. In that view, Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co. is seen to be irrelevant. There is no occasion in such circumstances to mark its limits more precisely. Hawks v. Hamill, supra.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the meaning of the words 'determinable future time,' see Wis.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIES OF STATE OF(1934)\nNo. 29\nArgued: October 18, 1934Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. \n\n[293 U.S. 151, 152]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry E. Foster, of Olympia, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. Daniel Baker, of Seattle, Wash., Mr. Miles H. McKey, of Salem, Or ., and Miss Dorothee Scarbrough, of Olympia, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Since 1911 the State of Washington has had a Workmen's Compensation Act applicable to extrahazardous employments. Until March 15, 1927, the statute contained a section providing: 'If aggravation, diminution, or termination of disability takes place or be discovered after the rate of compensation shall have been established or compensation terminated in any case the department may, upon the application of the beneficiary or upon its own motion, readjust for future application the rate of compensation \n\n[293 U.S. 151, 153]\n\u00a0\n in accordance with the rules in this section provided for the same, or in a proper case terminate the payment.' \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n On February 7, 1927, while the quoted section was in force, the appellant injured his arm while doing extrahazardous work. March 15, 1927 the law was amended and the section in question was altered to provide: 'If aggravation, diminution, or termination of disability takes place or be discovered after the rate of compensation shall have been established or compensation terminated, in any case the director of labor and industries, through and by means of the division of industrial insurance, may, upon the application of the beneficiary, made within three years after the establishment or termination of such compensation, or upon his own motion, readjust for further application the rate of compensation in accordance with the rules in this section provided for the same, or in a proper case terminate the payment: Provided, Any such applicant whose compensation has heretofore been established or terminated shall have three years from the taking effect of this act within which to apply for such readjustment.' \n2\n (Italics supplied.)\n Pursuant to a claim duly presented to the appellee, the appellant was paid from the State workmen's insurance fund on January 17, 1928, the sum of $240 in final settlement for permanent partial disability and the case was closed. May 10, 1933, he filed with the appellee a petition for reopening of his claim on the ground that his condition had become aggravated due to the injury. The appellee dismissed the petition for the reason that the \n\n[293 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n three year statute of limitations barred the claim. An appeal to the Supreme Court of Thurston County was dismissed, and the Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment. The case is here on appeal.\n The appellant insists that at the date of his injury the statute conferred upon him not only a right to make his original claim and receive compensation, but a further right to file an additional claim, without limit as to time, and to receive readjusted compensation for aggravation of his condition due to his injury. This, he says, is a vested right, is property, and its enforcement may not be abolished or limited, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. \n3\n The claim cannot be sustained.\n The Washington Workmen's Compensation Act is compulsory. In the exercise of the State's police power it abolishes common law actions for negligence, imposes upon industry a levy calculated in accordance with the risk of injury to workmen, places the money collected in a state- administered fund, and substitutes for the employee's common law right of action a purely statutory right to payment from the fund of a sum adjusted to the character and extent of the injury. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n That the State may impose reasonable conditions upon the assertion of the claim does not admit of argument. Considerations justifying a reasonable limitation of time within which further increase of compensation due to aggravation of condition may be claimed are so obvious as hardly to require statement. Appellant does not urge that the prescription of a period of three years for presenting such a claim is unreasonable, but that it is beyond the \n\n[293 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n State's power. The section under attack merely limits the time for the assertion of the right, affects the remedy only, and that in a manner not unreasonable, arbitrary or oppressive. Such a limitation of time within which appellant's remedy must be pursued does not deprive him of due process.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Session Laws 1911, c. 74,  5(h), pp. 356, 360, amended by Session Laws 1923, c. 136,  2(h), pp. 387, 397.

FURLAUD(1934)\nNo. 11\nArgued: October 11, 1934Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Mr. Ralph Royall, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Louis B. Eppstein, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n McCandless, a citizen and resident of Pennsylvania, suing as ancillary receiver of the Duquesne Gas Corporation, appointed by the federal court for Southern New York, brought this suit in that court. The bill alleged that he had been appointed receiver of all the assets of the corporation in a consolidated suit in the federal court for Western Pennsylvania originally brought by Frank T. Harrington against the Duquesne Gas Corporation, and later consolidated with one brought by the Central Hanover Bank & Trust Company, as trustee under the corporation's mortgage; that upon his petition as primary \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n receiver filed in the federal court for Southern New York he had by an order 'duly made' been appointed ancillary receiver there; that he had 'duly qualified and is now acting as such ancillary receiver;' and that the 'order duly authorized' him as such receiver to bring this suit. The bill then set forth at great length facts on which it charged that the defendants, or some of them, acting in a fiduciary relation to the corporation, came into the possession of funds arising from the sale of its securities and had misappropriated more than $2,500,000. An accounting and the recovery of these sums were prayed for. Furlaud, a citizen and resident of New York, and three corporations organized under the laws of states other than Pennsylvania were the defendants. Each filed an answer which denied most of the allegations of the bill.\n The case was heard by the District Court on the merits, on evidence which occupied 217 pages of the original printed record. That court entered a final decree which ordered Furland and the Kingston Company to pay the sum of $1,834.640.08, with interest and costs. Those defendants appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, denying liability. McCandless cross-appealed, claiming the additional sum of $850,000; and that the other two companies, as to whom the bill had been dismissed by the decree, were also liable for the full amount.\n The Court of Appeals, without passing upon the merits of the controversy, reversed the decree. 68 F.(2d) 925, 927. It did so, solely on the ground that, under the rule of Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, the 'appointment of the plaintiff as ancillary receiver was void, and he did not acquire, in any of the proceedings, a status to warrant the institution of this suit.' Its decision was based upon the following facts which were shown by the copy of the record of the proceedings in the federal court for Southern New York by which McCandless was appointed an \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n cillary receiver, and which he had introduced at the hearing in this cause: The papers in the proceeding for such appointment were entitled 'Frank T. Harrington, Complainant against Duquesne Gas Corporation, Defendant'; but, in fact, no independent bill against the corporation had been filed in the Southern District of New York by Harrington, or by any other person. The papers filed consisted merely of a petition by McCandless as primary receiver praying that he be appointed ancillary receiver; and the order entered thereon. Annexed to his petition was a copy of the proceedings of the federal court for Western Pennsylvania by which he was appointed primary receiver. The record does not show that the corporation was represented when the appointment of the ancillary receiver was made. So far as disclosed by the record, the order of the District Court for Southern New York appointing him was made ex parte.\n The Court of Appeals held that the legal sufficiency of the appointment of the plaintiff as ancillary receiver had been put in issue by the answer; and that the plaintiff had not sustained the burden of establishing its legality. It ruled that in the federal courts a foreign receiver may not 'sue outside the district as a matter of comity even by obtaining permission before suit is commenced;' that 'to permit a foreign receiver to obtain an ancillary appointment, on an ex parte application, improperly avoids the rule denying foreign receivers the right to sue in the foreign jurisdiction'; that the 'right of a receiver to sue in a foreign court cannot be upheld as a mere incident to the office of a receiver'; and that, since federal courts for the several districts are foreign to one another, an ancilary receiver may be appointed only as an incident of an independent bill.\n The importance of reviewing that rulling-in view of an established practice, said to prevail in perhaps a majority of the state courts, of permitting foreign receivers \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 71]\n\u00a0\n to sue,1 and a common practice, said to obtain in federal courts, of appointing ancillary receivers on the ex parte application of the primary receiver-was the reason principally urged for granting the petition for certiorari. The order allowing certiorari was 'limited to the questions pertaining to the validity of the appointment of the petitioner as ancillary receiver, and his right as such to maintain this suit.' In the abbreviated record prepared for use here, only those portions of the original record which were supposed to bear upon those questions were included. The rest were omitted in printing pursuant to stipulation. The briefs filed on the argument of the case in this Court were directed solely to the question whether the appointment of the ancillary receiver as made was void and open to collateral attack. But statements of counsel made at the oral argument in this Court, in answer to inquiries, and confirmed by examination of the original record, enable us to dispose of the case without passing on the specific question whether in a federal court an ancillary receiver may be appointed otherwise than as an incident of an independent bill in equity.\n First. The holding of the Court of Appeals that the legal sufficiency of the appointment of the plaintiff as ancillary receiver had been put in issue by the answer rests solely upon the provision in Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA,  723), which declares that a statement in the answer that the defendant is without knowledge as to facts alleged in the bill 'shall be treated as a denial.' \n2\n This constructive denial did \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 72]\n\u00a0\n not suggest that there was a legal objection to the manner of the appointment or to its validity. The proceedings at the hearing and later show that there was no intention to deny the validity of the appointment of the ancillary receiver,3 nor was it in fact questioned in the District Court. \n4\n On the appeal, sixty-five alleged errors were as \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 73]\n\u00a0\n signed. One of them was directed to an alleged holding that the order entered in the Southern District of New York 'constituted a due and valid appointment' of McCandless as ancillary receiver. But the record does not show that the District Court did so rule, or that it was requested to rule on the subject. Moreover, the petitioner stated that the objection to the validity of the appointment had been made for the first time in the Court of Appeals; and counsel for the respondent, in his oral argument in this Court, said that the objection to the validity of the appointment was not urged by him because he desired to have a decision on the merits.\n Second. Under the early practice an objection to the legal capacity of the plaintiff to sue could be taken only by plea in abatement. Kane v. Paul, 14 Pet. 33, 41; Ventress v. Smith, 10 Pet. 161, 168. New, it may be taken by plea in bar or by answer. Noonan v. Bradley, 9 Wall. 394, 400-402. But an objection to the plaintiff's legal capacity to sue will not be entertained if taken, for the first time, in the appellate court. The rule is of general application, and has been applied in the federal appellate courts to a variety of cases: To lack of capacity on the ground of infancy;5 on the ground that plaintiff was a married woman;6 on the ground that the husband was not entitled to sue in his own name for the death of his wife;7 on the ground that plaintiff, a foreign corporation, had failed to comply with requirements of the local law;8 on the ground that a suit in the name of the United States was brought without the requisite authority of the Attorney General. \n9\n Under like circumstances, the appeal \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 74]\n\u00a0\n late courts have refused to entertain the objection that plaintiff was not the real party in interest;10 that the father was not entitled to sue for the death of his minor son;11 and that the plaintiff, an executor or administrator, had not secured ancillary administration. \n12\n The reason for the rule is the broad one that a defect found lurking in the record on appeal may not be allowed to defeat recovery, where the defect might have been remedied, if the objection had been seasonably raised in the trial court. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The alleged invalidity of the order appointing McCandless ancillary receiver is a defect of this character. It is urged that the appointment of an ancillary receiver can be made only as an incident of an independent bill, and upon application of one properly a party thereto; that here there was nothing before the court, because no suit was then pending in the Southern District of New York; that there was neither a plaintiff nor a defendant; that no relief was prayed; that no process had issued; that the corporation did not voluntarily appear; and hence that the court lacked the power to make the appointment, since there was nothing before it upon which its judicial power could act. We have no occasion to decide whether the contention is well founded. For, if the validity of his appointment as ancillary receiver had been seasonably urged in the trial court, the plaintiff might have remedied the defect by causing an independent bill to be filed; the District Court might thereon have entered an order appointing him ancillary receiver; and, in this \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 75]\n\u00a0\n cause, the trial court might have permitted the appropriate amendment of the bill of complaint. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The rule that a federal appellate court must, of its own motion, dismiss the suit if it appears that the trial court was without jurisdiction, Mansfield, C. & L.M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S. Ct. 510, is not applicable to the situation presented here. In the case at bar, the District Court confessedly had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties. The objection sustained goes not to the jurisdiction of the District Court in this suit, but to the legal capacity of the plaintiff as ancillary receiver.\n Fourth. The objection which the Court of Appeals held fatal to the maintenance of this suit differs in essence from that sustained in Booth v. Clark. There, the foreign equity receiver suing in the federal court of another state failed because, having no title to the assets within the district, he was without a cause of action. He lacked title because the order appointing him did not, and could not, transfer to him the assets involved in the litigation. For that reason, a bill in the federal court for Southern New York brought by the primary receiver, alleged to have been duly appointed in Pennsylvania and authorized to bring this suit, would have been bad on demurrer. But this bill by the ancillary receiver, which alleges that he had been duly appointed by the federal court for New York and authorized to bring the suit, would have been good on demurrer.\n Great Western Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561, 576\n, 25 S.Ct. 770, 774, shows that the rule of Booth v. Clark rests upon practical considerations. The foreign receiver failed in the Great Western Case, although he sued in the name of the corporation. He failed, as the Court there stated, because 'every jurisdiction, in which it is sought, by means of a receiver, to subject property to the control of \n\n[293 U.S. 67, 76]\n\u00a0\n the court, has the right and power to determine for itself who the receiver shall be, and to make such distribution of the funds realized within its own jurisdiction as will protect the rights of local parties interested therein, and not permit a foreign court to prejudice the rights of local creditors by removing assets from the local jurisdiction without an order of the court, or its approval as to the officer who shall act in the holding and distribution of the property recovered.' The nature of the rule of Booth v. Clark is shown further by the fact that, when by statute the appointment of the receiver operates to transfer titil, the foreign receiver may sue in the federal court for another state. See Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n, 27 S.Ct. 755. Compare Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Clark v. Williard, \n292 \nU.S. 112\n, 54 S.Ct. 615\n\n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to it for the determination of the questions relating to the liability of the defendants decided by the District Court and presented by the appeal and cross-appeal.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 295 U.S --, 55 S.Ct. 830, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is stated by petitioner that a foreign equity receiver is permitted to sue in 21 states; and that the highest courts of 7 other states have indicated approval of that view. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Paragraph fourth of the amended bill of complainant, after reciting the proceedings appointing McCandless primary receiver in the Western District of Pennsylvania, stated: 'That upon petition of the complainant as such Receiver duly filed in the United States District Court in and for the Southern District of New York, an order was duly made on the 23rd day of March, 1932, by said last mentioned Court appointing said complainant, George W. McCandless, as Ancillary Receiver of Duquesne Gas Corporation, which last mentioned order duly authorized the complainant, as such Receiver, to bring this suit, and the complainant has duly qualified and is acting as such Ancillary Receiver.' Defendant answered: 'With respect to the allegation of paragraph 'Fourth' of the amended bill of complaint, defendant denies having information sufficient to form a belief with respect thereto and leaves the complainant to his proof thereof.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] McCandless, after testifying without objection to his appointment in Pennsylvania, was asked: 'Thereafter did you apply for and obtain authority from the Court to bring this suit?' Defendants' counsel objected, stating: 'The ground of my objection is that the order itself is the best evidence of what is contained therein. I might say at this point that I intend to raise the point in the course of this trial that the trustee had no authority to bring the suit in the particular action under which he was appointed.' The court directed that the order be introduced. Thereupon McCandless was asked: 'Were you thereafter appointed ancillary receiver by this District Court?' Without objection, he answered 'Yes.' Then he was asked: 'Were you there also authorized to bring suit?' Defendants' counsel then made 'the same objection,' which was sustained. The plaintiff then, without objection, introduced in evidence a copy of the proceeding appointing him the ancillary receiver. That record, including a copy of the proceedings in the Pennsylvania suit, occupies 35 pages of the printed record in this Court.\n The nature of the objection which counsel had in mind in asserting lack of authority in the 'trustee' to bring the suit is not clear. It obviously related equally to the authority conferred by the Pennsylvania court on the primary receiver. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The careful opinion of the District Judge (which occupies 14 pages of the printed record of this Court) makes no mention of any such objection or defense. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Paauhau Sugar Plantation Co. v.

Howard McLain and John M. Robinson, both of Charlotte, N.C ., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While in the military service of the United States Moses Reid took out a war risk insurance policy for $10,000 and designated his father and mother as beneficiaries. He died intestate August 23, 1920, leaving no wife, child, or descendant. The father died November 22, 1926, intestate; the mother February 22, 1932. Her will designated an executrix. \n\n[293 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n No payment of any kind was made under the policy prior to the mother's death. Thereafter the Bureau of War Risk Insurance determined that during his life the insured became entitled to monthly disability payments aggregating $862.50 and caused this sum to be paid to his administrator. Also that while alive the father, as beneficiary, became entitled to installments aggregating $2,127.50 which was paid to his administrator. Further that during her life the mother, as beneficiary, became entitled to payments aggregating $3,938.75. This sum was paid to her executrix. Finally it ruled that the commuted value of unpaid monthly installments under the policy payable after the mother's death amounted to $ 5,768, and the assured's administrator collected this. The only funds received by him were from payments under the policy as above stated.\n This proceeding, with proper parties, was duly begun by the assured's administrator in the superior court of Mecklenburg county, N.C. It sought binding direction concerning distribution of funds on hand and presented no other question.\n The trial court ruled that at the soldier's death his father and mother became sole distributees of his estate; 'that as to the $862.50 which was due the insured prior to his death, it belongs to the estate of the father and the estate of the mother equally; that as to the $5,768 received by him (the administrator) as the commuted value of the unpaid portion of the policy after the death of the beneficiaries, it should be paid to the estate of the father and the estate of the mother respectively in such sums as are required to bring the said estates to an equal sum after the sums paid into each by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, and the half of the $862.50 has been added together; the intention of this finding being to make the estate of the father and the estate of the mother exactly equal finally.' \n\n[293 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n Upon appeal the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed. It said ( 206 N.C. 102, 173 S.E. 49):\n'Wehn Moses Reid died, his distributees were his father, Adolphus Reid, and his mother, Ida Reid. Both were living. The statute cast upon each one-half of the personal property of deceased. Thereupon the right of property to such one-half immediately vested. C.S.  137, subd. 6.\n\n'Neither received as beneficiary in the war risk insurance policy any installment from the government during his or her life. Therefore the whole fund in contemplation of law is now assets of the estate of the dead soldier, to be distributed immediately to the estates of his father and mother. The fact that one beneficiary lived longer than the other, and hence entitled to receive more money in installments from the government, has nothing to do with the right of property as distributee. The intestate law of this state pegged that right at the death of the soldier.'\n\n In Singleton v. Cheek, \n284 \nU.S. 493\n, 52 S.Ct. 257, 81 A. L.R. 923, where the circumstances were similar to those presented here, nothing was paid under the policy until after the death of the wife, the designated beneficiary. We considered the applicable provisions of section 303, World War Veterans' Act of 1924, as amended by March 4, 1925, c. 553 ,  14, 43 Stat. 1302, 1310 (38 USCA  514), declared them retroactive to October 6, 1917, and held that installments which accrued before the death of the insured, and the commuted value of those accruing subsequent to the beneficiary's death belonged to the insured's estate for distribution as of the moment of his death. Benefits accrued in favor of but not received by the widow during her life had been paid to her administrator. No suggestion was made that other disposition would have been proper. At page 497 of 284 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 257, 259, the opinion says: \n\n[293 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n 'By that amendment, (March 4, 1925*) the rule, which, upon the happening of the contingencies named in the prior acts, limited the benefit of the unpaid installments to persons within the designated class of permittees, was abandoned, and 'the estate of the insured' was wholly substituted as the payee. All installments, whether accruing before the death of the Insured or after the death of the beneficiary named in the certificate of insurance, as a result, became assets of the estate of the insured upon the instant of his death, to be distributed to the heirs of the insured in accordance with the intestacy laws of the state of his residence, such heirs to be determined as of the date of his death, and not as of the date of the death of the beneficiary.'\n Considering what was said in United States v. Worley, \n281 \nU.S. 339, 341\n, 50 S.Ct. 291, and in Singleton v. Cheek, supra, together with the language and evident purpose of the act of 1924 as amended, we think it clear enough that installments which accrued in favor of the father and mother of Reid as beneficiaries during their lives became the property of their respective estates. Also that installments which accrued to the assured during his lifetime, and the commuted value of the installments payable subsequent to the mother's death, became the property of his estate.\n The court below erred in directing that the accruing before the death of the insured and mother- \n\n[293 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n during their lives should be treated as parts of the estate of the insured. See Reivich v. United States (C.C.A.) 25 F.(2d) 670, 672; United States v.

Carr, 76 Ala. 388, 52 Am.Rep. 339, that no Alabama court had jurisdiction of any suit against a foreign corporation unless the cause of action had arisen within the state. 2 In the case at bar the court held that, despite the 1907 act, lack of \n\n[292 U.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction still existed in respect to causes of action arising in another state under the federal law; because, since the statute was in plain terms limited to suits arising under the law of the other state, it could not be extended by construction to include causes of action arising in such other state under a federal law.\n The plaintiff contends that by refusing to entertain jurisdiction, the state court has denied him a right expressly conferred by Congress and guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.

Davis Provision Co., No. 1, \n191 \nU.S. 373\n, 24 S.Ct. 92; Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 149 S., 28 S.Ct. 34; and the extent to which its courts shall become a forum for the trial of transitory causes of action arising in other states, Missouri Pacific R.R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., \n257 \nU.S. 533\n, 42 S.Ct. 210; Douglas v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S.Ct. 355.\n Alabama has granted to its circuit courts general jurisdiction of the class of actions to which that here brought belongs, in cases between litigants situated like those in the case at bar. \n3\n The court would have had jurisdiction of the cause between these parties if the accident had occurred in Alabama. It would have had jurisdiction although the accident occurred in Tennessee, if the defendant had been a domestic corporation. It would have had jurisdiction, although the defendant was a foreign corporation, the plaintiff a nonresident, and the accident \n\n[292 U.S. 230, 233]\n\u00a0\n occurred in Tennessee, if the suit had been brought for an injury suffered while engaged in intrastate commerce. Thus, the ordinary jurisdiction of the Alabama circuit court is appropriate to enforce the right against this defendant conferred upon the plaintiff by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. And its jurisdiction was invoked according to the rules of procedure prevailing in that court.\n The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution. The privileges and immunities clause (article 4,  2, cl. 1) requires a state to accord to citizens of other states substantially the same right of access to its courts as it accords to its own citizens. Corfield v. Coryell, Fed. Cas. No. 3,230, 4 Wash.C.C. 371, 381. Compare Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Eggen, \n252 \nU.S. 553\n, 40 S.Ct. 402. The full faith and credit clause (article 4,  1) requires a state court to take jurisdiction of an action to enforce a judgment recovered in another state, although it might have refused to entertain a suit on the original cause of action as obnoxious to its public policy. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 10 A.L.R. 716; Loughran v.

New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R., \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, an action in a Connecticut court against a domestic corporation, it was settled that a state court whose ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate for the occasion, may not refuse to entertain suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.\n While Congress has not attempted to compel states to provide courts for the enforcement of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Douglas v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377, 387\n, 49 S.Ct. 355, the Federal Constitution prohibits state courts of general jurisdiction from refusing to do so solely because the suit is brought under a federal \n\n[292 U.S. 230, 234]\n\u00a0\n law. The denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is based solely upon the source of law sought to be enforced. The plaintiff is cast out because he is suing to enforce a federal act. A state may not discriminate against rights arising under federal laws.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Steen v. Swadley, 126 Ala. 616, 621, 28 So. 620; Lee v.

PACIFIC LUMBER CO.(1934)\nNo. 125\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R.I., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this action in the District Court for Northern California to recover $143,122.23 it had paid as income tax for 1923. The complaint alleges facts upon which respondent claims to have been overassessed in that sum as a result of failure to take into account deductible losses. One loss ($479,625) resulted from the liquidation in 1923 of A. F. Thane & Co., a wholly owned subsidiary. The other ($953,134. 49) was the indebtedness \n\n[293 U.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n of that company to respondent, ascertained to be worthless and charged off by the latter in that year. Petitioner's answer put in issue some and admitted other allegations of the complaint. The parties stipulated for trial by the court without a jury. The evidence consisted of an agreed statement of facts and the separate and consolidated tax returns for 1920 to 1923, inclusive, of respondent, Thane & Co., and Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois. At the close of the evidence each party moved for judgment. The court denied petitioner's motion, granted that of respondent, and gave it judgment in the amount sued for with interest and costs. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 66 F.(2d) 895.\n The allegations of the complaint admitted by the answer, the agreed statement and the tax returns show:\n During 1918 A. F. Thane & Co. had outstanding 600 shares of capital stock of the par value of $100 each; respondent owned 540 for which it had paid $31,500 and A. F. Thane owned 60. In 1920, the company increased its capital to 5,000 shares, respondent subscribed and paid to the company par value, $100 per share, for 3,960 and Thane took the remaining 440 shares. In 1921 respondent bought these shares for $52,125 and so became the owner of all, for which it had paid $479,625. At the close of 1923, Thane & Co. was dissolved and its remaining assets were transferred to respondent. Between March 17, 1921, and the end of 1923, respondent had advanced to it and paid for its account large sums. After deducting the amount repaid plus the value of the assets transferred at liquidation, Thane & Co. was indebted to respondent in the sum of $953,134.49. Before the end of 1923, respondent charged this off as a debt ascertained to be worthless in that year.\n From 1920 to 1923, inclusive, respondent, Thane & Co., and the Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois made separate income tax returns and also consolidated \n\n[293 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n returns as affiliated corporations. Their income taxes were paid on the latter basis. In each year respondent had a large net income and Thane & Co. lost heavily; the Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois lost in the first and had relatively small net income in each of the other years. \n1\n Their separate returns for 1923 respectively showed net income of $1,379,494.78, net loss of $229,942.15, and net income of $8,809.83. The consolidated return reported net income of $1,158,362.46 on which respondent paid $144, 795.31 as the total income tax. Upon examination and audit in the Bureau, a greater deduction was made for depreciation than was claimed in the return, overpayment was found in the amount of $1,673.08, and that was refunded.\n Insisting that the losses here in question were deductible, respondent filed a claim for refund of the balance, $143,122.23. The letter of the deputy commissioner notifying it that the claim would be rejected stated that, since Thane & Co. was affiliated with respondent and allowance was made, in computing consolidated not income, for all deductible losses sustained by the subsidiary during the several years, a further deduction reflect-\n[]\n 1920 1921 1922 1923 []\n Pacific Lumber Company of Maine, Respondent $2,262,959.39 $379,624.88 $1,266, 450.51 $1,379,494.78 A.

And the claim was disallowed.\n Petitioner's motion at the close of the evidence for judgment in his favor raised the question of law whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant judgment for respondent and the trial court's decision of that question was reviewable in the Circuit Court of Appeals and is here for decision. United States v. Jefferson Electric Mfg. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 386, 407\n, 54 S.Ct. 443.\n Section 240(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921 declares: 'That corporations which are affiliated within the meaning of this section may ... make separate returns or, under regulations prescribed, ... make a consolidated return of net income ... in which case the taxes thereunder shall be computed and determined upon the basis of such return.' 42 Stat. 227, 260. Treasury Regulations 62 provide: 'Consolidated returns are based upon the principle of levying the tax according to the true net income and invested capital of a single enterprise ... (Art. 631.) Subject ... to the elimination of intercompany transactions ... the consolidated taxable net income shall be the combined net income of the several corporations consolidated.' Art. 636.\n If not inconsistent with its obligation under the statute accurately to report taxable income for 1923, respondent may deduct the losses it sustained in that year as the result of its investment in the stock of Thane & Co. and its advances to or for that company. Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Mfg. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 53 S.Ct. 227. But a consolidated return must truly reflect taxable income of the unitary business and consequently it may not be employed to enable the taxpayer to use more than once the same losses for reduction of income. Losses of Thane & Co. that were subtracted from respondent's income are not directly or indirectly again deductible. Handy & Har- \n\n[293 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n man v. Burnet, \n284 \nU.S. 136, 140\n, 52 S.Ct. 51; United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 301\n, 47 S.Ct. 608; Ilfeld Co. v. Hernandez, \n292 \nU.S. 62, 68\n, 54 S.Ct. 596. Respondent voluntarily paid the tax. When disallowing the claim for refund, the Bureau notified it that losses in 1923 reflecting other deductions would not be allowed. Presumably respondent had within its control the records showing facts that would fully disclose the relations between such losses and those reported in the returns of Thane & Co. The Circuit Court of Appeals states that there is no evidence of double deduction or any specific instance of such deduction. But that absence of proof does not support the judgment. Respondent had the affirmative of the issue, and the burden was on it to show that allowance of the deduction claimed would not amount to twice subtracting the same loss. That is an essential fact which cannot be assumed. Respondent may not rely on mere assertion or speculation. Cochran v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 387, 393\n, 41 S.Ct. 166; Fidelity Title & Trust Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 304, 306\n, 42 S.Ct. 514; United States v.

Co., supra, page 400 of 291 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 443.\n The evidence not only fails to establish that essential fact but is little, if any, less than enough to show that the allowance of the deductions claimed would be a second use of the same losses. The details, given in the tabular statement printed in the margin of an earlier page of this opinion, show that the losses of Thane & Co., which operated through consolidated returns to reduce respondent's income taxed, amount in all to more than respondent's asserted 1923 losses and to more than its income taxed in that year. Thane & Co.'s statements attached to its separate tax returns show liabilities in excess of assets in each year of the affiliated period increasing annually until by the end of 1923 the deficit had become $1,453,134.49. Prior to 1920 Thane \n\n[293 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n & Co. had outstanding only $60,000 of capital stock, 90 per cent. of which was acquired by respondent for less than par. During the affiliated period its deductible losses amounted to more than three times its capital. While it is conceivable that, as suggested by respondent the losses do not necessarily indicate that thereby Thane & Co. became unable to pay its debts, the circumstances tend strongly to indicate that they did cause its breakdown resulting in respondent's 1923 losses here claimed. If these losses did not cause, or are not reflected in, those sustained by respondent in 1923 as the result of its investment in and advances to that company, it reasonably may be presumed that respondent would have shown that fact.\n The trial court should have granted petitioner's motion for judgment in his favor.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n 1 \n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCNALLY v.

Wise, Jr., of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Justin Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari, \n292 \nU.S. 619\n, 54 S.Ct. 773, brings this case here for review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals directing dismissal, on the merits, of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to be imprisoned upon two indictments framed under the Conspiracy Act of May 17, 1879, c. 8, 21 Stat. 4, as amended by Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321,  37, 35 Stat. 1088, 1096, U.S.C. title 18,  88 (18 USCA  88), and the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act of October 29, 1919, c. 89, 41 Stat. 324, 325, U.S.C. title 18,  408 ( 18 USCA  408). The indictment which alone need be considered here was in three counts: The first charged petitioner and others with conspiracy to violate the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Theft Act; the second, the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle; and the third, which is assailed here, the violation of section 4 of the Motor Vehicle Theft Act (18 USCA  408) by the sale in New Jersey of a motor vehicle which had been stolen in New York, 'knowing that the vehicle had been so stolen and transported in interstate commerce.' Petitioner was sentenced for a term of two years on the first count and for terms of four years each on the second and third counts, the sentence on the first to run concurrently with that on the second, the sentence on the second and third to run consecutively. Service of sentence was begun on November 30, 1931. It is conceded that the \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n sentence on the second count, less allowances for good behavior, has not expired and that service of sentence on the third has not yet begun.\n On April 6, 1933, the petitioner filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Middle district of Pennsylvania. He assailed the conviction and sentence on the third count as void. No attack was made on the conviction and sentence on the other counts, but the petition advanced as reasons for granting the writ that under the Parole Act of June 25, 1910, c. 387,  1, 36 Stat. 819, as amended by the Act of January 23, 1913, c. 9, 37 Stat. 650, U.S.C. tit. 18 ,  714 (18 USCA  714), petitioner was eligible to apply for parole, to be granted, in the discretion of the parole board, after serving one-third of his sentence; that he had served one-third or more of the valid sentence on the first and second counts, but less than one-third of the total period of imprisonment to which he had been sentenced on the three counts; and that consideration by the parole board of any application for his parole was precluded by reason of the outstanding, but void, sentence on the third count.\n Numerous objections to the validity of the conviction was sentence under the third count were urged either in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals. The only one considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals was that the third count was void because it failed to charge the petitioner, in conformity to the words of section 4 of the statute (18 USCA  408), with having sold a stolen motor vehicle 'moving as, or which is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce,' but had charged him, instead, with knowingly selling a stolen motor vehicle which 'had theretofore been transported in interstate commerce'; that it had thus failed to charge an offense against the United States since it appeared that the motor vehicle, at the time of the sale, had ceased to be the subject of interstate commerce. \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider whether the writ of habeas corpus could rightly be used to test the validity of the sentence on the third count, while the petitioner was in lawful custody under the sentence on the second, or whether the writ was improperly used as an attempted substitute for an appeal from the judgment of conviction. It contented itself with passing upon the sufficiency of the indictment and held that the act of sale charged was so closely related to the interstate transportation of the motor vehicle as to constitute the federal offense defined by the statute. It accordingly treated the alleged defects in the indictment as no more than formal and affirmed the order of the District Court dismissing the petition. 69 F.(2d) 38.\n We find it unnecessary to consider the questions raised or decided below, which the petitioner presses here. We conclude that, as it appears from the petition that the detention of petitioner is lawful under the sentence on the second count, there is no occasion, in a habeas corpus proceeding, for inquiry into the validity of his conviction under the third.\n The use of the writ of habeas corpus as an incident of the federal judicial power is implicitly recognized by article 1,  9, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides: 'The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspend, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.' The justices of this Court and judges of the District Courts were expressly given power to issue the writ by section 14 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 81, 82, now embodied, with additions, in chapter 14, title 28, U.S.C. (28 USCA  451 et seq.). Under the statute in its present form the writ may issue 'for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty,' but with the proviso that it 'shall in no case extend to a prisoner in jail unless where he is in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States; \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n ... or is in custody for an act done or omitted in pursuance of a lw of the United States; ... or is in custody in violation of the Constitution or of a law or treaty of the United States.' Sections 451, 452, 453, tit. 28, U.S.C. (28 USCA  451, 452, 453).\n The statute does not define the term habeas corpus. To ascertain its meaning and the appropriate use of the writ in the federal courts, recourse must be had to the common law, from which the term was drawn, and to the decisions of this Court interpreting and applying the common-law principles which define its use when authorized by the statute.

Hecht, \n263 \nU.S. 255\n, 44 S.Ct. 103.\n Originating as a writ by which the superior courts of the common law and the chancellor sought to extend their jurisdiction at the expense of inferior or rival courts, it ultimately took form and survived as the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, by which the legality of the detention of one in the custody of another could be tested judicially. See Holdsworth, History of the English Law, vol. 9, 108-125. Its use was defined and regulated by the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. II, c. 2. This legislation and the decisions of the English courts interpreting it have been accepted by this Court as authoritative guides in defining the principles which control the use of the writ in the federal courts. See Ex parte Watkins, supra, page 202 of 3 Pet.; Ex parte Yerger, supra, page 95 of 8 Wall.; Ex parte Parks, supra, pages 21, 22 of 93 U.S..\n The purpose of the proceeding defined by the statute was to inquire into the legality of the detention, and the only judicial relief authorized was the discharge of the prisoner or his admission to bail, and that only if his \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n detention were found to be unlawful. \n1\n In this, the statute conformed to the traditional form of the writ, which put in issue only the disposition of the custody of the prisoner according to law. \n2\n There is no warrant in either the statute or the writ for its use to invoke judicial determination of questions which could not affect the lawfulness of the custody and detention, and no suggestion of such a use has been found in the commentaries on the English common law. \n3\n Diligent search of the English author- \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n ities and the digests before 1789 has failed to disclose any case where the writ was sought or used, either before or after conviction, as a means of securing the judicial decision of any question which, even if determined in the prisoner's favor, could not have resulted in his immediate release. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Such use of the writ in the federal courts is without the support of history or of any language in the statutes which would indicate a purpose to enlarge its traditional function. Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, by the language already quoted, was at pains to declare that the writ might issue for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of restraint of liberty. Without restraint of liberty, the writ will not issue. Wales v. Whitney, \n114 \nU.S. 564\n, 5 S.Ct. 1050; Stallings v. Splain, \n253 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 40 S.Ct. 537. Equally, without restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used. A sentence which the prisoner has not begun to serve cannot be the cause of restraint which the statute makes the subject of inquiry.\n Considerations which have led this Court to hold that habeas corpus may not be used as a writ of error to correct an erroneous judgment of conviction of crime, but may be resorted to only where the judgment is void because the court was without jurisdiction to render it, Ex Parte Watkins, supra, page 203 of 3 Pet.; Knewel v. Egan, \n268 \nU.S. 442, 445\n, 447 S., 45 S.Ct. 552, lead to the like conclusion where the prisoner is \n\n[293 U.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n lawfully detained under a sentence which is invalid in part. Habeas corpus may not be used to modify or revise the judgment of conviction. Harian v. McGourin, \n218 \nU.S. 442\n, 31 S.Ct. 44, 21 Ann.Cas. 849; United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 \nU.S. 48, 63\n, 14 S.Ct. 746. Even when void, its operation may be stayed by habeas corpus only through the exercise of the authority of the court to remove the prisoner from custody. That authority cannot be exercised where the custody is lawful.\n Wherever the issue has been presented, this Court has consistently refused to review, upon habeas corpus, questions which do not concern the lawfulness of the detention. \n5\n In re Graham (Graham v.

The lower federal courts have generally denied petitions for the writ where the prisoner was at the time serving a part of his sentence not assailed as invalid. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner asks here only a ruling which will establish his eligibility for parole, because of the invalidity of the sentence on the third count. The ruling sought is such as might be obtained in a proceeding brought to mandamus the parole board to entertain his petition for parole, if the sentence on the third count were void for want of jurisdiction of the court to pronounce it. This use of habeas corpus is unauthorized by the statutes of the United States, and for that reason the judgment must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Habeas Corpus Act appears from its preamble to have been especially, although not exclusively, directed at cases in which the King's subjects were detained in custody upon a criminal charge where by law they were entitled to bail. It authorized the writ to issue, directed to any sheriff or gaoler, or other person 'for any person in his or their custody.' It commanded the production of the prisoner before the judicial officer to whom the writ was to be returned and directed that such officer 'shall discharge' the 'prisoner from his imprisonment' with provision for taking bail in his discretion, 'unless it shall appear' to him that the petitioner 'is detained upon a legal process, order or warrant out of some court that hath jurisdiction of criminal matters' or upon warrant for an offense 'for which by law the prisoner is not bailable.' 31 Car. II,  II( 2),  III(6)(7). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The writ, in its historic form, like that now in use in the federal courts, was directed to the disposition of the custody of the prisoner. It commanded the officer to 'have the body' of him 'detained in our prison under your custody,' 'together with the day and cause of his being taken and detained,' before the judge at a specified time and place 'to do and receive all and singular those things which our said chief justice shall then and there consider of him in this behalf.' Richardson, The Attorney's Practice in the Court of Kings Bench, vol. 1, p. 369. Numerous writs, in substantially the same form, used between 5 Edw. IV and James II, are collected in Tremaine, Pleas of the Crown, 351-435. The earliest of these is reprinted in Coke's Second Institutes, 53. And see Hurd, Habeas Corpus, 232-233. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Bacon, in his Abridgment, 425, declared the writ 'is the most usual remedy by which a man is restored to his liberty if he hath by law been deprived of it.' And Hale said that it was designed 'to remove or avoid the imprisonment.' Analysis of the Law, 78; see, also, Pleas of the Crown, 143.

Clarkson, 1 Stra. 444, in refusing to order the release of a woman content to remain with her guardian, said: 'We have nothing to do ... but only to see that she is under no illegal restraint.' See Brass Crosby's Case, 3 Wils. 189, 198. 'This is a writ by which the subject has a right of remedy to be discharged out of custody, if he hath been committed and is detained contrary to law.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In Morgan v. Devine, \n237 \nU.S. 632, 637\n, 35 S.Ct. 712, the writ was denied on the merits and in Ex parte Spencer, \n228 \nU.S. 652\n, 33 S.Ct. 709, petition for the writ was denied because sought to be used as a substitute for a writ of error, although in each case the petitioner had not served an admittedly valid part of his sentence. In neither case did the opinion discuss the question whether the application was premature. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Courts of Appeals in circuits other than the eighth have uniformly denied petitions for writs of habeas corpus when the prisoner was not at that time serving the part of the sentence said to be invalid.

And to the like effect, see Woodward v. Bridges, 144 F. 156 (D.C.); Ex parte Davis, 112 F. 139 (C.C.). This was the view of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Connella v. Haskell, 158 F. 285, 289. But in O'Brien v. McClaughry (C.C.A.) 209 F. 816, 820, 821, that court, in order that the prisoner might apply for parole for the valid part of his sentence, remanded the prisoner with directions to the District Court to discharge the prisoner from custody with respect to the invalid sentence, but to remand him to custody upon the valid sentence. This procedure was followed by the same court in Cahill v. Biddle (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 827, 828, 829. But see Morgan v. Sylvester (C.C.A.) 231 F. 886, 887; Hostetter v. United States (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 921, 923, and Schultz v. Biddle, 19 F.(2d) 478, 480, in the same court.\n In Colson v. Aderhold, 5 F.Supp. 111, the District Court for Northern Georgia entertained a writ of habeas corpus, reduced the sentence from fifty to thirty-five years, and remanded him for custody to serve the valid part of his sentence. \n\n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMIGUEL v. MCCARL(1934)\nNo. 435\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel T. Ansell and George M. Wilmeth, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. Mr. Harrell O. Hoagland, of Washington, D.C., for respondent J. Raymond McCarl, Comptroller General of the United States.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent Frederick W. Coleman, Chief of Finance, United States Army.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner served as an enlisted man in the Philippine Scouts under successive enlistments from October 1, 1901, until October 31, 1931, at which time, upon proper \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n application, he was, by order of the Secretary of War acting for the President, placed on the retired list of the army with the rank of master sergeant in pursuance of the Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2515, 34 Stat. 1217 ( see 10 USCA  947, 980), which provides:\n'When an enlisted man shall have served thirty years either in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, or in all, he shall, upon making application to the President, be placed upon the retired list, with seventy-five per centum of the pay and allowances he may then be in receipt of. ...'\n\n A voucher for the retired pay and allowances for the month of November, 1931, was presented to the Army disbursing officer for Manila, who, without making payment, forwarded it to the Comptroller General through the respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, with a request for 'an advance decision as to the legal authority for payment.' The Comptroller General, on January 19, 1932, rendered a decision holding that 'the retirement of enlisted men of the Philippine Scouts is not authorized even by the remotest implication of the laws,' and advising the disbursing officer that he was not authorized to pay the voucher, which would be retained in the files of the office of the Comptroller General.\n Petitioner thereupon brought this suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to enjoin the Comptroller General from interfering with the respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, or with any finance or disbursing officer of the Army, to prevent payment to petitioner of the retired pay and allowances due for the month of November and subsequent months; and to enjoin and command the Comptroller General to return forthwith to the disbursing officer the voucher then being retained in the files of his office. The bill further sought to enjoin and command respondent Coleman, Chief of Finance, to pay or cause to be paid to petitioner such retired pay and \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n allowances for November and subsequent months. Motions of respondents to dismiss the bill were denied by the Supreme Court of the District, and thereupon respondents filed separate answers. A motion to strike these answers and for a decree in favor of petitioner was granted by the Supreme Court of the District. Final decree against respondents followed in accordance with the prayer of the bill.\n Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District, this decree was reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of the District with instructions to dismiss the bill. 62 App.D.C. 259, 66 F.(2d) 564, 566. The holding of that court rested upon the view that mandamus would not lie against the Comptroller General to determine the right of a retired member of the Philippine Scouts to receive retirement pay and allowances, because the question of his status was disputed in good faith on the merits; and that neither mandamus nor injunction should issue 'in a case of doubtful inference from statutes of uncertain meaning, for in such circumstances the duty sought to be controlled is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion.'\n No appearance is made here by respondent Coleman, and no brief filed or argument made in his behalf. The Solicitor General, however, has filed a comprehensive brief (in which the Judge Advocate General of the War Department joins) urging the correctness of the petitioner's contention and uniting with him in challenging the decision below. The Comptroller General, contending that the decision is right and should be affirmed, states the point of inquiry to be whether the Chief of Finance and the Comptroller General can be compelled by mandatory injunction, the one to pay or cause to be paid the voucher in question, and the other to approve and allow credit for such payment, after the latter, on application for a decision by the disbursing officer before whom the \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n voucher was pending for payment, has rendered his decision holding such payment not authorized under existing appropriations.\n The principal question upon which the case turns, and the only one we need consider, is whether the statutes involved so plainly require the payment of the voucher that such payment constitutes a mere ministerial act on the part of the disbursing officer. Following numerous cases theretofore decided, the applicable rule in respect of the writ of mandamus is stated in Wilbur v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 206, 218\n, 219 S., 50 S.Ct. 320, 324, as follows:\n'Mandamus is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its chief use. It also is employed to compel action, when refused, in matters involving judgment and discretion, but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way nor to direct the retraction or reversal of action already taken in the exercise of either.\n\n'The duties of executive officers, such as the Secretary of the Interior, usually are connected with the administration of statutes which must be read and in a sense construed to ascertain what is required. But it does not follow that these administrative duties all involve judgment or discretion of the character intended by the rule just stated. Where the duty in a particular situation is so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt and equivalent to a positive command, it is regarded as being so far ministerial that its performance may be compelled by mandamus, unless there be provision or implication to the contrary. But where the duty is not thus plainly prescribed, but depends upon a statute or statutes the construction or application of which is not free from doubt, it is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion which cannot be controlled by mandamus.'\n\n In Roberts, Treasurer, v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221\n, 20 S.Ct. 376, this court held that where the proper construction of a statute is \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 452]\n\u00a0\n clear, the duty of an officer called upon to act under it is ministerial in its nature and may be compelled by mandamus. The opinion points out ( page 231 of 176 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 376, 379) that every such statute to some extent requires construction by the officer; that he must read the law and, therefore, in a certain sense, construe it in order to form a judgment from its language what duty he is required to perform. 'But that does not necessarily and in all cases make the duty of the officer anything other than a purely ministerial one. If the law direct him to perform an act in regard to which no discretion is committed to him, and which, upon the facts existing, he is bound to perform, then that act is ministerial, although depending upon a statute which requires, in some degree, a construction of its language by the officer. Unless this be so, the value of this writ is very greatly impaired.' This view of the matter has been uniformly approved in subsequent decisions. See, for example, Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 37 S.Ct. 558; Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, \n280 \nU.S. 306, 318\n, 50 S.Ct. 103. The mandatory injunction here prayed for is in effect equivalent to a writ of mandamus, and governed by like considerations. Warner Valley Stock Company v. Smith, \n165 \nU.S. 28, 31\n, 33 S., 17 S.Ct. 225. With the foregoing well settled rule in mind we turn to the pertinent legislation.\n Section 36 of the Act of February 2, 1901, c. 192, 31 Stat. 748, 757, authorizes the President, when in his opinion conditions in the Philippine Islands justify such action, 'to enlist natives of those islands for service in the Army, to be organized as scouts, with such officers as he shall deem necessary for their proper control, or as troops or companies, as authorized by this Act, for the Regular Army.'\n Petitioner enlisted under this act, and it does not admit of doubt that thereby he enlisted 'for service in the Army' as a member of the organization of Philippine Scouts. One who enlists for service in the Army certainly \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 453]\n\u00a0\n becomes 'an enlisted man ... in the Army'; and when he 'shall have served thirty years' therein, he falls within the plain terms of the Act of March 2, 1907, supra, and, in accordance therewith, is entitled to 'be placed upon the retired list' with the pay and allowances therein prescribed. Statutory provisions so clear and precise do not require construction. In such case, as this court has often held, the language is conclusive. 'There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.' United States v. Shreveport Grain & El. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 77, 83\n, 53 S.Ct. 42, 44, and cases cited.\n The court below cites section 26 of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, 185; sections 22 and 26 of the Act of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 759, 770, 775; and section 17 of the Act of June 10, 1922, 42 Stat. 625, 632, in support of its view that this is a case of 'doubtful inference from statutes of uncertain meaning' in the sense of the rule stated in Wilbur v. United States, supra, hereinbefore quoted. But those sections fail, in our opinion, to disclose anything which conflicts with the positive words of section 36 of the act of 1901, supra. Section 26 of the 1916 act simply provides that captains and lieutenants of the Philippine Scouts who are citizens of the United States shall be entitled to retirement under the laws governing retirement of enlisted men of the Regular Army, but to be retired with the grade held by them at the date of their retirement. The section is confined to the officers named and has nothing to do with enlisted men. The provision was necessary, as pointed out in the brief of the Solicitor General, because prior to the enactment of the Act of June 4, 1920, supra, these officers were usually enlisted men of other branches of the Regular Army, whose appointments were of a provisional character. Special legislation was therefore required to enable them to retire with the pay and allowances of officers instead of enlisted men. The provisions in the Act of June 4, 1920, which are referred \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 454]\n\u00a0\n to, relate to 'all officers of the Philippine Scouts,' but it is expressly provided that nothing in the act shall alter the status of enlisted men. Section 17 of the Act of June 10, 1922, likewise relates to officers and former officers of the Philippine Scouts, according them the status of officers in the regular establishment; and again it is provided that the act shall not be construed as affecting the enlisted men.\n It is hard to see how it reasonably can be thought that these acts have any effect upon the status of the enlisted men, since they are limited, in express terms, to officers. They do not modify or purport to modify in any way the provisions of section 36 of the act of 1901 in respect of such enlisted men. If that conclusion were not clear, the provisos would effectually settle the doubt. Putting aside those acts, therefore, as irrelevant, we have only to consider section 36 of the act of 1901, which plainly establishes the status of petitioner as an enlisted man in the Army, and the Act of March 2, 1907, which just as plainly directs that such an enlisted man, having served thirty years as such, shall be placed upon the retired list. In this situation the duty of the disbursing officer to pay the voucher in question 'is so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt and equivalent to a positive command,' and, therefore, is 'so far ministerial that its performance may be compelled by mandamus.' Wilbur v. United States, supra, pages 218, 219 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 320, 324. It seems unnecessary to add that this duty cannot be affected by a contrary decision of the Comptroller General.\n It is said by the Comptroller General that there was no existing appropriation of public money available for payment of retired pay and allowances to petitioner. But this statement quite evidently is made only in the view that the petitioner does not come within the retirement provision of the Act of March 2, 1907, since there was \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 455]\n\u00a0\n available an existing appropriation for retired pay and allowances of enlisted men retired under that provision.\n The Chief of Finance is charged by law with the duty of disbursing all funds of the War Department, including the pay of the Army. U.S.C., title 10,  172 (10 USCA  172). The disbursing officer to whom the voucher was presented for payment, therefore, is simply a subordinate of the Chief of Finance, subject to his control and direction, and the suit was properly brought against the latter. The purpose of the suit was to control the action of the Chief of Finance, that is, to compel him to pay or cause to be paid the voucher in question. The disbursing officer as the mere agent of his superior officer is not an indispensable, although he might have been joined as a proper, party. Compare Warner Valley Stock Company v. Smith, supra, pages 34, 35 of 165 U.S., 17 S.Ct. 225; Gnerich v. Rutter, \n265 U.S. 388\n, 391-393, 44 S.Ct. 532; Webster v. Fall, \n266 \nU.S. 507\n, 45 S.Ct. 148; Alcohol Warehouse Corporation v. Canfield (C.C.A.) 11 F.(2d) 214; Dami v. Canfield (D.C.) 5 F.(2d) 533. We find no merit in the contention that the United States is a necessary party and this suit not maintainable without its consent, Payne v. Central Pac. R. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 238\n, 41 S.Ct. 314; or in the further contention that the suit cannot be maintained because petitioner has a remedy at law in the court of claims for his retired pay. Smith v. Jackson, \n246 \nU.S. 388\n, 38 S.Ct. 353; Id. (C.C.A.) 241 F. 747, 760.\n It follows that the decree of the court below, in so far as it directs a dismissal of the bill as against the respondent Coleman, must be reversed, and the decree of the Supreme Court of the District in respect of that respondent affirmed.\n As to the Comptroller General, a different situation is presented. The request for an advance decision from him came from the Chief of Finance at the request of the disbursing officer. U.S.C. Supp., title 31,  74 (31 USCA  74). The Comptroller General undertook nothing on his own \n\n[291 U.S. 442, 456]\n\u00a0\n motion, and as he asserts, did nothing either to coerce or invite the application for an advance decision. Having given that decision, his function in that regard ceased. The effect of the decision is a matter purely of law. Obviously, there is no occasion for compelling him by mandamus to recall his decision. However, he continues to retain possession of the voucher, upon the theory evidently that, having determined that the disbursing officers were without authority to make payment, it belongs in the files of his office. The view of the Supreme Court of the District, that a mandatory injunction will lie to compel a return of that voucher to the disbursing officer and to enjoin the Comptroller General from any interference with the Chief of Finance tending to prevent payment thereof to petitioner, has not, in the light of the case as now made, met with the concurrence of a majority of this court. In that situation, we, therefore, affirm, without discussion, the decree of the District Court of Appeals in so far as it relates to the Comptroller General. But it is not to be supposed that, upon having his attention called to our decision, the Comptroller General will care to retain possession of the voucher or that he will interfere in any way with its payment.\n The decree of the court below will accordingly be reversed as to the respondent Coleman, and affirmed as to the comptroller General. But, in accordance with precedent, Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, supra, page 319 of 280 U.S., 50 St.Ct. 103, the mandatory injunction to Coleman should issue directing a disposal of petitioner's application for pay upon the merits, unaffected by the opinion of the Comptroller General, and in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion as to the proper interpretation and application of the pertinent statutes. A writ in that form is better suited to the circumstances than that indicated by the Supreme Court of the District.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNICH v. GARDNER(1934)\nNo. 669\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. John N. Minnich, of Bedford, Pa., and Henry George Gress, of Somerset, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. A. E. Kountz, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, on March 21, 1929, recovered two judgments in a Pennsylvania state court against the King Motor Company, the larger one being for something over $6,000. March 26 following, execution was issued thereon, and on March 27 the sheriff levied under the execution upon the personal property of the motor company, indorsing his \n\n[292 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n levy upon the writ. On April 15 the sheriff returned 'goods on hand not sold.' Subsequently, on various dates, a writ, an alias writ, and pluries writs of venditioni exponas were issued, upon each of which the sheriff made return to the effect that goods on hand were not sold or writ not executed for want of time. On August 21, 1930, nearly seventeen months after the levy of execution, petitioner directed the sheriff in writing that he must advertise all the goods taken under the original levy and sell them immediately. On the same day the sheriff advertised the goods for sale to be held August 29 following. August 25 a Pennsylvania state court of equity appointed a receiver for the King Motor Company and ordered a stay of the execution until final determination of the matter. August 30 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the motor company, upon which an adjudication of bankruptcy was made on September 19. All the personal property of the motor company having been sold by the trustee, it was agreed that $1,776.17, being 50 per cent. of the proceeds of such sale, represented the value of the goods levied upon in behalf of petitioner on March 27, 1929, and included in the trustee's sale. The referee in bankruptcy, after deducting for the costs which would have been incurred if the goods had been sold by the sheriff, awarded that sum to petitioner.\n The referee found, among other things, that petitioner had issued the writ of execution with an intention to collect his money, which he never relinquished or interrupted; that he had no intention to refrain from exacting payment or helping the debtor to hinder other creditors; that the indulgence was good business policy when it is considered that petitioner realized less than one-third of the amount called for by the execution. The referee concluded that petitioner had acted in good faith.\n On review the federal district court, sitting in bankruptcy, held that petitioner had no valid lien against the \n\n[292 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n fund and was not entitled to any distribution ahead of certain priority wage claims. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had made his levy solely for the purpose of acquiring a lien without a genuine intention of proceeding promptly for the collection of his debt, that he had not met the test of good faith, and, therefore, had failed to establish his lien upon the fund. 66 F.(2d) 561.\n Conceding that petitioner intended not to proceed promptly for the collection of his debt, and that his levy was made solely for the purpose of acquiring a lien, we think the conclusion drawn therefrom by the lower court-that he had failed to establish his lien upon the fund-does not follow, since it fails to give effect to the positive order of the petitioner, made nine days before the bankruptcy proceedings were begun, directing the sheriff to proceed at once under the original levy to advertise for sale and sell the goods. The effect of the intention and purpose ascribed to petitioner would be to destroy the priority of the lien obtained by his levy and thereby expose him to the risk of having his execution postponed in favor of purchasers and subsequent execution creditors. It, nevertheless, would continue good against the judgment debtor and all others not acquiring rights or liens. This, undoubtedly, is the general rule (e.g., In re Zeis (C.C.A.) 245 F. 737, 739; In re Schwab Printing Company (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 726, 728; Keel v. Larkin, 72 Ala. 493, 502, 503), and is fully recognized by the Pennsylvania decisions (Kent, Santee & Co's Appeal, 87 Pa. 165, 167; McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 85 Pa. 317, 322; Mentz v. Hamman, 5 Whart.(Pa.) 150, 153, 34 Am.Dec. 546; Fletcher's Appeal (Pa. 1860) 17 Leg.Int. 300). In Eberle v. Mayer, 1 Rawle ( Pa.) 366, it was held that an order given by an execution creditor to stay proceedings on his execution until further directions was a waiver of his priority in favor of a second execution received by the sheriff during the pendency of the stay. By \n\n[292 U.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n such order, it was said (page 369 of 1 Rawle), 'the plaintiff's execution must be considered as dormant, and constructively fraudulent as against the subsequent execution.'\n The general rule is equally well established that in the absence of any intervening rights or liens a direction to the sheriff to proceed with the sale has the effect of reviving the rights obtained by the original levy, that is to say, of reviving not the lien, but the priority of the lien as against all other liens and rights acquired after such direction. In re Zeis, supra; In re Schwab Printing Company, supra; Miller v. Kosch, 74 Hun, 50, 52, 26 N.Y.S. 183; Sweetser v. Matson, 153 Ill. 568, 584, 39 N. E. 1086, 27 L.R.A. 374, 46 Am.St.Rep. 911. We are of opinion that this general rule obtains in Pennsylvania. It was recognized as applicable to a Pennsylvania judgment as early as 1811 in Berry v. Smith, 3 Wash. C.C. 60, Fed. Cas. No. 1,359. The judgment considered in that case had been rendered by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and a fieri facias had issued with direction to the sheriff not to levy it until further instructions. A few days later the sheriff was directed to proceed with the levy. It was held that a second execution levied in the meantime, if pursued, would take preference, but otherwise if the second execution were issued after the countermand. Mr. Justice Washington, delivering the opinion, said: 'The order of suspension deprives the act of the officer, in pursuance of it, of all its force and effect, until it is restored by a countermand; and if, in the mean time, a second execution is taken out and levied, the former must be postponed;-not so, if the second execution issues subsequent to such countermand; and upon this distinction, the decision of the case of Huber v. Schnell (1 Browne (Pa.) 16), in the common pleas of this state, seems to be entirely correct.'\n In Freeburger's Appeal, 40 Pa. 244, it was held that an execution issued only for the purpose of a lien will be postponed to a subsequent execution issued in good faith. It \n\n[292 U.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n appeared there that the sheriff had been instructed, when the execution was placed in his hands, not to proceed until further orders, and thereafter to make a levy but not sell. Subsequently the sheriff was told to go on and sell; but the evidence did not make clear that the last order was given prior to the issue of the second execution. The court, therefore, sustained the lien of the second execution, saying, 'All this,' referring to the evidence, 'leaves it quite uncertain whether the orders to sell under the first execution were prior or subsequent to the issue of the second. But as it is clearly established that the first was used merely as a security until those orders were given, it is incumbent upon Cameron & Billmeyer (first judgment creditors) to prove affirmatively that they were given before the sheriff received the second writ. This they have failed to do, and their execution, therefore, has lost its priority.' This decision clearly imports the converse of the proposition, namely, that if it had been shown that the orders to sell were given before the receipt of the second execution, the first execution would not have lost its priority. See 2 Freeman on Executions,  206, p. 1043, n. 138. Our attention has been called to no Pennsylvania decision, and our examination discloses none, which conflicts with that conclusion. In the present case, the proof establishes and the court below concedes that an order to sell, which antedated by nine days the filing of the involuntary petition in bankruptcy, was in fact given.\n Since the effect of that order was to revive the priority of the lien, not to create a new one, and since that lien had attached long prior to the beginning of the four months' period preceding the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, it was not affected by the provisions of section 67f of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  107(f), which declare all liens obtained, etc., within such period null and void. In re Zeis, supra, 740, 741 of 245 F.; In re Schwab Printing Company, supra, 728 of 59 F.(2d), and cases cited. \n\n[292 U.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n Respondents suggest that, in any event, the case involves the further question whether, as wage claimants, each of them is entitled under a designated Pennsylvania statute to priority to the extent of $200 over the execution creditor. So far as the record discloses that question is raised here for the first time. The report of the referee recites that a preference for the claims, not to exceed $600 to each claimant, was sought under section 64b(5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  104(b)(5). That subdivision has no relation to claims arising under state law, and no mention of any such claims is made in the referee's report or in the decision of either of the courts below or in the record. In no view of the matter is the question properly before us for consideration.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY BARGE LINE CO. v. U.S.(1934)\nNo. 807\nArgued: April 5, 1934Decided: April 30, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri, Eastern Division. \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James R. Van Slyke and Truman Post Young, both of St. Louis, Mo., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D.C., for appellees the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Elmer A. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Illinois Cent. R. Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, Mississippi Valley Barge Line Company, is a common carrier by water, operating towboats and barges on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. It derives a large part of its earnings from the transportation \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n of sugar, which it carries from New Orleans to Cincinnati and St. Louis and intermediate ports. It is in active competition with rail carriers serving the same ports and inland points beyond.\n In 1932, the Illinois Central Railroad Company and other carriers by rail filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission proposed schedules of reduced rates on sugar from New Orleans to northern points, the rates to become effective October 1 of that year. The aim of the reduction was to meet the competition of the appellant and other carriers by water who had been able by reason of low and unregulated rates to divert to themselves a large part of the traffic in sugar that till then had moved by rail. The railway companies perceived that they were threatened with still heavier losses in the future unless something was done by a reduction of their own charges to recover the business that was slipping from their grasp. Indeed the change had gone so far that already they were hauling practically no sugar within the field of competition. In 1932 the barge movement amounted to over 500,000 tons, about ten times as much as moved all-rail from Louisiana to the north. Of the water borne traffic, by far the greater part was carried by the Federal Barge Line, which has acquiesced in the new schedules, perfering to let the rail carriers fix the rate level. The residue has been carried, part of it by this appellant, part by the American Barge Company, and part by tramp or contract operators. During the year 1932, one railway company, the Illinois Central, lost about half a million dollars by traffic thus diverted. The new schedules that were filed in the attempt to retrieve these losses proposed two different sets of rates, one based upon a minimum weight of 60,000 pounds per car, and the other upon a minimum weight of 80,000 pounds per car. To illustrate their effect, the old rate between New Orleans and Chicago had \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n been 56 cents per 100 pounds; the new one was 30 cents per 100 pounds for the 80,000 minimum and 39 cents per 100 pounds for the 60,000 minimum. Between New Orleans and St. Louis the old rate of 52 cents became 28 cents and 34 cents.\n Protests against these changes having been filed by the appellant and others, the Interstate Commerce Commission proceeded to an investigation under section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15(7), and in the meantime ordered that the schedules be suspended. There were full hearings of the parties in interest, with testimony and argument. On July 3, 1933, the Commission found by its report that the respondents (the interveners in the court below) had justified the proposed rates with the 60,000 pound minimum. It found that they had not justified the proposed rates with the 80,000 pound minimum, but that they had justified rates 4 cents higher. 'So far as the 80,000 pound minimum is concerned,' the Commission said, 'this means all-rail rates from New Orleans of 34 cents to Chicago and 32 cents to St. Louis.' Sugar Cases of 1933, 195 I.C.C. 127. The rail carriers accepted this proposal, and an amended order of the Commission gave approval to the schedules so revised.\n Under the Urgent Deficiencies Act (October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 48 (28 USCA  47, 48)), the Mississippi Valley Barge Line Company filed a bill to enjoin and set aside the order of the Commission, joining the United States and the Commission as defendants. A number of rail carriers who had been respondents in the proceeding were allowed to intervene. After the filing of answers the suit was heard by a District Court of three judges in accordance with the statute. 28 U.S.C.  47 (28 USCA  47). None of the evidence received by the Commission was placed before the court. All that the court had, aside from the report and orders, was a group of affidavits by the complainant's officers, which were in substance to the \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n effect that the water carriers would be unable to compete with the carriers by rail if the schedules were to stand approved. These affidavits were received without objection as to their form, but subject to the objection that they were inadmissible in so far as they were inconsistent with what had been found in the report. The court dismissed the bill, holding that the findings of the report were conclusive as to the facts, and that they were sufficient on their face to uphold the lowered rates. 4 F.Supp. 745. An appeal to this court followed. Judicial Code,  210, 28 U. S.C.  47a (28 USCA  47a).\n The settled rule is that the findings of the Commission may not be assailed upon appeal in the absence of the evidence upon which they were made. Spiller v. A., T. & S.F.R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 125\n, 40 S.Ct. 466; Louisiana & Pine Bluff R. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 114, 116\n, 42 S.Ct. 25; Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318, 324\n, 43 S.Ct. 583; Edward Hines Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 44 S.Ct. 72; C.I. & L.R. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287, 295\n, 46 S.Ct. 226. The appellant did not free itself of this restriction by submitting additional evidence in the form of affidavits by its officers. For all that we can know, the evidence received by the Commission overbore these affidavits or stripped them of significance. The findings in the report being thus accepted as true, there is left only the inquiry whether they give support to the conclusion. Quite manifestly they do. The structure of a rate schedule calls in peculiar measure for the use of that enlightened judgment which the commission by training and experience is qualified to form. Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 78 L.Ed. --, April 2, 1934. It is not the province of a court to absorb this function to itself. I.C.C. v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 100\n, 33 S. Ct. 185; Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S.Ct. 500; Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 47 S.Ct. 222. The judicial func- \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n tion is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body. In this instance the care and patience with which the Commission fulfilled its appointed task are plain, even to the casual reader, upon the face of its report. The rates were not approved as the respondents had submitted them. For the 80,000 pound minimum, they were found to be too low. Not till there had been an increase of 4 cents per 100 pounds did the schedule win approval. There was a sedulous endeavor to guard against a rate war that would end in mere oppression.\n We are told for the appellant that upon the face of the report the Commission has been heedless of the mandate of a statute. By section 500 of Transportation Act 1920 (Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 499, 49 U.S.C.  142 (49 USCA  142)) 'it is declared to be the policy of Congress to promote, encourage, and develop water transportation, service, and facilities in connection with the commerce of the United States, and to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation.' Following this declaration, which is in the last title of the act, a duty is imposed upon the Secretary of War to do certain acts with the object of developing facilities for inland waterway transportation, and in particular to investigate the subject of water terminals both for inland waterway traffic and for through traffic by water and rail; to advise and co-operate with communities, cities and towns; and to ascertain whether the inland waterways 'are being utilized to the extent of their capacity' and are meeting the demands of traffic. By earlier sections of the act ( section 418; 49 U.S.C.  15(1-4), 49 USCA  15(1-4), the regulatory powers of the Commission had been broadened in respect of through or joint rates for carriers by rail and water, Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 29, 36\n, 47 S.Ct. 486, and by the Inland Waterways Transportation Act as amended in 1928, these pow- \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n ers had a new extension. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 891,  2, 45 Stat. 978; 49 U.S.C.  153(e), 49 USCA  153(e); United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 457\n, 54 S.Ct. 471, March 5, 1934\n\n\n For the determination of this case there is no need to go into the question whether the declaration of the policy of Congress to foster rail and water transportation creates a new standard of duty for the Commission in the ordering of rates, or is a source of private rights if the duty is ignored. That question does not become important until the policy of the lawmakers appears to have been flouted; and here it was obeyed. The admonition does not mean that carriers by rail shall be required to maintain a rate that is too high for fear that through the change they may cut into the profits of carriers by water. The most that it can mean, unless, conceivably, in circumstances of wanton or malicious injury, is that where carriers by land and water are brought within the range of the regulatory powers of the Commission, as e.g., in establishing through routes or joint rates, there shall be impartial recognition and promotion of the interests of all.\n No discrimination of that kind is proved or even charged. The rates affected by this schedule do not involve the division of joint earnings between land and water carriers. The appellant makes its own rates from port to port, and may increase or lower them at will. What has been done by the Commission affects the carriers by rail alone, at least in its immediate consequences. Transportation by water may feel the repercussions of regulation elsewhere. It has not been regulated directly. Even for transportation by land, the Commission has done no more than establish a permissive minimum, and this a minimum sufficient to give assurance that the carriage of the sugar will not involve a loss. 'There is no reasonable doubt,' we are told in the report, 'that the proposed rates are high enough to pay more than the cost of service.' \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n The appellant insists that it is fighting for its life, and that the effect of the new competition will be to drive it out of business. Nothing in the findings gives substance to the fear. There is significance in the fact that the Federal Barge Line, the leading carrier by water, submitted without protest. We do not overlook a sentence that the appellant has lifted from its setting and put before us as a finding. 'If respondents succeed, the barge lines will be dealt a staggering blow.' Taken by themselves the words suggest a finding that the new schedules will affect the barge lines to the point of destruction, or something very near it. Read in the light of the context, they are not a finding at all, but a summary of the grounds of protest, an outline of the pleadings, or of what amounts to the pleadings before an administrative body. This being so, we do not now consider whether the destruction of a rival through the mere force of competition is legally a wrong, unless 'disinterested malevolence' (American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350, 258\n, 41 S.Ct. 499), or something akin thereto, has supplied the motive power. M. Steinert & Sons Co. v. Tagen, 207 Mass. 394, 397, 93 N.E. 584, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1013; Nann v. Raimist, 255 N.Y. 307, 319, 174 N.E. 690, 73 A.L.R. 669.\n There is no substance to the contention that the effect of the report is to give the sanction of the Commission to an illegal combination in restraint of trade and commerce.\n Nor is there substance to the contention that discretion was abused by denying a rehearing. United States v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 53 S.Ct. 406.\n For the purposes of this appeal we have assumed, as it was assumed in the court below, that the appellant has a standing sufficient to maintain the suit. See, however, Sprunt & Son, Inc., v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 249\n, 50 S.Ct. 315. We have made a like assumption in answer to the argument of counsel for the railways that the order of the Com- \n\n[292 U.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n mission is negative in form and substance, and hence not subject to review. Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229\n, 53 S.Ct. 124. These objections to the suit coalesce to such an extent with the merits of the appellant's grievance under section 500 of the statute (Transportation Act 1920) as to make it unnecessary to separate them.\n The decree is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC.

They delivered five loads \n\n[290 U.S. 576, 577]\n\u00a0\n directly to defendant and the other loads to connecting carriers that delivered them to defendant. It hauled all from Little Rock to destination. The shipments moved under uniform live stock contracts1 issued by the initial carriers. They contain the following clauses:\n'Section 2. (c) Claims for loss, damage, or injury to live stock must be made in writing to the originating or delivering carrier or carriers issuing this bill of lading within six months after the delivery of the live stock ... provided, that if such loss, damage or injury was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery. ...\n\n'Section 4. (c) Before the live stock is removed from the possession of the carrier or mingled with other live stock the shipper, owner, consignee or agent thereof shall inform in writing the delivering carrier of any visible or manifest injury to the live stock.'\n\n Plaintiffs did not sue until after the expiration of the time specified in the contract for notice or filing of claim; and they did not, before suit, give notice of or make any claim against defendant or any of the carriers for the loss or damage sued for, section 2(c), or give defendant the information specified in section 4(c). Their petition alleges that some of the cattle were killed and others injured by defendant's negligence in handling the cars in which the shipments moved over its line. The answer denied negligence and alleged that plaintiffs had not complied with the quoted contract provisions. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs, and the trial court gave them judg- \n\n[290 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n ment thereon. The Supreme Court affirmed. 162 Okl. 194, 19 P.(2d) 337.\n The first Cummins Amendment to section 20 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S.C.  20(11), 49 USCA  20(11) and note, concerning the duty of carriers to issue receipts or bills of lading for interstate freight and their liability for loss or damage, declares, 'That it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days, for the filing of claims than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years'; and, as here construed,2 the proviso reads, 'That if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damage in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.' The phrase 'carelessness or negligence' relates to each case of loss, damage, or injury mentioned in the proviso, and in such cases carriers are not permitted to require notice or filing of claim. Barrett v. Van Pelt, \n268 \nU.S. 85, 87\n, 91 S., 45 S.Ct. 437; Chesapeake & O. Ry. Co. v. Thompson Mfg.

Section 4(c) of the contract does not purport to make compliance with it a condition precedent to suit, and we need not decide whether in any case it could be so read. It does not expressly apply to loss or injuries caused by the carrier's negligence. If construed to cover such cases, the section would conflict with the proviso of the first Cummins Amendment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Prescribed by Domestic Bill of Lading and Live Stock Contract, 64 I.

MAURER(1934)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 237, 238]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank L. Guerena, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Edward D. Lyman and P. B. Plumb, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n International Re-Insurance Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. It had a place of business and real and personal property in California. On April 19, 1933, the Court of Chancery of Delaware appointed Arthur G. Logan of that State, Carl M. Hansen of Pennsylvania, and George De B. Keim of New Jersey, primary receivers of all its property. The statutes of Delaware purport to vest in receivers so appointed title, as quasi assignees, to all property, wherever located, except real estate not situated within the State. Rev. Code Del.  3884. The order appointing the primary receivers authorized them to apply in other jurisdictions for the appointment of ancillary receivers. On the day of their appointment, they filed, in the federal court for Southern California, a petition, or bill, praying that ancillary receivers be ap- \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n pointed of property there located. The prayer was granted ex parte. W. H. Comstock of California and De B. Keim were appointed ancillary receivers. And an order issued enjoining all persons from interfering with their possession and control.\n On the same day, E. Forrest Mitchell, the Insurance Commissioner of California, filed, in the Superior Court of that State, a petition praying that he be placed in the possession of the property and business of the Corporation. That court entered immediately an order temporarily enjoining the Corporation from disposing of its property in California; and ordered the Insurance Commissioner to take possession thereof. Its license to transact the business of workmen's compensation insurance in California had been revoked by the Commissioner prior to the appointment of the primary receivers.\n Service was promptly made of the orders issued by the two courts. A dispute arose as to the exact times of the filing of the several proceedings; of the entry of the orders; of the service thereof; and of taking possession. To resolve the controversy, the Insurance Commissioner filed in the federal court, on May 2, 1933, a motion to vacate its order appointing the ancillary receivers; to dissolve the restraining order; and to dismiss the petition of the primary receivers. The motion alleged that, before the federal court assumed to act, the California court had acquired jurisdiction and the Insurance Commissioner had actually taken possession of the Corporation's property. It charged, among other things, that the petition of the primary receivers on which the appointment of the ancillary receivers had been made, did not state facts sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of the subject-matter or of the parties; and that both the order of appointment and the restraining order were, therefore, invalid. \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 240]\n\u00a0\n At the hearing of the motion, it was admitted that 'the situation presented is within the California statute providing for proceedings against delinquent insurance companies'; that the California assets of the Corporation 'were in the possession of the Insurance Commissioner at the time of the appointment and qualification of the receivers appointed by the district court'; and that the proceeding brought by the primary receivers had been filed a few minutes before the Insurance Commissioner made his application to the state court. On these facts, the District Court held, that since the proceeding brought by the primary receivers ws 'first filed in this court, jurisdiction of the res is in the district court.' Upon a rehearing had on additional affidavits, the court re- affirmed its denial of the motion to vacate the order appointing the ancillary receivers.\n From this judgment, the Insurance Commissioner appealed to the Court of Appeals. There he contended that the original proceedings, in which the primary receivers petitioned for the appointment of ancillary receivers, was not a bill of complaint and was insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the District court, cf. McCandless v. Furlaud (C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 925; 1 that the subsequent amendments purporting to state a cause of action against the Corporation, were inoperative to sustain the jurisdiction of the federal court because they were not filed until after the state court had acquired possession of the property; and that the bill, even as amended, did not state a cause of action in which a valid order appointing ancillary receivers could be made.\n The Court of Appeals, in an elaborate opinion, affirmed the judgment of the District Court, 69 F.(2d) 233, 237. It did not pass upon the Commissioner's contention that the \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 241]\n\u00a0\n ancillary appointment could not be made upon the bill as it was originally filed, because it held that the subsequent amendments related back to the commencement of the proceedings. It overruled his objection that the bill failed to allege that the Corporation was insolvent or that the complainant in the primary suit was a judgment creditor, on the ground that any such defects were cured by the amendments or waived by the Corporation's answer. It held that the rule of Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, did not prevent the appointment of ancillary receivers, because here the primary receivers did not ask that they themselves be appointed ancillary receivers, and did ask specifically that the 'rights of creditors in the foreign jurisdiction be safeguarded.' It concluded that the state and federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction of the subject-matter; and that the federal court was entitled to exercise its jurisdiction, because of the prior filing in it of the proceedings for the appointment of ancillary receivers.\n Although the Court of Appeals discussed, also, questions of federal jurisdiction and venue, it did not refer specifically to the fact that a lack of diversity of citizenship appeared affirmatively, on the amended pleadings, one of the primary receivers as well as the Corporation being a citizen of Delaware. Nor was this fact relied upon by the Insurance Commissioner in his petition for certiorari or in oral argument here. He prayed for the writ solely on the ground that the Court of Appeals should have decided that 'the original bill filed in the District Court was insufficient to state a cause of action or to ocnfer jurisdiction'; and that the amendments thereto filed after the commencement of the suit in the state court could not operate to cure the defects of the original bill. But, as the lack of diversity of citizenship appears upon examination of the record, we have no occasion to pass upon the contentions made. The order appointing the \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 242]\n\u00a0\n ancillary receivers must be set aside because the District Court lacked federal jurisdiction of the cause.\n First. If the jurisdiction of the District Court must rest on diversity of citizenship, it fails because one of the plaintiffs is a citizen of the same state as the defendant. Hooe v. Jamieson, \n166 \nU.S. 395\n, 17 S.Ct. 596. The proceeding in the District Court was entitled 'Bertha E. Maurer v. International Re-insurance Corporation'; and that title has been used in all later proceedings in that court, in the Court of Appeals and in this Court. If Bertha E. Maurer had actually been the plaintiff, there would have been diversity of citizenship; for she is a citizen of New Jersey. But, in fact, Bertha E. Maurer was not a party to the application for the appointment of the ancillary receivers; was not later made a party to the suit; and has not appeared at any stage of the proceedings. Her name was used, doubtless, because she was the plaintiff in the suit against the Corporation brought in the Court of Chancery of Delaware in which the primary receivers were appointed. \n2\n The application in the case at bar for the appointment of ancillary receivers was made by, and in the name of, the primary receivers. They sue as quasi-assignees claiming to be entitled to the possession of the balance of the California property after its administration by the District Court of California. In the original application filed April 19, 1933 they called themselves petitioners. In the amendments filed six days later, the application is called a 'bill of complaint.' It is so designated in the answer of the Corporation, filed at the same time. We necessarily treat the primary receivers as the plaintiffs. \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 243]\n\u00a0\n Second. Apparently this lack of diversity jurisdiction was regarded as immaterial by the Court of Appeals, on the ground that the suit was an ancillary one. For the opinion states: 'Finally it has been held that an ancillary suit in a federal court does not depend on diverse citizenship.' This position is adopted in the brief of the primary receivers, but the contention is unsound. Where the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court is based upon diversity of citizenship, proceedings therein in intervention being ancillary, the jurisdiction rests upon that of the main cause. Cincinnati, etc., R. Co. v. Indianapolis, etc., Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 107\n, 46 S.Ct. 221. The same rule is applicable to sustain jurisdiction of independent suits which are ancillary to an original suit in the same court. White v. Ewing, \n159 \nU.S. 36\n, 15 S.Ct. 1018. Whether the rule may ever be applied to a suit brought in a federal court of another district; and whether a suit for the appointment of ancillary receivers in another federal district is an ancillary suit within the meaning of the rule does not appear to have been decided by this Court. \n3\n We need not decide either question now. For the rule can have no application where primary receivers appointed by a state court bring a suit for the appointment of ancillary receivers in the federal court for another State. Obviously such an application is not ancillary to any proceedings in any federal court. It is an independent original bill. Being such, it cannot be sustained when diversity of citizenship \n\n[293 U.S. 237, 244]\n\u00a0\n does not exist and no other ground of federal jurisdiction is shown.\n Third. Unlike an objection to venue, lack of federal jurisdiction cannot be waived or be overcome by an agreement of the parties. An appellate federal court must satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts in a cause under review. 4 Mansfield, etc., R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S.Ct. 510. Hence, the failure of the Insurance Commissioner to claim, in his petition for certiorari, that the order of the District Court was void for lack of federal jurisdiction of the suit, and his failure otherwise to call to the attention of this Court the lack of diversity of citizenship are immaterial. The Court of Appeals pointed out that under Judicial Code ,  274c (28 USCA  399), where 'jurisdiction of the district court is based upon the diverse citizenship of the parties, and such diverse citizenship in fact existed at the time the suit was brought, ... though defectively alleged, either party may amend at any stage of the proceedings and in the appellate court upon such terms as the court may impose.' But, in the case at bar, the admitted facts preclude such an amendment. Diversity of citizenship confessedly did not exist.\n The judgment is reversed; and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill for want of federal jurisdiction.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For disposition of the case by this Court, see \n293 \nU.S. 67\n, 55 S.Ct. 42. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Similarly, in McCandless v. Furlaud, \n293 \nU.S. 67\n, 55 S.Ct. 42. the petition for the appointment of ancillary receivers filed by the primary receivers in the federal court for southern New York, bore the title of the suit in the federal court for western Pennsylvania which appointed them. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Raphael v.

JOHNSON(1934)\nNo. 555\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n Licenses k7(2).\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Iowa.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul E. Roadifer, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, M. D. Kirk, of Tulsa, Okl., and George S. Wright, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, for appellant.\n Mr. L. W. Powers, of Denison, Iowa, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant filed a bill in the District Court for Southern Iowa, seeking a declaration that the laws of Iowa laying a tax on motor vehicle fuel violate state and federal constitutional provisions, and an injunction against their enforcement by state officers. A temporary injunction issued, but a court of three judges, upon final hearing, dismissed the suit. \n1\n The case is here on direct appeal.\n The General Assembly of the state, in order to raise revenue for the improvement of highways, imposed a license fee of two cents per gallon on all motor vehicle fuel 'used or otherwise disposed of in this state for any purpose whatsoever'; and directed that 'Any person using motor vehicle fuel within the state shall be liable for the fee herein provided for unless the same shall have \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n been previously paid.' \n2\n By a later statute an additional license fee of one cent per gallon was imposed. \n3\n The law (Code Iowa 1931,  5093-a2 et seq.) defines 'distributor' as 'any person who brings into the state or who produces, refines, manufactures or compounds within the state any motor vehicle fuel to be used within the state or sold or otherwise disposed of by him within the state for use in the state.' 'Person' is defined to include partnerships, corporations, and associations. One who sells at retail is required to keep posted in a public place a placard showing the total sale price per gallon, including license fee, and to have printed on the placard the words, 'state license fee included.' It is declared unlawful to conduct the business of a distributor unless a certificate giving certain information is filed with the state treasurer and a license is procured permitting the conduct of that business. Every distributor is required on or before the twentieth day of each calendar month to file with the state treasurer a report showing the total number of gallons imported by him during the preceding calendar month, with details as to each shipment, and at the same time to remit to the treasurer the amount of the license fee for such preceding month; he may, however, deduct 3 per cent. of the gallonage for evaporation and loss. If after the fee is remitted the fuel is destroyed by casualty not due to the fault of the distributor, before being sold or used, a refund of the tax paid \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n thereon is to be made by the state treasurer. The act declares that its provisions are not to apply to foreign or interstate commerce. (As distributors import gasoline into Iowa for reshipment to other states, the state treasurer has, in the administration of the acts, permitted a deduction in the monthly reports of any gasoline so sold and reshipped to points outside the state.)\n There is provision that one using fuel purchased for a purpose other than for a motor vehicle may, upon making claim upon the state treasurer in proper form and in due time, obtain a refund of the amount of the tax paid in respect of it.\n A penalty of 10 per cent. of the amount of the tax is imposed upon a distributor who fails to remit on or before the twentieth of the month following the importation. The Attorney General is empowered to bring action on behalf of the state against any distributor who is in default for thirty days in payment of tax. The state treasurer is authorized to revoke the license of a distributor who fails to render the prescribed reports, or renders a false report, or fails to pay the license fee when due, and he need not renew the license until satisfied that the applicant will in future comply with the law. Distributors are required to permit inspection of their books, records, papers, invoices, and equipment. It is made a misdemeanor for a distributor or any principal officer to refuse to submit the prescribed reports and certificates to the treasurer, or to refuse an examination of books, records, and equipment by the treasurer or his representatives, or to violate other provisions. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant is an Arizona corporation whose business is the buying, manufacturing, blending, and selling of gasoline and kindred products, including the importation into Iowa of gasoline by tank cars, trucks, and other con- \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n tainers, for resale to consumers and to dealers who sell to consumers, and the exportation of gasoline to other states; the maintenance of storage facilities in Iowa, from which deliveries are made in that and other states, and the maintenance of a refinery at Carter Lake, Iowa, where gasoline is blended and compounded and shipped to points in Iowa and other states. Prior to April, 1932, gasoline was refined at this plant. The corporation maintains numerous service stations in Iowa which sell to consumers. Upon the filing of a certificate with the state treasurer the company received a distributor's license; and between May, 1927, and May, 1932, paid to the state treasurer monthly, in accordance with the reports rendered, many thousand dollars as license fees. There was included in the amount so reported and paid a tax at the rate of three cents per gallon on gasoline imported into Iowa and gasoline refined and manufactured at the refinery at Carter Lake. No question seems to have been raised as to the applicability and validity of the statute until about May, 1932. At that time a controversy arose out of the following facts:\n Carter Lake, Iowa, where the appellant's refinery is located, now lies on the west shore of the Missouri river, not far from Omaha, Neb. It was originally on the east side of the river, the interstate boundary. By an avulsion the stream changed its course to the east of Carter Lake, but the old bed remained the interstate boundary. The refinery ships large quantities of gasoline to points in Nebraska and also to points in Iowa. The question arising whether the appellant should report gasoline which was ultimately distributed in Iowa upon its arrival at Carter Lake, or its manufacture there, or when it was shipped from Carter Lake to other points in Iowa, the state treasurer and the appellant agreed that importations into Carter Lake need not be treated as im- \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n portations into Iowa, but when gasoline arriving at Carter Lake or there manufactured should be shipped to other points in Iowa, it should be treated as then imported into the state for the purpose of report and payment of the tax by the appellant. This arrangement was made for the convenience of the parties.\n Prior to May, 1932, the appellant shipped forty tank cars of gasoline from the refinery at Carter Lake to destinations in Iowa, for sale and use there. Its employees and agents altered the invoices and waybills on these shipments so as to show 'gas-oil' instead of gasoline, and omitted to report them to the state treasurer, or to pay tax upon them, as should have been done in accordance with the arrangement mentioned. When the state treasurer called appellant's attention to the falsification of its reports the representatives of the company for the first time asserted that as gasoline moving from Carter Lake to other points in Iowa had to pass through Nebraska the shipments were interstate, and a tax on them would be a burden upon interstate commerce. The state treasurer, having confirmed the facts by an audit of the company's books, caused the appellant and certain of its officers to be indicted for making a false return, procured the Attorney General to bring a civil action against the appellant by attachment to recover the unpaid tax on gasoline imported and used within the state, and notified the appellant that he had revoked its license as a distributor. The individual defendants pleaded guilty and were fined, and the indictment was dismissed, as to the company. The civil suit was pending when the present bill was filed, asserting the invalidity of the law, and praying that the state treasurer and other officials be enjoined from interfering with the conduct of appellant's business as a distributor, from collecting the taxes imposed by the statutes, and from prosecuting the civil action in the state court. \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n The District Court, whose jurisdiction was invoked by reason of diversity of citizenship as well as the alleged conflict of the state statutes and the Federal Constitution, dismissed the bill. The decision is challenged for several reasons, but we are of opinion that it was proper.\n\n 1. \nThe amendatory act by which an additional tax of one cent per gallon was imposed is said to violate provisions of the Iowa Constitution respecting the title and the substance of taxing laws. The District Court examined these contentions and found them without merit. We concur in its conclusions.\n\n 2. \nThere is no substance in the claim that the statutes impose a burden upon interstate commerce, contrary to the prohibition of article 1, section 8, cl. 3, of the Federal Constitution. The appellant insists that the tax is a direct tax on motor vehicle fuel imported. The court below concluded that the law laid an excise upon the use of fuel for the propulsion of vehicles on the highways of the state. The state officials have administered the tax on this theory. We think this the correct view. The levy is not on property but upon a specified use of property. Altitude Oil Co. v. People, 70 Colo. 452, 202 P. 180; Standard Oil Co. of Louisiana v. Brodie, 153 Ark. 114, 293 S.W. 753. It is not laid upon the importer for the privilege of importing (compare Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 41 S.Ct. 606), but falls on the local use after interstate commerce has ended. Compare Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643; Nashville, c. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191; Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., \n289 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 591. The statute in terms imposes the tax on motor vehicle fuel used or otherwise disposed of in the state. Instead of collecting the tax from the user through its own officers, the state makes the distributor its agent for that purpose. This is a common and entirely lawful arrangement. Cit- \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n izens' National Bank v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 443, 454\n, 30 S.Ct. 532; Pierce Oil Corporation v. Hopkins, \n264 \nU.S. 137\n, 44 S.Ct. 251; Standard Oil Co. of Louisiana v. Brodie, supra; Standard Oil Co. v. Jones, 48 S.D. 482, 205 N.W. 72. The distributor who reports the gasoline and pays the tax is required to pass the burden on to the consumer, who is advised that in addition to the price of the gasoline he is paying a license fee to the state. To prevent evasion the distributor must pay and pass on the tax on all gasoline imported or distributed, irrespective of its ultimate use; but as some purchasers employ the gasoline for a purpose other than the propulsion of a motor vehicle, and as the burden of the tax has been passed on to them as well as those who desire a motor fuel, provision is made for a refund to the former. Since the law declares that the levy is only upon use of motor vehicle fuel in the state, and the intent is not to affect interstate commerce, the state treasurer properly permits distributors to deduct as a credit from the gasoline returned as imported into the state in any calendar month that which has been exported from the state by the distributor. Thus gasoline passing through the state to reach its ultimate destination is exempt. It is of course true that as the report is required on the twentieth of the calendar month for transactions of the preceding month, there may at times be gasoline received in the month covered by the report which has not been exported by the twentieth of the succeeding month; but the distributor is entitled to a credit for such exportation in his report made in the next month, and the mere fact that he cannot claim an anticipatory credit for gasoline not yet exported, but intended so to be, seems to us to be too slight a burden to be of any moment, or to raise a substantial constitutional question.\n The appellant, however, says that the state officials have required it to report and to pay tax on shipments made from Oklahoma direct to dealers in Iowa who are \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n appellant's customers, and that in respect of such transactions the burden on interstate commerce is obvious. But if the gasoline so imported is intended to be used in Iowa for motor vehicle fuel it is subject to the tax. If it is not so used by the appellant's customer, or by the purchaser at retail, either may obtain a refund of the tax collected by the appellant and remitted to the state. The statute obviously was not intended to reach transactions in interstate commerce, but to tax the use of motor fuel after it had come to rest in Iowa, and the requirement that the appellant as the shipper into Iowa shall, as agent of the state, report and pay the tax on the gasoline thus coming into the state for use by others on whom the tax falls imposes no unconstitutional burden either upon interstate commerce or upon the appellant.\n\n 3. \nThe method of imposition and collection of the tax does not deny the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Complaint is made of several features of the law which are said to create arbitrary discriminations. Appellant first says that as it must pay to the state a tax of three cents on every gallon of gasoline imported, whereas the user who employs the gasoline purchased for some other purpose than motor fuel may obtain a refund of the tax paid in respect of the fluid so used, the law attempts to impose a tax on the distributor for the benefit of persons who buy or use gasoline for some purpose other than the operation of a motor vehicle on the highways, and that the result is the imposition on the distributor of a tax for the benefit of this other class of persons.\n The short answer to the contention is that the statutes properly construed lay no tax whatever upon distributors, but make of them mere collectors from users of motor vehicle fuel, and refund the tax only to that class of users upon whom no excise is intended to be laid. The distribu- \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 96]\n\u00a0\n tor does not pay the tax; the user does. It cannot therefore be said that any tax is laid upon the appellant in ease of another class of taxpayers.\n The amendatory act, levying an additional cent per gallon, is said to discriminate against the appellant because if gasoline were distilled or manufactured in Iowa it would escape taxation, since the amendatory statute refers only to gasoline 'imported and used' within the state. This statute is, however, an amendment or supplement to the earlier act taxing use and disposition of gasoline for motor fuel (see State v. Northern Iowa Oil Co., 209 Iowa, 980; 229 N.W. 214), embodies by reference provisions of the earlier law (see note 3, supra), and, as the District Court held, is therefore to be construed to cover gasoline whether imported or manufactured within the state. It appears, moreover, that no gasoline is or has been distilled or manufactured in Iowa except that which was distilled or manufactured by appellant prior to April 1, 1932. Since that date the appellant has not distilled or manufactured gasoline within the state. The appellant is not in a position to complain of any alleged discrimination arising from the terms of the statute, since it has not sustained injury and none is threatened which can affect it.\n It is asserted that naptha imported into Iowa and blended may escape the tax on the ground that it is not motor vehicle fuel imported into Iowa. The evidence, however, discloses that the officers charged with the administration of the law are insisting that the tax should be paid on naphtha so imported and blended, and in fact are now prosecuting a suit against another defendant on this theory. No reason appears why, even if such naphtha were held free of tax, this would constitute an unfair discrimination against appellant, which is required to collect from users the tax on gasoline. \n\n[292 U.S. 86, 97]\n\u00a0\n 4. The revocation of the appellant's license by the state treasurer without notice and hearing did not deprive it of property without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether in other circumstances the license contemplated by the statutes under consideration might be considered property within the protection of the due process clause we need not determine. It is sufficient in this case to advert to the undisputed facts disclosed by the record. The law Imposes no penalty for conducting the business of a distributor without a license; the only penalties mentioned are for failure to report gasoline intended for use in the state, and to pay the tax. The state officers have not sought to prevent the appellant from continuing its business as a distributor, and have in this proceeding, both by answer and by evidence, avowed their purpose to take no further action against the appellant, either criminal or civil, until the conclusion of the civil suit now pending in a state court to recover the tax, the failure to pay which was the ground of revocation of the appellant's license. The state's officials are prosecuting the action as a test suit. There is therefore no threat of immediate harm as a result of the revocation of the license, and the action of the state treasurer in revoking it cannot affect the pending civil suit or any other action civil or criminal which may hereafter be brought.\n\n 5. \nBy its bill the appellant asked an injunction against the further prosecution of the action at law in the state court for the failure to report and to pay tax on certain gasoline. The court below pointed out that section 265 of the Judicial Code (U.S.C. tit. 28,  379 (28 USCA  379)) forbids the granting of this prayer, and the appellant admitted at the bar that it could not have such relief and did not insist upon it.\n We find no error in the decision of the District Court, and its judgment must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 3 F.Supp. 189. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Acts 41st Gen.

CO.(1934)\nNo. 173\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward Davidson, of La Fayette, Ind., and John P. Bramhall, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Albert H. Cole, of Peru, Ind., for respondent. \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this action in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Indiana, Fort Wayne Division, to recover for injuries which he sustained on November 29, 1930, in the course of his employment by respondent, an interstate carrier, in its yard \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n at Russell, ky. In his complaint he set forth two 'paragraphs' or counts, both being for the same injuries. In the first paragraph, petitioner alleged that at the time of the injuries he was employed in interstate commerce and that he brought the action under the acts of Congress known as the Federal Employers' Liability Act1 and the Safety Appliance Acts,2 and the rules and orders which the Interstate Commerce Commission had promulgated under the latter. \n3\n In the second paragraph, he alleged that, at the time of the injuries, he was employed in intrastate commerce, and he invoked the Safety Appliance Acts enacted by the Congress, and the rules and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission thereunder, and the Employers' Liability Act of Kentucky. The provisions of the laws of Kentucky which were alleged to govern the rights of the parties at the time and place in question were set forth. \n4\n In each count petitioner stated that the injuries were received while he was engaged as a switchman in attempting to uncouple certain freight cars and were due to a defective uncoupling lever.\n Objections to the jurisdiction of the District Court as to each count were raised by plea in abatement. They were overruled, and petitioner had a general verdict. The judgment, entered accordingly, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the case upon \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 209]\n\u00a0\n either count, 64 F.(2d) 472. This Court granted certiorari. \n290 \nU.S. 613\n, 54 S.Ct. 60, 78 L.Ed. --.\n Distinct questions are presented with respect to each count, and they will be considered separately.\n First. By the first paragraph, the jurisdiction of the federal court was rested upon the sole ground that the injury had been sustained during petitioner's employment in interstate commerce and that the cause of action arose under the pertinent federal legislation. To support the jurisdiction of the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, the complaint alleged that respondent was engaged in business in that district at the time of the commencement of the action. Respondent's challenge to the jurisdiction was upon the grounds (1) that at the time of the injuries petitioner was not employed in interstate commerce and hence the action would not lie under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51 et seq.) and (2) that respondent was a corporation organized under the laws of Virginia and an inhabitant of the Eastern District of Virginia, and hence, so far as the action rested upon the Safety Appliance Acts of Congress (45 USCA  1 et seq.) and the rules and orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it could not be brought in a federal court in any district other than the Eastern District of Virginia. Jud. Code  51, 28 U.S.C.  112 (28 USCA  112).\n Petitioner's demurrer to the plea in abatement as to the first cause of action was sustained by the trial court. That court pointed out that the plea did not deny that respondent was doing business within the Northern District of Indiana and that the pleading, in substance, went to the merits. The Circuit Court of Appeals took a different view, holding that, so far as petitioner relied upon a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts, the action must be brought in the district of respondent's residence. In reversing the judgment, the Circuit Court of Appeals re- \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n manded the cause with instructions to grant permission to petitioner to amend his first paragraph to conform exclusively to the theory of a violation of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.\n This ruling of the appellate court cannot be sustained. The jurisdiction of the District Court is to be determined by the allegations of the complaint. Mosher v. City of Phoenix, \n287 \nU.S. 29, 30\n, 53 S.Ct. 67; Levering & Garrigues v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 105\n, 53 S.Ct. 549. These allegations clearly set forth, in the first paragraph, a cause of action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Every essential ingredient of such a cause of action was appropriately alleged. The Federal Employers' Liability Act expressly recognized that in an action brought under its provisions the question of a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts might be presented and determined. This is the unmistakable effect of the provisions that, in such an action, the employee shall not be held 'to have been guilty of contributory negligence,' or 'to have assumed the risks of his employment' in any case 'where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' Act of April 22, 1908,  3, 4, 45 U.S.C.  53, 54 (45 USCA  53, 54). By the phrase 'any statute enacted for the safety of employees,' the Congress evidently intended to embrace its Safety Appliance Acts. Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 503\n, 34 S.Ct. 635, L.R.A. 1915C, 1, Ann.Cas. 1915B, 475. This Court has said that the statutes are in pari materia and that, 'where the Employers' Liability Act refers to 'any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances,' etc., it clearly is the legislative intent to treat a violation of the Safety Appliance Act as 'negligence,'-what is sometimes called negligence per se.' San Antonio & Aransas Pass R. Co. v. Wagner, \n241 \nU.S. 476, 484\n, 36 S.Ct. 626, 630. Where an employee of an interstate carrier sustains injuries while employed in the interstate commerce of the carrier, his action \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n may thus be brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in connection with the Safety Appliance Acts. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, an action may be brought 'in a District Court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.' 45 U.S.C.  56 (45 USCA  56). It follows that, upon the allegations of the complaint, the action on the claim set forth in the first paragraph was properly brought in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana where respondent was doing business when the action was begun.\n Second. In the second paragraph of the complaint, which treated the injuries as received in intrastate commerce, diversity of citizenship was alleged, that petitioner was a citizen of Indiana, and a resident of the city of Fort Wayne in that state, and that respondent was a citizen of Virginia doing business in Indiana. The plea in abatement, admitting respondent's citizenship in Virginia, denied that petitioner was a resident of Fort Wayne or of the Northern district of Indiana, or was a citizen of that state, and alleged that, as the cause of action set forth in the second paragraph arose under the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, the action could not be brought \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n in any district other than the Eastern District of Virginia. The District Court took evidence on the issue of fact, found that the petitioner was a citizen of Indiana and a resident of Fort Wayne, and overruled the plea. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court of the Northern District of Indiana was without jurisdiction, in the view that the second count attempted to set forth a cause of action 'under the Federal Safety Appliance Act as well as under the statutes of Kentucky,' and hence that jurisdiction did not rest solely on diversity of citizenship. Jud. Code  51, 28 U.S.C.  112 (28 USCA  112). In remanding the cause, the Circuit Court of Appeals directed that petitioner be allowed to amend the second paragraph of his complaint so as to conform exclusively to the theory of a violation of the Kentucky statute.\n While invoking, in the second count, the Safety Appliance Acts, petitioner fully set forth and relied upon the laws of the state of Kentucky where the cause of action arose. In relation to injuries received in that state in intrastate commerce, aside from the particular bearing of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, the liability of respondent was determined by the laws of Kentucky. Slater v. Mexican National R. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 120, 126\n, 24 S.Ct. 581; Cuba R. Co. v. Crosby, \n222 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 32 S.Ct. 132, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 40; Young v. Masci, \n289 \nU.S. 253, 258\n, 53 S.Ct. 599; Ormsby v. Chase, \n290 \nU.S. 387\n, 54 S.Ct. 211. The statute of Kentucky, in prescribing the liability of common carriers for negligence causing injuries to employees while engaged in intrastate commerce, reproduced in substance, and with almost literal exactness, the corresponding provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act as to injuries received in interstate commerce. Ky. Acts 1918, c. 52,  1-3, p. 153, Carroll's Ky. Statutes 1930,  820b-1, 820b-2, 820b-3. The Kentucky act provided that no employee should be held 'to have been guilty of contributory negligence' or 'to have assumed the risk of his employment' in any case 'where the violation by \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n such common carrier of any statute, State or Federal, enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' Id. The Kentucky Legislature read into its statute the provisions of statutes both state and federal which were enacted for the safety of employees, and the Federal Safety Appliance Acts were manifestly embraced in this description. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617, 619\n, 37 S.Ct. 456. Thus the second count of the complaint, in invoking the Federal Safety Appliance Acts, while declaring on the Kentucky Employers' Liability Act, cannot be regarded as setting up a claim which lay outside the purview of the state statute. As in the analogous case under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a violation of the acts for the safety of employees was to constitute negligence per se in applying the state statute and was to furnish the ground for precluding the defense of contributory negligence as well as that of assumption of risk.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals took the view that, if it were assumed that the second count was based exclusively upon the Kentucky statute, that statute and the federal requirements could not be considered as being in pari materia because the latter applied only to interstate commerce, and that, if the petitioner was permitted to establish the negligence required by the state statute by showing the violation of the federal requirements, the court would thereby be placed 'in the anomalous position of extending the benefits of the Safety Appliance Act to intrastate commerce,'\n This is an erroneous view. The original Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531 (45 USCA  1 et seq.), did not embrace all cars on the lines of interstate carriers, but only those engaged in interstate commerce. Brinkmeier v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n224 \nU.S. 268\n, 32 S.Ct. 412. By the amending Act of March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 943 (45 USCA  8-10), the scope of the statute was enlarged so as to include all cars 'used on any railroad \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n engaged in interstate commerce.' The statute as amended was intended to embrace all locomotives, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad which is a highway of interstate commerce. Southern Railway Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2. With respect to such vehicles, the duty to protect employees by the prescribed safety appliances exists even though the vehicles and the employee injured through the failure to provide such protection are at the time engaged in intrastate commerce. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33\n, 36 S.Ct. 482; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, supra. The federal act in its application to such a case is thus in pari materia with the statute of Kentucky which prescribes the liability of carriers for injuries to employees while employed in intrastate commerce, and which, in effect, reads into the provisions of the statute the requirements of the federal act for the safety of employees. There appears to be no anomaly in enforcing the state law with this defined content.\n The Federal Safety Appliance Acts prescribed duties, and injured employees are entitled to recover for injuries sustained through the breach of these duties. Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1\n, 25 S. Ct. 158; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281\n, 28 S.Ct. 616; Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, supra. Questions arising in actions in state courts to recover for injuries sustained by employees in intrastate commerce and relating to the scope or construction of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts are, of course, federal questions which may appropriately be reviewed in this Court. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern R. Co. v. Taylor, supra; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, supra. But it does not follow that a suit brought under the state statute which defines liability to employees who are injured while engaged in intrastate commerce, and brings within the purview of the statute a breach of the duty imposed by the federal statute, should be regarded as a suit arising under the laws of the United States and cognizable in the \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n federal court in the absence of diversity of citizenship. The Federal Safety Appliance Acts, while prescribing absolute duties, and thus creating correlative rights in favor of injured employees, did not attempt to lay down rules governing actions for enforcing these rights. The original act of 1893 made no provision for suits, except for penalties. That act did impliedly recognize the employee's right of action by providing in section 8 that he should not be deemed to have assumed the risk of injury occasioned by the breach of duty. But the act made no provision as to the place of suit or the time within which it should be brought, or as to the right to recover, or as to those who should be the beneficiaries of recovery, in case of the death of the employee. While dealing with assumption of risk, the statute did not affect the defense of contributory negligence, and hence that defense was still available according to the applicable state law. Schlemmer v. Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburg R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 590\n, 31 S.Ct. 561; Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie R. Co. v. Popplar, \n237 \nU.S. 369, 371\n, 372 S., 35 S.Ct. 609, 610. In these respects the amended act of 1903 made no change, notwithstanding the enlargement of the scope of the statutory requirements. The act of 1910, by a proviso in section 4 relating to penalties (36 Stat. 299 (45 USCA  13)), provided that nothing in that section should 'be construed to relieve such carrier from liability in any remedial action for the death or injury of any railroad employee' caused by the use of the prohibited equipment.\n The Safety Appliance Acts having prescribed the duty in this fashion, the right to recover damages sustained by the injured employee through the breach of duty sprang from the principle of the common law (Texas & Pacific R.R. Co. v. Rigsby, supra, at pages 39, 40 of 241 U.S., 36 S.Ct. 4826) and was left to be enforced accordingly, or, in case of the death of \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 216]\n\u00a0\n the injured employee, according to the applicable statute7 (St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern R. Co. v. Taylor, supra, at page 285 of 210 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 616; Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie R. Co. v. Popplar, supra). When the Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted, it drew to itself the right of action for injuries or death of the employees within its purview who were engaged in interstate commerce, including those cases in which injuries were due to a violation of the Safety Appliance Acts. Such an action must be brought as prescribed in the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and, if brought in the state court, it cannot be removed to the federal court, although violation of the Safety Appliance Acts is involved. See St. Joseph & G.I.R. Co. v. Moore, \n243 \nU.S. 311\n, 37 S.Ct. 278. With respect to injuries sustained in intrastate commerce, nothing in the Safety Appliance Acts precluded the state from incorporating in its legislation applicable to local transportation the paramount duty which the Safety Appliance Acts imposed as to the equipment of cars used on interstate railroads. As this Court said in Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie R. Co. v. Popplar, supra, as to an action for injuries sustained in intrastate commerce: 'The action fell within the familiar category of cases involving the duty of a master to his servant. This duty is defined by the common law, except as it may be modified by legislation. The Federal statute, in the present case, touched the duty of the master at a single point, and, save as provided in the statute, the right of the \n\n[291 U.S. 205, 217]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff to recover was left to be determined by the law of the state.'\n We are of the opinion that the second paragraph of the complaint set forth a cause of action under the Kentucky statute, and, as to this cause of action, the suit is not to be regarded as one arising under the laws of the United States. In view of the diversity of citizenship and the residence of petitioner, the District Court of the Northern District of Indiana had jurisdiction.\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider any questions save those relating to the jurisdiction of the District Court, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with directions to consider such other questions as may be presented by the appeal. It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C.  51 et seq.

The cause of action arose under the laws of the territory, and was enforced in the courts of Arkansas.' The question whether the action was triable in those courts was held not to present a federal question, but the question as to the interpretation of the Safety Appliance Act of 1893 did present the federal question which was reviewed by this Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORRISON v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA(1934)\nNo. 487\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of California. \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 83]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Marion Wright, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n Mr. James S. Howie, of Los Angeles, Cal., for the People of State of California.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants have been convicted of a conspiracy to violate the Alien Land Law of the state of California.\n The indictment charges that the two appellants, Morrison and Doi, feloniously conspired to place Doi in the possession and enjoyment of agricultural land within the state; that possession was obtained, and the land used and cultivated, in execution of the conspiracy; and that Doi was an alien Japanese, ineligible to citizenship, and not protected in his possession by any treaty between the government of the United States and the government of Japan. These acts, if committed with guilty knowledge of each defendant, make out a criminal conspiracy under the statutes of the state. \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 84]\n\u00a0\n On the trial the state proved that Dio had gone upon the land and used it under an agreement with Morrison, but did not attempt to prove that he was not a citizen of the United States or that he was ineligible for citizenship. The statutes of California provide that as to these elements of the crime the burden of disproving guilt shall rest on a defendant. By section 9a of the Alien Land Law, as amended in 1927 ( California Statutes, 1927, pp. 880, 881, c. 528,  1), it is enacted that, 'in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, by the State of California, or the people thereof, under any of the provisions of this act, when the proof introduced by the state, or the people thereof, establishes the acquisition, possession, enjoyment, use, cultivation, occupation, or transferring of real property or any interest therein, or the having in whole or in part the beneficial use thereof by any defendant, or any of such fact(s), and the complaint, indictment or information alleges the alienage and ineligibility to United States citizenship of such defendant, the burden of proving citizenship or eligibility to citizenship shall thereupon devolve upon such defendant.' At the same session of the Legislature, the Code of Civil Procedure of the state was amended by the addition of a new section (1983) which in substance and effect restates the same rule. California Statutes, 1927, p. 434, c. 244. Applying these statutes to this case, the trial judge held (a jury having been waived) that both the defendants, Morrison as well as Doi, were guilty of conspiracy. They were sentenced to be imprisoned for two years, but the sentences were suspended, and the defendants placed upon probation. There was an appeal to the District Court of Appeal for the Fourth District, where the judgment was affirmed. The court overruled the defendants' contention that, by the application of section 9a of the Alien Land Law and section 1983 of the Code of Civil Procedure, there had been a denial of due process \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 13 P.(2d) 803. The cause was then transferred to the Supreme Court of California. There defendants' contention under the Fourteenth Amendment was again overruled, and the conviction was affirmed, three judges dissenting. 22 P.(2d) 718. An appeal to this court followed.\n A person of the Japanese race is a citizen of the United States if he was born within the United States. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649\n, 18 S.Ct. 456. He is a citizen, even though born abroad, if his father was a citizen, provided, however, that this privilege shall not exist unless the father was at some time a resident of the United States as well as a citizen, and provided also that such a child, who continues to reside abroad, shall, in order to receive the protection of this government, be required upon reaching the age of eighteen years to record at an American consulate his intention to become a resident and remain a citizen of the United States, and shall be further required to take the oath of allegiance to the United States upon attaining his majority. R.S.  1993; 8 U.S.C.  6 (8 USCA  6); Weedin v. Chin Bow, \n274 \nU.S. 657\n, 47 S.Ct. 772; see also R.S.  2172; 8 U.S.C.  7 ( 8 USCA  7). But a person of the Japanese race, if not born a citizen, is ineligible to become a citizen, i.e., to be naturalized. The privilege of naturalization is confined to aliens who are 'free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.' R.S.  2169; 8 U.S.C.  359 (8 USCA  359). 'White persons,' within the meaning of the statute, are members of the Causcasian race, as Caucasian is defined in the understanding of the mass of men. Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178\n, 43 S.Ct. 65; Yamashita v. Hinkle, \n260 \nU.S. 199\n, 43 S.Ct. 69; United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, \n261 \nU.S. 204, 214\n, 43 S. Ct. 338; Terrace v.

California, \n268 \nU.S. 258\n, 45 S.Ct. 490. The term \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n excludes the Chinese (United States v. Wong Kim Ark, supra; 8 U.S.C.  363 ( 8 USCA  363)), the Japanese (cases supra), the Hindus (United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, supra), the American Indians (Ozawa v. United States, supra), and the Filipinos (Toyota v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 402\n, 45 S.Ct. 563), though Indians and Filipinos who have done military or naval service may be entitled to special privileges (8 U.S.C.  3, 388 ( 8 USCA  3, 388)). Nor is the range of the exclusion limited to persons of the full blood. The privilege of naturalization is denied to all who are not white (unless the applicants are of African nativity or African descent); and men are not white if the strain of colored blood in them is a half or a quarter, or, not improbably, even less, the governing test always (United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, supra) being that of common understanding. Dean v. Com., 4 Grat. (45 Va.) 541; Gentry v.

Raub, 88 Va. 721, 727- 729, 14 S.E. 178.1\n The California Alien Land Law must be read in the light of these rulings as to the effect of birth and race. Section 1 of the act (Cal. Stat. 1923, p. 1020,  1, amending Cal. Stat. 1921, p. lxxxiii) provides that all aliens eligible for citizenship may acquire and occupy real property to the same extent as citizens. Section 2 (as amended by section 2 of act of 1923) provides that aliens not eligible for citizenship may use and occupy real property to the extent prescribed by any treaty between the Government of the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject, 'and not \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n otherwise.' There is a Treaty between the United States and Japan (Feb. 21, 1911, 37 Stat. 1504) by which the Japanese may own or lease houses, manufactories, warehouses, and shops, and may lease land for residential and commercial purposes. The treaty does not confer a privilege to own or use land for the purposes of agriculture. Webb v. O'Brien, supra, \n263 \nU.S. 323\n, 44 S.Ct. 112; Frick v. Webb, \n263 \nU.S. 326\n, 44 S.Ct. 115. Section 3 of the act (as amended by section 3 of the act of 1923) prescribes the rule applicable to the acquisition of shares in corporations organized by aliens for the occupation or use of land; sections 4 and 5 (as amended by sections 4, 5 of the act of 1923) prescribe the rule for alien trustees and guardians; sections 7, 8, and 9 ( as amended by sections 6-8 of the act of 1923) provide for the escheat to the state of any interest in real property unlawfully acquired. Section 10 ( as amended by section 9 of the act of 1923) provides that: 'If two or more persons conspire to violate any of the provisions of this act they are punishable by imprisonment in the county jail or state penitentiary not exceeding two years or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or both.' This is the section under which the defendants have been convicted. There is nothing in the statute whereby unlawful occupation of land by an alien ineligible for citizenship is declared to be a crime unless the occupation has been acquired by force of a conspiracy.\n This court in Morrison v. California, \n288 \nU.S. 591\n, 53 S.Ct. 401,2 passed upon a controversy as to the validity of section 9b of the California Alien Land Law, which, though akin to section 9a, has important elements of difference. This section (9b) provides in substance that, when it has been proved that the defendant has been in the use or occupation of real property, and when it has also been proved that he is a member of a race ineligible for citizenship under the naturalization laws of the United States, the defendant shall have \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n the burden of proving citizenship as a defense. \n3\n We sustained that enactment when challenged as invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The state had given evidence with reference to the defendant, the occupant of the land, that by reason of his race he was ineligible to be made a citizen. With this evidence present, we held that the burden was his to show that by reason of his birth he was a citizen already, and thus to bring himself within a rule which has the effect of an exception. In the vast majority of cases, he could do this without trouble if his claim of citizenship was honest. The people, on the other hand, if forced to disprove his claim, would be relatively helpless. In all likelihood his life history would be known only to himself and at times to relatives or intimates unwilling to speak against him.\n The ruling was not novel. The decisions are manifold that within limits of reason and fairness the burden of proof may be lifted from the state in criminal prosecutions and cast on a defendant. The limits are in substance these, that the state shall have proved enough to make it just for the defendant to be required to repel what \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n has been proved with excuse or explanation, or at least that upon a balancing of convenience or of the opportunities for knowledge the shifting of the burden will be found to be an aid to the accuser without subjecting the accused to hardship or oppression. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 5,  2486, 2512, and cases cited. Special reasons are at hand to make the change permissible when citizenship vel non is the issue to be determined. Citizenship is a privilege not due of common right. One who lays claim to it as his, and does this in justification or excuse of an act otherwise illegal, may fairly be called upon to prove his title good. In accord with that view are decisions of this court in proceedings under the acts of Congress for the deportation of aliens. A Chinaman by race resisted deportation on the ground that, though a Chinaman, he had been born in the United States. The ruling was that as to the place of birth the burden was upon the alien, and not upon the government. The ruling also was that the imposition of that burden did not deprive the alien of his constitutional immunities. Chin Bak Kan v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 22 S.Ct. 891, 894. 'The inestimable heritage of citizenship is not to be conceded to those who seek to avail themselves of it under pressure of a particular exigency, without being able to show that it was ever possessed.' Id. See, also, Ah How v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 65, 76\n, 24 S.Ct. 357; Christy v. Leong Don (C.C.A.) 5 F.( 2d) 135. Cf. Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 42 S.Ct. 492. We adhered to that principle in Morrison v. California, supra. Upon that basis, we approved the ruling of the Supreme Court of California ( People v. Osaki, 209 Cal. 169, 286 P. 1025) that section 9b of the Alien Land Law casting upon a Japanese defendant the burden of proving citizenship after proof of his race had been given by the state was not an impairment of his immunities under the Federal Constitution. No point was made in the statement of jurisdiction or the supporting brief that \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n the crime was conspiracy, and that one of the defendants belonged to the white race. The case was submitted as if both were Japanese.\n The question is now as to section 9a. obviously there is a wide difference between the scope of the two sections. Possession of agricultural land by one not shown to be ineligible for citizenship is an act that carries with it not even a hint of criminality. To prove such possession without more is to take hardly a step forward in support of an indictment. No such probability of wrongdoing grows out of the naked fact of use or occupation as to awaken a belief that the user or occupier is guilty if he fails to come forward with excuse or explanation.

'The legislature may go a good way in raising (a presumption) or in changing the burden of proof, but there are limits.' McFarland v. American Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 36 S.Ct. 498, 501. What is proved must be so related to what is inferred in the case of a true presumption as to be at least a warning signal according to the teachings of experience. 'It is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.' McFarland v. American Sugar Co., supra; Bailey v. Alabama, supra; Manley v. Georgia, supra. There are, indeed, 'presumptions that are not evidence in a proper sense but simply regulations of the burden of proof.' Casey v. United States, supra. Even so, the occasions that justify requlations of the one order have a kinship, if nothing more, to those that justify the others. For a transfer of the burden, experience must teach that the evidence held to be inculpatory has at least a sinister significance (Yee Hem v. United States, supra; Casey v. \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 91]\n\u00a0\n United States, supra), or, if this at times be lacking, there must be in any event a manifest disparity in convenience of proof and opportunity for knowledge, as, for instance, where a general prohibition is applicable to every one who is unable to bring himself within the range of an exception. Greenleaf, Evidence, vol. 1,  79.4 The list is not exhaustive. Other instances may have arisen or may develop in the future where the balance of convenience can be redressed without oppression to the defendant through the same procedural expedient. The decisive considerations are too variable, too much distinctions of degree, too dependent in last analysis upon a common sense estimate of fairness or of facilities of proof, to be crowded into a formula. One can do no more than adumbrate them; sharper definition must await the specific case as it arises.\n We turn to this statute and endeavor to assign it to its class. In the law of California there is no general prohibition of the use of agricultural lands by aliens, with special or limited provisos or exceptions. To the contrary, it is the privilege that is general, and only the prohibition that is limited and special. Without preliminary \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 92]\n\u00a0\n proof of race, occupation of the land is not even a suspicious circumstance. The inquiry must therefore be whether occupants so situated may be charged with the burden of proving themselves eligible and thus establishing their innocence.\n First. The indictment is for conspiracy, and, indeed, the Alien Land Law creates no other crime. In re Akado, 188 Cal. 739, 742, 207 P. 245; Mott v. Cline, 200 Cal. 434, 448, 253 P. 718; California Delta Farms v. Chinese American Farms, 207 Cal. 298, 308, 278 P. 227. Morrison and Doi are charged to have conspired, but Doi alone is charged to be ineligible for citizenship. One might suppose from a reading of the statute that the burden of proof, even if shifted as to him, would be unaffected as to Morrison. The California courts, however, have cast the same burden upon both; and both have been convicted. None the less, in applying the presumption, we must keep before us steadily the quality of their crime. It is impossible in the nature of things for a man to conspire with himself. Turinetti v. United States (C.C.A.) 2 F.(2d) 15, 17. In California as elsewhere conspiracy imports a corrupt agreement between not less than two with guilty knowledge on the part of each. People v. Richards, 67 Cal. 412, 7 P. 828, 56 Am.Rep. 716; People v. Kizer, 22 Cal. App. 10, 14, 133 P. 516, 521, 134 P. 346; People v. Entriken, 106 Cal.App. 29, 32, 288 P. 788; Sands v. Commonwealth, 21 Grat.(Va.) 871, 899; Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 205 S., 13 S.Ct. 542.\n Now, plainly as to Morrison, an imputation of knowledge is a wholly arbitrary presumption. He may never have seen Doi before the transfer of possession or afterwards. He may have made his agreement by an agent or over the telephone or by writings delivered through the mails. Even if lessor and lessee came together face to face, there is nothing to show whether Doi was a Japanese of the full blood, whose race would have been appar- \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 93]\n\u00a0\n ent to any one looking at him. Moreover, if his race was apparent, he may still have been a citizen, for anything that was known to Morrison or others. The statute does not make it a crime to put a lessee into possession without knowledge or inquiry as to race and place of birth. The statute makes it a crime to put an ineligible lessee into possession as the result of a willful conspiracy to violate the law. Nothing in he people's evidence gives support to the inference that Morrison had knowledge of the disqualifications of his tenant or could testify about them. What was known to him, so far as the evidence discloses, was known also to the people, and provable with equal case. Only an arbitrary mandate could charge him with guilty knowledge as an inference of law if it were proved that Doi was not a citizen or eligible to become one. Still less can he be charged with such knowledge when Doi's disqualification is itself a mere presumption. In such circumstances the conviction of Morrison because he failed to assume the burden of disproving a conspiracy was a denial of due process that vitiates the judgment as to him. Nor is that the only consequence. Doi was not a conspirator, however guilty his own state of mind, unless Morrison had shared in the guilty knowledge and design. Pettibone v. United States, supra; Gebardi v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 112, 123\n, 53 S.Ct. 35, 84 A.L.R. 370. The joinder was something to be proved, for it was of the essence of the crime. Without it there was a civil wrong, but not a criminal conspiracy, the only crime denounced. In re Akado, supra. The conviction failing as to the one defendant must fail as to the other. Turinetti v. United States, supra; Williams v. United States (C.C.A.) 282 F. 481, 484; Gebardi v. United States, supra.\n Second. The result will not be changed if we view the case on the assumption that possession by one ineligible, when it is the product of agreement, may be criminal as to the tenant who holds with guilty knowledge, though \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 94]\n\u00a0\n innocent as to the landlord who believes that all is lawful.\n We have pointed out before that a lease of agricultural land, unaccompanied by evidence of the race of the lessee, conveys no hint of criminality. For the moment we assume, without intending to decide, that strong considerations of convenience, if they existed, might cast upon the tenant the burden of proving his qualifications and thus disproving guilt. The question will then be whether the normal burden of proof will so thwart or hamper justice as to create a practical necessity, without preponderating hardship to the defendant, for a departure from the usual rule.\n In the vast majority of cases the race of a Japanese or a Chinaman will be known to any one who looks at him. There is no practical necessity in such circumstances for shifting the burden to the defendant. Not only is there no necessity; there is only a faint promotion of procedural convenience. The triers of the facts will look upon the defendant sitting in the courtroom and will draw their own conclusions. If more than this is necessary, the people may call witnesses familiar with the characteristics of the race, who will state his racial origin. The only situation in which the shifting of the burden can be of any substantial profit to the state is where the defendant is of mixed blood, the white or the African so preponderating that there will be no external evidence of another. But in such circumstances the promotion of convenience from the point of view of the prosecution will be outweighed by the probability of injustice to the accused. One whose racial origins are so blended as to be not discoverable at sight will often be unaware of them. If he can state nothing but his ignorance, he has not sustained the burden of proving eligibility, and must stand condemned of crime.\n Reflection will satisfy that the chance of this injustice is not remote or shadowy. Let us assume a charge that \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 95]\n\u00a0\n agricultural land has been occupied by Filipinos not born in the United States, and not entitled to the privileges growing out of service in the army or the navy. 8 U.S.C.  388 (8 USCA  388). They are then ineligible for citizenship, and subject to indictment under the laws of California if they have gone into possession in aid of a conspiracy. But Filipinos have intermarried with many other peoples. They have intermarried with whites and with Negroes and mulattos. A laborer, born in Canada, his parents apparently mulattos, but one of his grandparents a Filipino, according to the charge in an indictment, would be ignorant in many cases whether he was a Filipino or an African. The admixture of oriental blood might be too slight for his race to be apparent to the eye, and family traditions are not always well preserved, especially when the descendants are men and women of humble origin, remote from kith and kin. The same possibility of injustice would be present where the occupant of the land is a descendant of Mexicans and Indians,5 \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 96]\n\u00a0\n or an Eurasian, his ancestors party Europeans and partly Asiatics. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The probability is thus apparent that the transfer of the burden may result in grave injustice in the only class of cases in which it will be of any practical importance. The statute does not say that the defendant shall be acquitted if he does not know his racial origin and is unable to make proof of it. What the effect of such a law would be, we are not required to consider. To the contrary, the statute says in substance that, unless he can and does prove it, he will have failed to discharge his burden, and will therefore be found guilty. Moreover, if he were to profess ignorance, and ignorance were an excuse, the trier of the facts might refuse to credit him. Holmes, J., in Ah How v. United States, supra, \n193 \nU.S. 76\n, 24 S.Ct. 357. There can be no escape from hardship and injustice, outweighing many times any procedural convenience, unless the burden of persuasion in respect of racial origin is cast upon the people.\n What has been written applies only to those provisions of the statute that prescribe the rule for criminal causes. \n\n[291 U.S. 82, 97]\n\u00a0\n Other considerations may or may not apply where the controversy is civil. We leave that question open.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The opinions in Jeffries v. Ankeny, 11 Ohio, 372 and Gray v. State, 4 Ohio 353, rest upon peculiar provisions of the Ohio Constitution. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The appeal was dismissed for the want of a substantial federal question upon a statement as to jurisdiction, and without argument of counsel. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Sec. 9b.

Cal. Stats. 1927, c. 528, p. 881,  2. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Instances of the application of this principle can be cited in profusion. The cases that follow are typical examples: King v. Turner, 5 Maule & Sel. 206, where a defendant, having game in his possession in violation of a statute whereby possession was generally a crime, was held to have the burden of proving his special qualifications (cf. Yee Hem v. United States, supra; also Spieres v. Parker, 1 T.R. 144, per Lord Mansfield); Fleming v. People, 27 N.Y. 329, a prosecution for bigamy, where, on proof that the defendant had contracted a second marriage during the lifetime of his first wife, the burden was laid upon him to prove exceptional circumstances that would have made the marriage lawful; and finally such cases as Potter v. Deyo, 19 Wend.(N.Y.) 361, 363, and United States v. Turner (D.C.) 266 F. 248 (typical of a host of others) where a defendant has been subjected to the burden of producing a license or a permit for a business or profession that would otherwise be illegal.

JOE GERRICK & CO.(1934)\nNo. 308\nArgued: January 19, 1934Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. M. M. Doyle, of Washington, D.C., and William Martin, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner. \n\n[291 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roszel C. Thomsen and Walter L. Clark, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Louis H. Murray, a steel erector, died as the result of a fall from a crane which was being erected by his employers, the respondents, in the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Wash. The petitioner, his widow, brought action, on her own and her minor child's behalf, alleging the decedent's death was caused by the respondents' negligence. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the declaration, holding the action was not maintainable by the widow and daughter as beneficiaries under the Washington Workmen's Compensation Act, since that act was not in force in the navy yard; and if it were considered a suit for death by wrongful act, the applicable state statute required that it be instituted by the personal representative of the decedent. The petitioner, although she was also administratrix, refused to amend and claim in virtue of her status as such, and stood upon the declaration. A judgment in favor of respondents was affirmed by the Supreme Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In the petition for certiorari it is asserted that the state courts misconstrued the Act of Congress of February 1, 1928 (16 USCA  457). This court consequently has jurisdiction. The question of the bearing of the federal act upon the right to maintain the action requires the statement of additional facts.\n By a statute passed in 18912 the state consented to the acquisition of a tract of land by the United States for a navy yard or other specified uses, and ceded jurisdiction \n\n[291 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n over the same to the federal government, retaining only concurrent jurisdiction for the service of civil and criminal process issued under the authority of the state. Pursuant to this consent, the United States acquired what is now known as Puget Sound Navy Yard. At that time a state statute was in force permitting the heirs or personal representatives of one dying as a result of negligence to maintain suit against the wrongdoer. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n In 1911 Washington adopted an industrial insurance law or Workmen's Compensation Act which required every employer engaged in extrahazardous occupation to report the work undertaken by him and to pay to a state insurance fund certain sums measured by the payroll for the work. The act abolished all actions by employees against employers for injury in extrahazardous occupations, and, in lieu thereof, conferred upon the injured workman the right to be paid from the fund; gave a similar right to named beneficiaries in case of an employee's death, and further provided that if an employer should fail to report or to pay to the state fund, the employee, or his beneficiaries in case of death, might sue the employer for negligence. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n In 1917 the prior statute relating to suits for death by wrongful act was superseded by an act vesting the right to sue in the personal representatives of the decedent. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n February 1, 1928, an act of Congress6 became effective entitled 'An Act Concerning actions on account of death or personal injury within places under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' It enacts: 'In the case of the death of any person by the neglect or wrongful act of another within a national park or other place \n\n[291 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, within the exterior boundaries of any State, such right of action shall exist as though the place were under the jurisdiction of the State; ... and in any action brought to recover on account of injuries sustained in any such place the rights of the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State within the exterior boundaries of which it may be.'\n The petitioner, believing this act of Congress made the state compensation law applicable to the navy yard, sued on behalf of her child and herself as beneficiaries, alleging the respondents had failed to report the work and make the payments required by the compensation act.\n The state Supreme Court held that the compensation act does not apply to territory beyond the authority of the state Legislature. But it also held that act could not have any force in the navy yard, since it was adopted many years after the cession of jurisdiction by the state and the consequent acquisition of the tract by the United States. In this the court was clearly right. After the effective date of the state's cession the jurisdiction of the federal government was exclusive (Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co. v. Lowe, \n114 \nU.S. 525, 537\n, 5 S.Ct. 995; United States v. Unzeuta, \n281 \nU.S. 138\n, 50 S.Ct. 284), and laws subsequently enacted by the state were ineffective in the navy yard. Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439\n, 49 S.Ct. 227. Congress may, however, adopt such later state legislation as respects territory under its jurisdiction, and the petitioner claims it did so adopt the compensation act by the Act of February 1, 1928. This argument overlooks the fact that the federal statute referred only to actions at law, where as the state act abolished all actions at law for negligence and substituted a system by which employers contribute to a fund to which injured workmen must look for compensation. The right of action given upon default of the employer in respect of his obligation to contribute to the fund is conferred as \n\n[291 U.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n a part of the scheme of state insurance and not otherwise. The act of Congress vested in Murray no right to sue the respondents, had he survived his injury. Nor did it authorize the state of Washington to collect assessments for its state fund from an employer conducting work in the navy yard. If it were held that beneficiaries may sue, pursuant to the compensation law, we should have the incongruous situation that this law is in part effective and in part ineffective within the area under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Congress did not intend such a result. On the contrary, the purpose was only to authorize suits under a state statute abolishing the common law rule that the death of the injured person abates the action for negligence.\n The petitioner urges that if the act of Congress failed to extend the workmen's compensation law to the navy yard, she is, nevertheless, entitled to maintain her action in behalf of herself and her child as heirs of the decedent, because the Code of 1881, supra, was in effect at the date of cession and remained applicable until Congress altered it. She relies upon the principle that when political jurisdiction and legislative power over territory are transferred from one sovereign to another, the municipal law of the place continues in force until abrogated by the new sovereign. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. McGlinn, \n114 \nU.S. 542\n, 5 S.Ct. 1005; Vilas v. Manila, \n220 \nU.S. 345, 357\n, 31 S. Ct. 416. But the weakness of her position is that by the Act of February 1, 1928, Congress did abrogate the code provision as respects the navy yard by enacting that 'such right of action shall exist as though the place were under the jurisdiction of the State,' and 'in any action brought to recover on account of injuries sustained in any such place the rights of the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State within the exterior boundaries of which it may be.' This plainly means the existing law, as declared from time to time by the state; and Washington, \n\n[291 U.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n by the act of 1917, has substituted for the action, given in the alternative to heirs or personal representatives by the Code of 1881, one vested exclusively in the personal representative. It results that the petitioner could sue only under the act of 1917\n\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 172 Wash. 365, 20 P.(2d) 591. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Laws of 1891, p. 31; Remington's Revised Statutes,  8108.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section, 8, Code of 1881, Remington & Ballinger's Ann.

CO. v. JOHNSON(1934)\nNo. 154\nArgued: November 15, 1934Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James C. Martin, of Roanoke, Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Burnett Miller, of Culpeper, Va., and John S. Barbour, of Fairfax, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On May 16, 1930, the petitioner, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, issued in Virginia to Benjamin F. Cooksey, who resided in that state, a policy of life insurance in the amount of $4,500 with disability benefits. Upon the face of the policy, it is provided that, if the insured is totally and permanently disabled before the age of 60, the company will pay him 'forty-five dollars monthly during such disability, ... besides waiving premium payments, all upon conditions set forth in section 3.' The conditions thus incorporated by reference are these: 'If before attaining the age of sixty years, and while no premium on the policy is in default, the insured shall furnish to the company due proof that he is totally and permanently disabled, ... the company will grant the following benefits during the remaining lifetime of the insured as long as such disability continues. Benefits (a) ... The company will pay a monthly income to the insured of the amount stated on the first page hereof ... beginning upon receipt of due proof of such disability. ... (b) Waiver of Premium. The Company will also, after receipt of such due proof, waive payment of each premium as it thereafter becomes due during such \n\n[293 U.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n disability.' There is also a provision that the policy will be reinstated within six months after a default if proof is given within that time that at the date of the default the insured was totally disabled and has continuously remained so.\n A quarterly premium became payable under this policy upon November 16, 1931, subject, however, to a period of grace of thirty-one days, whereby the time for payment was extended until December 17. This premium was never paid by the insured, though all earlier premiums had been paid as they matured. On December 17, the date of the default, the insured, who was under 60, was confined to his bed, a sufferer from chronic nephritis, which on January 20, 1932, resulted in his death. There is evidence by concession that as early as December 14, 1931, he was totally and permanently disabled, not only physically, but mentally, to such an extent that he was unable to give notice to the insurer in advance of the default, and thus procure the waiver called for by the policy. The company takes the ground that, because of the omission of that notice, the default is unexcused and the policy has lapsed.\n In this action by the administrator the District Court upheld the company's position, and directed a verdict for the defendant. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, and remanded the cause for trial. 70 F.(2d) 41. For the defendant it was argued that insanity is no more an excuse for the failure to give a notice that will cause the payment of the premiums to be waived than for the failure to make payment of the premiums when waiver is not a duty, either conditional or absolute.

For the plaintiff it was argued that, waiver having been promised, though subject to a condition as to notice, there must be a liberal construction of a requirement that is \n\n[293 U.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n merely modal or procedural, and the insurer will not be deemed, in respect of matters of that order, to have exacted the impossible. The controversy is one as to which the courts of the country are arrayed in opposing camps. Supporting the petitioner's view are New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

The case is here on certiorari.\n We think the contract is to be interpreted in accordance with the law of Virginia where delivery was made. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. McCue, \n223 \nU.S. 234\n, 32 S.Ct. 220, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 57; Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Clements, \n140 \nU.S. 226\n, 11 S.Ct. 822; Scudder v. Union National Bank, \n91 \nU.S. 406, 412\n, 413 S.. As to the meaning and obligation of such a policy, the highest court of the state has spoken in Swann v. Atlantic Life Insurance Co., supra, construing a provision substantially the same as the one in controversy here. The ruling there was that notice was excused by physical and mental incapacity to give it. 'When the disability of the insured occurred while the policy was in force, he was entitled to have his premiums waived until his death, for his disability continued until his death. He had paid for this right, and to say that he should lose the benefit of his policy because he failed through mental or physical incapacity to present proofs would be harsh and unreasonable under the circumstances.'\n In this situation we are not under a duty to make a choice for ourselves between alternative constructions as if the courts of the place of the contract were silent or uncertain. Without suggesting an independent preference either one way or the other, we yield to the judges of Virginia expounding a Virginia policy and adjudging its effect. The case will not be complicated by a consideration of our power to pursue some other course. The summum jus of power, whatever it may be, will be subordinated at times to a benign and prudent comity. At least in cases of uncertainty we steer away from a collision between courts of state and nation when harmony can be attained without the sacrifice of ends of national importance. No question as to a rule of the law merchant is present in this case. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1. \n\n[293 U.S. 335, 340]\n\u00a0\n No question is here as to any general principle of the law of contracts of insurance (Carpenter v.

Moore, \n231 \nU.S. 543, 559\n, 34 S.Ct. 186), with consequences broader than those involved in the construction of a highly specialized condition. All that is here for our decision is the meaning, the tacit implications, of a particular set of words, which as experience has shown, may yield a different answer to this reader and to that one. With choice so 'balanced with doubt,' we accept as our guide the law declared by the state where the contract had its being. Trainor Co. v.

HELVERING(1934)\nNo. 35\nArgued: October 17, 1934Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Messrs. John Francis Neylan and J. Paul Miller, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. William Stanley, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[293 U.S. 183, 184]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present in slightly different circumstances a question substantially the same as the one considered in Nos. 37 to 39, Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 172\n, 55 S.Ct. 127, decided herewith.\n Here, on July 15, 1925, the Zellerbach Paper Company filed for itself and its subsidiary, National Paper Products Company, a consolidated return under the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253) for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1925\n\n\n On February 26, 1926, the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9) was enacted, effective retroactively in respect of income taxes (with exceptions not now important) as of January 1, 1925. Sections 286, 1200 ( 26 USCA  931 note, 1a note, 1260a).\n The tax payable by the petitioners for the preceding fiscal year was changed by the new act in one respect only. For the four months of that year following January 1, 1925, the 12 1\/2 per cent. tax fixed by the Act of 1924 was increased to 13 per cent. (Section 230(a)(1), 26 USCA  981 note), an amount ascertainable through a simple computation when once the data had been supplied for separating income attributable to 1925 from income attributable to an earlier time. For other taxpayers differently situated, the changes might be different or greater. So far as the new act affected the petitioners, it changed the rate and nothing else.\n In accordance with Treasury Decision 38431 which \n\n[293 U.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n called for an additional return whenever there was an additional tax, the Zellerbach Paper Company for itself and its subsidiary filed a document which amounted to an 'amended return' and was so stamped by a representative of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The new return did not repeat what had been stated in the return of July, 1925, then upon the files. All that it did was to refer to the net income as previously reported, and then apply the new rate to that part of the income stated to be attributable to 1925.\n On October 10, 1928, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue gave notice of deficiency assessments against the two petitioners. The period of limitation prescribed by the Act of 1926 is three years after the filing of the return. Section 277(a)(1), 26 USCA  1057(a)(1). If the three years began to run upon the filing of the original return in July, 1925, the assessments were too late. If the term began to run when the additional return was filed (May 14, 1926), the assessments were in time.\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals (26 B.T.A. 92), upholding the action of the Commissioner (69 F.(2d) 857), and again, as in Nos. 37 to 39, refused to adhere to a contrary ruling in courts of coordinate jurisdiction (Myles Salt Co., Ltd., v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 232; Isaac Goldmann Co. v. Burnet, Commissioner, 60 App.D.C. 265, 51 F.(2d) 427; Valentine-Clark Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 52 F.(2d) 346). Writs of certiorari followed. Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 621\n, 54 S.Ct. 866, 867.\n The points of difference between these cases and Nos. 37 to 39 are these: Here the new statute was the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9), superseding as of January 1, 1925, the Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253); there the new statute was the Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227), superseding as of January 1, 1921, the Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). Here the change applicable to the petitioners was an increase of the rate; there the applicable change was the disallow- \n\n[293 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n ance of a credit. Here the taxpayers filed an additional return, supplementing the original one by a statement of the additional taxes due; there the taxpayer stood upon the original return, and omitted to file another.\n The conclusion is unaffected by any of these points of difference.\n For reasons stated in our opinion in Nos. 37 to 39, the period of limitation began to run on the filing of the first return, and a return for additional taxes, even if filed afterwards, was an amendment or supplement which did not toll the statute.\n The decree should be reversed, and it is\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Any corporation which has filed a return for a fiscal year ending in 1925 and paid or become liable for a tax computed under the Revenue Act of 1924, and is subject to additional tax for the same period under the Revenue Act of 1926, must file a new return covering such additional tax on or before May 15, 1926. Payment of the additional tax may be made at the time the return is filed or, if installment payments are desired, such installments must be paid at the time they would be due if based upon a return for the fiscal year ended February 28, 1926.' \n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEBBIA v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK(1934)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the County Court of Monroe County, New York.[ Nebbia v. People of State of New York \n291 U.S. 502\n (1934) ]\n\n\n[291 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur E. Sutherland, Jr., of Rochester, N.Y., for appellant.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Manley, of Albany, N.Y., for appellee.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 502, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Legislature of New York established by chapter 158 of the Laws of 1933, a Milk Control Board with power, among other things to 'fix minimum and maximum ... retail prices to be charged by ... stores to consumers for consumption off the premises where sold.' Agriculture and Markets Law N.Y. (Consol. Laws, c. 69)  312. The board fixed nine cents as the price to be charged by a store for a quart of milk. Nebbia, the proprietor of a grocery store in Rochester, sold two quarts and a 5-cent loaf of bread for 18 cents; and was convicted for violating the board's order. At his trial he asserted the statute and order contravene the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and renewed the contention in successive appeals to the county court and Court of Appeals. Both overruled his claim and affirmed the conviction. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The question for decision is whether the Federal Constitution prohibits a state from so fixing the selling price of milk. We first inquire as to the occasion for the legislation and its history.\n During 1932 the prices received by farmers for milk were much below the cost of production. The decline in prices during 1931 and 1932 was much greater than that of prices generally. The situation of the families of dairy producers had become desperate and called for state aid similar to that afforded the unemployed, if conditions should not improve. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 516]\n\u00a0\n On March 10, 1932, the senate and assembly resolved, 'That a joint Legislative committee is hereby created ... to investigate the causes of the decline of the price of milk to producers and the resultant effect of the low prices upon the dairy industry and the future supply of milk to the cities of the State; to investigate the cost of distribution of milk and its relation to prices paid to milk producers, to the end that the consumer may be assured of an adequate supply of milk at a reasonable price, both to producer and consumer.' The committee organized May 6, 1932, and its activities lasted nearly a year. It held 13 public hearings at which 254 witnesses testified and 2,350 typewritten pages of testimony were taken. Numerous exhibits were submitted. Under its direction an extensive research program was prosecuted by experts and official bodies and employees of the state and municipalities, which resulted in the assembling of much pertinent information. Detailed reports were received from over 100 distributors of milk, and these were collated and the information obtained analyzed. As a result of the study of this material a report covering 473 closely printed pages, embracing the conclusions and recommendations of the committee, was presented to the Legislature April 10, 1933. This document included detailed findings with copious references to the supporting evidence; appendices outlining the nature and results of prior investigations of the milk industry of the state, briefs upon the legal questions involved, and forms of bills recommended for passage. The conscientious effort and thoroughness exhibited by the report lend weight to the committee's conclusions.\n In part those conclusions are:\n Milk is an essential item of diet. It cannot long be stored. It is an excellent medium for growth of bacteria. These facts necessitate safeguards in its production and handling for human consumption which greatly increase \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 517]\n\u00a0\n the cost of the business. Failure of producers to receive a reasonable return for their labor and investment over an extended period threaten a relaxation of vigilance against contamination.\n The production and distribution of milk is a paramount industry of the state, and largely affects the health and prosperity of its people. Dairying yields fully one-half of the total income from all farm products. Dairy farm investment amounts to approximately $1,000,000,000. Curtailment or destruction of the dairy industry would cause a serious economic loss to the people of the state.\n In addition to the general price decline, other causes for the low price of milk include a periodic increase in the number of cows and in milk production, the prevalence of unfair and destructive trade practices in the distribution of milk, leading to a demoralization of prices in the metropolitan area and other markets, and the failure of transportation and distribution charges to be reduced in proportion to the reduction in retail prices for milk and cream.\n The fluid milk industry is affected by factors of instability peculiar to itself which call for special methods of control. Under the best practicable adjustment of supply to demand the industry must carry a surplus of about 20 per cent., because milk, an essential food, must be available as demanded by consumers every day in the year, and demand and supply vary from day to day and according to the reason; but milk is perishable and cannot be stored. Close adjustment of supply to demand is hindered by several factors difficult to control. Thus surplus milk presents a serious problem, as the prices which can be realized for it for other uses are much less than those obtainable for milk sold for consumption in fluid form or as cream. A satisfactory stabilization of prices for fluid milk requires that the burden of surplus milk be shared equally by all producers and all distributors in the milk \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 518]\n\u00a0\n shed. So long as the surplus burden is unequally distributed the pressure to market surplus milk in fluid form will be a serious disturbing factor. The fact that the larger distributors find it necessary to carry large quantities of surplus milk, while the smaller distributors do not, leads to price-cutting and other forms of destructive competition. Smaller distributors, who take no responsibility for the surplus, by purchasing their milk at the blended prices (i.e., an average between the price paid the producer for milk for sale as fluid milk, and the lower surplus milk price paid by the larger organizations) can undersell the larger distributors. Indulgence in this price-cutting often compels the larger dealer to cut the price to his own and the producer's detriment.\n Various remedies were suggested, amongst them united action by producers, the fixing of minimum prices for milk and cream by state authority, and the imposition of certain graded taxes on milk dealers proportioned so as to equalize the cost of milk and cream to all dealers and so remove the cause of price-cutting.\n The Legislature adopted chapter 158 as a method of correcting the evils, which the report of the committee showed could not be expected to right themselves through the ordinary play of the forces of supply and demand, owing to the peculiar and uncontrollable factors affecting the industry. The provisions of the statute are summarized in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 502, 519]\n\u00a0\n Section 312(e) on which the prosecution in the present case is founded, provides: 'After the board shall have fixed prices to be charged or paid for milk in any form \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 520]\n\u00a0\n ... it shall be unlawful for a milk dealer to sell or buy or offer to sell or buy milk at any price less or more than such price, ... and no method or device shall be lawful whereby milk is bought or sold ... at a price less or more than such price ... whether by any discount, or rebate, or free service, or advertising allowance, or a combined price for such milk together with another commodity or commodities, or service or services, which is less or more than the aggregate of the prices for the milk and the price or prices for such other commodity or commodities, or service or services, when sold or offered for sale separately or otherwise . ...'\n First. The appellant urges that the order of the Milk Control Board denies him the equal protection of the laws. It is shown that the order requires him, if he purchases his supply from a dealer, to pay 8 cents per quart and \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 521]\n\u00a0\n 5 cents per pint, and to resell at not less than 9 and 6, whereas the same dealer may buy his supply from a farmer at lower prices and deliver milk to consumers at 10 cents the quart and 6 cents the pint. We think the contention that the discrimination deprives the appellant of equal protection is not well founded. For aught that appears, the appellant purchased his supply of milk from a farmer as do distributors, or could have procured it from a farmer if he so desired. There is therefore no showing that the order placed him at a disadvantage, or in fact affected him adversely, and this alone is fatal to the claim of denial of equal protection. But if it were shown that the appellant is compelled to buy from a distributor, the difference in the retail price he is required to charge his customers, from that prescribed for sales by distributors is not on its face arbitrary or unreasonable, for there are obvious distinctions between the two sorts of merchants which may well justify a difference of treatment, if the Legislature possesses the power to control the prices to be charged for fluid milk. Compare American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A. L.R. 1464\n\n\n Second. The more serious question is whether, in the light of the conditions disclosed, the enforcement of section 312(e) denied the appellant the due process secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Save the conduct of railroads, no business has been so thoroughly regimented and regulated by the State of New York as the milk industry. Legislation controlling it in the interest of the public health was adopted in 18623 and subsequent statutes,4 have been carried into the gen- \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 522]\n\u00a0\n eral codification known as the Agriculture and Markets Law. \n5\n A perusal of these statutes discloses that the milk industry has been progressively subjected to a larger measure of control. \n6\n The producer or dairy farmer is in certain circumstances liable to have his herd quarantined against bovine tuberculosis; is limited in the importation of dairy cattle to those free from Bang's disease; is subject to rules governing the care and feeding of his cows and the care of the milk produced, the condition and surroundings of his barns and buildings used for production of milk, the utensils used, and the persons employed in milking (sections 46, 47, 55, 72-88). Proprietors of milk gathering stations or processing plants are subject to regulation (section 54), and persons in charge must operate under license and give bond to comply with the law and regulations; must keep records, pay promptly for milk purchased, abstain from false or misleading statements and from combinations to fix prices (sections 57, 57- a, 252). In addition there is a large volume of legislation intended to promote cleanliness and fair trade practices, affecting all who are engaged in the industry. \n7\n The challenged amend- \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 523]\n\u00a0\n ment of 1933 carried regulation much farther than the prior enactments. Appellant insists that it went beyond the limits fixed by the Constitution.\n Under our form of government the use of property and the making of contracts are normally matters of private and not of public concern. The general rule is that both shall be free of governmental interference. But neither property rights8 nor contract rights9 are absolute; for government cannot exist if the citizen may at will use his property to the detriment of his fellows, or exercise his freedom of contract to work them harm. Equally fundamental with the private right is that of the public to regulate it in the common interest. As Chief Justice Marshall said, speaking specifically of inspection laws, such laws form 'a portion of that immense mass of legislation which embraces everything within the territory of a state, ... all which can be most advantageously exercised by the states themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a state, ... are component parts of this mass.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Justice Barbour said for this court: '... it is not only the right, but the bounden and solemn duty of a state, to advance the safety, happiness and prosperity of its people, and to provide for its general welfare, by any and every act of legislation, which it may deem to be conductive to these ends; where the power over the particular subject, or the manner of its exercise is not surrendered or restrained, in the manner just stated. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 524]\n\u00a0\n That all those powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what may, perhaps, more properly be called internal police, are not thus surrendered or restrained; and that, consequently, in relation to these, the authority of a state is complete, unqualified, and exclusive.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n And Chief Justice Taney said upon the same subject: 'But what are the police powers of a State? They are nothing more or less than the powers of government inherent in every sovereignty to the extent of its dominions. And whether a State passes a quarantine law, or a law to punish offenses, or to establish courts of justice, or requiring certain instruments to be recorded, or to regulate commerce within its own limits, in every case it exercises the same power; that is to say, the power of sovereignty, the power to govern men and things within the limits of its dominion. It is by virtue of this power that it legislates; and its authority to make regulations of commerce is as absolute as its power to pass health laws, except in so far as it has been restricted by the constitution of the United States.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Thus has this court from the early days affirmed that the power to promote the general welfare is inherent in government. Touching the matters committed to it by the Constitution the United States possesses the power,13 as do the states in their sovereign capacity touching all subjects jurisdiction of which is not surrendered to the federal government, as shown by the quotations above given. These correlative rights, that of the citizen to exercise exclusive dominion over property and freely to contract about his affairs, and that of the state to regulate the use of property and the conduct of business, are always in collision. No exercise of the private right can be \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 525]\n\u00a0\n imagined which will not in some respect, however slight, affect the public; no exercise of the legislative prerogative to regulate the conduct of the citizen which will not to some extent abridge his liberty or affect his property. But subject only to constitutional restraint the private right must yield to the public need.\n The Fifth Amendment, in the field of federal activity,14 and the Fourteenth, as respects state action,15 do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare. They merely condition the exertion of the admitted power, by securing that the end shall be accomplished by methods consistent with due process. And the guaranty of due process, as has often been held, demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. It results that a regulation valid for one sort of business, or in given circumstances, may be invalid for another sort, or for the same business under other circumstances, because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts.\n The reports of our decisions abound with cases in which the citizen, individual or corporate, has vainly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment in resistance to necessary and appropriate exertion of the police power.\n The court has repeatedly sustained curtailment of enjoyment of private property, in the public interest. The owner's rights may be subordinated to the needs of other private owners whose pursuits are vital to the paramount interests of the community. \n16\n The state may control the \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 526]\n\u00a0\n use of property in various ways; may prohibit advertising bill boards except of a prescribed size and location,17 or their use for certain kinds of advertising;18 may in certain circumstances authorize encroachments by party walls in cities;19 may fix the height of buildings, the character of materials, and methods of construction, the adjoining area which must be left open, and may exclude from residential sections offensive trades, industries and structures likely injuriously to affect the public health or safety;20 or may establish zones within which certain types of buildings or businesses are permitted and others excluded. \n21\n And although the Fourteenth Amendment extends protection to aliens as well as citizens, 22 a state may for adequate reasons of policy exclude aliens altogether from the use and occupancy of land. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Laws passed for the suppression of immorality, in the interest of health, to secure fair trade practices, and to safeguard the interests of depositors in banks, have been found consistent with due process. \n24\n These measures not \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 527]\n\u00a0\n only affected the use of private property, but also interfered with the right of private contract. Other instances are numerous where valid regulation has restricted the right of contract, while less directly affecting property rights. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n The Constitution does not guarantee the unrestricted privilege to engage in a business or to conduct it as one \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 528]\n\u00a0\n pleases. Certain kinds of business may be prohibited;26 and the right to conduct a business, or to pursue a calling, may be conditioned. \n27\n Regulation of a business to prevent waste of the state's resources may be justified. \n28\n And statutes prescribing the terms upon which those conducting certain businesses may contract, or imposing terms if they do enter into agreements, are within the state's competency. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 502, 529]\n\u00a0\n Legislation concerning sales of goods, and incidentally affecting prices, has repeatedly been held valid. In this class fall laws forbidding unfair competition by the charging of lower prices in one locality than those exacted in another,30 by giving trade inducements to purchasers,31 and by other forms of price discrimination. \n32\n The public policy with respect to free competition has engendered state and federal statutes prohibiting monopolies, 33 which have been upheld. On the other hand, where the policy of the state dictated that a monopoly should be granted, statutes having that effect have been held inoffensive to the constitutional guarantees. \n34\n Moreover, the state or a municipality may itself enter into business in competition with private proprietors, and thus effec- \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 530]\n\u00a0\n tively although indirectly control the prices charged by them. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n The milk industry in New York has been the subject of long-standing and drastic regulation in the public interest. The legislative investigation of 1932 was persuasive of the fact that for this and other reasons unrestricted competition aggravated existing evils and the normal law of supply and demand was insufficient to correct maladjustments detrimental to the community. The inquiry disclosed destructive and demoralizing competitive conditions and unfair trade practices which resulted in retail price cutting and reduced the income of the farmer below the cost of production. We do not understand the appellant to deny that in these circumstances the Legislature might reasonably consider further regulation and control desirable for protection of the industry and the consuming public. That body believed conditions could be improved by preventing destructive price-cutting by stores which, due to the flood of surplus milk, were able to buy at much lower prices than the larger distributors and to sell without incurring the delivery costs of the latter. In the order of which complaint is made the Milk Control Board fixed a price of 10 cents per quart for sales by a distributor to a consumer, and 9 cents by a store to a consumer, thus recognizing the lower costs of the store, and endeavoring to establish a differential which would be just to both. In the light of the facts the order appears not to be unreasonable or arbitrary, or without relation to the purpose to prevent ruthless competition from destroying the wholesale price structure on which the farmer depends for his livelihood, and the community for an assured supply of milk. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 531]\n\u00a0\n But we are told that because the law essays to control prices it denies due process. Notwithstanding the admitted power to correct existing economic ills by appropriate regulation of business, even though an indirect result may be a restriction of the freedom of contract or a modification of charges for services or the price of commodities, the appellant urges that direct fixation of prices is a type of regulation absolutely forbidden. His position is that the Fourteenth Amendment requires us to hold the challenged statute void for this reason alone. The argument runs that the public control of rates or prices is per se unreasonable and unconstitutional, save as applied to businesses affected with a public interest; that a business so affected is one in which property is devoted to an enterprise of a sort which the public itself might appropriately undertake, or one whose owner relies on a public grant or franchise for the right to conduct the business, or in which he is bound to serve all who apply; in short, such as is commonly called a public utility; or a business in its nature a monopoly. The milk industry, it is said, possesses none of these characteristics, and, therefore, not being affected with a public interest, its charges may not be controlled by the state. Upon the soundness of this contention the appellant's case against the statute depends.\n We may as well say at once that the dairy industry is not, in the accepted sense of the phrase, a public utility. We think the appellant is also right in asserting that there is in this case no suggestion of any monopoly or monopolistic practice. It goes without saying that those engaged in the business are in no way dependent upon public grants or franchises for the privilege of conducting their activities. But if, as must be conceded, the industry is subject to regulation in the public interest, what constitutional principle bars the state from correcting existing \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 532]\n\u00a0\n maladjustments by legislation touching prices? We think there is no such principle. The due process clause makes no mention of sales or of prices any more than it speaks of business or contracts or buildings or other incidents of property. The thought seems nevertheless to have persisted that there is something peculiarly sacrosanct about the price one may charge for what he makes or sells, and that, however able to regulate other elements of manufacture or trade, with incidental effect upon price, the state is incapable of directly controlling the price itself. This view was negatived many years ago. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n. The appellant's claim is, however, that this court, in there sustaining a statutory prescription of charges for storage by the proprietors of a grain elevator, limited permissible legislation of that type to businesses affected with a public interest, and he says no business is so affected except it have one or more of the characteristics he enumerates. But this is a misconception. Munn and Scott held no franchise from the state. They owned the property upon which their elevator was situated and conducted their business as private citizens. No doubt they felt at liberty to deal with whom they pleased and on such terms as they might deem just to themselves. Their enterprise could not fairly be called a monopoly, although it was referred to in the decision as a 'virtual monopoly.' This meant only that their elevator was strategically situated and that a large portion of the public found it highly inconvenient to deal with others. This court concluded the circumstances justified the legislation as an exercise of the governmental right to control the business in the public interest; that is, as an exercise of the police power. It is true that the court cited a statement from Lord Hale's De Portibus Maris, to the effect that when private property is 'affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati only'; but the court proceeded at once to define what it understood by \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 533]\n\u00a0\n the expression, saying: 'Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large.' Page 126 of 94 U.S. Thus understood, 'affected with a public interest' is the equivalent of 'subject to the exercise of the police power'; and it is plain that nothing more was intended by the expression. The court had been at pains to define that power (pages 124, 125 of 94 U.S.) ending its discussion in these words: 'From this it is apparent that, down to the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not supposed that statutes regulating the use, or even the price of the use, of private property necessarily deprived an owner of his property without due process of law. Under some circumstances they may, but not under all. The amendment does not change the law in this particular; it simply prevents the States from doing that which will operate as such a deprivation.' \n36\n\u00a0\n\n In the further discussion of the principle it is said that when one devotes his property to a use, 'in which the public has an interest,' he in effect 'grants to the public an interest in that use' and must submit to be controlled for the common good. The conclusion is that if Munn and Scott wished to avoid having their business regulated they should not have embarked their property in an industry which is subject to regulation in the public interest.\n The true interpretation of the court's language is claimed to be that only property voluntarily devoted to a known public use is subject to regulation as to rates. But obviously Munn and Scott had not voluntarily dedicated their business to a public use. They intended only \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 534]\n\u00a0\n to conduct it as private citizens, and they insisted that they had done nothing which gave the public an interest in their transactions or conferred any right of regulation. The statement that one has dedicated his property to a public use is, therefore, merely another way of saying that if one embarks in a business which public interest demands shall be regulated, he must know regulation will ensue.\n In the same volume the court sustained regulation of railroad rates. 37 After referring to the fact that railroads are carriers for hire, are incorporated as such, and given extraordinary powers in order that they may better serve the public, it was said that they are engaged in employment 'affecting the public interest,' and therefore, under the doctrine of the Munn Case, subject to legislative control as to rates. And in another of the group of railroad cases then heard38 it was said that the property of railroads is 'clothed with a public interest' which permits legislative limitation of the charges for its use. Plainly the activities of railroads, their charges and practices, so nearly touch the vital economic interests of society that the police power may be invoked to regulate their charges, and no additional formula of affectation or clothing with a public interest is needed to justify the regulation. And this is evidently true of all business units supplying transportation, light, heat, power and water to communities, irrespective of how they obtain their powers.\n The touchstone of public interest in any business, its practices and charges, clearly is not the enjoyment of any franchise from the state, Munn v. Illinois, supra. Nor is it the enjoyment of a monopoly; for in Brass v. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 535]\n\u00a0\n North Dakota, \n153 \nU.S. 391\n, 14 S.Ct. 857, a similar control of prices of grain elevators was upheld in spite of overwhelming and uncontradicted proof that about six hundred grain elevators existed along the line of the Great Northern Railroad, in North Dakota; that at the very station where the defendant's elevator was located two others operated; and that the business was keenly competitive throughout the state.\n In German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A. 1915C, 1189, a statute fixing the amount of premiums for fire insurance was held not to deny due process. Though the business of the insurers depended on no franchise or grant from the state, and there was no threat of monopoly, two factors rendered the regulation reasonable. These were the almost universal need of insurance protection and the fact that while the insurers competed for the business, they all fixed their premiums for similar risks according to an agreed schedule of rates. The court was at pains to point out that it was impossible to lay down any sweeping and general classification of businesses as to which price-regulation could be adjudged arbitrary or the reverse.\n Many other decisions show that the private character of a business does not necessarily remove it from the realm of regulation of charges or prices. The usury laws fix the price which may be exacted for the use of money, although no business more essentially private in character can be imagined than that of loaning one's personal funds. Griffith v. Connecticut, \n218 \nU.S. 563\n, 31 S.Ct. 132. Insurance agents' compensation may be regulated, though their contracts are private, because the business of insurance is considered one properly subject to public control. O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Ins. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163. Statutes prescribing in the public interest the amounts to be charged by attorneys for prosecuting certain claims, a matter ordinarily one of personal and private nature, \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 536]\n\u00a0\n are not a deprivation of due process. Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160\n, 15 S.Ct. 586; Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, \n250 \nU.S. 208\n, 39 S.Ct. 486; Calhoun v. Massie, \n253 \nU.S. 170\n, 40 S.Ct. 474; Newman v. Moyers, \n253 \nU.S. 182\n, 40 S.Ct. 478; Yeiser v. Dysart, \n267 \nU.S. 540\n, 45 S.Ct. 399; Margolin v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 93\n, 46 S.Ct. 64. A stockyards corporation, 'while not a common carrier, nor engaged in any distinctively public employment, is doing a work in which the public has an interest,' and its charges may be controlled. Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., \n183 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 22 S.Ct. 30. Private contract carriers, who do not operate under a franchise, and have no monopoly of the carriage of goods or passengers, may, since they use the highways to compete with railroads, be compelled to charge rates not lower than those of public carriers for corresponding services, if the state, in pursuance of a public policy to protect the latter, so determines. Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 274\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n It is clear that there is no closed class or category of businesses affected with a public interest, and the function of courts in the application of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is to determine in each case whether circumstances vindicate the challenged regulation as a reasonable exertion of governmental authority or condemn it as arbitrary or discriminatory. Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 43 S.Ct. 630, 27 A.L.R. 1280. The phrase 'affected with a public interest' can, in the nature of things, mean no more than that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public good. In several of the decisions of this court wherein the expressions 'affected with a public interest,' and 'clothed with a public use,' have been brought forward as the criteria of the validity of price control, it has been admitted that they are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices. These decisions must rest, finally, upon the basis that the requirements of due process were \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 537]\n\u00a0\n not met because the laws were found arbitrary in their operation and effect. \n39\n But there can be no doubt that upon proper occasion and by appropriate measures the state may regulate a business in any of its aspects, including the prices to be charged for the products or commodities it sells.\n So far as the requirement of due process is concerned, and in the absence of other constitutional restriction, a state is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose. The courts are without authority either to declare such policy, or, when it is declared by the legislature, to override it. If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court functus officio. 'Whether the free operation of the normal laws of competition is a wise and wholesome rule for trade and commerce is an economic question which this court need not consider or determine.' Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 337\n, 338 S., 24 S.Ct. 436, 457. And it is equally clear that if the legislative policy be to curb unrestrained and harmful competition by measures which are not arbitrary or discriminatory it does not lie with the courts to determine that the rule is unwise. With the wisdom of the policy adopted, with the adequacy or practicability of the law enacted to forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to deal. The course of decision in this court exhibits a firm adherence to these principles. Times without number we have said that the Legislature is primarily the judge of the necessity of such an enact- \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 538]\n\u00a0\n ment, that every possible presumption is in favor of its validity, and that though the court may hold views inconsistent with the wisdom of the law, it may not be annulled unless palpably in excess of legislative power. \n 40\n\u00a0\n\n The lawmaking bodies have in the past endeavored to promote free competition by laws aimed at trusts and monopolies. The consequent interference with private property and freedom of contract has not availed with the courts to set these enactments aside as denying due process. \n41\n Where the public interest was deemed to require the fixing of minimum prices, that expedient has been sustained. \n42\n If the lawmaking body within its sphere of government concludes that the conditions or practices in an industry make unrestricted competition an inadequate safeguard of the consumer's interests,43 produce waste harmful to the public, threaten ultimately to cut off the supply of a commodity needed by the public, or portend the destruction of the industry itself, appropriate statutes passed in an honest effort to correct the threatened consequences may not be set aside because the regulation adopted fixes prices reasonably deemed by the Legislature to be fair to those engaged in the industry and to the consuming public. And this is especially so where, as here, the economic maladjustment is one of price, which threatens harm to the producer at one end of the series and the consumer at the other. The Constitution does \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 539]\n\u00a0\n not secure to any one liberty to conduct his business in such fashion as to inflict injury upon the public at large, or upon any substantial group of the people. Price control, like any other form of regulation, is unconstitutional only if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the Legislature is free to adopt, and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty.\n Tested by these considerations we find no basis in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for condemning the provisions of the Agriculture and Markets Law here drawn into question.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n By an act effective April 10, 1933 (Laws 1933, ch. 158), when production of milk greatly exceeded the demand, the Legislature created a Control Board with power to 'regulate the entire milk industry of New York state, including the production, transportation, manufacture, storage, distribution, delivery and sale. ...' Agriculture and Markets Law N.Y.  303. The 'board may adopt and enforce all rules and all orders necessary to carry out the provisions of this article. ... A rule of the board when duly posted and filed as provided in this section shall have the force and effect of law. ... A violation of any provision of this article or of any rule or order of the board lawfully made, except as otherwise expressly provided by this article, shall be a misdemeanor. ...' Sections 304, 307. After considering 'all conditions affecting the milk industry including the amount necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and to the milk dealer ...' the board 'shall fix by official order the minimum wholesale and retail prices and may fix by official order the maximum wholesale and retail prices to be charged for milk handled within the state.' Section 312. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 540]\n\u00a0\n April 17, this board prescribed 9 cents per quart as the minimum at which 'a store' might sell.* April 19, appellant Nebbia, a small storekeeper in Rochester, sold two bottles at a less price. An information charged that by so doing he committed a misdemeanor. A motion to dismiss which challenged the validity of both statute and order being overruled, the trial proceeded under a plea of not guilty. The board's order and statements by two witnesses tending to show the alleged sale constituted the entire evidence. Notwithstanding the claim, that under the Fourteenth Amendment the state lacked power to \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 541]\n\u00a0\n prescribe prices at which he might sell pure milk, lawfully held, he was adjudged guilty and ordered to pay a fine.\n The Court of Appeals (262 N.Y. 259, 186 N.E. 694, 695) affirmed the conviction. Among other things, it said:\n The sale by Nebbia was a violation of the statute 'inasmuch as the Milk Control Board had fixed a minimum price for milk of 9 cents per quart . ...\n'The appellant not unfairly summarizes this law by saying that it first declares that milk has been selling too cheaply in the state of New York, and has thus created a temporary emergency; this emergency is remedied by making the sale of milk at a low price a crime; the question of what is a low price is determined by the majority vote of three officials. As an aid in enforcing the rate regulation, the milk industry in the state of New York is made a business affecting the public health and interest until March 31, 1934, and the board can exclude from the milk business any violator of the statute or the board's orders.'\n\n In fixing (sale) prices the board 'must take into consideration the amount necessary to yield a 'reasonable return' to the producer and the milk dealer. ... The fixing of minimum prices is one of the main features of the act. The question is whether the act, so far as it provides for fixing minimum prices for milk, is unconstitutional ... in that it interferes with the right of the milk dealer to carry on his business in such manner as suits his convenience, without state interference as to the price at which he shall sell his milk. The power thus to regulate private business can be invoked only under special circumstances. It may be so invoked when the Legislature is dealing with a paramount industry upon which the prosperity of the entire state in large measure depends. It may not be invoked when we are dealing with an ordinary business, essentially private in its na- \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 542]\n\u00a0\n ture. This is the vital distinction pointed out in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262, 277\n, 52 S.Ct. 371. ...\n'The question is as to whether the business justifies the particular restriction, or whether the nature of the business is such that any competent person may, conformably to reasonable regulation, engage therein. The production of milk is, on account of its great importance as human food, a chief industry of the state of New York. ... It is of such paramount importance as to justify the assertion that the general welfare and prosperity of the state in a very large and real sense depend upon it . ... The state seeks to protect the producer by fixing a minimum price for his milk to keep open the stream of milk flowing from the farm to the city and to guard the farmer from substantial loss. ... Price is regulated to protect the farmer from the exactions of purchasers against which he cannot protect himself. ...\n\n'Concededly the Legislature cannot decide the question of emergency and regulation, free from judicial review, but this court should consider only the legitimacy of the conclusions drawn from the facts found.\n\n'We are accustomed to rate regulation in cases of public utilities and other analogous cases and to the extension of such regulative power into similar fields. ... This case, for example, may be distinguished from the Oklahoma Ice Case (New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, supra (\n285 \nU.S. 262, 277\n, 52 S.Ct. 371)), holding that the business of manufacturing and selling ice cannot be made a public business, to which it bears a general resemblance. The New York law creates no monopoly; does not restrict production; was adopted to meet an emergency; milk is a greater family necessity than ice. ... Mechanical concepts of jurisprudence make easy a decision on the strength of seeming authority . ...\n\n'Doubtless the statute before us would be condemned by an earlier generation as a temerarious interference \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 543]\n\u00a0\n with the rights of property and contract ...; with the natural law of supply and demand. But we must not fail to consider that the police power is the least limitable of the powers of government and that it extends to all the great public needs; ... that statutes aiming to ... stimulate the production of a vital food product by fixing living standards of prices for the producer, are to be interpreted with that degree of liberality which is essential to the attainment of the end in view. ...\n\n'With full respect for the Constitution as an efficient frame of government in peace and war, under normal conditions or in emergencies, with cheerful submission to the rule of the Supreme Court that legislative authority to abridge property rights and freedom of contract can be justified only by exceptional circumstances and, even then, by reasonable regulation only, and that legislative conclusions based on findings of fact are subject to judicial review, we do not feel compelled to hold that the 'due process' clause of the Constitution has left milk producers unprotected from oppression and to place the stamp of invalidity on the measure before us.\n\n'With the wisdom of the legislation we have naught to do. It may be vain to hope by laws to oppose the general course of trade. ...\n\n'We are unable to say that the Legislature is lacking in power, not only to regulate and encourage the production of milk, but also, when conditions require, to regulate the prices to be paid for it, so that a fair return may be obtained by the producer and a vital industry preserved from destruction. ... The policy of noninterference with individual freedom must at times give way to the policy of compulsion for the general welfare.'\n\n Our question is whether the control act, as applied to appellant through the order of the board, No. 5, deprives him of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He was convicted of a crime for selling his own \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 544]\n\u00a0\n property-wholesome milk-in the ordinary course of business at a price satisfactory to himself and the customer. We are not immediately concerned with any other provision of the act or later orders. Prices at which the producer may sell were not prescribed-he may accept any price-nor was production in any way limited. 'To stimulate the production of a vital food product' was not the purpose of the statute. There was an oversupply of an excellent article. The affirmation is 'that milk has been selling too cheaply ... and has thus created a temporary emergency; this emergency is remedied by making the sale of milk at a low price a crime.'\n The opinion below points out that the statute expires March 31, 1934, 'and is avowedly a mere temporary measure to meet an existing emergency'; but the basis of the decision is not explicit. There was no definite finding of an emergency by the court upon consideration of established facts and no pronouncement that conditions were accurately reported by a legislative committee. Was the legislation upheld because only temporary and for an emergency; or was it sustained upon the view that the milk business bears a peculiar relation to the public, is affected with a public interest, and, therefore, sales prices may be prescribed irrespective of exceptional circumstances? We are left in uncertainty. The two notions are distinct if not conflicting. Widely different results may follow adherence to one or the other.\n The theory that legislative action which ordinarily would be ineffective because of conflict with the Constitution may become potent if intended to meet peculiar conditions and properly limited, was lucidly discussed and its weakness disclosed by the dissenting opinion in Home \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 545]\n\u00a0\n Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231 (January 8, 1934). Sixty years ago, in Milligan's Case, 4 Wall. 2, this Court declared it inimicable to constitutional government and did 'write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it.'\n Milligan, charged with offenses against the United States committed during 1863 and 1864, was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be hanged by a military commission proceeding under an act of Congress passed in 1862. The crisis then existing was urged in justification of its action. But this Court held the right of trial by jury did not yield to emergency; and directed his release. 'Those great and good men (who drafted the Constitution) foresaw that troublous times would arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. ... The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism.' Ex parte Milligan (1866) 4 Wall. 2, 120.\n The Fourteenth Amendment wholly disempowered the several states to 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The assurance of each of these things is the same. If now liberty or property may be struck down because of difficult circumstances, we must expect that hereafter every right must yield to the voice of an impatient majority when stirred by distressful \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 546]\n\u00a0\n exigency. Amid the turmoil of civil war Milligan was sentenced: happily, this Court intervened. Constitutional guaranties are not to be 'thrust to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine.' They were intended to be immutable so long as within our charter. Rights shielded yesterday should remain indefeasible today and tomorrow. Certain fundamentals have been set beyond experimentation; the Constitution has released them from control by the state. Again and again this Court has so declared.\n Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590\n, 37 S.Ct. 662, 664, L.R. A. 1917F. 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973, condemned a Washington initiative measure which undertook to destroy the business of private employment agencies because it unduly restricted individual liberty. We there said: 'The fundamental guaranties of the Constitution cannot be freely submerged if and whenever some ostensible justification is advanced and the police power invoked.'\n Buchanan v. Warley, \n245 \nU.S. 60\n, 38 S.Ct. 16, 18, L.R.A. 1918A, 210, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1201, held ineffective an ordinance which forbade negroes to reside in a city block where most of the houses were occupied by whites. 'It is equally well established that the police power, broad as it is, cannot justify the passage of a law or ordinance which runs counter to the limitations of the federal Constitution; that principle has been so frequently affirmed in this court that we need not stop to cite the cases.' Southern Ry. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190\n, 54 S. Ct. 148, 150, 78 L.Ed.260 (December 4, 1933): 'The claim that the questioned statute was enacted under the police power of the state, and therefore is not subject to the standards applicable to legislation under other powers, conflicts with the firmly established rule that every state power is limited by the inhibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.'\n Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 545\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 396, 24 A.L.R. 1238: 'That the right to contract about one's affairs is a part of the liberty of the individual protected by this clause \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 547]\n\u00a0\n (Fifth Amendment) is settled by the decisions of this court and is no longer open to question.'\n Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 29 A.L.R. 1446, held invalid a state enactment (1919), which forbade the teaching in schools of any language other than English. 'While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.'\n Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 46 S.Ct. 260, 261: 'The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.'\n Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, overthrew a Minnesota statute designed to protect the public against obvious evils incident to the business of regularly publishing malicious, scandalous and defamatory matters, because of conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In the following, among many other cases, much consideration has been given to this subject: United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81, 88\n, 41 S.Ct. 298, 14 A.L.R. 1045; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S.Ct. 630, 27 A.L.R. 1280; and Id., \n267 \nU.S. 552\n, 45 S.Ct. 441; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468; Tyson & Brother v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S.Ct. 506, 52 A.L.R. 163; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S.Ct. 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327; Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 60 A.L.R. 596; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378\n, 53 S.Ct. 190. All stand in opposition to the views apparently approved below. \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 548]\n\u00a0\n If validity of the enactment depends upon emergency, then to sustain this conviction we must be able to affirm that an adequate one has been shown by competent evidence of essential facts. The asserted right is federal. Such rights may demand and often have received affirmation and protection here. They do not vanish simply because the power of the state is arrayed against them. Nor are they enjoyed in subjection to mere legislative findings.\n If she relied upon the existence of emergency, the burden was upon the state to establish it by competent evidence. None was presented at the trial. If necessary for appellant to show absence of the asserted conditions, the little grocer was helpless from the beginning-the practical difficulties were too great for the average man.\n What circumstances give force to an 'emergency' statute? In how much of the state must they obtain? Everywhere, or will a single county suffice? How many farmers must have been impoverished or threatened violence to create a crisis of sufficient gravity? If three days after this act became effective another 'very grievous murrain' had descended and half of the cattle had died, would the emergency then have ended, also the prescribed rates? If prices for agricultural products become high can consumers claim a crisis exists and demand that the Legislature fix less ones? Or are producers alone to be considered, consumers neglected? To these questions we have no answers. When emergency gives potency, its subsidence must disempower; but no test for its presence or absence has been offered. How is an accused to know when some new rule of conduct arrived, when it will disappear?\n It is argued that the report of the Legislative Committee, dated April 10, 1933, disclosed the essential facts. May one be convicted of crime upon such findings? Are \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 549]\n\u00a0\n federal rights subject to extinction by reports of committees? Heretofore, they have not been.\n Apparently the Legislature acted upon this report. Some excerpts from it follow. We have no basis for determining whether the findings of the committee or Legislature are correct or otherwise. The court below refrained from expressing any opinion in that regard, notwithstanding its declaration 'that legislative authority to abridge property rights and freedom of contract can be justified only by exceptional circumstances and even then by reasonable regulation only and that legislative conclusions based on findings of fact are subject to judicial review.' On the other hand it asserted: 'This court should consider only the legitimacy of the conclusions drawn from the facts found.'\n In New York there are 12,000,000 possible consumers of milk; 130,000 farms produce it. The average daily output approximates 9,500,000 quarts. For ten or fifteen years prior to 1929 or 1930 the per capita consumption steadily increased; so did the supply. 'Realizing the marked improvement in milk quality, the public has tended to increase its consumption of this commodity.' 'In the past two years the per capita consumption has fallen off, (possibly) 10 per cent.' 'These marked changes in the trend of consumption of fluid milk and cream have occurred in spite of drastic reductions in retail prices. The obvious cause is the reduced buying power of consumers.' 'These cycles of overproduction and underproduction which average about 15 years in length, are explained by the human tendency to raise too many heifers when prices of cows are high and too few when prices of cows are low. A period of favorable prices for milk leads to the raising of more than the usual number of heifers, but it is not until seven or eight years later that the trend is reversed as a result of the falling prices \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 550]\n\u00a0\n of milk and cows.' 'Farmers all over the world raise too many heifers whenever cows pay and raise too few heifers when cows do not pay.'\n'During the years 1925 to 1930 inclusive, the prices which the farmers of the state received for milk were favorable as compared with the wholesale prices of all commodities. They were even more favorable as compared with the prices received for other farm products, for not only in New York but throughout the United States the general level of prices of farm products has been below that of other prices since the World War.'\n\n'The comparatively favorable situation enjoyed by the milk producers had an abrupt ending in 1932. Even before that, in 1930 and 1931, milk prices dropped very rapidly.' 'The prices which farmers received for milk during 1932 were much below the costs of production. After other costs were paid the producers had practically nothing left for their labor. The price received for milk in January, 1933, was little more than half the cost of production.'\n\n'Since 1927 the number of dairy cows in the state has increased about 10 per cent. The effect of this has been to increase the surplus of milk.' 'Similar increases in the number of cows have occurred generally in the United States and are due to the periodic changes in number of heifer calves raised on the farms. Previous experience indicates that unless some form of arbitrary regulation is applied, the production of milk will not be satisfactorily adjusted to the demand for a period of several years.' 'Close adjustment of the supply of fluid milk to the demand is further hindered by the periodic changes in the number of heifers raised for dairy cows.'\n\n'The purpose of this emergency measure is to bring partial relief to dairymen from the disastrously low prices for milk which have prevailed in recent months. It is recognized that the dairy industry of the state cannot be \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 551]\n\u00a0\n placed upon a profitable basis without a decided rise in the general level of commodity prices.'\n\n Thus we are told the number of dairy cows had been increasing and that favorable prices for milk bring more cows. For two years notwithstanding law prices the per capita consumption had been falling. 'The obvious cause is the reduced buying power of consumers.' Notwithstanding the low prices, farmers continued to produce a large surplus of wholesome milk for which there was no market. They had yielded to 'the human tendency to raise too many heifers' when prices were high and 'not until seven or eight years' after 1930 could one reasonably expect a reverse trend. This failure of demand had nothing to do with the quality of the milk-that was excellent. Consumers lacked funds with which to buy. In consequence the farmers became impoverished and their lands depreciated in value. Naturally they became discontented.\n The exigency is of the kind which inevitably arises when one set of men continue to produce more than all others can buy. The distressing result to the producer followed his ill-advised but voluntary efforts. Similar situations occur in almost every business. If here we have an emergency sufficient to empower the Legislature to fix sales prices, then whenever there is too much or too little of an essential thing-whether of milk or grain or pork or coal or shoes or clothes-constitutional provisions may be declared inoperative and the 'anarchy and despotism' prefigured in Milligan's Case are at the door. The futility of such legislation in the circumstances is pointed out below.\n Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.T. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165, and Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465, are much relied on to support emergency legislation. They were civil proceedings; the first to recover a leased building in the District of \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 552]\n\u00a0\n Columbia; the second to gain possession of an apartment house in New York. The unusual conditions grew out of the World War. The questioned statutes made careful provision for protection of owners. These cases were analyzed and their inapplicability to circumstances like the ones before us was pointed out in Tyson v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 58 A.L.R. 1236. They involved peculiar facts and must be strictly limited. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 416\n, 43 S.Ct. 158, 160, 28 A.L.R. 1321, said of them: 'The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They went to the verge of the law but fell far short of the present act.'\n Is the milk business so affected with public interest that the Legislature may prescribe prices for sales by stores? This Court has approved the contrary view; has emphatically declared that a state lacks power to fix prices in similar private businesses. United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S.Ct. 298, 14 A.L.R. 1045; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A.L.R. 1280; Tyson & Brother v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S.Ct. 506, 52 A.L.R. 163; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S.Ct. 545, 56 A.L.R. 1327; Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 60 A.L.R. 596; New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262\n, 52 S.Ct. 371; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 396\n, 53 S.Ct. 190.\n Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 537\n, 43 S.Ct. 630, 633, 27 A.L.R. 1280: Here the state statute undertook to destroy the freedom to contract by parties engaged in so-called 'essential' industries. This Court held that she had no such power. 'It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the Constitution, that the business of the butcher, or the baker, the tailor, the wood chopper, the \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 553]\n\u00a0\n mining operator, or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by state regulation . ... An ordinary producer, manufacturer, or shopkeeper may sell or not sell as he likes.' On a second appeal, \n267 \nU.S. 552, 569\n, 45 S.Ct. 441, 445, the same doctrine was restated: 'The system of compulsory arbitration which the act establishes is intended to compel, and if sustained will compel, the owner and employees to continue the business on terms which are not of their making. It will constrain them, not merely to respect the terms if they continue the business, but will constrain them to continue the business of those terms. True, the terms have some qualifications, but as shown in the prior decision the qualifications are rather illusory and do not subtract much from the duty imposed. Such a system infringes the liberty of contract and rights of property guaranteed by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 'The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect.\"\n Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 47 S.Ct. 506, 508, 52 A.L.R. 163: A statute commanded buyers of cream to adhere to uniform prices fixed by a single transaction. 'May the state, in order to prevent some strong buyers of cream from doing things which may tend to monopoly, inhibit plaintiff in error from carrying on its business in the usual way heretofore regarded as both moral and beneficial to the public and not shown now to be accompanied by evil results as ordinary incidents? Former decisions here require a negative answer. We think the inhibition of the statute has no reasonable relation to the anticipated evil-high bidding by some with purpose to monopolize or destroy competition. Looking through form to substance, it clearly and unmistakably infringes private rights, whose exercise \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 554]\n\u00a0\n does not ordinarily produce evil consequences, but the reverse.'\n Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 239\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 116, 60 A.L.R. 596: The State of Tennessee was declared without power to prescribe prices at which gasoline might be sold.' It is settled by recent decisions of this court that a state Legislature is without constitutional power to fix prices at which commodities may be sold, services rendered, or property used, unless the business or property involved is 'affected with a public interest.\" Considered affirmatively, 'it means that a business or property, in order to be affected with a public interest, must be such or be so employed as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby in effect granted to the public. ... Negatively, it does not mean that a business is affected with a public interest merely because it is large or because the public are warranted in having a feeling of concern in respect of its maintenance.'\n New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262, 277\n, 52 S.Ct. 371, 374: Here Oklahoma undertook the control of the business of manufacturing and selling ice. We denied the power so to do. 'It is a business as essentially private in its nature as the business of the grocer, the dairyman, the butcher, the baker, the shoemaker, or the tailor . ... And this court has definitely said that the production or sale of food or clothing cannot be subjected to legislative regulation on the basis of a public use.'\n Regulation to prevent recognized evils in business has long been upheld as permissible legislative action. But fixation of the price at which A, engaged in an ordinary business, may sell, in order to enable B, a producer, to improve his condition, has not been regarded as within legislative power. This is not regulation, but management, control, dictation-it amounts to the deprivation \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 555]\n\u00a0\n of the fundamental right which one has to conduct his own affairs honestly and along customary lines. The argument advanced here would support general prescription of prices for farm products, groceries, shoes, clothing, all the necessities of modern civilization, as well as labor, when some Legislature finds and declares such action advisable and for the public good. This Court has declared that a state may not by legislative fiat convert a private business into a public utility. Michigan Comn. v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 577\n, 45 S.Ct. 191, 36 A.L.R. 1105; Frost Trucking Co. v. R.R. Comn., \n271 \nU.S. 583, 592\n, 46 S.Ct. 605, 47 A.L.R. 457; Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 563\n, 51 S.Ct. 582. And if it be now ruled that one dedicates his property to public use whenever he embarks on an enterprise which the Legislature may think it desirable to bring under control, this is but to declare that rights guaranteed by the Constitution exist only so long as supposed public interest does not require their extinction. To adopt such a view, of course, would put an end to liberty under the Constitution.\n Munn v. Illinois (1876) \n94 U.S. 113\n, has been much discussed in the opinions referred to above. And always the conclusion was that nothing there sustains the notion that the ordinary business of dealing in commodities is charged with a public interest and subject to legislative control. The contrary has been distinctly announced. To undertake now to attribute a repudiated implication to that opinion is to affirm that it means what this Court has declared again and again was not intended. The painstaking effort there to point out that certain businesses like ferries, mills, etc., were subject to legislative control at common law and then to show that warehousing at Chicago occupied like relation to the public would have been pointless if 'affected with a public interest' only means that the public has serious concern about the perpetuity and success of the undertaking. That is true of almost all ordinary business affairs. Nothing in the \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 556]\n\u00a0\n opinion lends support, directly or otherwise to the notion that in times of peace a legislature may fix the price of ordinary commodities-grain, meat, milk, cotton, etc.\n Of the assailed statute the Court of Appeals says: 'It first declares that milk has been selling too cheaply in the state of New York, and has thus created a temporary emergency; this emergency is remedied by making the sale of milk at a low price a crime; the question of what is a low price is determined by the majority vote of three officials.' Also: 'With the wisdom of the legislation we have naught to do. It may be vain to hope by laws to oppose the general course of trade.' Maybe, because of this conclusion, it said nothing concerning the possibility of obtaining increase of prices to producers-the thing definitely aimed at-through the means adopted.\n But plainly, I think, this Court must have regard to the wisdom of the enactment. At least, we must inquire concerning its purpose and decide whether the means proposed have reasonable relation to something within legislative power-whether the end is legitimate, and the means appropriate. If a statute to prevent conflagrations, should require householders to pour oil on their roofs as a means of curbing the spread of fire when discovered in the neighborhood, we could hardly uphold it. Here, we find direct interference with guaranteed rights defended upon the ground that the purpose was to promote the public welfare by increasing milk prices at the farm. Unless we can affirm that the end proposed is proper and the means adopted have reasonable relation to it, this action is unjustifiable.\n The court below has not definitely affirmed this necessary relation; it has not attempted to indicate how higher charges at stores to impoverished customers when the out \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 557]\n\u00a0\n put is excessive and sale prices by producers are unrestrained, can possibly increase receipts at the farm. The Legislative Committee pointed out as the obvious cause of decreased consumption, notwithstanding low prices, the consumers' reduced buying power. Higher store prices will not enlarge this power; nor will they decrease production. Low prices will bring less cows only after several years. The prime causes of the difficulties will remain. Nothing indicates early decreased output. Demand at low prices being wholly insufficient, the proposed plan is to raise and fix higher minimum prices at stores and thereby aid the producer whose output and prices remain unrestrained! It is not true as stated that 'the State seeks to protect the producer by fixing a minimum price for his milk.' She carefully refrained from doing this; but did undertake to fix the price after the milk had passed to other owners. Assuming that the views and facts reported by the Legislative Committee are correct, it appears to me wholly unreasonable to expect this legislation to accomplish the proposed end-increase of prices at the farm. We deal only with Order No. 5 as did the court below. It is not merely unwise; it is arbitrary and unduly oppressive. Better prices may follow but it is beyond reason to expect them as the consequent of that order. The Legislative Committee reported: 'It is recognized that the dairy industry of the State cannot be placed upon a profitable basis without a decided rise in the general level of commodity prices.'\n Not only does the statute interfere arbitrarily with the rights of the little grocer to conduct his business according to standards long accepted-complete destruction may follow; but it takes away the liberty of 12,000,000 consumers to buy a necessity of life in an open market. It imposes direct and arbitrary burdens upon those already seriously impoverished with the alleged immediate design of affording special benefits to others. To him \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 558]\n\u00a0\n with less than 9 cents it says: You cannot procure a quart of milk from the grocer although he is anxious to accept what you can pay and the demands of your household are urgent! A superabundance; but no child can purchase from a willing storekeeper below the figure appointed by three men at headquarters! And this is true although the storekeeper himself may have bought from a willing producer at half that rate and must sell quickly or lose his stock through deterioration. The fanciful scheme is to protect the farmer against undue exactions by prescribing the price at which milk disposed of by him at will may be resold!\n The statement by the court below that, 'Doubtless the statute before us would be condemned by an earlier generation as a temerarious interference with the rights of property and contract ... with the natural law of supply and demand,' is obviously correct. But another, that 'statutes aiming to ... stimulate the production of a vital food product by fixing living standards of prices for the producer, are to be interpreted with that degree of liberality which is essential to the attainment of the end in view,' conflicts with views of constitutional rights accepted since the beginning. An end although apparently desirable cannot justify inhibited means. Moreover, the challenged act was not designed to stimulate production-there was too much milk for the demand and no prospect of less for several years. Also 'standards of prices' at which the producer might sell were not prescribed. The Legislature cannot lawfully destroy guaranteed rights of one man with the prime purpose of enriching another, even if for the moment, this may seem advantageous to the public. And the adoption of any 'concept of jurisprudence' which permits facile disregard of the Constitution as long interpreted and respected will inevitably lead to its destruction. Then, all rights will be subject \n\n[291 U.S. 502, 559]\n\u00a0\n to the caprice of the hour; government by stable laws will pass.\n The somewhat misty suggestion below that condemnation of the challenged legislation would amount to holding 'that the due process clause has left milk producers unprotected from oppression,' I assume, was not intended as a material contribution to the discussion upon the merits of the cause. Grave concern for embarrassed farmers is everywhere; but this should neither obscure the rights of others nor obstruct judicial appraisement of measures proposed for relief. The ultimate welfare of the producer, like that of every other class, requires dominance of the Constitution. And zealously to uphold this in all its parts is the highest duty intrusted to the courts.\n The judgment of the court below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER authorize me to say that they concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] People v. Nebbia, 262 N.Y. 259, 186 N.E. 694.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 158 of the Laws of 1933 added a new article (numbered 25) to the Agriculture and Markets Law. The reasons for the enactment are set forth in the first section (section 300). So far as material they are: That unhealthful, unfair, unjust, destructive, demoralizing, and uneconomic trade practices exist in the production, sale, and distribution of milk and milk products, whereby the dairy industry in the state and the constant supply of pure milk to inhabitants of the state are imperiled; these conditions are a menace to the public health, welfare and reasonable comfort; the production and distribution of milk is a paramount industry upon which the prosperity of \n the state in a great measure depends; existing economic conditions have largely destroyed the purchasing power of milk producers for industrial products, have broken down the orderly production and marketing of milk, and have seriously impaired the agricultural assets supporting the credit structure of the state and its local governmental subdivisions. The danger to public health and welfare consequent upon these conditions is declared to be immediate and to require public supervision and control of the industry to enforce proper standards of production, sanitation and marketing.\n The law then (section 301) defines the terms used; declaring, inter alia, that 'milk dealer' means any person who purchases or handles milk within the state, for sale in the state, or sells milk within the state except when consumed on the premises where sold; and includes within the definition of 'store' a grocery store.\n By section 302 a state Milk Control Board is established; and by section 303 general power is conferred upon that body to supervise and regulate the entire milk industry of the state, subject to existing provisions of the public health law, the public service law, the state sanitary code, and local health ordinances and regulations; to act as arbitrator or mediator in controversies arising between producers and dealers, or groups within those classes, and to exercise certain special powers to which reference will be made.\n The board is authorized to promulgate orders and rules which are to have the force of law (section 304); to make investigations (section 305); to enter and inspect premises in which any branch of the industry is conducted, and examine the books, papers and records of any person concerned in the industry (section 306); to license all milk dealers and suspend or revoke licenses for specified causes, its action in these respects being subject to review by certiorari (section 308), and to require licensees to keep records (section 309) and to make reports ( section 310).\n A violation of any provision of article 25 or of any lawful order of the board is made a misdemeanor (section 307).\n By section 312 it is enacted (a): 'The board shall ascertain by such investigations and proofs as the emergency permits, what prices for milk in the several localities and markets of the state, and under varying conditions, will best protect the milk industry in the state and insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk ... and be most in the public interest. The board shall take into considera- \n tion all conditions affecting the milk industry including the amount necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and to the milk dealer.' (b) After such investigation the board shall by official order fix minimum and maximum wholesale and retail prices to be charged by milk dealers to consumers, by milk dealers to stores for consumption on the premises or for resale to consumers, and by stores to consumers for consumption off the premises where sold. It is declared (c) that the intent of the law is that the benefit of any advance in price granted to dealers shall be passed on to the producer, and if the board, after due hearing, finds this has not been done, the dealer's license may be revoked, and the dealer may be subjected to the penalties mentioned in the Act. The board may (d) after investigation fix the prices to be paid by dealers to producers for the various grades and classes of milk.\n Subsection (e),  312, on which the prosecution in the present case is founded, is quoted in the text.\n Alterations may be made in existing orders after hearing of the interested parties section 312(f) and orders made are subject to review on certiorari. The board (section 319) is to continue with all the powers and duties specified until March 31, 1934, at which date it is to be deemed abolished. The Act contains further provisions not material to the present controversy. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Laws 1862, chap. 467. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Laws 1893, chap. 338; Laws 1909, chap. 9, Consol.

HELVERING(1934)\nNo. 547\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph Sterling and Edward G. Griffin, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. Brian Holland, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a controversy respecting deficiencies in the petitioner's income taxes for 1922 and 1923. \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n The question presented is, Where all the assets and business of an older corporation are taken over by a new corporation, specially organized for the purpose and having substantially the same capital structure, in exchange for a portion of its stock, which is distributed by the older corporation among the latter's stockholders share for share, thereby retiring the old shares, is the new corporation entitled, notwithstanding the change in corporate identity and ownership, to have its taxable income for the succeeding period computed and determined by deducting from its net income for that period the net losses sustained by the older corporation in the preceding period? The answer involves a construction of section 204(b) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 231, which declares:\n'If for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1920, it appears upon the production of evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner that any taxpayer has sustained a net loss, the amount thereof shall be deducted from the net income of the taxpayer for the succeeding taxable year; and if such net loss is in excess of the net income for such succeeding taxable year, the amount of such excess shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income for the next succeeding taxable year; the deduction in all cases to be made under regulations prescribed by the Commission with the approval of the Secretary.'\n\n The material facts out of which the controversy arises are as follows:\n Both corporations were organized under the laws of New York for the purpose of producing and selling ice-the older in 1920, with an authorized capital of $750,000, and the new on April 13, 1922, with an authorized capital of $700,000. The older one had proceeded to issue and sell stock, acquire a site for its plant, and supply necessary equipment. When the equipment was only partly in \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n stalled, and the plant was being operated at 40 per cent. of its intended capacity, the company became financially embarrassed and unable to meet its indebtedness or supply additional equipment needed to render the business profitable.\n A creditors' committee was organized, and likewise a stockholders' committee. Investigation disclosed that much stock had been issued of which there was no record and for which no consideration was received. Negotiations resulted in the restoration and cancellation of the spurious stock and in an agreement to organize a new company to take over the assets and liabilities, proceed with the completion of the equipment, and continue the operation of the business. The agreement included provisions for the issue of stock by the new company to the old equal in class, par- value, and number of shares, to the outstanding stock so that the old company could make an exchange share for share with its stockholders and thereby retire its outstanding stock; for obtaining new funds with which to complete the equipment; for an extension of time by existing creditors; and for investing creditors with a supervising management through a stock voting trust until their claims were paid.\n Accordingly the new corporation-petitioner here-was organized and took over the assets, liabilities, and business of the old corporation on April 13, 1922. Other provisions of the agreement were carried out in the manner contemplated, save in minor particulars not material here. The corporate existence of the old corporation continue (so it is stipulated) during the remainder of 1922 and all of 1923, but after the transfer it transacted no business and had no assets or income.\n The old corporation sustained statutory net losses in the sum of $36, 093.19 during 1921 and in the further sum of $10,338.90 during the part of 1922 preceding the transer. The new corporation realized a net income of $ 48,763.43 during the part of 1922 succeeding the transfer \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n and of $56,242.55 during the year 1923. In this proceeding the new corporation asserts a right under section 204(b) to a deduction from its income so realized of the losses so sustained by the old corporation.\n The petitioner insists that the continuity of the business was not broken by the transfer from the old company to the new; and this may be conceded. But it should be observed that this continuity was accomplished by deliberate elimination of the old company and substitution of the new one. Besides, the matter of importance here, as will be shown presently, is not continuity of business alone but of ownership and tax liability as well. Had the transfer from one company to the other been effected by an unconditional sale for cash, there would have been continuity of business, but not of ownership or tax liability.\n Petitioner also insists that the ultimate parties in interest- stockholders and creditors-were substantially the same after the transfer as before; and this may be conceded. But there is here no effort to tax either creditors or stockholders. Other statutes, as also constitutional provisions, have an important bearing on the taxation of gains by stockholders through corporate reorganizations, and the cited decisions relating to that subject1 are not presently apposite. What is being taxed in this instance is the income realized by the new company in conducting the business after the transfer; and the sole matter for decision is whether, under section 204(b), there shall be deducted from that income the losses suffered by the old company in its conduct of the same business before the transfer.\n The Board of Tax Appeals, 24 B.T.A. 886, and the Circuit Court of Appeals, 66 F.(2d) 480, both ruled that the deduction is not admissible under the statute. \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n The power to tax income like that of the new corporation is plain and extends to the gross income. Whether and to what extent deductions shall be allowed depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.\n The statutes pertaining to the determination of taxable income have proceeded generally on the principle that there shall be a computation of gains and losses on the basis of a distinct accounting for each taxable year; and only in exceptional situations, clearly defined, has there been provision for an allowance for losses suffered in an earlier year. Not only so, but the statutes have disclosed a general purpose to confine allowable losses to the taxpayer sustaining them, i.e., to treat them as personal to him and not transferable to or usable by another.\n Obviously, therefore, a taxpayer seeking a deduction must be able to point to an applicable statute and show that he comes within its terms.\n These views, often reflected in decisions of this Court, have been recently reaffirmed and applied in Woolford Realty Company v. Rose, \n286 U.S. 319\n, 326 et seq., 52 S.Ct. 509; Planters' Cotton Oil Company v. Hopkins, \n286 \nU.S. 332\n, 52 S.Ct. 509; and Helvering v. Independent Life Insurance Company, \n292 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 758, 78 L.Ed. -- (decided May 21, 1934).\n When section 204(b) is read with the general policy of the statutes in mind, as it  ould be, we think it cannot be regarded as giving any support to the deduction here claimed. It brings into the statutes an exceptional provision declaring that where for one year 'any taxpayer has sustained a net loss' the same shall be deducted from the net income of 'the taxpayer' for the succeeding taxable year; and, if such loss be in excess of the income for that year, the excess shall be deducted from the net income for the next succeeding taxable year. Its words are plain and free from ambiguity. Taken according to their natural import they mean that the taxpayer who sustained the loss is the one to whom the deduction shall \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n be allowed. Had there been a purpose to depart from the general policy in that regard, and to make the right to the deduction transferable or available to others than the taxpayer who sustained the loss, it is but reasonable to believe that purpose would have been clearly expressed. And, as the section contains nothing which even approaches such an expression, it must be taken as not intended to make such a departure.\n We come then to an alternative contention that, even though the section be not as broad as claimed, the deduction should be allowed, because 'for all practical purposes the new corporation was the same entity as the old one and therefore the same taxpayer.' This is not in accord with the view on which the stockholders and creditors proceeded when the new company was brought into being. They deserted the old company and turned to the new one because they regarded it as a distinct corporate entity and therefore free from difficulties attending the old one. Having sought and reaped the advantages incident to the change, it well may be that they would encounter some embarrassment in now objecting to an incidental and remote disadvantage such as is here in question. But, be this as it may, we are of opinion that in law and in fact the two corporations were not identical but distinct. This was plainly implied in the transfer of the assets and business from one to the other. That transaction was voluntary and contractual, not by operation of law. Thereafter neither corporation had any control over the other;2 the old corporation had no interest in the assets or business, and the chance of gain and the risk of loss were wholly with the new one. Thus the contention that the two corporations were practically the same entity and therefore the same taxpayer has no basis, unless, as the petitioner insists, the fact that the stock- \n\n[292 U.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n holders of the two corporations were substantially the same constitutes such a basis.\n As a general rule a corporation and its stockholders are deemed separate entities3 and this is true in respect of tax problems. \n4\n Of course, the rule is subject to the qualification that the separate identity may be disregarded in exceptional situations where it otherwise would present an obstacle to the due protection or enforcement of public or private rights. 5 But in this case we find no such exceptional situation-nothing taking it out of the general rule. On the contrary, we think it a typical case for the application of that rule.\n The petitioner relies on Pioneer Pole & Shaft Company v. Commissioner ( C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 861, Industrial Cotton Mills Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 291, and H. H. Miller Industries Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 412. The decisions in these cases are not wholly in point but contain language giving color to the petitioner's claim, and are to that extent in conflict with other federal decisions, notably Athol Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 54 F. (2d) 230; Turner-Farber-Love Co. v. Helvering ( C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 416; and the decision now under review. In so far as they are not in harmony with the views expressed in this opinion they are disapproved.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

So far as the state court discussed these contentions with specific reference to the Constitution of the United States, both in its original opinion, and in an opinion denying the appellants' application for rehearing, they may be reviewed here, notwithstanding the failure of appellants to mention them in their assignment of errors to the state supreme court, as required by its rules.

Board of Revision of Tax Assessm nts, \n284 \nU.S. 23, 24\n, 52 S.Ct. 48. We confine our opinion to the questions thus discussed.\n Appellants, nonresidents of Mississippi are owners of tracts of land in Tunica county, Miss., all of which were assessed for local and state taxation for the year 1928. They failed to pay the tax on one tract alone, and the state, on relation of the Attorney General, brought the present suit in the chancery court of Tunica county to recover the unpaid tax as a debt of the owners. This suit was begun by attachment of other lands of appellants' on which the tax had been paid. The bill of complaint alleges that the appellants are engaged in removing timber from the land on which the tax has not been paid; that the land without it is not of sufficient value to \n\n[292 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n pay the tax, and that unless they are restrained from cutting the timber the state and its municipal subdivisions will be deprived of the tax. The bill prays that appellants be enjoined from cutting the timber until the tax is paid, and that it be satisfied from the attached lands.\n Appellants appeared generally in the suit, and secured the release of the attachment by giving bond, in the sum of $10,000, an amount in excess of all taxes claimed and recovered, by which they and their surety became bound to satisfy any decree which might be recovered in the suit. In their answer they set up numerous defenses on state grounds, all of which so far as now material have been resolved against them and may not be reviewed here. They also set up two distinct defenses, which are urged here: First, that they are and at all times have been nonresidents of the state and that the tax demanded was assessed without service of any process on them, or notice to them, or opportunity to be heard in any proceedings for its assessment, and without their appearance in any such proceedings; that in consequence the state taxing officers were without jurisdiction to assess the tax and that any collection is an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, that the decree of the state court, so far as it purports to adjudicate any right of the state to satisfy the tax liability out of lands of appellants within the state other than those upon which the tax was assessed, or to impose upon appellants any personal liability for the tax is likewise a violation of due process.\n\n 1. \nSection 3122 of the Mississippi Code of 1930 declares that every lawful tax is a debt for the recovery of which an action may be brought in the state courts 'and in all actions for the recovery of ad valorem taxes the assessment rolls shall only be prima facie correct.' In construing and applying this section in the present case, the state court held that the tax, recovery of which it \n\n[292 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n allowed, was a debt collectible by suit. But as the statute makes the assessment roll only prima facie correct, the court, following its decision in George County Bridge Co. v. Catlett, 161 Miss. 120, 135 So. 217, ruled that it is open to a defendant, in such a suit, to assail the correctness and legal sufficiency of the assessment; that it is the proceeding in court and not the assessment which finally fixes the liability to pay the tax, and since appellants had appeared in the suit and had had full opportunity to be heard before the decree was rendered upholding the assessment, there was no denial of due process.\n Accepting, as we must, this construction of the laws of the state by its highest court, they infringe no constitutional limitation. There is no constitutional command that notice of the assessment of a tax, and opportunity to contest it, must be given in advance of the assessment. It is enough that all available defenses may be presented to a competent tribunal before exaction of the tax and before the command of the state to pay it becomes final and irrevocable.

Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298.\n\n 2. \nThe question remains whether the state, in conformity with due process, may declare the tax, lawfully assessed upon one tract of appellants' land, a debt collectible from other property of theirs within the state and from the appellants themselves by a judgment in personam. It can no longer be questioned that a state may collect taxes, assessed against one parcel of property within its jurisdiction, from other parcels within the state, owned by the same person, though he be a nonresident. Scottish Union & National Insurance Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 632\n, 25 S.Ct. 345; Bristol v. Washington County, Supra, 145 of 177 U. S., 20 S.Ct. 585; compare Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 124 S., 8 S.Ct. 1037; see Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 39 S.Ct. 33. To \n\n[292 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n that extent at least the power of the state over the property within its bounds may be exerted to affect the interest of the common owner. The power to collect the tax from property within the state is always exercised at the expense of the owner, even though a non-resident, and an obligation in rem is thus imposed on his ownership, which is within the control of the state because of the presence there of the physical objects which are the subject of ownership. As it is an incident of property that it may be made to respond to obligations to which its owner may be subject, no want of due process is involved in satisfying an obligation imposed upon the ownership of one item of property by resort to another which is subject to the same ownership.\n Here the suit was brought to compel payment of the tax out of the attached property. The end sought was the same as that constitutionally achieved in Scottish Union & National Ins. Co. v. Bowland, supra, by distraint upon the non-resident's property to satisfy a tax assessed upon other property within the taxing state, and is equally free from constitutional objection. By giving their bond to release the attachment, the appellants have voluntarily substituted their personal liability on the bond for the liability which might otherwise have been satisfied from the attached property. As the tax, payment of which is decreed, is less than the amount of the bond, it is only this personal liability upon the bond which the state seeks to enforce here.\n It is unnecessary to decide the different question with respect to appellants' personal liability to pay the tax which would be presented if the decree had exceeded the amount of the bond, or if appellants had appeared and defended the suit without giving bond or securing release of the attachment.

BOBO(1934)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[290 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. H. Orrick, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert D. Duke, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Claiming under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59 ), respondent sued the petitioner in the superior court, Marin county, Cal ., for damages consequent upon the death of her husband, Perry E. Bobo. She maintains that this was the proximate result of the company's negligence while it employed him.\n The complaint alleged:\n That on February 4, 1930, the decedent, Bobo, was a tender of the bridge at Grand View, Cal., a portion of petitioner's road; 'it was part of said deceased's duties as such bridge tender to uncouple the tracks and, connections on said bridge, work the semaphore signals and, open and close the draw of said bridge; that in the course of the performance of said duties said deceased was required to go to the building on the top of said bridge for the purpose of using the mechanism located in said building which was necessary to be used in the opening and closing of said bridge and to work the semaphore signals; that on said last mentioned date it became the duty of said \n\n[290 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n deceased in the discharge of his duties as such bridge tender to adjust the semaphore signals and that while returning from his duties he slipped upon the steps leading up to said building and was precipitated into the waters of the Petaluma Creek and came to his death.\n'That said defendant was careless and negligent in this, that it failed to provide said deceased a safe place to do the Work required of him; that said bridge was installed in an improper manner so as to render the same unsafe and dangerous; that the steps leading to the building on the top of said bridge were constructed, installed, used and maintained by said defendant in an improper, faulty and defective manner so as to render them unsafe and dangerous; that it failed to install proper guard rails on said steps and the approaches thereto so as to protect persons using said bridge and said steps; that it permitted said steps to become uneven so that they sloped and permitted water to collect in depressions on said steps on which said deceased slipped and fell.'\n\n A jury found in favor of the respondent and assessed the damages at $ 12,500. Judgment thereon was affirmed by the District Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court refused to hear the cause, and it comes here by certiorari.\n The petitioner maintained that there was no evidence to show the death resulted from its negligence, also that Bobo assumed the risk, and asked for an instructed verdict. The trial court wrongly, we think, refused this request.\n The evidence shows that the deceased began his service as bridge tender in August, 1929, and continued until he disappeared February 4, 1930. His working hours were from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. His duty was to open the draw for the passage of boats, then close it, see that the rails were properly aligned, and set the lights. The draw was operated through an engine housed 26 feet above the \n\n[290 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n rails. When not actually engaged, Bobo ordinarily remained in a shanty, near the end of the bridge. To reach or return from the enging he went up or down a flight of 35 iron steps which ran along the outside of the bridge structure, pitched at 48 1\/2 degrees to the horizontal. These steps were guarded by a single rail on either side. They were 21 inches long and 8 inches wide. He was furnished with a proper lantern to light the way.\n February 3, 1930, at 9 o'clock Bobo went to work. He was last seen alive at 11 o'clock; an entry in the log book shows that he opened the draw the next morning at 1:30. Two weeks thereafter his body, badly decomposed, was found in the water some distance from the bridge. To determine the cause of death from an examination of this was impossible.\n When last seen, the deceased wore a coat with sheepskin collar. A few hours after his disappearance witnesses discovered on the edge of the iron platform at the foot of the stairway what seemed to be small pieces of wool; also a little spot which looked like blood. Some of the steps and the platform had become smooth through use during fifteen years or more. During the winter dew often accumulated on these during the night and caused them to become quite slippery. Also witnesses stated the stairs and platform were not adequately guarded-the single rail was not enough and was placed too low.\n Respondent's theory is that, while properly discharging his duties, Bobo slipped, fell into the water, and drowned.\n Our decisions clearly show that 'proof of negligence alone does not entitle the plaintiff to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The negligence complained of must be the cause of the injury. The jury may not be permitted to speculate as to its cause, and the case must be withdrawn from its consideration, unless there is evidence from which the inference may reasonably be \n\n[290 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n drawn that the injury suffered was caused by the negligent act of the employer.'

Saxon, \n284 \nU.S. 458\n, 52 S.Ct. 229.\n If petitioner was negligent in respect of the stairway and platform, there is nothing whatsoever to show that this was the proximate cause of the unfortunate death. So to conclude would be pure speculation; and, for reasons heretofore sufficiently elaborated, judgments based upon verdicts so arrived at cannot be permitted to stand.\n Regarding the defense based upon assumption of the risk, the District Court of Appeal said: 'Here, so far as shown, decedent had never ascended the stairway during the daytime; nor was he aware of the conditions which made the structure dangerous. The complaint described the defects which were alleged to have caused the injury; and defendant contends that these allegations show that the cause of death was a risk assumed by decedent, and that consequently no cause of action was stated, citing Bresette v. E. B. & A. L. Stone Co., 162 Cal. 74, 121 P. 312; but, as pointed out, the evidence was insufficient to show that decedent knew of the defects described, or that the conditions under which he was employed were such that he must have known them.'\n With this conclusion we cannot agree. The deceased had gone up and down these open stairs very many times from August to February. He had a proper lantern by the light of which he could easily see the alleged defects. He must have been aware that moisture frequently accumulated. Also often during the summer and early autumn there was adequate sunlight before 5 o'clock a.m. to disclose the real conditions. No suggestion is made of any complaint to the company concerning the stairs or platform. \n\n[290 U.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n We think the record discloses enough to show that the decedent assumed any alleged risk.

OKLAHOMA PACKING CO.(1934)\nNo. 832\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Oklahoma. \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert M. Rainey, of Oklahoma City, Okl., I. J. Underwood, of Tulsa, Okl., and Streeter B. Flynn, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n Messrs. W. R. Brown, of Chicago, Ill., and Fred Hansen, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) from a decree of the District Court for Western Oklahoma, three judges sitting, which dismissed the cause for want of equity jurisdiction. 6 F.Supp. 893. The suit was brought by Oklahoma Natural Gas Company and Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, two public service companies, against appellees, Wilson & Co., Inc., now Oklahoma Packing Company, a private business corporation, the State Corporation Commission, and the Attorney General of the state, to enjoin enforcement of an order of the commission. The order, which directed the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to supply Wilson & Company with natural gas at a prescribed rate, was assailed as an infringement of the due process and contract clauses of the Federal Constitution on the ground that it imposed on the gas company a duty to serve which it had never undertaken to perform, and impaired a contract between the two gas companies with respect to the distribution of gas by them to consumers in the vicinity of the plant of Wilson & Co. The order, which was made upon petition of Wilson & Co. to the state \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n commission, directed that the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company be required to supply it with gas at a lower rate than it had been paying for gas supplied by the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company which that company purchased from the Natural Gas Company for distribution.\n On appeal, the state Supreme Court affirmed the order. 146 Okl. 272, 288 P. 316. Pending the appeal, supersedeas bonds were given which suspended the order and Wilson & Co. continued to take its gas supply from the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company at the higher rate. In the meantime, while the petition to review the order was pending before the state Supreme Court, and before the present suit was brought, the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company acquired the properties of the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, and a new industrial rate for natural gas supplied by it was put into effect by order of the commission.\n Upon affirmance by the state Supreme Court of the commission's earlier order, Wilson & Co. brought suit in the state district court, joining as defendants the Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company and the sureties on the supersedeas bonds, to recover the amount paid for gas in excess of the rate prescribed by the earlier order of the commission. That suit was defended upon the ground, among others, of the constitutional invalidity of the order. Judgment was given for Wilson & Co., from which an appeal was taken and is now pending in he state Supreme Court.\n Following this judgment, the present suit was brought upon a bill of complaint which set up the invalidity of the order, alleged that the action of the state Supreme Court in affirming it was legislative, not judicial, see Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Company, Inc. (C.C.A .) 54 F.(2d) 596, and prayed an injunction restraining appellees from taking any steps to enforce it. The court below construed this as asking both that the state officers be enjoined from \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 389]\n\u00a0\n enforcing the order and that Wilson & Co. be restrained from prosecuting its pending suit in the state courts to recover the excess payments for gas. Upon the trial, the court below made its finding, not assailed here, that no penalties could be imposed for noncompliance with the challenged order, as it had been suspended by supersedeas in the proceedings to review it before the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and while they were pending it had become inoperative by reason of the order of the commission establishing the new rate. It found that 'there is no suggestion in the record of any intention on the part of any of the officials of Oklahoma to undertake to impose any statutory penalties for failure to comply with the order.' The court concluded that there was no basis for relief by injunction against state officials, and that the only issue left in the case was the right asserted by appellees to enjoin prosecution of the suit of Wilson & Co. in the state courts, and that, as the alleged invalidity of the commission's order had been interposed as a defense in that suit and had been passed upon by the state court, there was no occasion for relief by a federal court of equity.\n The appellants insist here, as they did below, that the District Court of Oklahoma is without jurisdiction to pass upon the issue of the invalidity of the order, since by section 20, art. 9, of the state Constitution, exclusive jurisdiction to review or set aside an order of the commission is conferred on the state Supreme Court. See Pioneer Tel. & Tel. Company v. State, 40 Okl. 417, 138 P. 1033. We are asked on this appeal to sustain the equity jurisdiction of the three-judge court to restrain the prosecution of the suit at law in the state courts, upon the ground that appellants are without adequate legal remedy to protect themselves from the exactions of the unconstitutional order. \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n By section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), suits, in which an interlocutory injunction is sought and pressed, to restrain any state officer from enforcing or executing a state statute or an order of a state commission, on the ground of its unconstitutionality, are required to be tried before a court of three judges. The section provides that 'a direct appeal to the Supreme Court may be taken from a final decree granting or denying a permanent injunction in such suit.' Our jurisdiction to hear the present appeal is challenged, and, as this is the only provision authorizing the appeal to this Court, it is necessary at the outset to determine whether this is 'such suit.'\n The procedure prescribed by section 266 may be invoked only if the suit is one to restrain the action of state officers. Ex parte Public National Bank, \n278 \nU.S. 101\n, 49 S.Ct. 43; Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565\n, 48 S.Ct. 585. That this condition is vital is sufficiently indicated by reference to the part played by Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764, in inducing enactment of the section. \n1\n Hence the cause of action alleged against Wilson & Co., although within the jurisdiction of the District Court, is subject to this extraordinary procedure, and appealable directly to this Court, if at all only because it is incidental to the relief prayed against the state officers. See Pittsburgh & West Virginia Ry. Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479\n, 50 S.Ct. 378. Whether it is so incidental we need not inquire, for we conclude that the cas against the state officers was not one within the appellate jurisdiction conferred upon this Court by section 266 so as to bring either that case or its incidents before us for decision. Compare Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 549; Clark v. Wooster, \n119 \nU.S. 322, 325\n, 7 S.Ct. 217. \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n The allegations against appellee officers, it is true, present on their face every prerequisite to three-judge action. But, when it became apparent, as it did upon the final hearing, that there was never any basis for relief of any sort against the state officers, and that the only matter in controversy was the right of Wilson & Co. to recover the alleged excess payments for gas, there was no longer any occasion for proceeding under section 266. The issue is not one of the federal jurisdiction of the District Court, see Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, 78 L.Ed . --; Ex parte Poresky, \n290 \nU.S. 30, 31\n, 54 S.Ct. 3; compare Rice & Adams Corporation v.

That procedure, designed for a specific class of cases, sharply defined, should not be lightly extended. Ex parte Collins, supra, at 569. The limitations of the statute would be defeated were it enough to keep three judges assembled that a plaintiff could resort to a mere form of words in his complaint alleging that the suit is one to restrain action of state officers, with no support whatever in fact or law. Compare Pacific Elec. Ry. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n194 \nU.S. 112, 118\n, 24 S.Ct. 586. See, also, Wilderman v. Roth (C.C.A.) 17 F.(2d) 486. The restrictions placed upon appellate review in this Court by the jurisdictional act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936), would likewise be measurably impaired were groundless allegations thus to suffice. See Smith v. Wilson, supra, at page 390 of 273 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 385. Compare United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n, 40 S.Ct. 448. When it becomes apparent that the plaintiff has no case for three judges, though they may have been properly \n\n[292 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n convened, their action is no longer prescribed, and direct appeal here must fail as well in this case as where the plaintiff does not press his injunction, Smith v. Wilson, supra, or his constitutional attack. Compare Ex parte Hobbs, supra. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Although without jurisdiction to hear the merits of the appeal, this Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, has authority to give such directions as may be appropriate to enforce the limitations of section 266, and to conform the procedure to its requirements. And we may frame our order in a way that will save to the appellants their proper remedies. Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 16\n, 54 S.Ct. 565, 78 L.Ed. --.

Anchor Coal Co., \n279 \nU.S. 812\n, 49 S.Ct. 262.\n By mistakenly appealing directly to this Court, appellants have lost their opportunity to have the decree below reviewed on its merits, as the time for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals has expired. Compare Healy v. Ratta, \n289 \nU.S. 701\n, 53 S.Ct. 522; Id., \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, 78 L.Ed. --. We might now terminate the litigation by dismissing the appeal without more, and it would be proper to do so had the correct procedure under section 266 been more definitely settled at the time the appeal to this Court was attempted. But, in the circumstances, it is appropriate that the decree below should be vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings to be taken independently of section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380). Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., supra.\n Costs will be awarded against the appellants. See Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan Railway Co. v.

Ed. --, 'limited to the question of the right of the taxpayer to deductions (a) on account of amortization of bond discount and (b) on account of contributions to the San Francisco Community Chest.'\n During each of the years 1923 to 1926, inclusive, petitioner and two corporations affiliated with it filed consolidated income tax returns on the accrual basis. In each year one of the affiliated corporations deducted, from gross income, amortized discount allowed upon an issue of its bonds in 1912. In computing the taxable income to be assessed to petitioner, the parent corporation, under the applicable Revenue Acts of 1921 (chapter 136, 42 Stat. 227), 1924 (chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253), and 1926 (chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9), the Commissioner refused to allow the deduction of so much of the amortized discount as was applicable to bonds, issued by its affiliate, which petitioner had acquired by purchase. He also refused to allow credit for the contributions to the Community Chest as not an ordinary and necessary expense, deduction of which the statute permits. His action was sustained both by the Board of Tax Appeals, 25 B.T. A. 305, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 69 F.(2d) 676.\n\n 1. \nIt is no longer open to question that amortized bond discount may be deducted in the separate return of a single taxpayer. See Helvering v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n293 \nU.S. 282\n, 55 S.Ct. 165, decided this day. But the government insists that the deduction by one affiliate, in a consolidated return, of amortized discount upon its bonds, \n\n[293 U.S. 289, 291]\n\u00a0\n which are owned by another affiliate, involves an 'intercompany transaction' which, under the applicable statutes and regulations, must be eliminated from the computation of the tax in order to arrive at the true taxable income.\n Section 240 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 260), and section 240, Revenue Acts 1924, and 1926 (26 USCA  993 and note) extends to affiliated corporate taxpayers the privilege of making a consolidated tax return, subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by treasury regulations. The purpose of the section was to provide a method of computing the tax upon the true net income of what is in practical effect a single business enterprise, with substantially common ownership, as though it were that of a single taxpayer, despite the fact that it is carried on by separate corporations whose tax would otherwise be independently computed. See Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Co., \n287 \nU.S. 544, 547\n, 53 S.Ct. 227; Handy & Harman v. Burnet, \n284 \nU.S. 136, 140\n, 52 S.Ct. 51; Atlantic City Electric Co. v.

It is by the elimination of intercompany trans- \n\n[293 U.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n actions from the computation, in order to ascertain 'the combined net income of the several corporations consolidated,' that the purpose of the statute is effected. See Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Co., supra, \n287 \nU.S. 549, 550\n, 53 S.Ct. 227. The government, having thus conferred upon groups of affiliated taxpayers the privilege of computing their tax as though they were a single taxpaying entity, it would require plain language in statute and regulations to support the conclusion that it was also intended that they should retain the advantages which, before affiliation, attached peculiarly to their status as independent tax computing entities. The regulations are aimed at the prevention of a double advantage, to be secured only if affiliated taxpayers are allowed to treat themselves, at the same moment, as one or many, according to their convenience for purposes of tax computation.\n Amortized bond discount is deductible from the taxpayer's gross income only by way of anticipation of payment of the bonds at maturity. It is then that the taxpayer pays the difference, between the amount realized upon the sale of the bonds and their par value, which is the subject of the amortization. Helvering v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra. Here the payment anticipated is from one affiliate to another, an intercompany transaction. If we eliminate it from the computation of income upon the consolidated return, as the regulation directs, there is no anticipated payment of the discount to be amortized and no basis for the deduction.\n A single taxpayer who had purchased his own bonds before maturity could not afterwards deduct, from gross income, the amortized discount on the bonds, in anticipation of their payment at maturity. This is equally the case where the obligor and obligee are affiliated corporations claiming the benefit of a statute which permits them to compute their tax as though they were one. It is true \n\n[293 U.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n that in either case the bondholder may sell his bonds before maturity, and thus renew his obligation to pay them. But in neither is the taxpayer in a position to require the government to anticipate an event which may never occur, by conferring upon him the benefit of a deduction to which, without its occurrence, he would not be entitled. Having elected to take the benefit of affiliation, the taxpayer cannot complain of a burden which is inseparable from the benefit and which finds its source in the very method of computing the tax from which the benefit is derived.\n\n 2. \nThe privilege of deducting charitable donations from gross income, conferred on individual taxpayers by section 214(a) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 239), and section 214(a), Revenue Acts 1924 and 1926, 26 USCA  955(a) and note, has not been extended to corporations. A proposal to extend it to them was rejected by Congress pending the passage of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). Cong. Rec., House, Vol. 56, Part 10, 10426-10428. Section 234(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 254), and section 234(a) (1), Revenue Acts 1924 and 1926, 26 USCA  986(a)(1) and note, authorizes corporations to deduct from gross income 'all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.' Article 562 of Treasury Regulations 62, interpretative of the 1921 act, declared that corporations were not entitled to deduct charitable donations. But it recognized the right to deduct donations 'made by a corporation for purposes connected with the operation of its business ... when limited to charitable institutions, hospitals or educational institutions conducted for the benefit of its employees,' and also donations 'which legitimately represent a consideration for a benefit flowing directly to the corporation as an incident of its business.' These provisions were retained, without substantial change, in the regulations promulgated under the 1924, 1926, and 1928 Revenue Acts. Art. 562 of T.R. 65, 69; Art. 262 of T.R. 74. As section 234(a) \n\n[293 U.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n (1) to wich they pertain has been re-enacted in several revenue acts, the regulation now has the force of law. McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510; Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 269, 273\n, 53 S.Ct. 337.\n It is a question of fact in each case whether a donation is made to an institution conducted for the benefit of the donor's employees or is consideration for a benefit flowing directly to the donor as an incident of its business. Here the ruling of the Commissioner, that the deduction was not permissible under the statute and regulations, presumably rests upon a correct determination of the facts. Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111, 115\n, 54 S.Ct. 8. The Board of Tax Appeals found that the gifts to the San Francisco Community Chest were apportioned among the charitable organizations of the city and that the gifts of petitioner were made in the belief that 'they resulted in good will toward the petitioner and increased its business.' But the Board made no finding of any direct benefit to petitioner's employees or business which the regulations contemplate. Nor was there evidence before it to support such a finding. Our review of determinations by the Board is limited to questions of law raised by its findings or its failure to make findings required by the statute. See Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 728\n, 49 S. Ct. 499; Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 599\n, 600 S., 51 S.Ct. 608. Compare Kendrick Coal & Dock Co. v.

The only substantial question is whether, on the facts disclosed by the record and others of which judicial notice may be taken, the actual use and special adaptability of petitioners' shorelands for the flowage and storage of water, that inter alia will be available for the generation of power, may be taken into consideration in ascertaining the just compensation to which petitioners are entitled.\n The superficial area of the Lake of the Woods is between fourteen and fifteen hundred square miles; it lies in Minnesota, Ontario, and Manitoba. Many streams flow into it. The Rainy river and Warroad river are the largest of those touching Minnesota. The former, coming from the east along the international boundary, drains a very large territory lying on both sides of the line. The latter, not so large, coming from the south, drains a considerable area within Minnesota and empties into the southwesterly part of the lake. The outlets of the lake are in Canada; they combine to make the Winnipeg, a great river, flowing northwesterly to Lake Winnipeg. In 1898 a Canadian corporation, by agreement with the \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n Crown, put in operation the Norman dam for the control of outflow down the Winnipeg. Since the construction of this dam, and in consequence of it and other dams in the outlets, shorelands, in disregard of the rights of owners, have been intermittently flooded for the impounding of water used in Canada for the generation of power and other purposes.\n In 1909 the United States and Great Britain made a treaty which (art. 8) created an international joint commission and conferred upon it jurisdiction in terms broad enough to include cases involving the elevation of the Lake of the Woods as the result of these dams. 36 Stat. 2451. In 1912 questions arising out of the raising of the lake were referred to the commission, and, after hearings and extensive studies, it made its final report in 1917. The United States and Great Britain then consummated the treaty of 1925 (44 Stat. 2110) which provides (article 8): 'A flowage easement shall be permitted up to elevation 1064 sea level datum upon all lands bordering on Lake of the Woods in the United States, and the United States assumes all liability to the owners of such lands for the costs of such easement.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n By an act to carry into effect the provisions of the last-mentioned treaty (Act of May 22, 1926, 44 Stat. 617, as amended April 18, 1928, 45 Stat. 431), Congress directed the Secretary of War to acquire by purchase or condemnation flowage easements up to the specified elevation upon all lands in Minnesota bordering upon the Lake of the Woods, the Warroad river, and the Rainy river, and that compensation should be made in accordance with the Constitution of Minnesota which declares (article 1,  13): 'Private property shall not be taken, destroyed or damaged for public use, without just compensation therefor first paid or secured.' Commissioners appointed to ascertain the damages sustained by the several owners by reason of such taking made their awards. The United States and these petitioners appealed.

The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 67 F.(2d) 24.\n At the trial petitioners sought to have just compensation ascertained on the theory that the flooding of their lands (for brevity called 'use for reservoir purposes'), the circumstances which make them specially adaptable for that use and the fact that prior to condemnation such adaptability had increased their market value should be considered by the jury in determining just compensation. And, in order to establish a basis on which to rest that submission, petitioners offered to prove the followign facts:\n There are valuable power sites at the outlets and in the Winnipeg river which cannot be fully developed without flooding the shorelands. The industries using these waters to produce power are well established and financially responsible. Demand for electricity there produced will increase. The raising of the lake level creates a storage reservoir, of which petitioners' lands form a part, that serves to increase potential capacity by about 200,000 continuous horse power which is worth more than $ 1,000,000 annually. Competition exists for the right to develop and control that capacity, the value of which is so great that one or another of the competitors would have acquired the flowage rights if the United States had not done so. It is entirely practicable for private enterprises to acquire flowage e sements. Publicity, long given to the great value of the lake as a storage reservoir, created a demand and affected the market value of shorelands needed for that purpose. And, in connection with the facts above stated, petitioners offered to prove the fair market values of their lands before and after the imposition of the flowage easement, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances affecting market prices. \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 252]\n\u00a0\n Respondent, having obtained leave to establish foundation for objection to petitioners' offers to prove, introduced evidence of the following facts:\n The main shore line of the Lake of the Woods, including the affected reaches of the Rainy river, exceeds 1,035 miles of which more than 110 are in Minnesota. There are in the lake a number of islands of a mile or over in length and approximately 10,000 smaller ones. The shore lines of the islands exceed 1,180 miles of which about 20 miles are it Minnesota. Below sea-level datum 1064, established by the treaty, there are about 850 parcels owned by more than 775 individuals. If mortgagees and other claimants are counted, the number to be dealt with is not less than 1,225 persons. Of these, only 496 live on or near the land, 186 live elsewhere in Minnesota, and 123 in other parts of the United States and Canada. The addresses of 401 are unknown. The United States owns a considerable part- about one-fifth-of the shore line in Minnesota. Small areas are held under homestead entries. The state of Minnesota owns a small piece subject to contracts of sale.\n And it was made to appear:\n None of the 35 miles of shorelands in Manitoba, of which about 14,427 acres lie below contour 1064, are privately owned. In 1915 they were reserved by the Dominion in anticipation of action by the International Joint Commission to regulate lake levels, and in 1930 they were transferred to the Province. In Ontario more than 700 persons own shorelands. In 1920 that Province, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, withdrew its lands below the established level-about 13, 043 acres-from private entry. On the Canadian side about 40 Indian reservations include 8,600 acres below the established level along about 250 miles of shore line. These lands may be disposed of only with the assent of a majority of the male members of the band of the full age \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 253]\n\u00a0\n of 21 years at a meeting summoned for that purpose according to the rules of the band, and subject to the approval of governmental authority.\n The Lake of the Woods is one of the water communications which by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty is required to be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both countries. Its usefulness for navigation is a matter of great concern. The United States is interested in navigation and in the protection of owners of shorelands on the American side rather than in the development of power in Canada. The levels controlled by dams in the outlets were regulated by Canadian authority until the creation of an international regime in pursuance of the Treaty of 1925. Regulation has not been exclusively for the Production of power but, so far as practicable, for the protection of all interests, including navigation, logging, domestic use of water, irrigation, and power.\n The trial court, being of opinion that under the circumstances neither the use nor the special adaptability of petitioners' lands for reservoir purposes could be considered in determining their market value, excluded the evidence offered by the petitioners. He instructed the jury first to determine as to each piece of land its fair market value on May 4, 1929-before the easement was imposed-taking into consideration the fact that prior to the taking the government had the right to maintain the level of the lake up to 1059 sealevel datum (that may be taken as the natural level); next to find the fair market value after the taking, and that the difference is the amount for which the government is liable. To guide the jury in the ascertainment f such values, the court charged: 'You will take into consideration all of the use for which the property was available on May 4, 1929, and May 5th, 1929, and determine what use it was most valuable for, and base your award thereon; but you will not \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 254]\n\u00a0\n make an award based on any claim for reservoir value. I have held that under the law the value of these lands could not be based upon the use of the lake and its shores for reservoir purposes. It is, as I understand it, conceded that the only other use for which these lands are suited, with the exception perhaps of Mr. Olson's tract, is for agricultural purposes, or purposes relating to agriculture, so that it is for those purposes that you are to value these lands.' The court suggested that petitioner Olson's lands might be used for fishing purposes and instructed the jury, if it so found, to 'add to the value which it might have for agricultural purposes, any added value which might accrue to it, because of its usefulness as a fishing station.' Under these instructions the government was not entitled to, and it has not claimed, lesser awards because of diminution of value caused by the unauthorized flooding of petitioners' lands. The owners were severally entitled to the compensation then due as if no such trespass had been committed.\n The rule prescribed by the Minnesota Constitution is not, at least so far as concerns these cases, to be distinguished from that expressed by the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment and implied in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The judicial ascertainment of the amount that shall be paid to the owner of private property taken for public use through exertion of the sovereign power of eminent domain is always a matter of importance for, as said in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 324\n, 13 S.Ct. 622, 625: 'In any society the fullness and sufficiency of the securities which surround the individual in the use and enjoyment of his property constitute one of the most certain tests of the character and value of the government.' The statement in that opinion (page 326 of 148 U. S., 13 S.Ct. 622, 626) that 'no private property shall be appropriated to public uses unless a full and exact equivalent for it be returned \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 255]\n\u00a0\n to the owner' aptly expresses the scope of the constitutional safeguard against the uncompensated taking or use of private property for public purposes. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 399\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047.\n That equivalent is the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 43 S.Ct. 354; Jacobs v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 13, 17\n, 54 S.Ct. 26; 2 Lewis, Eminent Domain (3d Ed.)  682, p. 1172. It may be more or less than the owner's investment. He may have acquired the property for less than its worth or he may have paid a speculative and exorbitant price. Its value may have changed substantially while held by him. The return yielded may have been greater or less than interest, taxes, and other carrying charges. The public may not by any means confiscate the benefits, or be required to bear the burden, of the owner's bargain. Vogelstein & Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 337, 340\n, 43 S.Ct. 564. He is entitled to be put in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken. He must be made whole but is not entitled to more. It is the property and not the cost of it that is safeguarded by state and Federal Constitutions. The Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 454\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n Just compensation includes all elements of value that inhere in the property, but it does not exceed market value fairly determined. The sum required to be paid the owner does not depend upon the uses to which he has devoted his land but is to be arrived at upon just consideration of all the uses for which it is suitable. The highest and most profitable use for which the property is adaptable and needed or likely to be needed in the reasonably near future is to be considered, not necessarily as the measure of value, but to the full extent that the prospect of demand for such use affects the market value while the property is privately held. Mississippi & R.R. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 408; Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 256]\n\u00a0\n Public Service Commission, \n291 \nU.S. 227\n, 54 S.Ct. 427; 2 Lewis, Eminent Domain (3d Ed.)  707, p. 1233; 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain ( 2d Ed.)  220, p. 671. The fact that the most profitable use of a parcel can be made only in combination with other lands does not necessarily exclude that use from consideration if the possibility of combination is reasonably sufficient to affect market value. Nor does the fact that it may be or is being acquired by eminent domain negative consideration of availability for use in the public service. New York v. Sage, \n239 \nU.S. 57, 61\n, 36 S.Ct. 25. It is common knowledge that public service corporations and others having that power frequently are actual or potential competitors not only for tracts held in single ownership but also for rights of way, locations, sites, and other areas requiring the union of numerous parcels held by different owners. And, to the extent that probable demand by prospective purchasers or condemnors affects market value, it is to be taken into account. Boom Co. v. Patterson, ubi supra. But the value to be ascertained does not include, and the owner is not entitled to compensation for, any element resulting subsequently to or because of the taking. Considerations that may not reasonably be held to affect market value are excluded. Value to the taker of a piece of land combined with other parcels for public use is not the measure of or a guide to the compensation to which the owner is entitled. New York v. Sage, ubi supra; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 76\n, 80 S., 33 S. Ct. 667; Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 305\n, 13 S.Ct. 361; Kerr v. South Park Commissioners, \n117 \nU.S. 379, 386\n, 6 S.Ct. 801; Union Electric Light & Power Co. v. Snyder Estate Co. (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 297, 304. The use of shorelands for reservoir purposes prior to the taking shows merely the physical possibility of so controlling the level of the lake. But physical adaptability alone cannot be deemed to affect market value. There must be a reasonable possibility that the owner could \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 257]\n\u00a0\n use his tract together with the other shorelands for reservoir purposes or that another could acquire all lands or easements necessary for that use. The trespass committed by means of the dams added nothing to the value of the shorelands.\n Flowage easements upon these lands were not currently bought or sold to such an extent as to establish prevailing prices, at or as of the time of the expropriation. As that measure (United States v. New River Colliteries, \n262 \nU.S. 341, 344\n, 43 S.Ct. 565) is lacking, the market value must be estimated. In respect of each item of property that value may be deemed to be the sum which, considering all the circumstances, could have been obtained for it; that is, the amount that in all probability would have been arrived at by fair negotiations between an owner willing to sell and a purchaser desiring to buy. In making that estimate there should be taken into account all considerations that fairly might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial weight in such bargaining. Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 124\n, 44 S.Ct. 471. The determination is to be made in the light of all facts affecting the market value that are shown by the evidence taken in connection with those of such general notoriety as not to require proof. Elements affecting value that depend upon events or combinations of occurrences which, while within the realm of possibility, are not fairly shown to be reasonably probable should be excluded from consideration for that would be to allow mere speculation and conjecture to become a guide for the ascertainment of value-a thing to be condemned in business transactions as well as in judicial ascertainment of truth. Cf., The Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, page 452 of 230 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 729; Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 152\n, 51 S.Ct. 65; Los Angeles Gas Co. v. R.R. Comm'n, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 319\n, 53 S.Ct. 637.\n Petitioners rely on Mississippi & R.R. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n. At the time of that condemnation, logs belonging to many \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 258]\n\u00a0\n owners were floated down the Mississippi to sawmills at and below the Falls of St. Anthony. Patterson owned three islands, about 34 acres, in the river a few miles above the falls, lying near to each other and approximately parallel to the west bank. The company, merely by closing the spaces between the islands and connecting the downstream end to the bank so as to prevent the passage of floating logs, created a boom about a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide. The owner objected to that use of his property and the company condemned. There was evidence of value other than for boom purposes and also of value for all purposes. The jury specially found that aside from boom purposes the value of the land was $ 300 and that, in view of the adaptability for boom purposes, it had an additional value of $9,058.33. There was a general verdict for the sum of these amounts. The court ordered the verdict set aside unless the owner consent to reduce it to $5,500. He did consent and judgment was entered for that amount.\n Upon appeal this court affirmed and, speaking through Mr. Justice Field, said (page 407-409 of 98 U.S.): 'In determining the value of land appropriated for public purposes, the same considerations are to be regarded as in a sale of property between private parties. The inquiry in such cases must be what is the property worth in the market, viewed not merely with reference to the uses to which it is at the time applied, but with reference to the uses to which it is plainly adapted. ... The position of the three islands ... fitting them to form, in connection with the west bank ... a boom of immense dimensions ... added largely to the value of the lands. ... Their adaptability for boom purposes was a circumstance, therefore, which the owner had a right to insist upon as an element in estimating the value of his lands. We do not understand that all persons, except the plaintiff in error, \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 259]\n\u00a0\n were precluded from availing themselves of these lands for the construction of a boom, either on their own account or for general use . ... The Mississippi is a navigable river above the Falls of St. Anthony, and the State could not confer an exclusive use of its waters, or exclusive control and management of logs floating on it, against the consent of their owners.'\n The principle governing that case has been frequently applied here3 and in the lower federal courts. \n4\n The decision is authoritative in state courts in all condemnation cases in which the owner invokes protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n5\n But clearly it does not support petitioners' contention here. \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 260]\n\u00a0\n The circumstances there disclosed required submission to the jury of the question whether the use and special adaptation of the islands for boom purposes affected market value at the time of the taking. They were amply sufficient to warrant a finding that the islands were well suited and presently needed for that purpose and that demand for them, actual or prospective, to form a part of a boom greatly enhanced their market value. The boom company could not exclude others from handling logs floated in the river. The owner and others had the right to use the island lands to construct a boom for their own p rposes or for general use.\n The situation in respect of lands bordering the Lake of the Woods is essentially different. The fact that the raising of the lake would take or damage shorelands could not affect their market value. There could be no rational basis for any demand that would affect value to the owner for reservoir purposes unless, as a legal and practical possibility, he or some other person or persons-other than the expropriating authority-could have acquired the right to flow the lands necessary for the lawful raising of the lake. The lands upon which the flowage easement is condemned are located in two countries. Neither could authorize expropriation in the other. Petitioners did not cite or offer evidence of any instance of acquisitions, without reliance upon the power of eminent domain, that are at all comparable with those under consideration. When regard is had to the number of parcels, private owners, Indian tribes, and sovereign proprietors to be dealt with, it is clear that there is no foundation for opinion evidence to the effect that it was practicable for private parties to acquire the flowage easements in question.\n The policy of joint governmental control of the lake levels was indicated years before the taking. The lands in Manitoba and Ontario that long prior to the condemna- \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 261]\n\u00a0\n tion were reserved in anticipation of measures to be taken for the raising of the lake level were essential to the enterprise. Additional reservoir capacity could not lawfully be created without them and they could not be purchased or condemned. There was no justifiable basis for competition for the purchase of flowage rights from private owners. Rivalry between power companies or others to secure opportunity to develop capacity resulting incidentally from lake levels established in the settlement of, or to prevent, controversy between the parties to the treaty or between either of them and nationals of the other is too remote to warrant a finding that market value of petitioners' lands was thereby enhanced. It had no direct, and could have no substantial or legitimate, influence upon such value.\n As just compensation includes no increment resulting from the taking, petitioners were not entitled to elements of value arising from the prospect that the government would acquire the flowage easements. Under the circumstances, intention to acquire was the equivalent of the formal designation of the property to be taken. Prices actually paid, and estimates or opinions based, upon the assumption that value to owners includes any such elements are not entitled to weight and should not be taken into account. On the facts shown, it conclusively appears that there was no element of value belonging to petitioners that legitimately could be attributed to use and adaptability of their lands for reservoir purposes. The evidence covered by petitioners' offers was inadmissible. The court rightly excluded reservoir uses from consideration.\n In their brief, petitioners complain that the trial court instructed the jury 'to consider only the value of the lands for agriculture, although it was admitted that the lands were not suitable for agriculture and had never been used for that purpose.' The parts of the charge \n\n[292 U.S. 246, 262]\n\u00a0\n above quoted show that the statement is without foundation as to Olson's land and inaccurate as to all. The record definitely shows that petitioners did not claim that, except for reservoir purposes, their lands are worth more than their value for agriculture. Moreover, the point is not made in the specification of errors or in the reasons given in the petition for this writ. The contention is not properly before us. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 50 S.Ct. 231.\n Petitioners maintain that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the Treaty of 1909 did not give redress, and that they had no remedy, for the wrongful flooding of their lands. The statements in the opinion assailed by specifications of error in petitioners' brief were made arguendo and do not constitute decision of any point on which petitioners there sought reversal. The questions considered below concerned compensation for flowage easements. The condemnation was under section 1 of the Act of May 22, 1926, as amended, supra. The property taken was the right to use in the future. The commissioners were not authorized to make any award on account of damages caused by unlawful flooding of shorelands prior to the taking. That is clear from section 1, as amended, and especially so when its provisions are read in connection with the general condemnation Act of August 1, 1888, 25 Stat. 357 (40 USCA  257, 258), and the rule of just compensation prescribed by the Constitution of Minnesota, both of which are expressly adopted by that section. Moreover, section 3, as amended, directs the Secretary of War to deal with all claims for damages caused, prior to the acquisition of flowage easements under this act, to the inhabitants of the United States by fluctuation of the water levels of the Lake of the Woods due to artificial obstructions in the outlets. No question of liability for, or the amount of, such damages was before the lower courts.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article IX provides: 'The United States and the Dominion of Canada shall each on its own side of the boundary assume responsibility for any damage or injury which may have heretofore resulted to it or to its inhabitants from the fluctuations of the level of Lake of the Woods or of the outflow therefrom.\n'Each shall likewise assume responsibility for any damage or injury which may hereafter result to it or to its inhabitants from the regulation of the level of Lake of the Woods in the manner provided for in the present Convention.'\n\n Article X contains the following: 'In consideration, however, of the unertakings of the United States as set forth in Article VIII, the Government of Canada shall pay to the Government of the United States the sum of two hundred and eventy-five thousand dollars ($275,000) in currncy of the United States. Should this sum prove insufficient to cover the cost of such undertakings one-half of the excess of such cost over the said sum shall, if the expenditure be incurred within five years of the coming into force of the present Convention, be paid by the Government of Canada.' Treaty of February 24, 1925, 44 Stat. 2108. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner Olson, as stated in the condemnation petition, owns, as part of a homestead, 55.21 acres below contour 1064. He claimed $300 per acre, making in all $16,563. The commissioners awarded $1,296.50, including $40 for damage to dock and wharf. The jury's verdict was $490.\n Petitioner Karlson, as stated in the condemnation petition, owns 163. 5 acres below contour 1064. It lies in two parcels, one of which, 120 acres, he bought in 1921 for $175, or about $1.45 per acre. He claimed $ 275 per acre, or a total of about $44,000. The commissioners made but one award, $3,660. The jury's verdict was $880.\n Petitioner Brewster, as stated in the condemnation petition, owns as part of his homestead 98.55 acres (exhibits indicate this should be about 156 acres) below contour 1064. Though contiguous, it is listed as three parcels. He claimed $300 per acre, making in all $46,965. The commissioners awarded $640.70 for one parcel of 32.15 acres and $3,195.80 for the remainder, about 124 acres, making in all $3,836.50. The jury's verdict for all three was $900. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Chicago, Burlington, etc., R'd v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 250\n, 17 S. Ct. 581; Boston Chamber of Commerce v.

Grover, of Kansas City, Mo., and Harold D. Le Mar, of Omaha, Neb., for appellants.\n Mr. Paul F. Good, of Lincoln, Neb., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are makers of bread for sale in Nebraska. The appellees, the Governor and deputy secretary of agriculture, are authorized to enforce an act to establish a standard loaf. Laws 1931, c. 162, p. 430. Appellants sued in the district court of Lancaster county to have the \n\n[290 U.S. 570, 572]\n\u00a0\n measure decreed invalid and its enforcement enjoined upon the ground of repugnancy to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court upheld the law and dismissed the petition. The Supreme Court affirmed. 124 Neb. 464, 247 N.W. 39.\n The challenged enactment declares that every loaf made for sale in Nebraska shall be one-half pound, one pound, one and one-half pounds or exact multiples of one pound and provides that the act shall not apply to fancy breads; directs the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe reasonable tolerances or variations in excess of, but not under, the specified weights and the time for which said weights shall be maintained, and imposes fines for violations.\n Rules and regulations promulgated by the deputy secretary of agriculture require the rate of tolerance not to exceed three ounces to the pound, the bread to be so made that under normal conditions it will maintain the minimum weight for not less than twelve hours after cooling, the weights to be determined by taking the average of not less than five loaves, if available. They do not purport to make bakers responsible for maintenance of minimum weights after delivery to a retail dealer or consumer or to a transportation agency for delivery. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n So far as need be specifically referred to, appellants' contentions are that: (1) A maximum tolerance is arbitrary and discriminatory. (2) The statute vests arbitrary power in the secretary of agriculture. (3) It is impossible \n\n[290 U.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n to comply with the prescribed tolerances, and the provisions as to time, place, possession, and particular loaves subject bakers to fines irrespective of negligence.\n The fixing of a maximum weight for each size or class of loaves is not unreasonable. In Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 \nU.S. 504\n, 44 S.Ct. 412, 32 A.L.R. 661, we were called on to consider the constitutionality of a similar measure. Nebraska Laws 1921, c. 2, p. 56. We there adverted to the undoubted power of the state to protect purchasers of bread from imposition by the sale of short-weight loaves ( Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 \nU.S. 578, 588\n, 33 S.Ct. 182) and showed that the purpose of prescribing minimum weights is to prevent sellers from palming off loaves of smaller size as those of a larger size. The tolerances prescribed by that statute were at the rate of two ounces to the pound of the minimum weight required to be maintained for 24 hours after baking. Here the rate of tolerance is three ounces to the pound, and minima are required to be maintained only 12 hours after cooling. In that case the evidence demonstrated that, owing to evaporation from bread under conditions of temperature and humidity that often prevail in Nebraska, it was impossible to make good bread in the regular way without exceeding the tolerances then prescribed. And it was held that a relatively much wider spread between the required minimum and the permitted maximum weight applicable to each size or class of loaves would be equally effective to prevent deception and that therefore the maxima complained of were unnecessary and arbitrary.\n The diminution in weight of dough while being baked or of bread after baking cannot be definitely determined in advance. It may be usefully approximated. It only one size or class of loaves were being made, the fixing of minimum weight might be effective to prevent short-weight sales. But that is not the situation in Nebraska. The classes of loaves being made for sale and distributed \n\n[290 U.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n there include those being sold as one-half pound, a pound, a pound and a quarter, a pound and a half. The mere prescribing of a minimum weight for each class reasonably may be deemed not effective for there might be made such intermediate sizes as would permit deception and fraud. The danger is illustrated by the twenty ounce loaf being made by appellants. The statute prohibits it, undoubtedly for the reason that its weight is only four ounces more than the pound loaf and four ounces less than the pound and a half loaf. Unquestionably there are adequate grounds for prohibiting a loaf of that size. The fixing of both maximum and minimum weights for each class fairly may be deemed appropriate and necessary. If not too low, there is no support for the claim that the maximum is arbitrary or discriminatory.\n There is no merit in the claim that the delegation of authority to the secretary violates the due process or equal protection clause. The act fixes the mimimum weight of loaves of each size or class. The lessening of weight during and immediately following baking depends on changing conditions and varies considerably. Maxima that readily may be complied with in one period may be found too low at another time. The Nebraska Legislature is not constantly in session and convenes regularly only once in two years. But the secretary may act at any time as need arises. Presumably the delegation was made in the interest of justice to the bakers as well as for the convenient enforcement of the statute and regulations. Chicago & N.W.R. Co. v. Dey (C.C.) 35 F. 866, 875, 1 L.R.A. 744. Nor does the failure of the act to define 'fancy breads' and the implied direction that the secretary shall ascertain what is covered by the phrase operate to vest arbitrary power in him. It is not shown that in the trade the phrase does not have an established meaning. On the contrary, the evidence tends to show that it has. The trial court found that it is 'sufficiently definite' and that it does not cover \n\n[290 U.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n 'common white bread.' It does not appear that any requirement here involved applies to fancy bread made by appellants or other bakeries. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 680\n, 18 S.Ct. 229; Williams v. Mississippi, \n170 \nU.S. 213, 225\n, 18 S.Ct. 583; Yazoo & Miss. V.R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 \nU.S. 217, 219\n, 220 S., 33 S.Ct. 40; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 544-546, 34 S.Ct. 359. The delegation of authority appears to be well within the principles established by our decisions. Louisville & Nash. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 305\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; Red 'C' Oil Mfg. Co. v. Board of Agriculture of North Carolina, \n222 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 32 S.Ct. 152. And see St. Louis Iron Mountain & S.R. Co. v.

Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S.Ct. 349.\n It is not shown that the prescribed tolerances are unreasonable or that the statute and regulations operate to prescribe punishment in the absence of fault. The lower court found, and the evidence warrants the finding, that appellants and other bakers readily may comply with the prescribed weights and tolerances. It is therefore to be presumed that in the absence of fault or negligence, violations will not occur. The facts plainly distinguish this case from Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan.\n Moreover, the state Supreme Court held that a secondary purpose of the act is to prevent unfair competition by dishonest bakers resulting in injury to the consuming public. As there is no showing that the measure is not reasonably calculated effectively to serve for that purpose, the judgment upholding the act must be affirmed. And, in so far as it upholds the rules and regulations, it must be affirmed upon another ground. The lower court, following our decision in Red 'C' Oil Mfg. Co. v. Board of Agriculture of North Carolina, supra, held that where one complains that regulations promulgated under legislative authority by a state board are unreasonable and oppressive, he should seek relief by applying to that board to modify them. There is no \n\n[290 U.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n suggestion that, if appellants had sought modification of the tolerances complained of, their application would not have been fairly or that they would have been denied relief to which they were entitled.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] June 24, 1931, the deputy secretary of agriculture prescribed a maximum tolerance of one ounce on half-pound loaves, two ounces on pound loaves, and 10 per cent. on larger loaves; the tolerance to apply for a period of twelve hours after baking and the weights to be determined by taking the average of not less than five loaves, if available. After the commencement of this suit that regulation was superseded by the one here in question. \n\n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC TEL. & TEL. CO. v. CITY OF SEATTLE, WASH.(1934)\nNo. 364\nArgued: January 15, 1934Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.\n Messrs. Otto R. Rupp and Alfred J. Schweppe, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Messrs. Walter L. Baumgartner and A. C. Van Soelen, both of Seattle Wash., for appellees. \n\n[291 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Washington, 172 Wash. 649, 21 P.(2d) 721, sustaining a state license or excise tax assailed by appellant upon numerous state and federal grounds. The only one urged here is that the statutory measure of the tax as applied to appellant is so vague and indefinite as to infringe the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n An ordinance of the Seattle city council, of May 23, 1932, imposes annual license taxes on the privilege of carrying on various classes of business. One such is the telephone business upon which the tax is 4 per cent. of the 'gross income' of the business 'in the city' during the preceding fiscal year. The definition of gross income by section 2 is printed in the margin. \n1\n By section 10, the taxpayer is required annually to make application to the city comptroller for an 'occupation license' for the ensuing year 'upon blanks or forms to be prepared by him requiring such information as may be necessary to enable him to arrive at the lawful amount of the fee or tax.' By section 20 the comptroller is required to make rules and regulations having the force of law for carrying the ordinance into effect. Payment of the full tax or a monthly or quarterly installment of it is required on filing the return. \n\n[291 U.S. 300, 302]\n\u00a0\n The cause was heard and decided on demurrer to appellant's bill of complaint asking an injunction to restrain the collection of the tax. The bill was filed shortly after the enactment of the ordinance. It alleges that the appellant, a California corporation, derives its receipts and earnings from the conduct of a telephone business, both interstate and intrastate, carried on within and without the city of Seattle, by the use of its telephone exchanges, wires, poles, conduits, and other property located in Seattle, and also outside of Seattle, both within and without the state. It charges that the ordinance is vague and indefinite, in that it fixes no method of computation whereby appellant, with reasonable certainty, can segregate its interstate business or so much of its intrastate business as is conducted within the city of Seattle, and that the definition of gross income set out in section 2 is so vague and uncertain as to make it impossible for appellant to compute with reasonable certainty the amount of the tax.\n The bill of complaint does not show whether appellant had applied for its occupation license or had received from the comptroller the prescribed form of return specifying the information which would be required by him for the computation of the tax or whether the comptroller had prepared such a form at the time when the bill was filed. It fails to show whether the comptroller had promulgated rules or regulations for carrying the ordinance into effect or whether appellant had requested of him any ruling, interpreting the ordinance, which would aid in preparing the return required for the computation of the tax. On the argument before us appellant admitted that the present suit was brought without waiting for the preparation of forms and regulations, and that it had made no effort to secure an administrative interpretation of the ordinance. \n\n[291 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n The state court (172 Wash. 649, 21 P.(2d) 721, 724), in disposing of the attack upon the uncertainty of the statute, contented itself with saying that 'gross income' is a proper basis for determining the amount of a tax; that the objections raised by the appellant are 'more fancied than real'; and that 'in practical application, under present-day systems of accounting, appellant will have no serious difficulty in ascertaining the amount of tax it is required to pay.'\n Despite this conclusion of the state court that the taxing act can be given a practical construction we are asked to say that the statute is unconstitutional because of its vagueness. It may be conceded that the definition by the ordinance of taxable 'gross income' is not free from ambiguities or difficulties of construction. But in the present posture of the case we are called upon neither to resolve them nor to say whether they can be resolved.\n The ordinance allows wide latitude for administrative construction, both by the provision which requires the comptroller to make interpretative rules and regulations, and that which commands him to prepare the form for the return on the basis of which the tax is to be computed. Until the form is prepared, the most that can be required of taxpayer is that they apply for the license and for the form on which to make their tax returns. Without the return there can be no tax, and no penalty can be imposed for its nonpayment. Thus the ordinance does not purport finally to define the duty of taxpayers. Instead it directs that an administrative officer shall mark the scope of the obligation, and only then does the state compel obedience to its mandate.\n In this we see no invasion of constitutional immunity. Compare In re Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526\n, 17 S.Ct. 444; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Ry. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281\n, 28 S.Ct. 616; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S. Ct. 436. The Fourteenth Amendment does not require that legal duties \n\n[291 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n shall be defined by any particular agency of the state government. Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 23 S.Ct. 28; Soliah v. Heskin, \n222 \nU.S. 522, 524\n, 32 S.Ct. 103; Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 443\n, 43 S.Ct. 445; O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 545\n, 53 S.Ct. 740; cf. Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. State of Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n, 32 S.Ct. 224. The demands of due process are satisfied if reasonably clear definition is afforded in time to give the taxpayer an opportunity to comply. Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S. Ct. 126. Before the duties of the administrative officer are performed we cannot say that the ordinance falls short of that requirement. At this stage appellant can show no more than apprehension that the definition which the administrative officer will lay down may be deficient. The Constitution cannot allay that fear. Compare Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., \n289 \nU.S. 249, 253\n, 53 S.Ct. 591\n\n\n The decision of the state court must be affirmed, not because the appellant has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, which would concern us only if the suit had been brought in a federal court of equity, but because without administrative action, which has not occurred, there can be no infringement of the immunity invoked.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 2.

Swenson, of Atwater, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether war risk insurance money paid to the estate of an insured soldier is exempt from the claims of his creditors. Title 38, U.S. Code (38 USCA), contains the applicable statutes. They are: Section 454: 'The ... insurance ... shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made;' section 511: 'In order to give to every commissioned officer and enlisted man ... protection for themselves and their dependents, the United States ... shall grant ... life insurance ... payable only to a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, brother- in-law or sister-in-law, or to any or all of them;' section 514: '... If the designated beneficiary ... survives the insured and dies prior to receiving all of the two hundred and forty installments or all such as are payable and applicable, there shall be paid to the \n\n[291 U.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n estate of the insured the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable.'\n Jacob E. Hallbom, the insured soldier, obtained a $10,000 policy, and designated as beneficiary his father, Peter J. Hallbom. He died intestate October 20, 1925, leaving no spouse or child. He was survived by his father and others within the permitted class of beneficiaries. Thereupon, until the death of the father, February 22, 1928, the Bureau paid him the monthly installments according to the terms of the policy. He was survived by his wife, a son, a widow and child of a deceased son (who died after the death of the insured), daughters, and children of a deceased daughter. They were mother, brother, sisters, sister-in-law, nephews, and nieces of the insured.\n The Bureau paid Pagel, administrator of the estate of the insured, $9, 116, being the value of the installments payable after the death of the designated beneficiary. The other assets in his hands were not sufficient to pay expenses of administration or the claims of creditors which amounted to about $3,800. The probate court directed payment of such claims. The mother, Selma Hallbom, claiming under the War Risk Insurance Act to be entitled to the entire sum as beneficiary, appealed to the district court which reversed the order of the probate court. The state Supreme Court affirmed. Hallbom's Estate, 179 Minn. 402, 229 N.W. 344. It held the money not subject to claims of creditors, that upon the death of the designated beneficiary the value of the unpaid installments became payable to the estate of the insured for distribution to such persons then living and within the permitted class of beneficiaries, section 511, as would be entitled to the personal property of the insured under Minnesota intestacy laws, and that such persons were entitled as beneficiaries and not as heirs. \n\n[291 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n Pending the application of the administrator for a writ of certiorari, the mother died and, after the granting of the writ, Pagel v. Hallbom, \n282 \nU.S. 819\n, 51 S.Ct. 25, MacLean, who had been appointed special administrator of her estate, was here substituted as respondent. Her death having given rise to questions involving the rights of persons who were not parties, we vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Pagel v. MacLean, \n283 \nU.S. 266\n, 51 S.Ct. 416. The state Supreme Court remanded to the district court, with the suggestion that the brothers and sisters of the insured be made parties. Pagel v. MacLean, 183 Minn. 429, 237 N.W. 21.\n The surviving brother and sisters appeared and claimed the insurance money as beneficiaries. The administrator of the deceased brother intervened as a creditor and prayed that his claim be paid out of the insurance money. The children of the deceased son and daughter became parties, and prayed that, after payment of claims against the estate of the insured, the residue be distributed to the father and mother. The court held that, upon the death of the designated beneficiary, the insurance money became an asset of the estate of the insured and subject to the claims of creditors. It directed that the balance be distributed to the heirs in accordance with state law, and that heirship be determined as of the date of the death of the insured. The surviving brother and sisters and the special administrator of the mother appealed to the Supreme Court. That court, in view of Singleton v. Cheek, \n284 \nU.S. 493\n, 52 S.Ct. 257, 81 A.L.R. 923, held its former decision erroneous and affirmed the judgment of the district court. In re Hallbom's Estate, 249 N.W. 417. We granted a writ of certiorari. Pagel v. Pagel, \n290 \nU.S. 620\n, 54 S.Ct. 131, 78 L.Ed. --.* \n\n[291 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n In Singleton v. Cheek, supra, \n284 \nU.S. 496\n, 52 S.Ct. 257, 81 A.L.R. 923, we held that, when the insured and designated beneficiary die successively intestate, the commuted amount of the installments not accrued when the beneficiary dies is to be paid to the estate of the insured for distribution to his heirs and that the heirs are to be determined as of the time of his death in accordance with the laws of the state where he resided and are not limited to the class of beneficiaries designated by the act. The question whether insurance money paid to the estate is subject to claims of creditors was not involved in that case. The purpose of the exemption, section 454, is to safeguard to the insured soldier and the beneficiary payments made under the policy to them or for their benefit. Spicer v. Smith, \n288 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 53 S.Ct. 415, 84 A.L.R. 1525. Upon the death of the insured, the father whom he had designated as beneficiary was by the Bureau awarded monthly payments to continue until death. The language of the statute limits the exemption to 'any person to whom an award is made.' It is clear that the statute does not extend the exemption beyond the insured and beneficiary. And, as said by the state Supreme Court after referring to our decision in Singleton v. Cheek, 'it cannot be held now that exemption of the fund survives both insured and beneficiary for benefit of the heirs of the former.' 249 N.W. 417, 419.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] There is a conflict between decisions announced since our decision in Singleton v.

Boyle, of Duluth, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pigeon River Improvement, Slide & Boom Company, a Minnesota corporation, brought this action against Charles W. Cox, Limited, a Canadian corporation, to recover tolls for the use of improvements which the Minnesota corporation had made in the Pigeon river. These improvements embraced sluiceways, booms, and dams, which were used by the defendant in driving, sluicing, and floating timber products. The case was removed to the Federal court, a demurrer to the amended complaint was sustained without leave further to amend, and the judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 63 F.(2d) 567. The case comes here on appeal.\n Pigeon river is a boundary stream between the State of Minnesota and the Province of Ontario, Dominion of Canada, at the northeast corner of Minnesota. The river is a small stream which has its source in lakes on the international boundary and flows in a southeasterly direction along that boundary for about forty miles, discharging at Pigeon Bay into Lake Superior. The boundary is approximately midstream. The defense against the charge of tolls is based upon article 2 of the Treaty of August 9, \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n 1842-the Webster-Ashburton Treaty-which, after defining the international boundary, provides as follows:1\n'It being understood that all the water communications and all the usual portages along the line from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand portage, from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon river, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both countries.'\n\n When this treaty was concluded, the lower portion of the Pigeon river was impassable because of falls and rapids. On July 25, 1842, Mr. Ferguson, who had been surveyor to the commissioners under the seventh article of the Treaty of Ghent,2 thus described this part of the river in response to an inquiry by Mr. Webster:3 'At the mouth of the Pigeon River there is probably about three hundred yards in length of alluvial formation; but the river above that, as far as to near Fort Charlotte, runs between steep cut rocks of basaltic or primitive formation, and is a succession of falls and rapids for nearly its whole length-the last cataract, which is within about a mile of its mouth, being almost one hundred feet in height.' Below Fort Charlotte on the Pigeon river, communication with Lake Superior was by means of a trail about nine miles long running south of the river, and some distance from it, which was known as the Grand portage and was so described in the treaty. \n4\n In Mr. Webster's com- \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n munication to Lord Ashburton of July 27, 1842, summarizing the understanding which had been reached as to the boundary and setting forth the proposed stipulation as to water communications and portages which was incorporated in the treaty as above quoted, he said: 'The broken and difficult nature of the water communication from Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods renders numerous portages necessary; and it is right that these water communications and these portages should make a common highway where necessary for the use of the subjects and citizens of both Governments.' \n5\n At the time of the conclusion of the treaty, this was the highway of commerce, used principally by fur traders, between the Great Lakes and the country to the north and northwest. \n6\n But the Pigeon river itself prior to the improvements here in question, as alleged in the complaint and admitted by the demurrer, 'was at all times incapable of use for the driving, handling and floating of logs, pulp-wood and timber.' \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 150]\n\u00a0\n Pigeon River Improvement, Slide & Boom Company, which for convenience we may call the Pigeon River Company, was incorporated in 1898 under the general laws of Minnesota. \n7\n These laws purported to empower the Pigeon River Company to improve streams by erecting sluiceways, booms, dams, and other works; to acquire structures already erected together with necessary rights of way, shore rights, land and lands under water; to operate its works so as to render the driving of logs practicable; and to collect 'reasonable and uniform tolls upon all logs, lumber and timber driven, sluiced or floated' on the streams so improved. The company was also authorized, in the case of a boundary stream, to purchase stock in a corporation created in an adjoining state or country for similar purposes upon the same stream, or to unite with such a corporation, upon conditions stated. Acting under this authority, the Pigeon River Company took possession of the portion of Pigeon river within the State of Minnesota and improved it by erecting sluiceways, booms, and dams on the Minnesota side of the international boundary.\n At the same time, the complaint alleges, the Arrow River & Tributaries, Boom & Slide Company, was organized under the laws of the Dominion of Canada and Province of Ontario with powers and purposes similar to those of the Pigeon River Company, but limited to the portion of the Pigeon river and its tributaries within the Dominion of Canada. This Canadian corporation, under an agreement with the Pigeon River Company, similarly improved the portion of the Pigeon river on the Dominion side of the boundary so that the improvements made by each company 'constituted complements the one of the other, and the whole of said improvements \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 151]\n\u00a0\n rendered the driving of logs thereon reasonably practicable and certain.' These improvements. which have since been maintained, were all located below Fort Charlotte on the Pigeon river, with the sole exception of a reservoir dam at the south end of South Fowl Lake.\n Adjacent to the lower part of the Pigeon river on the Minnesota side lies the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, extending for a considerable distance along the stream. \n8\n By the Act of Congress of March 3, 1901,9 the Pigeon River Company was authorized, under such regulations and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior might prescribe, to 'improve the Pigeon River at what is known as the cascades of said river, for the purpose of making said river at said point navigable for floating logs.' For that purpose the company was empowered to enter upon unallotted lands and, with the consent of the allottees, upon allotted lands, adjacent to the cascades, of the Grand Portgage Indian Reservation and to construct such dams, bulkheads and other works as should be necessary. It was further provided that the river 'after being so improved shall be open at all times to the free passage of all timber cut from said Grand Portage Indian Reservation, and to the passage of all other timber for a reasonable charge therefor.' \n10\n It does not appear that the Secretary of the Interior prescribed any regulations or conditions in relation to the improvements made by the Pigeon River Company.\n Recovery is now, sought for the use by the defendant, a Canadian corporation, of these improvements in the years 1928, 1929, and 1930, in driving, sluicing, and floating upon the Pigeon river its pulp wood and railway ties. \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 152]\n\u00a0\n This timber, the defendant says in its argument, was cut from Canadian lands and put into the Arrow river, a tributary in Canada of the Pigeon river, and was floated into the Pigeon river on its way to Lake Superior and Canadian mills. The tolls charged the defendant are alleged in the complaint, and thus admitted, to be the 'reasonable and uniform tolls' which the Pigeon River Company had established. No question is raised as to reasonableness or discrimination, the only question being whether in the light of the provision of the treaty any tolls whatever could be charged. The contentions of the defendant are that the Pigeon river is a boundary stream and, as one of the 'water communications' described in the treaty, must be kept 'free and open' to the use of the citizens and subjects of both countries; that the imposition of tolls is inconsistent with this stipulated immunity and is not justified by the legislation which the Pigeon River Company invokes.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals in the instant case followed its earlier decision in Clark v. Pigeon River Improvement, Slide & Boom Company, 52 F.( 2d) 550, 556, where the court reached the conclusion that the charge of tolls was forbidden by the treaty. The court disagreed with the view advanced by the Pigeon River Company that the words of the treaty 'as now actually used' limited the provision as to 'free and open' use, expressing the opinion that these qualifying words referred only to the Grand Portage. Id., 52 F.(2d) 550, 555, 556. In support of its conclusion, the Circuit Court of Appeals cited the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in the case of Arrow River & Tributaries, Slide & Boom Company, Ltd., 66 Ont. L.R. 577; where the court held that the Canadian company did not have 'the right to build upon the bed of the Pigeon River anything which may interfere with the enjoyment of free and open use of it by the citizens of the United States.' After the Circuit Court of Ap- \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 153]\n\u00a0\n peals had decided the Clark Case, the judgment in the case of the Arrow River Company was reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada. 1932 Canadian Supreme Court Reports, 495. The latter decision was brought to the attention of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the instant case, but the court adhered to its former opinion. 63 F.(2d) 567, 568, 569.\n The litigation in Canada presented the question whether the statutes of the Province of Ontario authorized the Canadian company to construct and maintain works upon the Pigeon river on the Ontario side of the international boundary and to charge tolls upon timber passing through those works. It appeared that the Arrow River & Tributaries, Slide & Boom Company, Limited, had been incorporated in 1922 under the Ontario Companies Act,11 for the purpose of acquiring or constructing dams, booms and other works to facilitate the transmission of timber down the Arrow river, and its tributaries, and that part of the Pigeon river which is within the Province of Ontario; and that the company had acquired title to, and had extended, works which had been erected by a former corporation formed in 1899 with the same shareholders and directors and with similar objects. The company applied to the District Judge for approval of tolls to be charged for the use of these works, and the respondent in that case, the Pigeon River Timber Company, Limited, sought an injunction restraining the District Judge from acting upon the application. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty was invoked and it was contended that the provision of the Ontario statute, so far as it purported to authorize the company to charge tolls for the use of its improvements on that river, was 'ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature.' The District Judge \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 154]\n\u00a0\n refused the injunction for the reason that 'treaties to which Great Britain is a party are not as such binding on the individual subject in the absence of legislation.' On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario agreed with that principle but had a different opinion as to the effect of the legislation of Ontario. That court decided that the statute in question applied to lakes and rivers that were wholly within the Province and did not apply to the Pigeon river which was a boundary stream. The reason given for this construction was that the court should not impute to the Legislature an intent to authorize a violation of the terms of the treaty, if the statutory provision was capable of another construction. The Supreme Court of Canada reversed this decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, holding that the statute did authorize the construction of the works on the Pigeon river and also the charge of tolls for the use of the improvements, and, as thus construed, was within the competency of the provincial Legislature.\n In the Supreme Court of Canada three opinions were delivered. Three of the five judges held that the legislation was not in conflict with the terms of the treaty. Of this majority, Judges Rinfret and Smith, in an opinion delivered by the latter, took the view that the right preserved by the provision of the treaty 'was the right to continue to use the water communication and portages then in use.' They expressly disagreed with the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Clark Case, supra, that the words 'as now actually used' applied only to Grand Portage. These judges could not see any reason 'for preserving a right to use Grand Portage that would not apply to other portages,' and they thought that the language of the provision appeared 'to apply to all, and to the water communications, and should be so construed.' They added: 'What was being dealt with, and \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 155]\n\u00a0\n what was in the contemplation of the parties, was travel and transportation over the water communications and portages as then used, and there was ... no thought or intention of dealing with the use of these non-navigable rapids and falls that were not in use and could not be used, the passing of which was provided for by the portages.'\n Chief Justice Anglin wrote a separate opinion agreeing in the result 'largely for the reasons' stated by Judges Rinfret and Smith. He said, however, that he should have 'preferred it had the majority of the court seen its way clear to base its decision upon a holding' that the stipulation of the treaty 'was merely meant to ensure to the citizens of both countries equality of rights in regard to the water communications, portages, etc., and that it never was intended thereby to provide that in no event should either party to the treaty be at liberty, as regards citizens of its own nationality, to impose tolls for the use of improvements lawfully to be made thereon'; that 'where either party to the treaty saw fit to impose tolls upon its own citizens, in regard to such improvements, it should be at liberty to impose like tolls (but none greater) on citizens of the other country for the use of the improvements so made.'\n Two judges-Judges Lamont and Cannon-delivered an opinion to the effect that 'although at the date of the treaty the chief purpose for which these water communications were being used was the transportation by boat or canoe of persons and goods, the clause in question places no limit on the purposes for which they might be used'; that 'they are to be 'free and open' to the people of both countries for whatever purpose they may desire to use them as a water communication,' and therefore if 'they could be used for any purpose which did not necessitate the making of a portage to get past a point of danger,' there was 'nothing in the clause, or in any other \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 156]\n\u00a0\n part of the treaty, which would compel the use of the portage in order to have a free passage.' These judges thought that to hold otherwise would be 'to give too narrow a construction to the language used, and to impute a want of vision to the framers of the treaty.' They expressed the opinion that the Pigeon river 'from its mouth along both sides of the boundary line, forms part of the 'water communications' which were to be free and open,' and that this provision is not consistent with the imposition of tolls for the use of improvements erected in the river. While thus construing the treaty, Judges Lamont and Cannon nevertheless reached the final conclusion that the legislation authorizing the imposition of tolls was applicable and valid. This was in the view that 'the legislative competence of a provincial legislature is as plenary and as ample as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed, and could bestow'; that the existence of the treaty does not of itself impose a limitation upon the provincial legislative power; that 'the treaty in itself is not equivalent to an Imperial Act and, without the sanction of Parliament, the Crown cannot alter the existing law by entering into a contract with a foreign power.' Hence, it was said, the rights and privileges given by a treaty are, under Canadian law, enforceable by the courts only where the treaty 'has been implemented or sanctioned by legislation rendering it binding upon the subject,' and the statute giving authority to impose tolls for the use of the improvements 'must be considered to be a valid enactment until the treaty is implemented by Imperial or Dominion legislation.' While the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada thus differed in the grounds of their judgments, they agreed in the result.\n Under this decision in Canada and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we have the extraordinary situation that as to these improvements at the same place on the \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 157]\n\u00a0\n boundary stream-improvements necessarily complementary to each other-the Ontario Company may impose charges upon Citizens of the United States for the use of its works on the Canadian side of the line while the Minnesota Company may not charge citizens of Canada for the use of its corresponding works on the Minnesota side.\n In deciding the instant case, we think that there are controlling considerations which make it unnecessary to pass broadly upon the significance of the words 'free and open' in provisions in treaties relating to the use of navigable streams-a phrase which with different contexts has been repeatedly used in international engagements. \n12\n The question here is simply as to the application of these words of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty to this particular boundary stream, the Pigeon river, at points where the river was impassable and hence not used as a means of communication at the time the treaty was made, the travel and transportation of that period, and of earlier times, necessarily seeking the portage by means of which alone it was practicable to secure the desired communication. The words of the clause in question 'as then actually used,' undoubtedly refer to the Grand Portage, but we think there is force in the reasoning of the opinion of Judges Rinfret and Smith in the Supreme Court of Canada that these words were not limited to that portage, and we are not convinced that it was the intention either to \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 158]\n\u00a0\n preclude an improvement which would make a stream along the boundary available for use theretofore impossible, or to prevent a reasonable and nondiscriminatory charge for the use of such an improvement. In the terms of the treaty we find no compelling clarity of prohibition. At best, the clause is ambiguous, and it is appropriate that we should look to the practical construction which has been placed upon it.\n With respect to the portion of the stream within the territorial jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota, the Legislature of that state authorized the erection of these improvements and the charging of reasonable tolls. In contemplation of improvements of this sort in a stream forming part of the international boundary, the state legislation expressly provided for the uniting of such an enterprise with a similar and complementary project appropriately authorized with respect to the Canadian portion of the stream. In the absence of a violation of treaty, or of conflict with an act of the Congress, there can be no doubt as to the power of the state to establish such an aid to commerce. An undertaking of this character by the state falls within the familiar category of cases in which a state may make reasonable provision for local improvements until its authority is superseded by dominant Federal action. 13 The fact that the stream forms part of the international boundary does not make this principle inapplicable. Where, under section 9 of the \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 159]\n\u00a0\n Act of March 3, 1899,14 the consent of Congress is required for the erection of structures in or over navigable waters not lying wholly within a state, 'the Act does not make Congress the source of the right to build but assumes that the right comes from another source, that is, the State'; it merely subjects the exercise of the right 'to the further condition of getting from Congress consent to action upon the grant.' International Bridge Co. v. New York, \n254 \nU.S. 126, 133\n, 41 S.Ct. 56, 59.\n It is not necessary to decide whether, in view of the impassable condition of the portion of the Pigeon river under consideration, the improvements came under the provisions of either section 9 or section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (33 USCA  401, 403),15 as we are of the opinion that the improvements were made with the consent of Congress. By the Act of March 3, 190116 (which apparently was not brought to the attention of the Circuit Court of Appeals), the Congress expressly authorized the Pigeon River Company to improve the river in order that it might be rendered navigable for floating logs, to erect dams and other works necessary for that purpose, and to impose a reasonable charge for the passage of all timber save that which was cut from the adjoining Grand Portage Indian Reservation. The fact that this authority directly applied to that part of the Pigeon river known as 'the cascades' does not, in our judgment, detract from the significance of the act as showing the acquiescence of the Congress in the improvements here in question. The authority was given because of the governmental interest in the Indian Reservation adjacent to the Pigeon river, and\n 14 30 Stat. 1151 (33 USCA  401).\n 15 See United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 707\n, 708 S., 19 S.Ct. 770; Leovy v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 621, 628\n, 20 S.Ct. 797; Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 124 S., 41 S.Ct. 409; Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367, 412\n, 413 S., 49 S.Ct. 163.\n 16 See note 9. \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 160]\n\u00a0\n it is obvious that the works at the cascades would have been futile if the related portions of the river required for the contemplated flotation of timber were not appropriately improved. The consent of the Congress, running expressly to the Pigeon River Company as a corporation organized under the applicable laws of Minnesota, for the erection of the structures at the cascades where the interests of the Indian Reservation were involved, necessarily implied acquiescence in the action by the state in authorizing the improvements which would accomplish the purpose which the Congress had in view. Nor does it affect the question that the congressional authorization was stated to be subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior might prescribe. It is not shown that the Secretary has imposed restrictions and the Act did not require him to impose them.\n We find no reason for regarding this action as intended to abrogate or modify the provision of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty. So far as the act of Congress specifically authorized the charging of tolls for the use of the improvements on the Minnesota side of the boundary, it would control in our courts as the later expression of our municipal law, even though it conflicted with the provision of the treaty and the international obligation remained unaffected. The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 621; Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 597\n, 5 S.Ct. 247; Cook v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 102, 120\n, 53 S.Ct. 305. But the intention to abrogate or modify a treaty is not to be lightly imputed to the Congress. Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536, 549\n, 5 S.Ct. 255; United States v. Payne, \n264 \nU.S. 446, 449\n, 44 S. Ct. 352; Cook v. United States, supra. We think that it is proper to infer that the Congress, in view of the condition of the stream and the purpose of the improvements, did not consider the authority to make them and to impose a reasonable charge for their use, as being inconsistent with the treaty \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 161]\n\u00a0\n stipulation. We regard the action of the Congress, following that of the state, as a practical construction of the treaty as permitting these works and justifying the charge.\n The same may be said of the action of the Province of Ontario in providing for the complementary works on the Canadian side of the boundary and authorizing tolls for their use. While this action was taken in the plenitude of the power of the provincial Legislature as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada, we perceive no reason for ascribing to that Legislature an intention to override the provision of the treaty but rather see in that action an assumption on the part of the Legislature that its course was not repugnant to the treaty, an inference which finds abundant support in the conclusion of the majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada. Nor does it appear that either of the parties to the treaty has made to the other any representations as to a breach of obligation by reason of the making of the improvements or the imposition of tolls. We find no ground for rejecting the practical construction which the treaty has thus received.\n Further, in 1909, for the purpose of settling all questions pending between the United States and the Dominion of Canada, 'involving the rights, obligations or interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, along their common frontier,' the United States and Great Britain entered into a treaty concerning the boundary waters. \n17\n By article 1 of this treaty the parties formulated their agreement 'that the navigation of all navigable boundary waters shall forever continue free and open for the purposes of commerce to the inhabitants and to ships, vessels and boats of both countries \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 162]\n\u00a0\n equally.' \n18\n The treaty expressly refers to uses and obstructions of boundary waters which had theretofore been permitted and sets up an International Joint Commission with jurisdiction to deal with future uses and obstructions, as stated. Article 3 of the treaty thus provides (36 Stat. 2449): 'It is agreed that, in addition to the uses, obstructions, and diversions heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by special agreement between the Parties hereto, no further or other uses or obstructions or diversions, whether temporary or permanent, of boundary waters on either side of the line, affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the other side of the line, shall be made except by authority of the United States or the Dominion of Canada within their respective jurisdictions and with the approval, as hereinafter provided, of a joint commission, to be known as the International Joint Commission.' \n\n[291 U.S. 138, 163]\n\u00a0\n We think it may fairly be said that the improvements here in question on the Pigeon river constituted structures and uses which had been permitted by the parties prior to the treaty of 1909 and were recognized by that treaty. It does not appear that any action has been taken by either government or by the International Joint Commission inconsistent with this view.\n We conclude that it was error to sustain the demurrer to the amended complaint. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Stat. 573, 574; Malloy, Treaties, vol. 1, pp. 652, 653. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 8 Stat. 221, 222; Malloy, Treaties, vol. 1, loc. cit., pp. 617, 624. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sen.

WABASH RY. CO.(1934)\nNo. 585\nArgued: Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. St. J. Wines, of Springfield, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Homer Hall, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n John Pokora, driving his truck across a railway grade crossing in the city of Spring field, Ill., was struck by a train and injured. Upon the trial of his suit for damages, the District Court held that he had been guilty of contributory negligence, and directed a verdict for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting) affirmed ( 66 F.(2d) 166), resting its judgment on the opinion of this court in B. & O.R. Co. v. Goodman, \n275 \nU.S. 66\n, 48 S.Ct. 24, 25, 56 A.L.R. 645. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n Pokora was an ice dealer, and had come to the crossing to load his truck with ice. The tracks of the Wabash Railway are laid along Tenth street, which runs north and south. There is a crossing at Edwards street running east and west. Two ice depots are on opposite corners of Tenth and Edward streets; one at the northeast corner, the other at the southwest. Pokora, driving west along Edwards street, stopped at the first of these corners to get his load of ice, but found so many trucks ahead of him that he decided to try the depot on the other side of the way. In this crossing of the railway, the accident occurred. \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n The defendant has four tracks on Tenth street; a switch track on the east, then the main track, and then two switches. Pokora, as he left the northeast corner where his truck had been stopped, looked to the north for approaching trains. He did this at a point about ten or fifteen feet east of the switch ahead of him. A string of box cars standing on the switch, about five to ten feet from the north line of Edwards street, cut off his view of the tracks beyond him to the north. At the same time he listened. There was neither bell nor whistle. Still listening, he crossed the switch, and reaching the main track was struck by a passenger train coming from the north at a speed of twenty-five to thirty miles an hour.\n The burden of proof was on the defendant to make out the defense of contributory negligence. Miller v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n290 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 54 S.Ct. 172. The record does not show in any conclusive way that the train was visible to Pokora while there was still time to stop. A space of eight feet lay between the west rail of the switch and the east rail of the main track, but there was an overhang of the locomotive ( perhaps two and a half or three feet), as well as an overhang of the box cars, which brought the zone of danger even nearer. When the front of the truck had come within this zone, Pokora was on his seat, and so was farther back (perhaps five feet or even more), just how far we do not know, for the defendant has omitted to make proof of the dimensions. Nice calculations are submitted in an effort to make out that there was a glimpse of the main track before the switch was fully cleared. Two feet farther back the track was visible, it is said, for about 130 or 140 feet. But the view from that position does not tell us anything of significance unless we know also the position of the train. Pokora was not protected by his glimpse of 130 feet if the train at the same moment was 150 feet away or farther. For all that appears he had no view of the main track northward, or none for \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n a substantial distance, till the train was so near that escape had been cut off. Cf. Dobson v. St. Louis S.F. Ry. Co., 223 Mo.App. 812, 822, 10 S. W.(2d) 528; Turner v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S.S.M.R. Co., 164 Minn. 335, 341, 205 N.W. 213.\n In such circumstances the question, we think, was for the jury whether reasonable caution forbade his going forward in reliance on the sense of hearing, unaided by that of sight. No doubt it was his duty to look along the track from his seat, if looking would avail to warn him of the danger. This does not mean, however, that if vision was cut off by obstacles, there was negligence in going on, any more than there would have been in trusting to his ears if vision had been cut off by the darkness of the night. Cf. Norfolk & W. Ry. v. Holbrook (C.C.A.) 27 F.(2d) 326. Pokora made his crossing in the daytime, but like the traveler by night he used the faculties available to one in his position. Johnson v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., 163 N.C. 431, 79 S.E. 690, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 598; Parsons v. Syracuse, B. & N.Y.R. Co., 205 N.Y. 226, 228, 98 N.E. 331. A jury, but not the court, might say that with faculties thus limited he should have found some other means of assuring himself of safety before venturing to cross. The crossing was a frequented highway in a populous city. Behind him was a line of other cars, making ready to follow him. To some extent, at least, there was assurance in the thought that the defendant would not run its train at such a time and place without sounding bell or whistle. L. & N.R. Co. v. Summers (C.C.A.) 125 F. 719, 721; Smith-Hurd Rev. St. 1933, c. 114,  59, Illinois Revised Statutes ( 1933 Ed.), c. 114, par. 84.1 Indeed, the \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n statutory signals did not exhaust the defendant's duty when to its knowledge there was special danger to the traveler through obstructions on the roadbed narrowing the field of vision. Wright v. St. Louis-S.F. Ry. Co ., 327 Mo. 557, 566, 37 S.W.(2d) 591; Hires v. Atlantic City R. Co., 66 N. J. Law, 30, 48 A. 1002; Cordell v. N.Y.C. & H.R.R. Co., 70 N.Y. 119, 26 Am. Rep. 550. All this the plaintiff, like any other reasonable traveler, might fairly take into account. All this must be taken into account by us in comparing what he did with the conduct reasonably to be expected of reasonable men. Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Ives, \n144 \nU.S. 408, 417\n, 12 S.Ct. 679; Flannelly v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n225 \nU.S. 597\n, 32 S. Ct. 783, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 154.\n The argument is made, however, that our decision in B. & O.R. Co. v. Goodman, supra, is a barrier in the plaintiff's path, irrespective of the conclusion that might commend itself if the question were at large. There is no doubt that the opinion in that case is correct in its result. Goodman, the driver, traveling only five or six miles an hour, had, before reaching the track, a clear space of eighteen feet within which the train was plainly visible. \n2\n With that opportunity, he fell short of the legal standard of duty established for a traveler when he failed to look and see. This was decisive of the case. But the court did not stop there. It added a remark, unnecessary upon the facts before it, which has been a fertile source of controversy. 'In such circumstances it seems to us that if a driver cannot be sure otherwise whether a train is dangerously near he must stop and get out of his vehicle, although obviously he will not often be required to do more than to stop and look.'\n There is need at this stage to clear the ground of brushwood that may obscure the point at issue. We do \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n not now inquire into the existence of a duty to stop, disconnected from a duty to get out and reconnoitre. The inquiry, if pursued, would lead us into the thickets of conflicting judgments. \n3\n Some courts apply what is often spoken of as the Pennsylvania rule, and impose an unyielding duty to stop, as well as to look and listen, no matter how clear the crossing or the tracks on either side. See, e.g., Benner v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 262 Pa. 307, 105 A. 283, 2 A.L.R. 759; Thompson v. Pennsylvania R. Co ., 215 Pa. 113, 64 A. 323, 7 Ann.Cas. 351; Hines v. Cooper, 205 Ala. 70, 88 So. 133; cf. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Yingling, 148 Md. 169, 129 A. 36, 41 A.L.R. 398. Other courts, the majority, adopt the rule that the traveler must look and listen, but that the existence of a duty to stop depends upon the circumstances, and hence generally, even if not invariably, upon the judgment of the jury. See, e.g., Judson v. Central Vermont R. Co., 158 N.Y. 597, 605, 606, 53 N.E. 514, and cases cited; Love v. Fort Dodge R. Co., 207 Iowa, 1278, 1286, 224 N.W. 815; Turner v. Minneapolis R. Co., supra; Wisconsin & Arkansas Lumber Co. v. Brady, 157 Ark. 449, 454, 248 S.W. 278; cf. Metcalf v. Central Vermont R. Co., 78 Conn. 614, 63 A. 633; Gills v. N.Y., C. & St. L.R. Co., 342 Ill. 455, 174 N.E. 523. The subject has been less considered in this court, but in none of its opinions is there a suggestion that at any and every crossing the duty to stop is absolute, irrespective of the danger. Not even in B. & O.R. Co. v. Goodman, supra, which goes farther than the earlier cases, is there support for such a rule. To the contrary, the opinion makes it clear that the duty is conditioned upon the presence of impediments whereby sight and hearing become inadequate for the traveler's protection. Cf. Murray v. So. Pacific Co., 177 Cal. 1, 10, 169 P. 675; Williams v. Iola Electric R. Co., 102 Kan. 268, 271, 170 P. 397. \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 104]\n\u00a0\n Choice between these diversities of doctrine is unnecessary for the decision of the case at hand. Here the fact is not disputed that the plaintiff did stop before he started to cross the tracks. If we assume that by reason of the box cars, there was a duty to stop again when the obstructions had been cleared, that duty did not arise unless a stop could be made safely after the point of clearance had been reached. See, e.g., Dobson v. St. Louis-S.F. Ry. Co., supra. For reasons already stated, the testimony permits the inference that the truck was in the zone of danger by the time the field of vision was enlarged. No stop would then have helped the plaintiff if he remained seated on his truck, or so the triers of the facts might find. His case was for the jury, unless as a matter of law he was subject to a duty to get out of the vehicle before it crossed the switch, walk forward to the front, and then, afoot, survey the scene. We must say whether his failure to do this was negligence so obvious and certain that one conclusion and one only is permissible for rational and candid minds. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Ives, supra.\n Standards of prudent conduct are declared at times by courts, but they are taken over from the facts of life. To get out of a vehicle and reconnoitre is an uncommon precaution, as everyday experience informs us. Besides being uncommon, it is very likely to be futile, and sometimes even dangerous. If the driver leaves his vehicle when he nears a cut or curve, he will learn nothing by getting out about the perils that lurk beyond. By the time he regains his seat and sets his car in motion, the hidden train may be upon him. See, e.g., Torgeson v. Missouri-K.-T.R. Co., 124 Kan. 798, 800, 801, 262 P. 564, 55 A.L.R. 1335; Dobson v. St. Louis-S.F.R. Co., supra; Key v. Carolina & N.W.R. Co., 150 S.C. 29, 35, 147 S.E. 625; Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Stanley, 38 Ga.App. 773, 778, 145 S.E. 530. Often the added safeguard will be dubious though the track happens to be straight, as \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 105]\n\u00a0\n it seems that this one was, at all events as far as the station, about five blocks to the north. A train traveling at a speed of thirty miles an hour will cover a quarter of a mile in the space of thirty seconds. It may thus emerge out of obscurity as the driver turns his back to regain the waiting car, and may then descend upon him suddenly when his car is on the track. Instead of helping himself by getting out, he might do better to press forward with all his faculties alert. So a train at a neighboring station, apparently at rest and harmless, may be transformed in a few seconds into an instrument of destruction. At times the course of safety may be different. One can figure to oneself a roadbed so level and unbroken that getting out will be a gain. Even then the balance of advantage depends on many circumstances and can be easily disturbed. Where was Pokora to leave his truck after getting out to reconnoitre? If he was to leave it on the switch, there was the possibility that the box cars would be shunted down upon him before he could regain his seat. The defendant did not show whether there was a locomotive at the forward end, or whether the cars were so few that a locomotive could be seen. If he was to leave his vehicle near the curb, there was even stronger reason to believe that the space to be covered in going back and forth would make his observations worthless. One must remember that while the traveler turns his eyes in one direction, a train or a loose engine may be approaching from the other.\n Illustrations such as these bear witness to the need for caution in framing standards of behavior that amount to rules of law. The need is the more urgent when there is no background of experience out of which the standards have emerged. They are then, not the natural flowerings of behavior in its customary forms, but rules artificially developed, and imposed from without. Extraordinary situations may not wisely or fairly be subjected to \n\n[292 U.S. 98, 106]\n\u00a0\n tests or regulations that are fitting for the commonplace or normal. In default of the guide of customary conduct, what is suitable for the traveler caught in a mesh where the ordinary safeguards fail him is for the judgment of a jury. Dolan v. D. & H.C. Co., 71 N.Y. 285, 288, 289; Davis v. N.Y.C. & H.R.R. Co., 47 N.Y. 400, 402. The opinion in Goodman's Case has been a source of confusion in the federal courts to the extent that it imposes a standard for application by the judge, and has had only wavering support in the courts of the states. \n4\n We limit it accordingly.\n The judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Illinois Act provides: 'Every railroad corporation shall cause a bell of at least thirty pounds weight, and a steam whistle placed and kept on each locomotive engine, and shall cause the same to be rung or whistled by the engineer or fireman, at the distance of at least eighty rods from the place where the railroad crosses or intersects any public highway, and shall be kept ringing or whistling until such highway is reached.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a full statement of the facts, see the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 10 F.(2d) 58, 59. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The cases are collected in 1 A.L.R. 203 and 41 A.L.R. 405 notes. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Many cases are collected in 43 Harvard Law Review 926, 929, 930, and in 56 A.L.R. 647 note.\n See, also, Dobson v.

STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1934)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic R. Coudert and Dean Emery, both of New York, for plaintiff.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. A. Lauderdale and Greek L. Rice, both of Jackson, Miss., for the State of Mississippi.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Principality of Monaco asks leave to bring suit in this Court against the State of Mississippi upon bonds issued by the State and alleged to be the absolute property of the Principality.\n The proposed declaration sets forth four causes of action. Two counts are upon bonds known as Mississippi Planters' Bank Bonds, dated March 1, 1833, the first count being upon eight bonds of $1,000 each, due March 1, 1861, and the second count upon two bonds of $1,000 each, due March 1, 1866, all with interest at 6 per cent. per annum. The remaining two counts are upon bonds known as Mississippi Union Bank Bonds, the third count being on twenty bonds of $2,000 each, dated June 7, 1838, due February 5, 1850, and the fourth count upon twenty-five bonds of $2,000 each, dated June 6, 1838, due February 5, 1858, all with interest at 5 per cent. per annum. In each count it was alleged that the bonds were transferred and delivered to the Principality at its legation in Paris, France, on or about September 27, 1933, as an absolute gift. Accompanying the declaration and made a part of it is a letter of the donors, dated September 26, 1933, stating that the bonds had 'been handed down from their respective families who purchased them at \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n the time of their issue by the State of Mississippi'; that the State had 'long since defaulted on the principal and interest of these bonds, the holders of which have waited for some 90 years in the hope that the State would meet its obligations and make payment'; that the donors had been advised that there was no basis upon which they could maintain a suit against Mississippi on the bonds, but that 'such a suit could only be maintained by a foreign government or one of the United States'; and that in these circumstances the donors were making an unconditional gift of the bonds to the Principality to be applied 'to the causes of any of its charities, to the furtherance of its internal development or to the benefit of its citizens in such manner as it may select.'\n The State of Mississippi, in its return to the rule to show cause why leave should not be granted, raises the following objections: (1) That the Principality of Monaco is not a 'foreign State' within the meaning of section 2, article 3, of the Constitution of the United States, and is therefore not authorized to bring a suit against a State; (2) that the State of Mississippi has not consented and does not consent that she be sued by the Principality of Monaco and that without such consent the State cannot be sued; (3) that the Constitution by section 10, cl. 3, art. 1, 'forbids the State of Mississippi without the consent of Congress to enter into any compact or agreement with the Principality of Monaco, and no compact, agreement or contract has been entered into by the State with the Principality'; (4) that the proposed litigation is an attempt by the Principality 'to evade the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States'; (5) that the proposed declaration does not state a controversy which is 'justiciable under the Constitution of the United States and cognizable under the jurisdiction of this Court'; (6) that the alleged right of action 'has long since been defeated and \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n extinguished' by reason of the completion of the period of limitation of action prescribed by the statutes of Mississippi; that the plaintiff and its predecessors in title have been guilty of laches, and that the right of action, if any, is now and for a long time has been stale.\n The State contends that the holders of her bonds had a statutory right to sue the State by Virtue of the Act of February 15, 1833 ( Hutchinson's Code, 1798-1848, chap. 54, art. 11,  1; State v. Johnson, 25 Miss. 625); that by the operation of a constitutional amendment in 1856 abolishing the Superior Court of Chancery, and until the adoption of the Revised Code of 1871, the State had no statutory provision authorizing suits against her (Whitney v. State, 52 Miss. 732); that the Revised Code of 1871 (section 1573) provided that the State might be sued and that Code had no statute of limitations in respect to bonds or contracts under seal; that a limitation of seven years as to actions upon such obligations was imposed by the Act of April 19, 1873 (Laws Miss. 1873, c. 26) and that the statute of limitations against the bonds in question began to run on that date; that the right to sue the State conferred by the Revised Code of 1871 was taken away by the Code of 1880 which became effective on November 1st of that year (Gulf Export Co. v. State, 112 Miss. 452, 73 So. 281); that meanwhile, in 1876, the Constitution of the State (art. 12,  5) was amended so as to provide that the State should not 'assume, redeem, secure, or pay any indebtedness or pretended indebtedness alleged to be due by the state of Mississippi to any person, association, or corporation whatsoever, claiming the same as owners, holders, or assignees of any bond or bonds, now generally known as 'Union Bank' bonds and 'Planters Bank' bonds,' that this provision was incorporated in the Constitution of 1890 (section 258), and that since its adoption no foreign State could accept the bonds in question as a charitable donation in good faith. \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n In reply to these objections, the Principality asserts that she is a foreign State recognized as such by the Government of the United States; that the consent of the State of Mississippi is not necessary to give the Court jurisdiction; that the obligation of the State of Mississippi to pay her bonds is not an agreement or a compact with a foreign power within section 10, cl. 3, article 1, of the Constitution; that the action is not a subterfuge to evade the Eleventh Amendment; that the cause of action is justiciable; that no statute of limitations has run against the plaintiff or its predecessors and that neither has been guilty of laches. Upon the last-mentioned points the Principality urges that under the provisions of the statutes of Mississippi, holders of her bonds never had an enforceable remedy which could be said to be barred by the running of any state statute of limitations, and that the Principality will be prepared in the course of the suit to meet the defense of laches by showing the history of the efforts of the holders of the bonds to procure payment.\n These contentions have been presented in oral argument as well as upon briefs. We find it necessary to deal with but one, that is, the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit brought by a foreign State against a State without her consent. That question, not hitherto determined, is now definitely presented.\n The Principality relies upon the provisions of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution of the United States that the judicial power shall extend to controversies 'between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects' (clause 1), and that in cases 'in which a State shall be Party' this Court shall have original jurisdiction ( clause 2). The absence of qualification requiring the consent of the State in the case of a suit by a foreign State is asserted to be controlling. And the point is stressed that the Eleventh Amendment \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution, providing that the judicial power shall not be construed to extend to any suit against one of the United States 'by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or subjects of any Foreign State,' contains no reference to a suit brought by a foreign State.\n The argument drawn from the lack of an express requirement of consent to be sued is inconclusive. Thus there is no express provision that the United States may not be sued in the absence of consent. Clause 1 of section 2 of article 3 extends the judicial power 'to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party.' Literally, this includes such controversies, whether the United States be party plaintiff or defendant. Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 573\n, 53 S.Ct. 751. But by reason of the established doctrine of the immunity of the sovereign from suit except upon consent, the provision of clause 1 of section 2 of article 3 does not authorize the maintenance of suits against the United States. Williams v. United States, supra. Compare Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 411, 412; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 386 S., 22 S.Ct. 650; Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 331, 341\n, 342 S., 27 S.Ct. 388. And while clause 2 of section 2 of article 3 gives this Court original jurisdiction in those cases in which 'a State shall be Party,' this Court has no jurisdiction of a suit by a State against the United States in the absence of consent. Kansas v. United States, supra. Clause 2 merely distributes the jurisdiction conferred by clause 1, and deals with cases in which resort may be had to the original jurisdiction of this Court in the exercise of the judicial power as previously given. Duhne v. New Jersey, \n251 \nU.S. 311, 314\n, 40 S.Ct. 154.\n Similarly, neither the literal sweep of the words of clause 1 of section 2 of article 3, nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in clause 1, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent. \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n Thus clause 1 specifically provides that the judicial power shall extend 'to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.' But, although a case may arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is sought to be prosecuted against a StateWithout her consent, by one of her own citizens. Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S.Ct. 504; Duhne v. New Jersey, supra, page 311 of 251 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 154. The requirement of consent is necessarily implied. The State has the same immunity in case of a suit brought by a corporation created by act of Congress. Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436\n, 20 S.Ct. 919. Yet in neither case is the suit within the express prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment. Again, the Eleventh Amendment mentions only suits 'in law or equity'; it does not refer to suits in admiralty. But this Court has held that the Amendment does not 'leave open a suit against a state in the admiralty jurisdiction by individuals, whether its own citizens or not.' Ex parte State of New York, No. 1, \n256 \nU.S. 490, 498\n, 41 S.Ct. 588, 590\n\n\n Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of section 2 of article 3, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against nonconsenting States. Behind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control. There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as contemplated, shall be found to be of a justiciable character. There is also the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of sovereignty,1 shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where there has been 'a surrender of this \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n immunity in the plan of the convention.' The Federalist, No. 81. The question is whether the plan of the Constitution involves the surrender of immunity when the suit is brought against a State, without her consent, by a foreign State.\n The debates in the Constitutional Convention do not disclose a discussion of this question. But Madison, in the Virginia Convention, answering objections to the ratification of the Constitution, clearly stated his view as to the purpose and effect of the provision conferring jurisdiction over controversies between States of the Union and foreign States. That purpose was suitably to provide for adjudication in such cases if consent should be given but not otherwise. \n2\n Madison said: 'The next case provides for disputes between a foreign state and one of our states, should such a case ever arise; and between a citizen and a foreign citizen or subject. I do not conceive that any controversy can ever be decided, in these courts, between \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 324]\n\u00a0\n an American state and a foreign state, without the consent of the partie . If they consent, provision is here made.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 533.\n Marshall, in the same Convention, expressed a similar view. Replying to an objection as to the admissibility of a suit by a foreign state, Marshall said: 'He objects, in the next place, to its jurisdiction in controversies between a state and a foreign state. Suppose, says he, in such a suit, a foreign state is cast; will she be bound by the decision? If a foreign state brought a suit against the commonwealth of Virginia, would she not be barred from the claim if the federal judiciary thought it unjust? The previous consent of the parties is necessary; and, as the federal judiciary will decide, each party will acquiesce.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 557.3\n Hamilton, in the Federalist, No. 81, made the following emphatic statement of the general principle of immunity: 'It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us that there is no color to pretend that the State governments would by the adoption of that plan be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 325]\n\u00a0\n The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident it could not be done without waging was against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication, and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would involve such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that, despite these cogent statements of the views which prevailed when the Constitution was ratified, the Court held, in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, over the vigorous dissent of Mr. Justice Iredell,5 that a State was liable to suit by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country. But this decision created such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted. As the Amendment did not in terms apply to a suit against a State by its own citizen, the Court had occasion, when that question was presented in Hans v. Louisiana, supra (a case alleged to arise under the Constitution of the United States), to give elaborate consideration to the application of the general principle of the immunity of States from suits brought against them without their consent. Mr. Justice Bradley delivered the opinion of the Court and, in view of the importance of the question, we quote at length from that opinion to show the reasoning which \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 326]\n\u00a0\n led to the decision that the suit could not be maintained. The Court said ( 134 U.S. page 12 et seq., 10 S.Ct. 504, 506): 'Looking back from our present stand-point at the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, we do not greatly wonder at the effect which it had upon the country. Any such power as that of authorizing the federal judiciary to entertain suits by individuals against the states had been expressly disclaimed, and even resented, by the great defenders of the constitution while it was on its trial before the American people.' After quoting the statements of Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall, the Court continued:\n'It seems to us that these views of those great advocates and defenders of the constitution were most sensible and just, and they apply equally to the present case as to that then under discussion. The letter is appealed to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an individual against a state. The reason against it is as strong in this case as it was in that. It is an attempt to strain the constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of. Can we suppose that, when the eleventh amendment was adopted, it was understood to be left open for citizens of a state to sue their own state in the federal courts, while the idea of suits by citizens of other states, or of foreign states, was indignantly repelled? Suppose that congress, when proposing the eleventh amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a state from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the states? The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face.\n\n'The truth is that the cognizance of suits and actions unknown to the law, and forbidden by the law, was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States. ... \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 327]\n\u00a0\n 'The suability of a state, without its consent, was a thing unknown to the law. This has been so often laid down and acknowledged by courts and jurists that it is hardly necessary to be formally asserted. It was fully shown by an exhaustive examination of the old law by Mr. Justice Iredell in his opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia; and it has been conceded in every case since, where the question has, in any way, been presented, even in the cases which have gone furthest in sustaining suits against the officers or agents of states.'\n\n The Court then adverted to observations of Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, which favored the argument of the plaintiff in error, but as those observat ons were unnecessary to the decision in the case of Cohens, the Court was of the opinion that they should not 'outweigh the important considerations referred to which lead to a different conclusion.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The same principle of immunity was reiterated and applied by the Court, upon the authority of Hans v. Louisiana, in Smith v. Reeves, supra, in deciding that a federal corporation could not sue a State without her consent, although, as we have seen, such a suit was not listed in the specific prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment.\n In the case of State of South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286, 318\n, 24 S.Ct. 269, the Court observed that the expression in the opinion in Hans v. Louisiana of concurrence in the views announced by Mr. Justice Iredell in his dissenting opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, could not be considered as a judgment of the Court, in view of the point which Hans v. Louisiana actually decided. But South Dakota v. North Carolina did not disturb the ruling in Hans v. Louisiana or the principle which that decision applied. \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 328]\n\u00a0\n South Dakota v. North Carolina was a suit by one State against another State and did not present the question of the maintenance either of a suit by individuals against a State or by a foreign State against a State. As a suit by one State against another State, it involved a distinct and essential principle of the constitutional plan which provided means for the judicial settlement of controversies between States of the Union, a principle which necessarily operates regardless of the consent of the defendant State. The reasoning of the Court in Hans v. Louisiana with respect to the general principle of sovereign immunity from suits was recently reviewed and approved in Williams v. United States, supra.\n The question of that immunity, in the light of the provisions of clause 1 of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, is thus presented in several distinct classes of cases, that is, in those brought against a State (a) by another State of the Union; (b) by the United States; (c) by the citizens of another State or by the citizens or subjects of a foreign State; (d) by citizens of the same State or by federal corporations; and ( e) by foreign States. Each of these classes has its characteristic aspect, from the standpoint of the effect, upon sovereign immunity from suits, which has been produced by the constitutional scheme.\n\n 1. \nThe establishment of a permanent tribunal with adequate authority to determine controversies between the States, in place of an inadequate scheme of arbitration, was essential to the peace of the Union. The Federalist, No. 80; Story on the Constitution,  1679. With respect to such constroversies, the States by the adoption of the Constitution, acting 'in their highest sovereign capacity, in the convention of the people,' waived their exemption from judicial power. The jurisdiction of this Court over the parties in such cases was thus established \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 329]\n\u00a0\n 'by their own consent and delegated authority' as a necessary feature of the formation of a more perfect Union. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 720; Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 17 S., 20 S. Ct. 251; Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 240\n, 241 S., 21 S. Ct. 331; Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125, 142\n, 144 S., 22 S.Ct. 552; Id., \n206 \nU.S. 46, 83\n, 85 S., 27 S.Ct. 655; Commonwealth of Virginia v. West Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 565\n, 38 S.Ct. 400.\n\n 2. \nUpon a similar basis rests the jurisdiction of this Court of a suit by the United States against a State, albeit without the consent of the latter. While that jurisdiction is not conferred by the Constitution in express words, it is inherent in the constitutional plan. United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211\n, 10 S.Ct. 920; United States v. Texas, \n14 \nU.S. 621, 644\n, 645 S., 12 S.Ct. 488, 493; Id., \n162 \nU.S. 1, 90\n, 16 S.Ct. 725; United States v. Michigan, \n190 \nU.S. 379, 396\n, 23 S.Ct. 742; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S.Ct. 406; United States v. Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 195\n, 46 S.Ct. 298. Without such a provision, as this Court said in United States v. Texas, supra, 'the permanence of the Union might be endangered.'\n\n 3. \nTo suits against a State, without her consent, brought by citizens of another State or by citizens or subjects of a foreign State, the Eleventh Amendment erected an absolute bar. Superseding the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, supra, the Amendment established in effective operation the principle asserted by Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall in expounding the Constitution and advocating its ratification. The 'entire judicial power granted by the Constitution' does not embrace authority to entertain such suits in the absence of the State's consent. Ex parte State of New York, No. 1, supra, page 497 of \n256 U.S. 41\n S.Ct. 588; Missouri v. Fiske, \n290 \nU.S. 18, 25\n, 26 S., 54 S.Ct. 18.\n\n 4. \nProtected by the same fundamental principle, the States, in the absence of consent, are immune from suits brought against them by their own citizens or by federal corporations, although such suits are not within the ex- \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 330]\n\u00a0\n plicit prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment. Hans v. Louisiana, supra; Smith v. Reeves, supra; Duhne v. New Jersey, supra; Ex parte State of New York, No. 1, supra.\n\n 5. \nWe are of the opinion that the same principle applies to suits against a State by a foreign State. The decision in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, is not opposed, as it rested upon the determination that the Cherokee nation was not a 'foreign State' in the sense in which the term is used in the Constitution. The question now before us necessarily remained an open one. We think that Madison correctly interpreted clause 1 of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution as making provision for jurisdiction of a suit against a State by a foreign State in the event of the State's consent but not otherwise. In such a case, the grounds of coercive jurisdiction which are present in suits to determine controversies between States of the Union, or in suits brought by the United States against a State, are not present. The foreign State lies outside the structure of the Union. The waiver or consent, on the part of a State, which inheres in the acceptance of the constitutional plan, runs to the other States who have likewise accepted that plan, and to the United States as the sovereign which the Constitution creates. We perceive no ground upon which it can be said that any waiver or consent by a State of the Union has run in favor of a foreign State. As to suits brought by a foreign State, we think that the States of the Union retain the same immunity that they enjoy with respect to suits by individuals whether citizens of the United States or citizens or subjects of a foreign State. The foreign State enjoys a similar sovereign immunity and without her consent may not be sued by a State of the Union.\n The question of the right of suit by a foreign State against a State of the Union is not limited to cases of \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 331]\n\u00a0\n alleged debts or of obligations issued by a State and claimed to have been acquired by transfer. Controversies between a State and a foreign State may involve international questions in relation to which the United States has a sovereign prerogative. One of the most frequent occasions for the exercise of the jurisdiction granted by the Constitution over controversies between States of the Union has been found in disputes over territorial boundaries. See Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, supra, page 737 of 12 Pet.. Questions have also arisen with respect to the obstruction of navigation, South Carolina v. Georgia, \n93 U.S. 4\n; the pollution of streams, Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 08\n, 21 S.Ct. 331; Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S.Ct. 268; and the diversion of navigable waters, Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S. Ct. 163; Id., \n289 \nU.S. 395, 400\n, 53 S.Ct. 671. But in the case of such a controversy with a foreign power, a State has no prerogative of adjustment. No State can enter 'into and Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation' or, without the consent of Congress, 'into any Agreement or Compact ... with a foreign Power.' Const. art. 1,  10. The National Government, by virtue of its control of our foreign relations is entitled to employ the resources of diplomatic negotiations and to effect such an international settlement as may be found to be appropriate, through treaty, agreement, of arbitration, or otherwise. It cannot be supposed that it was the intention that a controversy growing out of the action of a State, which involves a matter of national concern and which is said to affect injuriously the interests of a foreign State, or a dispute arising from conflicting claims of a State of the Union and a foreign State as to territorial boundaries, should be taken out of the sphere of international negotiations and adjustment through a resort by the foreign State to a suit under the provisions of section 2 of article 3. In such a case, the State has immunity from suit without her consent and the National Government is protected by the \n\n[292 U.S. 313, 332]\n\u00a0\n provision prohibiting agreements between States and foreign powers in the absence of the consent of the Congress. While, in this instance, the proposed suit does not arise a question of national concern, the constitutional provision which is said to confer jurisdiction should be construed in the light of all its applications.\n We conclude that the Principality of Monaco, with respect to the right to maintain the proposed suit, is in no better case than the donors of the bonds, and that the application for leave to sue must be denied.\n Rule discharged, and leave denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, 321; Darrington v. Bank of Alabama, 13 How. 12, 17; Beers v.

King of Spain v. Oliver, Fed. Cas. No. 7, 814, 2 Wash.C.C. 429, 431; The Sapphire, 11 Wall. 164, 167. In the latter case the court said (pages 167, 168 of 11 Wall.): 'Our own government has largely availed itself of the like privilege to bring suits in the English courts in cases growing out of our late civil war. Twelve or more of such suits are enumerated in the brief of the appellees, brought within the last five years in the English law, chancery, and admiralty courts. There are numerous cases in the English reports in which suits of foreign sovereigns have been sustained, though it is held that a sovereign cannot be forced into court by suit.' Cases cited. In Kingdom of Roumania v. Guaranty Trust Co. (C.C.A.) 250 F. 341, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 524, the court held that the bringing of an action by a foreign nation in a court of the United States to recover a deposit placed to its credit in a bank was not a waiver of its immunity as a sovereign from suit by other parties, and hence that the court was without jurisdiction to permit the defendant by interpleader to substitute as defendant another party claiming a lien on the deposit as a creditor of the plaintiff.

CITY OF SEATTLE(1934)\nNo. 344\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 620]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clarence R. Innis and Elmer E. Todd, Frank E. Holman, and William M. Allen, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Messrs. A. C. Van Soelen, Corp. Counsel, Walter L. Baumgartner, Asst. Corp. Counsel, and C. V. Hoard, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington, 172 Wash. 668, 21 P.(2d) 727, 728, sustaining a municipal license or excise tax, assailed by appellant as infringing the Fourteenth Amendment and the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (Article 1,  10, cl. 1).\n An ordinance of the city of Seattle of May 23, 1932, imposes an annual license tax upon the privilege of carrying on the business of selling or furnishing electric light \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 621]\n\u00a0\n and power to consumers. The tax is 3 per cent. of the gross income from the business 'in the city' during the fiscal year next preceding the tax year for which the license is required. The suit, brought to recover an installment of the tax already paid and to enjoin the collection of future installments, was heard and decided upon demurrer to appellant's complaint.\n Both appellant, a Massachusetts corporation, acting under a municipal franchise, and appellee, the city of Seattle, acting by state authority, are engaged and actively compete in the business of furnishing electric light and power to consumers for hire. By state law the city is given plenary power to fix rates for the electric current which it distributes, and its rates are not subject to regulation and control by the Public Service Commission, as are those of appellant. Section 10390, Remington's Rev. Stat. of Washington. Revenues of the city from its electric light business are required by the city charter, article VIII,  9, to be deposited in a special 'city light fund,' separate from the general funds of the city, and transfer from one fund to the other, except by direction of the city council, is forbidden by the city charter. Article IX,  17. Section 6 of the ordinance, in terms, imposes the same tax on the city 'so far as permitted by law,' as that levied on appellant. But it appears that the city, acting under a state statute, section 9491, Remington's Rev. Stat. of Washington, enacted before the taxing ordinance, has issued bonds, the payment of which, both principal and interest, is secured by the revenue of its electric light business. Appellant contends that, by the statute, municipal ordinance, and the terms of the bonds themselves, this pledge is superior to all other charges upon the gross revenue, and that the city cannot lawfully pay the tax. It appears that in fact the city has not paid the tax or made any provision for paying it. The state court, in passing on this question, said: \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 622]\n\u00a0\n 'The city has not allocated, and probably cannot allocate, any of the revenues of its power and light business to the payment of such a tax. Bonds have been issued in excess of $30,000,000 against the revenues from that business; and those bonds are a prior lien on the entire income from it-taking precedence even over operating charges. Conceding that the city's light and power revenues could be subjected to the tax, no machinery is set up in the ordinance to accomplish such an end. Furthermore, in making up its budget for 1932, no provision was made for the levy of general taxes to cover the excise provided for in the ordinance. So the problem must be met as though section 6 had been omitted from the ordinance. ...'\n Whether by this statement the Court intended to decide that the city could not lawfully pay the tax, or assumed that to be the case for the purpose of the decision, it is unnecessary to determine, for appellant further insists that, even though the tax were paid by the city to itself, it would impose no actual burden.\n Asserting that no effective tax is imposed with respect to the business carried on by the city, appellant argues that the taxation of its competing business is a denial of equal protection and deprives it of its property without due process. The tax is also assailed because the measure of it is vague and uncertain, and because, by imposing a license tax upon the privilege of doing the business, the ordinance impairs appellant's franchise contract which gave it the right to conduct the business.\n In sustaining the constitutionality of the tax, the state court found it unnecessary to ascertain whether, under the city charter and ordinances, and state law, the tax, if paid by the city, must be paid from its city light fund rather than from its general fund, or to what extent moneys may now or hereafter be transferred from one \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n fund to the other, or how far the general fund raised by taxation may be used otherwise, either directly or indirectly, to aid the city's electric lighting business. We do not attempt to resolve these questions here. Decision that the city is not authorized by existing law to aid its light fund by taxation, without disposing of the constitutional question decided by the state court, would entail the decision of other questions, arising under the equal protection and contract clauses, not raised or considered in the case. Moreover, the appellant insists that in any case payment of the tax would neither relieve appellant of its burden nor impose a comparable burden on the city, since the same hand would both pay and receive the tax, and there is no constitutional limitation on the power of the city to use the tax when collected for the maintenance of the city's business. Standard Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, 114 Neb. 245, 207 N.W. 172, 208 N.W. 962, affirmed per curiam \n275 \nU.S. 504\n, 48 S.Ct. 155. All the questions thus suggested are met and disposed of by decision of the constitutional question which the state court decided and which we decide here.\n\n 1. \nThere is no contention that appellant's franchise or any contract relieves it generally from the duty of paying taxes. It is not contended that a state or municipality, merely because it fails or is unable to tax its own property or business, is prohibited from taxing like property or business. The contention here is that constitutional limitations are transgressed only because the tax affects a business with which the taxing sovereign is actively competing. For that reason it is argued that the taxation involves a forbidden discrimination and deprives appellant of its property without due process, since the combined power of the city to tax and to compete may be used to destroy appellant's business. As appellant asserts that the tax can impose no effective burden on the city, its \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 624]\n\u00a0\n contention is, in effect, that the city, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, upon entering the business, forfeited its power to tax any competitor.\n In conducting the business by state authority, the city is exercising a part of the sovereign power of the state which the Constitution has not curtailed. The decisions of this Court leave no doubt that a state may, in the public interest, constitutionally engage in a business commonly carried on by private enterprise, levy a tax to support it, Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, 40 S.Ct. 499; Jones v. City of Portland, \n245 \nU.S. 217\n, 38 S.Ct. 112, L.R.A. 1918C, 765, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 660, and compete with private interests engaged in a like activity, Standard Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra; Madera Waterworks v. Madera, \n228 \nU.S. 454\n, 33 S.Ct. 571; Helena Water Works Co. v. Helena, \n195 \nU.S. 383\n, 25 S.Ct. 40.\n We need not stop to inquire whether the equal protection clause was designed to protect the citizen from advantages retained by the sovereign, or to point out the extraordinary implications of appellant's argument when applied to expansions of government activities which have become commonplace. It is enough for present purposes that the equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination with respect to things that are different. The distinctions between the taxing sovereign and its taxpayers are many and obvious. The private corporation, whatever its public duties, carries on its business for private profit, and is subject to the obligation, common to all, to contribute to the expense of government by paying taxes. The municipality, which is enabled to function only because it is a tax gatherer, may acquire property or conduct a business in the interest of the public welfare, and its gains, if any, must be used for public ends. Hence equal protection does not require a city to abstain from taxing the business of a corporation organized for profit merely because in the public interest the municipality has acquired like property or conducts a like business. \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n These differences are not lessened nor the constitutional exaction of uniformity increased because the city competes with a business which it taxes. Compare Springfield Gas & Electric Co. v. Springfield, \n257 \nU.S. 66\n, 42 S.Ct. 24; Hollis v. Kutz, \n255 \nU.S. 452\n, 41 S.Ct. 371; Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Western Union, \n275 \nU.S. 415\n, 48 S.Ct. 198. The state may tax different types of taxpayers differently even though they compete. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464; Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44\n, 41 S.Ct. 219; Hammond Packing Co. v. Montana, \n233 \nU.S. 331\n, 34 S.Ct. 596; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192. It could not plausibly be argued that a private nonprofit corporation distributing electric current to consumers at cost could not be exempted from taxes borne by others serving the same wants. Compare Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 48 S.Ct. 423; German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Superintendent of Ins. of State of Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 418\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A. 1915C, 1189; Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S.Ct. 833. A business which in private hands might be exempted from taxation because not conducted for private profit is no less privileged because its capital is supplied by the government which controls it in the public interest. These considerations are in no way affected by calling the city's activity 'proprietary' instead of 'governmental.' Compare South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737, with Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., \n213 \nU.S. 151\n, 29 S.Ct. 458, and Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S.Ct. 172.\n The injury, which appellant fears may result, is the consequence of competition by the city, and not necessarily of the imposition of the tax. Even without the tax, the possibility of injury would remain, for the city is not bound to conduct the business at a profit. The argument that some way must be found to interpret the due process clause so as to preclude the danger of such an injury fails to point the way. Legislation may protect from the consequences of competition, but the Con- \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n stitution does not. Helena Water Works Co. v. Helena, supra; Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 \nU.S. 259\n, 34 S.Ct. 95. The Fourteenth Amendment does not purport to protect property from every injurious or oppressive action by a state, Memphis Gas-Light Co. v. Taxing District of Shelby County, \n109 \nU.S. 398, 400\n, 3 S.Ct. 205; St. Louis v. United Railways Co., \n210 \nU.S. 266, 276\n, 28 S.Ct. 630, nor can it relieve property of congenital defects, Madera Waterworks v. Madera, supra, 456 of 228 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 571. It does not preclude competition, however drastic, between private enterprises or prevent unequal taxation of competitors who are different. Those were risks which appellant took when it entered the field. No articulate principle is suggested calling for the conclusion that the appellant is not subject to the same risks because the competing business is carried on by the state in the exercise of a power which has been constitutionally reserved to it from the beginning.\n Such was the decision in Madera Waterworks v. Madera, supra, where this Court pointed out that, in the absence of any contract restriction, the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a city from conducting a public waterworks in competition with private business or preclude taxation of the private business to help its rival to succeed. See, also, Springfield Gas & Electric Co. v. Springfield, supra. Such must be our decision now.\n\n 2. \nThe definition of gross income by section 2 of the ordinance, which is sassailed as vague and indefinite, is that considered in Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Seattle, \n291 \nU.S. 300\n, 54 S.Ct. 383. By section 10 and 20 the comptroller of the city is required to make rules and regulations, having the force of law, for carrying the ordinance into effect, and to provide blank forms of return upon which the taxpayer is to enter such information as the comptroller may require to enable him to compute the tax. As appellant alleges that it has received its license and paid the first installment of the tax, it appears that a practical construction has been \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 627]\n\u00a0\n given to the ordinance by an administrative officer competent to give it, which the state court has upheld. It is thus apparent that the ordinance, as construed, is sufficiently difinite to enable the appellant to comply with it, and, as appellant's return for taxation and the method of computing the tax are not disclosed by the record, no constitutional infirmity in the ordinance is revealed. See Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., \n289 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 591; Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Seattle, supra.\n\n 3. \nAppellant asserts a contract under its franchise to use the streets of the city for the purpose of carrying on its business for an unexpired term of years. It argues that the franchise is a contract license to carry on the business, and that the exaction of a tax as a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the license will operate to destroy the privilege granted by the franchise. This argument was made and answered in Memphis Gas-Light Co. v. Taxing District of Shelby County, \n109 \nU.S. 398\n, 3 S.Ct. 205, and in St. Louis v. United Railways Co., \n210 \nU.S. 266\n, 28 S.Ct. 630. Surrender of the state's power to tax the privilege is not to be implied from the grant of it. Hence appellant took its franchise subject to the power of the state to tax the granted privilege in common with all other privileges and property in the state. Without a clearly expressed obligation on the part of the city to surrender that power the contract clause does not limit it. See Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, \n107 \nU.S. 365\n, 2 S.Ct. 257; New Orleans City & Lake R. Co. v. New Orleans, \n143 \nU.S. 192\n, 12 S.Ct. 406; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. City Council of Charleston, \n153 \nU.S. 692\n, 14 S.Ct. 1094; cf. Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 \nU.S. 22\n, 26 S.Ct. 224.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER (specially concurring).\n I concur in the judgment of affirmance, but not in the principal part of the court's opinion.\n The appellant, the power company, assails the ordinance imposing the tax on the following grounds: \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 628]\n\u00a0\n 1. The ordinance contravenes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it lays the tax on the appellant's electric light and power business but not on the like and competing business of the city.\n\n 2. \nThe ordinance offends the due process clause of that Amendment in that it prescribes severe penalties and liabilities for nonpayment of the tax and yet defines 'gross income,' on which the tax is to be computed, so vaguely that the amount of the tax cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty.\n\n 3. \nThe ordinance impairs the franchise contract entitling the appellant to conduct its business within the city for a term of fifty years, and thereby infringes the contract clause of the Constitution, in that it makes the continued enjoyment of the franchise depend on the payment of the tax.\n The assault is confined to this taxing ordinance. Other ordinances, some provisions in the city's charter, and still other enactments, have a real bearing on the matter, but their validity under the Constitution of the United States is not called in question.\n I agree that the second and third grounds of the assault must be held untenable for the reasons stated in the opinion; and I further agree that the first ground must fail-but for reasons essentially different from those which the opinion announces.\n The first ground proceeds on the theory that the city is free to accord equal treatment to the two competitive businesses, but by its ordinance unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminates against the business of the appellant and in favor of its own business by subjecting the former to the tax and omitting or refusing to subject the latter to a like burden. It therefore is of first importance to ascertain what the ordinance provides and what are the \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 629]\n\u00a0\n circumstances which surrounded its adoption and in which it is to be applied.\n The ordinance was approved by the mayor May 25, 1932, and was to become effective July 1 of that year. It provides in section 2 that the word 'person' in the several sections shall be taken to include a corporation unless the context plainly shows otherwise; in subdivision (c) of section 5 that the tax shall be applied to 'every person engaged in or carrying on' the business of selling or furnishing electric light and power within the city; and in section 6 that subdivision (c) of section 5 'shall, as far as permitted by law, be applicable to the City of Seattle, except that said City shall not, as a taxpayer, be required to conform to the other provisions of this ordinance'-the 'other provisions' obviously being those which require sworn returns, application for license, etc.\n The electric light and power business of the appellant and the like business of the city have been and are highly competitive, and the the only ones in the field. Both had their inception in ordinances adopted in 1902-the one under which the city entered the field being a little older than the one granting the franchise under which the plaintiff has proceeded. Both businesses have been greatly extended and enlarged in relative keeping with the growth of the city.\n The city's business is conducted, as is required by statutory and charter provisions, as an independent unit distinct from all other activities of the city, whether governmental or proprietary; and the accounts, revenues, expenses and funds pertaining to the business are kept, handled and adjusted, as is similarily required, separately from other accounts, revenues, expenses and funds of the city. This independence and separation is not merely formal, but real and persistent. The city in its governmental capacity is a customer of its proprietary light \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 630]\n\u00a0\n and power business and obtains therefrom electric current needed for street lighting and other municipal purposes. For this current the city in its governmental capacity pays each year a sum which is determined after a public hearing in which all who are interested are given an opportunity to participate. The payment is effected by transferring money from the city's tax-supported general fund, which is devoted to government uses, to the separate fund into which the revenues of the proprietary light and power business are required to be paid. The amount to be paid for such current in 1932 was given in the city's budget as $438.750.\n The decisions of the Supreme Court of the state leave no doubt that the situation is as just stated. In Uhler v. City of Olympia, 87 Wash. 1, page 4, 151 P. 117, 118, 152 P. 998, which relates to a proposed city- owned water system designed to supply for hire both private and municipal needs, that court says: 'The revenues to be received under the plan proposed ... do not partake of the character of general funds, nor can the general fund be invaded if they are not sufficient;' and again (page 14 of 87 Wash., 151 P. 117, 121, 152 P. 998): 'The city, in meeting functions that are called governmental, is taking (water) from the city ... in its proprietary capacity; therefore the general fund of the city may be charged, and the special fund credited, with a reasonable charge for the water used (by the city), when it is so provided in the ordinance. The city, as a governmental entity, stands in the same relation to the system as a private citizen who is patronizing it.' And that court further holds that, while it is admissible under the laws of the state for a city to make 'temporary loans' from the tax-supported general fund to a special utility fund or vice versa, or from one special utility fund to another, if the borrowing fund is solvent and has an assured income from which repayment may be made, it is not admissible to \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 631]\n\u00a0\n make loans from one of these funds to another which is insolvent, or to make contributions or permanent diversions from one to another; and that attempted infractions of these restrictions may be prevented by injunction. Asia v. City of Seattle, 119 Wash. 674, 679, 680, 206 P. 366; Griffin v. City of Tacoma, 49 Wash. 524, 529, 95 P. 1107; Uhler v. City of Olympia, 87 Wash. 1, 7, 151 P. 117, 152 P. 998; Von Herberg v. City of Seattle, 157 Wash. 141, 147, 150, 151, 288 P. 646, 70 A.L.R. 417.\n Since 1916 the city has financed the extension and development of its electric light and power business by issuing and selling revenue bonds, without submitting the matter to the electorate or creating an indebtedness on the part of the city. The total of such bonds outstanding at the end of 1931 was approximately $32,000,000. By law and by their own terms these bonds are payable only from a bond fund specially created from revenues derived by the city from its electric light and power business.\n The appellant in its complaint alleges that the gross revenues of the business are, by law, underlying ordinances, and the terms of the bonds, pledged to the payment of the bonds, principal and interest; and that 'such pledge constitutes a charge upon such gross revenues prior and superior to all other charges whatsoever, including charges for maintenance and operation.' Counsel for the city, while not questioning the allegation in other respects, insist that under the applicable law the pledge is not of the gross revenues, but at most is only of what remains after paying costs of maintenance and operation, and that the tax in question, if laid on the city's business pursuant to the ordinance, may be paid from the gross revenues like other costs of maintenance and operation.\n Section 9491 of Remington's Revised Statutes of Washington, under which appellant alleges the bonds were issued, makes provision for setting aside and paying into a \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 632]\n\u00a0\n special bond fund 'any fixed proportion' or 'any fixed amount' of the 'gross revenues' from the business in aid of which bonds are issued, and for making the bonds payable 'only out of such special fund.' These provisions are followed by another in the same section declaring:\n'In creating any such special fund or funds the common council or other corporate authorities of such city or town shall havd due regard to the cost of operation and maintenance of the plant or system as constructed or added to, and to any proportion or part of the revenue previously pledged as a fund for the payment of bonds, warrants, or other indebtedness, and shall not set aside into such special fund a greater amount or proportion of the revenue and proceeds than in their judgment will be available over and above such cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue so previously pledged.'\n\n The charter of the city also contains a provision, section 18 ( fifteenth), enabling the city to establish, operate, and maintain a plant or system for furnishing electric power and light for industrial, individual, and municipal uses, 'and to provide and secure payment therefor in whole or in part by net earnings therefrom.'\n Section 9491, under which the appellant alleges the revenue bonds were issued, is not confined to enabling cities to supply an electric light and power service, but is also directed to enabling them through the issue of like bonds to supply a street railroad service or a water service. In 1919 the appellant, which then owned a street railroad system in Seattle as well as an electric light and power system, sold and transferred its street railroad system to the city and received in payment fifteen million dollars of revenue bonds with a supporting pledge like that which the appellant sets forth in its complaint in \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 633]\n\u00a0\n the present case. \n1\n Controversy soon arose as to whether that pledge includes the entire gross revenue of the street railroad system or only what remains after paying the cost of maintenance and operation; and much litigation ensued in which the appellant persistently sought to establish the broader construction of the pledge. \n2\n The litigation resulted in decisions recognizing and sustaining the pledge in several respects,3 but leaving undetermined the question whether it includes all of the gross revenue or only what is left after the cost of maintenance and operation is paid. The case of Von Herberg v. City of Seattle, 157 Wash. 141, 288 P. 646, 650, 70 A.L.R. 417, decided in 1930, appears to have been the last of the series. The appellant was a party and set up its contention as in the other cases. In concluding the decision, the court said: 'We accordingly express no opinion upon the question of whether or not wages and operating expenses of the street railway must be paid before the application of any money in the street railway fund to the payment of the bonds evidencing the purchase price of the system.'\n In view of that acute and undetermined controversy and its obvious bearing on the pledge given in support of the revenue bonds pertaining to the city's electric light and power business, it is easy to perceive why the city in adopting the ordinance of 1932 and providing in section 6 that the tax should be applicable to the city's business inserted the words 'as far as permitted by law.' Evi- \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 634]\n\u00a0\n dently the city understood that, if the entire gross revenue from the business was pledged, it might be for that reason unable to pay out any part of the revenue for another purpose. It also is easy to perceive that the appellant, by reason of its interest in the street railroad revenue bonds, may have regarded the present suit as a suitable vehicle for getting its contention respecting such a pledge before a court and possibly establishing indirectly what it had been unable to establish through its earlier and direct efforts. Certainly the appellant could not reasonably have expected to enhance its chances of success in the present suit by introducing such a contention respecting the pledge given in support of the electric light and power revenue bonds.\n Of the circumstances in which the ordinance was adopted and of the provision in section 6 declaring the tax applicable to the city's business, the state court said in the present suit:\n'The city, in its proprietary capacity, is in competition with appellant in the power and light business. The possible consequences to appellant, if it is subjected to an excise of 3 per cent. on its gross revenues, while its competitor escapes the burden, are too obvious for discussion. Evidently having such consequences in mind, the city council, by virtue of section 6 of the ordinance, has undertaken to subject the city's power and light business to the tax imposed upon persons and corporations engaging in that business. This is merely a more or less friendly gesture. The city has not allocated, and probably cannot allocate, any of the revenues of its power and light business to the payment of such a tax. Bonds have been issued in excess of $30,000,000 against the revenues from that business; and those bonds are a prior lien on the entire income from it-taking precedence even over operating charges.' \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 635]\n\u00a0\n Counsel differ widely respecting so much of this excerpt as speaks of the existing pledge as an obstacle to applying the tax to the city's business. Counsel for the city say this statement rests only on an allegation in the appellant's complaint and was made in the absence of a full presentation of the matter and without intention to render a decision thereon; and they present arguments and citations giving color to their assertion. On the other hand, counsel for the appellant insist the statement is decisive, and point to its letter as justifying them in so insisting. It is obvious that the statement, when separately considered, makes strongly for the latter view; but, when it is read in connection with prior decisions, which it does not mention, and with charter and statutory provisions, which are not noticed, there arises a real doubt whether it was made as a decisive utterance or as a recital of what was alleged and only assumed to be true. \n4\n This is a matter on which only the state court can speak with ultimate authority; and as its solution, as will appear later on, is not essential for present purposes, it properly may be put to one side. When this is done, the appellant's charge of unreasonable discrimination amounting to a denial of equal protection needs to be examined with three suggested views of the existing pledge in mind-one treating it as including only the net revenues from the city's business, as the city asserts; another treating it as including the entire gross revenues, but subject to payment therefrom of any tax lawfully imposed on the city's business; and still another treating it as including the entire gross revenues and preventing, by reason of the contract clause of the Constitution, payment therefrom of the tax named in the ordinance, as the appellant insists. \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 636]\n\u00a0\n The ordinance, in section 6, provides that the tax 'shall, as far as permitted by law, be applicable' to the city's proprietary business. Unless the pledge be in the way, it is plain that there is no legal obstacle to carrying this provision into effect. \n5\n The state court does not suggest the presence of any other obstacle; and counsel for the appellant do not show that there is any. On the other hand, counsel for the city concede that the ordinance imposes the tax on the city's business and assert the city's willingness to pay the tax out of the gross revenues from that business.\n\n True, the appellant alleges in its complaint that the city budget for 1932 did not allocate any of the revenues from the city's business for such payment. But this allegation is of no significance. As counsel for the city point out, the budget was adopted late in 1931, while the taxing ordinance was not adopted until May 25, 1932, and did not become effective until July 1 of that year. Appellant's complaint was filed shortly after the ordinance became effective and before the time fixed for making up and settling another budget.\n In view of the terms of the ordinance and of the city's attitude declared by its counsel, it is manifest that, if the pledge be only of the net revenues, the tax falls on \n\n[291 U.S. 619, 637]\n\u00a0\n the city's business just as on the other, and that the charge of unreasonable discrimination is without any basis.\n If the pledge be of the gross revenues, but subject to payment therefrom of any tax lawfully laid on the city's business, thereby leaving the city free to pay the tax imposed by the ordinance out of such revenues, it still is manifest that the ordinance treats both businesses alike, and therefore that there is no discrimination.\n If the pledge be of the entire gross revenues and, by reason of the contract clause of the Constitution, prevents the application of part of the revenues to the payment of the tax, it is very plain that such discrimination as results is neither arbitrary on the part of the city nor within the condemnation of the equal protection clause. The contract clause and the equal protection clause are both parts of the Constitution; and of course action taken or omitted in obedience to the contract clause cannot be regarded as a violation of the equal protection clause. Nor does the latter clause require that a right or exemption which under the other clause must be accorded to a particular business be also accorded to a similar business not otherwise entitled to it. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n It follows that in none of the suggested views of the pledge can the appellant's charge of unreasonable discrimination be sustained. And, this being so, there is no need for now considering which of the suggested views of the pledge is right.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n292 \nU.S. 603\n, 54 S.Ct. 712, 78 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Twichell v.

UNITED STATES(1934)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howe P. Cochran, James S.Y. Ivins, and Frederick S. Winston, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon the footing of an account stated the petitioner sues the Government for taxes overpaid.\n Income and profits tax returns for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1917, were filed by the taxpayer in September, 1917. The tax shown by these returns as well as by amended returns for the same year was paid in full.\n Income and profits tax returns for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1918, were filed in October, 1918, and again the tax was promptly paid.\n Following the practice of the Bureau, the Commissioner proceeded to audit the returns to the end that the assessments might be increased or reduced according to the facts.\n In February, 1921, the taxpayer signed and filed a waiver of any statutory period of limitation as to the assessment and collection of the tax for the calendar year \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 57]\n\u00a0\n 1917. It did this in order to be assured that the audit by the Commissioner would be deliberate and thorough. In the absence of such a consent the period of limitation would have expired in April, 1923. The extension was approved in writing by the Commissioner in February, 1923. The waiver on its face had no limit in respect of time, but under a regulation adopted in April, 1923, it spent its force on April 1, 1924, unless continued or renewed.\n In February, 1923, the taxpayer signed a second waiver applicable to the fiscal years 1917 and 1918, and extending the period for collection until March 1, 1925. This waiver was not signed by the Commissioner within the term of its duration, though it was signed, years afterwards, on April 7, 1930. However, in June, 1923, while both waivers were on file, the Commissioner made an additional assessment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1917, and on the attached assessment list wrote the word 'waiver' opposite the item affecting the petitioner. The additional assessment for 1917 was reduced by a credit of an overassessment for 1916, and when so reduced amounted to $20,757.14. Payment of this amount was demanded by the collector on August 3, 1923\n\n\n On August 9, 1923, the petitioner filed a claim for refund and credit of income taxes alleged to have been overpaid for the fiscal years 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1921, amounting in the aggregate to $35,727.10, and asked that the unpaid balance for 1917 be set off against the claim for overpayment and that the remainder be refunded. At that time it was the practice of the collector's office to treat such a claim as a stay of collection of unpaid taxes against which the credit was asked, until the Commissioner had considered and adjusted the claim.\n On March 1, 1924, the Commissioner approved a schedule of overassessments which included an overassessment in favor of the petitioner for the fiscal year ending July \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 58]\n\u00a0\n 31, 1918, in the sum of $14,928.07, and sent this schedule to the collector for action in accordance with the directions appearing thereon. On June 12, 1924, the collector, following these instructions, signed and returned the schedule to the Commissioner, together with a schedule of refunds and credits, certifying the application of $14,928.07 as a credit. On June 28, 1924, the Commissioner signed the schedule of refunds and credits, by which act for the first time he definitively announced his allowance of the claim. Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 46 S.Ct. 229; United States v. Swift & Co., \n282 \nU.S. 468, 475\n, 51 S.Ct. 202. Before doing this, and on or after March 1, 1924, he had transmitted to the petitioner a certificate of overassessment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1918, in the sum of $14, 928.07, which sum was credited in June upon the taxes overdue. This overassessment for 1918, applied as a credit upon the unpaid tax for 1917 ($ 20,757.14), reduced the liability of the taxpayer to $5,829.07. Demand for the payment of this balance with accrued interest was made by the collector on September 1, 1924. Two weeks later, the petitioner complied with the demand, accepting without protest the application of the credit, and paying the resulting balance.\n For nearly six years the transaction was allowed to stand unopened and unchallenged. In April, 1930, the petitioner learned through an attorney that the second waiver had not been signed by the Commissioner until after it had expired. With this knowledge it filed with the Commissioner a claim for refund of the overpaid tax for 1918 ($14,928.07) which had been collected through application as a credit upon the tax for the year before. The basis for the claim was this, that at the time of the credit the first waiver had expired, that the second waiver was ineffective because not signed by the Commissioner, that collection by credit after the term of limitation was as much prohibited as collection at such a time by suit \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 59]\n\u00a0\n or by distraint, and hence that the overpaid tax certified by the Commissioner in the schedule of overassessment was an undischarged indebtedness, still owing from the Government. Four days later this action was begun. The Court of Claims gave judgment in favor of the Government (2 F.Supp. 773), and a writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n\n 1. \nAuditing the tax for 1918 and crediting the overassessment for that year upon the tax for the year before, the Commissioner acted at the request of the petitioner, which was valid till revoked.\n For the decision of this case we do not need to rule whether a 'waiver' by a taxpayer consenting to the enlargement of the time for assessment or collection is ineffective unless approved by the Commissioner in writing. \n1\n There was here more than a waiver, an abandonment of a privilege to insist upon the fulfillment of a condition ( Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270, 275\n, 276 S., 51 S.Ct. 145; Florsheim Bros. Co. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 50 S.Ct. 215); there was a positive request, which till revoked upon reasonable notice had the effect of an estoppel.\n On August 3, 1923, the collector made demand upon the petitioner for the payment of $20,757.14, the tax balance then due for the year 1917. There is no dispute that the demand was timely, and that collection would have been enforced unless the taxpayer had done something to postpone the hour of payment. Waivers were then on file, one of them signed by the Commissioner, the other unsigned, but the petitioner did not rest upon these, nor would these without more have availed to avert the threatened levy. On August 9, 1923, the petitioner filed with the Commissioner a request to withhold the \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 60]\n\u00a0\n process of collection until credits were adjusted. In substance the request was this: Please do not collect the tax for 1917, until you have completed the audit for the years 1918 to 1921 inclusive, and if there has been overassessment for those years, set it off as a credit.\n Now, the time for assessment and collection of the 1921 tax did not expire till 1925, and this without the aid of any waiver or extension. In such circumstances, request by the taxpayer that the Commissioner withhold collection for 1917 until there had been an audit of the tax for 1921 was at least equivalent to a request that he delay until the assessment for 1921 was due under the statute. But before that time arrived, i.e., before 1925, the Commissioner had acted. On March 1, 1924, he had completed the reaudit, and had discovered an overassessment for one of the years covered by the petitioner's request. Within a reasonable time thereafter (June 12, 1924) he had received from the collector a report that $20,757.14 was still unpaid upon the tax for 1917. Promptly thereafter (June 28, 1924), he had complied with the petitioner's instructions by offsetting the overpayment for the one year in reduction of the balance owing for the other. The whole process had been completed within the time fixed by implication in the petitioner's request, within the time when assessment was due for the last of the group of years (1918 to 1921) to be covered by the audit.\n The petitioner makes the point that by the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. c. 852, pp. 791, 875,  609 (26 USCA  2609)), a credit against a liability in respect of any taxable year shall be 'void' if it has been made against a liability barred by limitation. The aim of that provision, as we view it, was to invalidate such a credit if made by the Commissioner of his own motion without the taxpayer's approval or with approval falling short of inducement or request. Cf. Stange v. United States, supra; Revenue Act of 1928,  506(b), (c), 45 Stat. c. 852, pp. 791, 870, 871 (26 USCA  1062a and  1060 note). If nothing \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 61]\n\u00a0\n more than this appeared, there was to be no exercise in invitum of governmental power. But the aim of the statute suggests a restraint upon its meaning. To know whether liability has been barred by limitation it will not do to refer to the flight of time alone. The limitation may have been postponed by force of a simple waiver, which must then be made in adherence to the statutory forms, or so we now assume. It may have been postponed by deliberate persuasion to withhold official action. We think it an unreasonable construction that would view the prohibition of the statute as overriding the doctrine of estoppel (Randon v. Toby, 11 How. 493, 519) and invalidating a credit made at the taxpayer's request. Here at the time of the request, the liability was still alive, unaffected as yet by any statutory bar. The request in its fair meaning reached forward into the future and prayed for the postponement of collection till the audits for later years had been completed in the usual course. This having been done, the suspended collection might be effected by credit or by distraint or by other methods prescribed by law. Congress surely did not mean that a credit was to be void if made by the Government in response to such a prayer.\n The applicable principle is fundamental and unquestioned. 'He who prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself of the nonperformance which he has himself occasioned, for the law says to him, in effect: 'This is your own act, and therefore you are not damnified.\" Dolan v. Rodgers, 149 N.Y. 489, 491, 44 N.E. 167; and Imperator Realty Co. v. Tull, 228 N.Y. 447, 457, 127 N.E. 263; quoting West v. Blakeway, 2 Man . & G. 729, 751. Sometimes the resulting disability has been characterized as an estoppel, sometimes as a waiver. The label counts for little. Enough for present purposes that the disability has its roots in a principle more nearly ultimate than either waiver or estoppel, the principle that no one \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 62]\n\u00a0\n shall be permitted to found any claim upon his own inequity or take advantage of his own wrong. Imperator Realty Co. v. Tull, supra. A suit may not be built on an omission induced by him who sues. Swain v. Seamens, 9 Wall. 254, 274; United States v. Peck, \n102 U.S. 64\n; Thomson v. Poor, 147 N.Y. 402, 42 N.E. 13; New Zealand Shipping Co. v. Socie te des Ateliers, (1919) A. C. 1, 6; Williston, Contracts, vol. 2 ,  689, 692.\n\n 2. \nIf we assume in favor of the petitioner that the credit is a nullity in the absence of a written waiver, approved by the Commissioner, the record supports the inference that at the time of the set-off such approval had been given.\n The statute provides that no suit or proceeding shall be begun for the collection of the tax after the expiration of five years succeeding the filing of the return 'unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection.' Revenue Act of 1921,  250(d), 42 Stat. c. 136, pp. 227, 264, 265. In this case, consent by the taxpayer in due form is found and indeed conceded. The only question is whether there was consent by the Commissioner. But the statute does not say that the evidence of consent shall be embodied in a single paper. Cf. Eclipse Lawn Mower Co. v. United States (Ct. Cl.) 1 F. Supp. 768. Its one requirement in respect of form is that the consent shall be in writing. Sabin v. United States, 44 F.(2d) 70, 70 Ct.Cl. 574. There is left a wide range of administrative discretion. Any writing, formal or informal, is sufficient if made for the purpose of recording the Commissioner's approval, and if approval may be gathered therefrom as a reasonable inference.\n The burden was on the petitioner, seeking a refund of its tax, to prove its allegation that the overassessment for 1918 had been illegally credited upon the tax for 1917. \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 63]\n\u00a0\n At the outset it might have stood upon the fact that the credit had been made after the normal term of limitation, casting the burden on the Government of going forward with evidence in proof of an extension. When its own waiver had been proved, however, the case took on another aspect. At that stage the presumption of official regularity was sufficient to sustain the inference that the Commissioner on his side had done whatever was appropriate to give support to his own act and thus validate the credit. Acts done by a public officer 'which presuppose the existence of other acts to make them legally operative, are presumptive proofs of the latter.' Bank of the United States v. Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 64, 70; United States v. Royer, \n268 \nU.S. 394, 398\n, 45 S.Ct. 519; Knox County v. Ninth National Bank, \n147 \nU.S. 91, 97\n, 13 S.Ct. 267; Mandeville v. Reynolds, 68 N.Y. 528, 534; Demings v. Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias, 131 N.Y. 522, 527, 30 N.E. 572; Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 5,  2524. No doubt the presumption of regularity is subject to be rebutted. It stands until dislodged.\n Now, the petitioner has failed to show that the Commissioner did not approve in writing. On the contrary the evidence is persuasive that he did. A certificate of an additional assessment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1917, was signed, as we have seen, on June 26, 1923; and on the assessment list attached thereto, opposite the entry of the assessment against the petitioner, the following appears: '7\/31\/17 Fisc. 1753361. O.L. 4\/17\/23; waiver.' The Commissioner did not sign his name below the memorandum, but the memorandum was attached to a certificate which the Commissioner did sign, and his name subscribed to the certificate authenticates also the documents attached to it, if we assume in favor of the petitioner that signing is essential. The Court of Claims was of the opinion that the word 'waiver' on this list had relation to \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 64]\n\u00a0\n the second of the two consents on file with the Commissioner. The context and the circumstances lend support to that conclusion. The fiscal year for the petitioner ended July 31. Probably through inadvertence, the first waiver refers to a tax for the calendar year ending December 31. This might have seemed to exclude the first six months of the year ending July 31, 1917, i.e., the period from July 31, 1916 to January 1 following. We do not say that the courts would uphold so literal a construction. Almost certainly the objection, if made, would be put aside as hypercritical. See 39 Stat. c. 463, p. 770,  13. Even so, the memorandum may well be allocated to the waiver that fits it precisely in preference to the one that fits it imperfectly. We turn, then, to the documents in order to relate them to one another. If we look only to its letter, the memorandum does not refer to a waiver for the calendar year ending December 31, 1917. It refers, on the contrary, to a waiver for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1917 (7\/31\/17). The only waiver corresponding to this description in form as well as in substance is the one filed with the Commissioner February 19, 1923, which covers the year ending July 31, 1917, as well as the year after.\n The inference, therefore, is legitimate that the second of the two waivers is the one that the Commissioner had in view when he wrote this memorandum indicative of assent. At the very least the effect of the entry is to leave the purpose of the writer doubtful. Choice between two doubts should be made in such a way as to favor the presumption of official regularity.\n\n 3. \nThe petitioner has failed to make out the existence of an account stated for its benefit, and its claim, even if otherwise valid, is barred by limitation.\n Payment of the tax for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1918, was made by the petitioner, partly in 1918, and \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 65]\n\u00a0\n partly in 1919. Five years from the date of payment, a statute of limitations set up a bar to a suit for the recovery of the tax on the ground of illegal assessment or collection. R.S.  3226; 26 U.S.C.  156 ( 26 USCA  156); Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 51 S.Ct. 395. The petitioner, conceding this, maintains that in June, 1924, there was a statement of an account, giving rise to a new cause of action with a new term of limitation. Daube v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 367, 370\n, 53 S.Ct. 597; Bonwit Teller & Co. v. United States, supra. This suit was not brought till May, 1930. In the absence of an account stated in its favor the petitioner must fail.\n A recent judgment of this court recalls the essentials of an account stated as they were long ago defined. Daube v. United States, supra. A balance must have been struck in such circumstances as to import a promise of payment on the one side and acceptance on the other. But plainly no such promise is a just or reasonable inference from the certificate of overassessment delivered to this taxpayer, if the certificate is interpreted in the setting of the occasion. The taxpayer knew that the Commissioner had been requested, after determining the overassessment, to set it off against the tax for an earlier year. The taxpayer knew also that the set-off or credit would not appear on the face of the certificate of overassessment, knew also that it had signed a formal and later document, the schedule of refunds and credits. The diverse functions of these documents were pointed out by this court in United States v. Swift & Co., \n282 \nU.S. 468, 475\n, 51 S.Ct. 202, and Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 46 S.Ct. 229. The taxpayer payer knew also that it had signed a formal waiver extending the term of collection until March, 1925, and it had no reason to believe that this waiver had not been signed by the Commissioner, if it be assumed for present purposes that such a signature was necessary. \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 66]\n\u00a0\n Plainly, in such circumstances the certificate of overassessment without more does not import a promise by the Commissioner to refund the amount there certified instead of applying it as a credit upon the tax of an earlier year. At most the promise to be implied is one to refund the excess after there has been a computation of the taxes unpaid for other years and an ascertainment of the balance. The statement of the account is not unconditional and definitive. It is provisional and tentative. Finality was lacking until there was an agreement as to credits. Newburger- Morris Co. v. Talcott, 219 N.Y. 505, 512, 114 N.E. 846, 3 A.L.R. 287.\n The events that followed confirm this interpretation of the effect of the transaction. Upon a computation of the credits the final balance was ascertained to be in favor of the Government. The balance thereby fixed was reported to the taxpayer. After the schedule of refunds and credits had been signed by the Commissioner, the collector transmitted to the taxpayer a new statement of account by which it was clearly made to appear that the overassessment had been credited upon the tax for 1917, and that after such credit there was still owing from the taxpayer a balance of $5, 829.07, which, together with the accrued interest, was thereupon collected. Then for the first time was there a final ascertainment of the balance upon consideration of both sides of the account, the debits and the credits. The taxpayer did not object to the account as submitted in its final form. Far from objecting, it paid the resulting balance, and by this act as well as by silence conceded the indebtedness. Indeed there was more than an account stated; by force of voluntary payment there was also an account settled. Lockwood v. Thorne, 18 N.Y. 285, 292. The statute of limitations is a bar to the recovery by the petitioner of the balance paid to the Government upon the demand of the collector. \n\n[291 U.S. 54, 67]\n\u00a0\n This is not disputed. It is equally a bar to the recovery of any item that entered into the account and determined the balance as thus definitively adjusted.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Commissioner v.

Darby, Jr., of New York City, and Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N.J., for petitioners.\n Mr. William H. Davis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners, assignees of two patents, Nos. 1,507,016 and 1,507, 017, granted to Lee De Forest on September 2, 1924, have sued to restrain an infringement and for other relief.\n The respondent, defendant in the trial court, admits the infringement if the patents are valid, but maintains that they are void in that they were issued to a patentee who was not the first inventor.\n Long before this suit the rival claimants to the invention, Armstrong and De Forest, had fought out between themselves the legal battle now renewed. The outcome of their contest was a decree whereby priority of invention was found in accordance with the patents now assailed by the respondent, a decree binding on the claimants and their several asignees. For the purpose of any controversy between Armstrong and De Forest, the validity of the patents must be accepted as a datum. Even for the purpose of a controversy with strangers, there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence. The question is whether the respondent has sustained that heavy burden. \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n At the outset there were four claimants to priority of title. All four, acting independently, had made the same or nearly the same discovery at times not widely separate. The prize of an exclusive patent falls to the one who had the fortune to be first. Du Bois v. Kirk, \n158 \nU.S. 58, 66\n, 15 S.Ct. 729; Evans v. Eaton, 3 Wheat. 454. The others gain nothing for all their toil and talents. Of the four claimants Langmuir filed an application for a patent on October 29, 1913, claiming August 1, 1913, as the date of his invention. Armstrong filed an application on October 29, 1913, and a second one on December 18, 1913, fixing the date of his invention as the fall of 1912 or the beginning of 1913. As early as October 6, 1914, he received a patent covering the subject-matter of his first application (patent No. 1,113,149), but not the subject-matter of his second. Meissner filed an application on March 16, 1914, fixing the date of his invention as April 9, 1913. De Forest filed an application on March 20, 1914, and another on September 23, 1915, fixing as the date of his invention August 6, 1912, the earliest date of all, which would make him the first inventor if the claim could be made good.\n Interferences were declared by the Patent Office as the result of these conflicting applications. One involved the applications of De Forest and Langmuir; another the applications of De Forest, Langmuir, and Meissner; a third the applications by De Forest, Langmuir, and Meissner and also the second one of Armstrong's, the only one of his then pending. While these interferences were still undecided, Armstrong and his assignee brought suit for the infringement of patent No. 1,113,149, which had been issued to him in October, 1914, the defendant in that suit being the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company. The District Court (per Mayer, J.) fixed the date of Armstrong's discovery as January 31, 1913, rejected De Forest's claim to discovery on August 6, 1912, and gave \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n an interlocutory decree for an injunction and an accounting. 279 F. 445. The Circuit Court of Appeals per Manton, J.) affirmed. 280 F. 584. In the meanwhile the interference proceedings went on in the Patent Office. On March 31, 1923, the Commissioner of Patents rendered a decision which gave priority to Armstrong. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, invested at that time with supervisory jurisdiction in the administration of the patent laws. Butterworth v. U.S. ex rel. Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 5 S.Ct. 25; Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 284 71 L.Ed. 478. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Commissioner, and decreed priority of invention in favor of De Forest. 54 App.D.C. 391, 298 F. 1006. On September 2, 1924, pursuant to the mandate of that court, patents Nos. 1, 507,016 and 1,507,017 were issued by the Patent Office.\n The fight was far from ended. Already there was pending in the District Court in Delaware a suit brought under the authority of R.S.  4915 (35 U.S.C.  63 (35 USCA  63))1 to direct the issuing of a patent to Meissner or his assigns. After the decree in the District of Columbia, there was a suit in Pennsylvania under R.S.  4918 (35 U.S.C.  66 (35 USCA  66)),2 \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n which was brought by the assignee of the De Forest patents to set aside the Armstrong patent of October, 1914 (No. 1,113,149), all the interested parties being joined as defendants. Later on there was still another suit in Delaware, under R.S.  4915, to establish priority for Langmuir. The suit in Pennsylvania came to a decree in July, 1926. The decision was in favor of De Forest ((D.C.) 13 F.(2d) 1014), the court adjudging that the holder of the Armstrong patent had failed to overcome the presumption of validity attaching to the De Forest patents under the administrative ruling in the District of Columbia, and that the earlier decision in New York (279 F. 445, 280 F. 584) did not sustain the defense of res judicata for the reason that the cause had never gone to final judgment. In February and March. 1927, the two suits in Delaware were decided the same way. (D.C.) 18 F.(2d) 338; (D.C.) 18 F.(2d) 345. The decrees in the three suits came up for review before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. All three were affirmed with a comprehensive opinion by Woolley, J., marshaling the evidence and weighing the competing arguments. As the upshot the court held that the presumption of validity which protected the De Forest patents had not been overthrown, and that apart from any presumption De Forest had made out his title as the original inventor. 21 F.(2d) 918. Writs of certiorari brought the controversy here. \n278 \nU.S. 562\n, 49 S.Ct. 34. This court affirmed the decree on the authority of Morgan v. Daniels, \n153 \nU.S. 120\n, 14 S.Ct. 772, and Victor Talking Machine Co. v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., \n273 \nU.S. 670\n, 47 S. Ct. 474. The first of those cases lays down the rule \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n that 'where the question decided in the patent office is one between contesting parties as to priority of invention, the decision there made must be accepted as controlling upon that question of fact in any subsequent suit between the same parties, unless the contrary is established by testimony which in character and amount carries thorough conviction.' 153 U.S. at page 125, 14 S.Ct. 772, 773. The second case (\n273 \nU.S. 670\n, 47 S.Ct. 474) adds to that presumption of validity the support of the familiar principle, repeatedly applied in our decisions, that the concurrent findings of the courts below will be accepted by this court 'unless clear error is shown.' See, e.g., United States v. State Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 211\n, 44 S.Ct. 289, 290; Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 558\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; United States v. Commercial Credit Co., \n286 \nU.S. 63, 67\n, 52 S.Ct. 467.\n One might have supposed that controversy would have been stilled after all these years of litigation. It proved to be not so. The petitioners, after repelling every assault from within the ranks of rival claimants, found it necessary to meet a challenge from without. The respondent, Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., allying itself with Armstrong, who is paying its expenses, insists that the invention is at large for the reason that De Forest, who received the patents, is not the true inventor, and that Armstrong, who is the inventor, is barred by a final judgment, conclusive between himself and the pretender, from obtaining the patent that is due him, and with it an exclusive right. The evidence in this suit for an infringement is a repetition, word for word, of the evidence in the earlier suits, so far as material to the conflicting claims of Armstrong and De Forest. What has been added is so nearly negligible that to all intents and purposes the records are the same. The District Court (per Campbell, J.) held upon that evidence that the respondent had not succeeded in overcoming the De Forest patents, and entered a decree for the complainants. 1 F.Supp. 65. Upon \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the decree was reversed by a divided court with instructions to dismiss the bill. 66 F.( 2d) 768. A majority of the court adhered to the conclusion which it had announced eleven years before. 280 F. 584. A dissenting opinion enforced the view that De Forest's title as inventor, conclusively established as between himself and Armstrong, should be held, upon substantially the same record, to be good also against others. A writ of certiorari issued from this court. \n290 \nU.S. 624\n, 54 S.Ct. 373.\n The judgments in the suits between Armstrong and De Forest and their respective assignees are not conclusive upon the respondent, a stranger to the record. This is so by force of the accepted limitations of the doctrine of res judicata. It is so by force of the statute (R.S.  4918), which provides in so many words that 'no such judgment or adjudication shall affect the right of any person except the parties to the suit and those deriving title under them subsequent to the rendition of such judgment.' But the respondent does not move very far upon the pathway to success by showing that what has been heretofore determined is without conclusive force. A patent regularly issued, and even more obviously a patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants, is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error. The force of that presumption has found varying expression in this and other courts. Sometimes it is said that in a suit for infringement, when the defense is a prior invention, 'the burden of proof to make good this defense' is 'upon the party setting it up,' and 'every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him.' Cantrell v. Wallick, \n117 \nU.S. 689, 695\n, 696 S., 6 S.Ct. 970, 974; Coffin v. Ogden, 18 Wall. 120, 124; The Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 285\n, 12 S.Ct. 450; Washburn v. Gould, Fed. Cas. No. 17,214, 3 Story, 122, 142; H. J. Heinz Co. v. Cohn (C.C.A.) 207 F. 547, 554; Detroit Motor Appliance Co. v. Burke (D.C.) 4 \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n F.(2d) 118, 122; Wilson & Willard Mfg. Co. v. Bole (C.C.A.) 227 F. 607, 609; Stoody Co. v. Mills Alloys, Inc. (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 807, 809; cf. Morgan v. Daniels, supra, at page 123 of 153 U.S., 14 S.Ct. 772, Again it is said that 'the presumption of the validity of the patent is such that the defense of invention by another must be established by the clearest proof- perhaps beyond reasonable doubt.' Austin Machinery Co. v. Buckeye Traction Ditcher Co. (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 697, 700. The context suggests that in these and like phrases the courts were not defining a standard in terms of scientific accuracy or literal precision, but were offering counsel and suggestion to guide the course of judgment. Through all the verbal variances, however, there runs this common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance. Cf., Philippine Sugar E.D. Co. v. Philippine Islands, \n247 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 38 S.Ct. 513. If that is true where the assailant connects himself in some way with the title of the true inventor, it is so a fortiori where he is a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of his own. If it is true where the assailant launches his attack with evidence different, at least in form, from any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent, it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is even verbally the same. From all this it results that a stranger to a patent suit does not avoid altogether the consequences of a judgment rendered in his absence by establishing his privilege under the doctrine of res judicata to try the issues over again. If he has that opportunity and there is substantial identity of evidence, he may find that the principle of adherence to precedent will bring him out at the end where he would be if he had been barred at the beginning. Cf., National Folding-Box & Paper Co. v. American Paper Pail & Box Co. (C.C.) 48 \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n F. 913; Rousso v. First Nat. Bank (C.C.A.) 37 F.(2d) 281; Cary v. Domestic Spring-Bed Co. (C.C.) 27 F. 299; 3 Robinson, Patents,  1017\n\n\n This court in affirming the decrees in favor of De Forest did not say out and out that it would have reached the same conclusion upon the issue of priority if it had been itself the trier of the facts. It did, however, say in substance that Armstrong had failed to establish his own superior right by evidence sufficient to carry thorough conviction to the mind ( Morgan v. Daniels, supra), or by evidence of manifest error in the findings of the courts below. We do not need to go into the question whether Morgan v. Daniels is applicable in all its force unless the parties to the later suit were parties also to the contest in the administrative proceeding. There are statements in the opinion (153 U.S. at pages 124, 125, 14 S.Ct. 772) with reference to the analogy between a patent and a judgment that presuppose, perhaps, identity of parties. Cf., Rousso v. Barber (C.C.A.) 3 F.(2d) 740; Rousso v. First Nat. Bank, supra. Be that as it may, the requirement of evidence sufficient to carry conviction to the mind is little more than another form of words for the requirement that the presumption of validity shall prevail against strangers as well as parties unless the countervailing evidence is clear and satisfactory. Nice distinctions are suggested between the application of these principles by the court that finds the facts and their application by the court that sits as a reviewing body, though we know that an appeal in equity imports a broad power of revision. Conceivably, we are told, a court might have a clear conviction that the validity of a patent had been successfully impeached, if it were passing upon the issue unhampered by the views of others, and yet the conviction might not be clear enough to overthrow a holding to the contrary approved by other \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n judges. Gradations of difference so subtle are not susceptible of pursuit without leading us into a land of shadows. This court held the view when these patents were last before it that the evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of their validity in any clear or certain way. If our estimate of probative values had been different, the invention must have gone to Armstrong, no matter though other courts or administrative officers had been persuaded to the contrary. The evidence that was insufficient at that time to evoke a clear conviction that the patents were invalid is the same in all essentials as the evidence before us now. We must pronounce a like decree unless we are prepared to say in the light of fuller argument that the first decree was wrong.\n The record has been re-examined patiently without inducing that persuasion. After all that has been written about the De Forest patents in these many years of litigation, there is no need to fill the pages of our reports with an analysis of the opposing arguments as if we were a court of first instance trying the controversy anew. For present purposes it is enough to bring out into sharp relief a few considerations of dominating significance. Patent No. 1,507,017 is for an invention known as a 'feed- back circuit' and patent No. 1,507,016 for an invention known as the audion 'oscillator.' The two, however, are closely associated, for the oscillator can be produced only by use of the feed-back circuit, though the feed-back circuit can be used without producing an oscillator. As far back as 1908, De Forest had received a patent for a form of vacuum tube to which he gave the name of 'audion.' The Fleming vacuum tube in use up to that time had in it a metallic filament, which was electrically heated to incandescence through an input circuit, and a cold metallic plate to which electrons were trans- \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n mitted from the filament, passing from the plate to another or output circuit. De Forest's 'audion' changed the Fleming tube by interposing a special wire known as the 'grid' between the filament and the plate, thereby increasing its capacity as a detector of waves of radio or inaudible frequency and serving better to transform them into waves of audible frequency.\n The device established itself almost at once as a revolutionary improvement in the art of transmitting sounds at great distances by wire and through the air. At the beginning, however, its potencies were not fully appreciated by electrical experts, not even by its inventor. Many experiments were made with a view to exploring its capacities and developing them. Among those interested and curious was Armstrong, then a very young man, a student in the school of electrical engineering at Columbia University. He conceived the idea about January, 1913, that through a hook-up or coupling of the output and the input circuit there would be a feed-back or regeneration of energy whereby the plate in the audion would become an independent generator of continuous oscillations. Tuning the circuit to the appropriate frequency, he found that the messages communicated through the antenna of a radio station were heard with a new clearness. Signals from distant lands were borne to him across the seas.\n It was a brilliant conception, but another creative mind, working independently, had developed it before in designs and apparatus till then unknown to the art. De Forest with his assistant Van Etten had been working during the summer of 1912 along two lines of thought. One was the use of the audion as a telephone repeater to amplify weak telephone currents and thus facilitate the transmission of long distance messages. The other was its development as a generator of alternating currents for any and all uses, some perhaps indefinite, that were capable of \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n being served by oscillations thus produced. On August 6, 1912, a diagram showing a feed-back hook-up of the input and output circuits is recorded in Van Etten's notebook with a note that by the use of the coupling 'a beautiful clear tone' had been developed, which means that oscillations had been produced and that the oscillations were sustained. There is also a note that the pitch, i.e., the frequency, was varied by altering the plate voltage, which means, or was understood, we are told, by De Forest to mean, that by other simple adjustments the frequency of the oscillations could be varied at will. Armstrong does not deny that all this was done just as stated by De Forest. Indeed the authenticity of the notebook entries has never been disputed through the many phases of the controversy. What Armstrong does deny is that anything done or recorded in August, 1912, is an anticipation of his own invention. He says that the sustained oscillations generated at that time were of audio and not of radio frequency, and this, it seems, is admitted. He says there was then no perception or thought that the audion plate could be made to oscillate at radio as well as audible frequencies through a coupling of the circuits. This De Forest denies. He maintains, with the backing of other witnesses, that upon discovering the effect of the feed-back in generating sustained oscillations of the plate, he understood at once that by controlling the inductance or capacity in the oscillating circuit he could also control the frequency. This, he says in substance, must have been obvious upon reflection to any competent electrician, though there would be need of a certain amount of adjustment and experiment in substituting the correct inductance or capacity, a process, it is argued, that would be well within the ability of any one skillful in the art. Beyond this he insists that having discovered the generative virtue of the feed-back, he was not confined in his invention to the uses then developed, but if his patent \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n claims were broad enough was entitled to the benefit of other and related uses made manifest thereafter.\n We think that for all these contentions of De Forest adequate support exists in the record and the law. There is evidence that in August, 1912, he discussed with his assistants the possibility of using sustained oscillations of the audion in generating and transmitting radio waves as well as those of audio frequency. There is evidence that intermittently in 1913 he worked upon that theory, and particularly that on April 17 of that year at Palo Alto, Cal., he received a clear note, the true heterodyne beat note, from the radio signal station at San Francisco Beach with the aid of the coupled circuits. The entry in his notebook made the same day tells us, 'This day I got the long looked for beat note.' This was long before he had heard of Armstrong or of like experiments by any one. There is evidence that in the early part of 1914, he renewed his investigation in that field of research, after being temporarily diverted, and finally on February 27, 1941, recorded in his notebook, as the outcome of a number of experiments, that he had 'full proof that the audion acts as a generator of high frequency currents.'\n True there are circumstances that have been thought to bear against him. Thus, in December, 1913, he read a paper before the Institute of Radio Engineers on 'The Audion Detector and Amplifier.' In the discussion following the paper he made answers which, it is argued, are irreconcilable with a belief that there was a regenerative feed-back of radio frequencies from the plate circuit to the grid. He denies, however, that he intended to convey the meaning now ascribed to him, and insists that to his understanding in the heat of the discussion the audio and not the radio frequencies were the subject of the questions. Much is made also of his failure to perfect his invention promptly or to apply promptly for a \n\n[293 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n patent, the delay being extraordinary, it is argued, if a conception so important in its possibilities of profit and utility was present in his mind. For this delay he given his explanations, lack of funds, preoccupation with other uses of the audion having a cash value at the moment (its use, for illustration, as a telephone repeater), and perhaps chiefly the belief that he was a pioneer in the art without a rival in the offing. These explanations, even if not wholly convincing, are not so manifestly inadequate as to lead us to say that the conception of the oscillator as a generator of radio frequencies has been proved in any clear or certain way to have been developed and applied by Armstrong before it was born in De Forest's mind. To say this, moreover, would not be enough, even if we were willing to go so far, which, as already stated, we are not. Vacuum tube oscillators have a commercial use for other purposes besides radio. If De Forest's explanations and excuses were to be disregarded altogether, the result at most would be that the apparatus of the coupled circuits had potencies and values more important than the uses that were immediately apparent, potencies and values at least dimly apprehended, and never discarded or forgotten down to the time of their complete fruition. The benefit of all alike belonged to the inventor. Corona Cord Tire Co. v. Dovan Chemical Corp., \n276 \nU.S. 358, 369\n, 48 S.Ct. 380; Roberts v. Ryer, \n91 U.S. 150\n, 157; Stow v.

UNITED STATES(1934)\nNo. 734\nArgued: May 3, 1934Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis W. Hill, Jr., and David A. Pine, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. Brian Holland, of Philadelphia, Pa., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the Court of Claims by petitioner, an honorably discharged veteran of the Spanish-American War, to recover judgment against the United States for money deducted from his pension on account of board furnished him while he was an inmate of St. Elizabeths Hospital. He was committed to the hospital as an insane person on June 19, 1911, and remained there until April 25, 1930, when he was discharged in the custody of his brother. Thereafter, petitioner regained his sanity and was of sound mind when this suit was prosecuted. During the entire period of his confinement he suffered from a neuropsychiatric ailment. Preceding the time of his discharge from the hospital there had been placed to his credit on the books of the institution, under the certificate of the Bureau of Pensions, $ ,036, representing funds paid to the institution by the Bureau of Pensions on his behalf. Upon his discharge the hospital deducted from these pension funds a sum which had been advanced to him for clothing and cash, and applied the remaining $3,259.17 on account of board furnished during the period of his confinement. Petitioner, at the time, protested against the application thus made and against the refusal of the hospital to pay over to him the amount so withheld.\n Shortly after his discharge from the hospital application was made on his behalf to the Director of the Veterans' Bureau for an order authorizing and directing his hospitalization at St. Elizabeths Hospital from the effec- \n\n[292 U.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n tive date of the World War Veterans' Act of June 7, 1924, to the date of his discharge, April 25, 1930. The director held that since no application had been made by petitioner or by any one acting in his behalf until after his discharge, the question was moot, and the director was without authority of law to issue a retroactive order authorizing hospitalization in such a case. Following this ruling, however, the bureau issued a certificate recognizing petitioner as a veteran entitled to hospitalization under section 202(10) of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, as amended.\n Petitioner, by three successive enlistments, served in the army of the United States from November 30, 1897, until January 25, 1907, at which time he was honorably discharged by reason of the expiration of his term of service.\n The Court of Claims denied petitioner's right to recover and dismissed his petition.\n Section 202(10) of the World War Veterans' Act, as amended (U.S.C.A., title 38,  484 (38 USCA  484)), directs that all hospital facilities under the control and jurisdiction of the Veterans' Bureau shall be available 'for every honorably discharged veteran of the Spanish-American War ... suffering from neuropsychiatric ... ailments,' with the following proviso: 'That the pension of a veteran entitled to hospitalization under this section shall not be subject to deduction, while such veteran is hospitalized in any Government hospital, for board, maintenance, or any other purpose incident to hospitalization.' This proviso appeared for the first time in the Act of July 2, 1926, c. 723,  9, 44 Stat. 794.\n The Veterans' Bureau had and exercised the right to make use of St. Elizabeths Hospital for insane veterans; and this, we think, satisfied the requirement contemplated by the statute that the hospital facilities (not the hospi- \n\n[292 U.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n tal) shall be under the control and jurisdiction of that bureau.\n The court below, in ruling against petitioner, proceeded upon the theory that a court is without jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding for the determination of the question whether a veteran is entitled to hospital facilities, to order his hospitalization, or to certify his right thereto-those being matters, the court said within the sole authority of the director of the bureau. Granting the correctness of this view, we are of opinion that it does not apply in this case. The undisputed and indisputable facts bring the veteran within the requirements of the statute. Undoubtedly, therefore, as matter of law, he was entitled to the hospital facilities of St. Elizabeths, and if timely application had been made to the director of the bureau, a refusal upon his part to order the hospitalization would have been wholly without evidentiary support, clearly arbitrary and capricious, and would not, upon well-settled principles, have concluded the courts. Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 45 S.Ct. 69, and authorities cited; United States v. Williams, \n278 \nU.S. 255, 257\n, 49 S.Ct. 97. So much, indeed, seems to be within the concession made in the brief and argument for the government: 'It may be conceded at the outset that if a court may determine whether a person is entitled to hospitalization under the statute when the Director of the Veterans' Bureau has not passed upon the f cts of the case, the petitioner has stated and proved a good cause of action, and the court below erred in rendering judgment in favor of the United States.'\n Here no application was made to the director for the sufficient reason that petitioner was mentally, and therefore legally, incapable of making it; and apparently he had no guardian to act for him. However, his condition being certified to the Secretary of the Interior, in virtue of a statutory provision, that official, acting under the \n\n[292 U.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n statute, ordered petitioner confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital; and to that hospital he was accordingly committed and there held until his discharge in 1930. It would, perhaps, not be going too far to say that the hospital authorities were charged with the duty of making application to the director if under these circumstances any further steps were required. We, therefore, do not have the case of an insane person seeking at the hands of a court an order awarding him the facilities of the hospital, but that of one who having been accorded such facilities was in and entitled to be in the possession and use of them as of right.\n In this state of affairs, about which there is and can be no dispute, the only question presented to the court below was whether, under the proviso already quoted, the pension of petitioner was subject to deduction for board. The purpose of that proviso was to exempt pensions of the class named from hospital charges like the one here involved, and thereby cure what Congress deemed a defect in the prior law. The language is clear and explicit, namely, 'that the pension of a veteran entitled to hospitalization under this subdivision shall not be subject to deduction, while such veteran is hospitalized ..., for board ....' Given their natural meaning, these words plainly are applicable to the situation with which the court below was called upon to deal. The result is that the hospital was without authority to retain the funds here in question, and the court below should have given judgment for petitioner.\n The final contention of the government is that, in any event, petitioner is not entitled to recover so much of the funds withheld by the hospital as equal the charges for board furnished prior to July 2, 1926, when the proviso first came into effect, since to allow him to do so, it is said, would be to give the proviso a retroactive operation contrary to the intention of Congress. The evidence of \n\n[292 U.S. 443, 448]\n\u00a0\n such intention is said to lie in the fact that the bill as it passed the House contained an additional provision to the effect that when any such deductions 'have heretofore been made' the Veterans' Bureau shall reimburse the veterans concerned in amounts equal thereto; and that this provision was rejected by the Senate and finally eliminated from the bill; thus evincing the intention of Congress that the proviso should operate prospectively only.\n But the rejected provision spoke only of deductions made before the enactment of the proviso, and the deduction in the present case was not so made. The court below found that at the time of petitioner's discharge from the hospital the sum of the pension payments which had been credited to him on the books of that institution was $4,036; and that upon his discharge the hospital deducted the amount here in dispute on account of board from May 7, 1922, to February 6, 1930. The deduction, therefore, was not one which had 'heretofore been made,' but was one made long after the passage of the proviso and did not come within the terms of the rejected provision. Certainly Congress has power to relieve a pension paid by the federal government from liability to answer for a pre- existing unpaid debt owing to a governmental institution, as well as one thereafter incurred; and it seems entirely clear that the proviso in question was so intended. The liability for board arose from continuous charges, beginning before the proviso was passed and ending at the time of petitioner's discharge, when the pens on funds credited to petitioner and then in the hands of the hospital were taken over or 'deducted,' in settlement of the then existing account for board-a proceeding plainly forbidden by the proviso.\n But in no aspect of the matter would the allowance of that portion of the amount sued for which was applicable to board furnished prior to July 2, 1926, cause the proviso \n\n[292 U.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n to operate retroactively. A statute is not rendered retroactive merely because the facts or requisites upon which its subsequent action depends, or some of them, are drawn from a time antecedent to the enactment. Cox v.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity of a deficiency assessment of 1929 income taxes made under the Revenue Act of 1928. Section 202(a), 26 USCA  2202(a), defines gross income to be that re- \n\n[292 U.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n ceived from interest, dividends, and rents. Section 203(a) (26 USCA  2203( a), defines net income to be the gross less specified deductions including ( 5) 'investment expenses,' (6) 'Taxes and other expenses paid during the taxable year exclusively upon or with respect to the real estate owned by the company ...,' and (7) 'A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' Subsection (b) (26 USCA  2203(b), provides no deduction shall be made under subsection (a)(6) and (7) 'on account of any real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a life insurance company unless there is included in the return of gross income the rental value of the space so occupied. Such rental value shall be n t less than a sum which in addition to any rents received from other tenants shall provide a net income (after deducting taxes, depreciation, and all other expenses) at the rate of 4 per centum per annum of the book value at the end of the taxable year of the real estate so owned or occupied.' 45 Stat. 842-844.\n During 1929 petitioner owned a building all of which it used. It received $15 rent for use of the premises and in its return included that amount as a part of gross income. It did not add any sum on account of rental value of the building. Nevertheless, it deducted expenses chargeable to the building, amounting to $4,033.05. The commissioner disallowed the deduction. Petitioner also deducted from gross $1,783.02 to cover depreciation on all furniture and fixtures. The commissioner held the deduction allowable only in respect of such as were used in connection with the company's 'investment business.' That phrase may be taken to include activities relating to interest, dividends, and rents constituting the income taxed as distinguished from its 'underwriting business' which embraces its other activities. There being no allocation, the commissioner apportioned depreciation on the ratio of investment income, $123,248.44, to total income, $751,147.77. This reduced the deduction to $292.56. \n\n[292 U.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n These adjustments resulted in a binding of deficiency of $607.53. Following its earlier decisions, the Board of Tax Appeals held petitioner entitled to deduct expenses chargeable to the building and depreciation of all its furniture and fixtures. On that basis it found an overpayment of $ 750.05. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 67 F.(2d) 213.\n The ruling of the lower court disallowing deduction of expenses chargeable to the building is sustained on the authority of Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 758, 78 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\n The other question presented for decision is whether petitioner is entitled to deduct depreciation on all furniture and fixtures or only such part as fairly may be attributed to the income taxed. Petitioner raises no question as to the method employed for making the apportionment, but insists that the 'reasonable allowance' granted by section 203(a)(7) extends to all property and includes depreciation of all furniture and fixtures. It refers to the language of the corresponding provision in the Revenue Act of 1916 which permits deduction of 'a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out of its use or employment in the business or trade' and to similar language in the Revenue Act of 1918.1 It emphasizes absence from the Revenue Act of 1921 ( 42 Stat. 227) and later ones of the words above italicized. It argues that the change of language, made applicable to life insurance companies, shows that Congress intended to permit them to deduct depreciation of all property without regard to its use. The constructions put upon provisions in measures that did not limit income to be taxed, as did later acts, are of no value as guides to the meaning of the clause under consideration. In reason the cost \n\n[292 U.S. 382, 385]\n\u00a0\n of depreciation, like other items of expense to be deducted, ought to be limited to that related to the income taxed. Allowance of deduction of expenses incurred for the correction of premiums or in respect of other income not taxed would be hard to justify. In absence of specific declaration of that purpose, Congress may not reasonably be held to have intended by that means further to reduce taxable income of life insurance companies.\n There is adequate evidence that Congress intended to limit deductions of expenses to those related to the taxed income. Helvering v. Independent Life Insurance Co., supra. In the reports of committees having in charge the act of 1921 in which first appeared the language under consideration section 203(a) (7), it is said: 'The proposed plan would tax life insurance companies on the basis of their investment income from interest, dividends, and rents, with suitable deductions for expenses fairly chargeable against such investment income.' \n2\n Section 203(a)(5), by restricting deductions to investment expenses, indicates purpose to exclude those not related to investment income. Section 203(b), by condition imposed, similarly restricts deductions of real estate expenses. The language under consideration opposes deduction of unrelated expenses and is in harmony with the construction for which the commissioner contends. The significance of the word 'reasonable' qualifying allowance need not be limited to the amount to be ascertained. But having regard to the context and probable purpose of the provision it rightly may be construed to limit the ascertainment of depreciation to the property that is used in connection with the company's investment business. The construction put upon the statute by the Commissioner and Circuit Court of Appeals is sustained.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Revenue Act of 1916,  12(a), 39 Stat. 768; Revenue Act 1917,  4, 40 Stat. 302; Revenue Act of 1918,  234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1077, 1078. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 67th Congress, 1st Session, Senate Report No. 275, p. 20.

Greenwood, both of Cheyenne, Wyo., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Samuel H. Cady and William T. Faricy, both of Chicago, Ill., and R. R. Rose, of Casper, Wyo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the district court for Wyoming by the company against the treasurers of four counties to enjoin collection of a part of the taxes for 1931 levied upon its railroad property therein. The laws of that State required all taxable property to be assessed on the basis of its actual value. See State Constitution, art. 15,  11; Wyoming Revised Statutes, 1931,  115-119, 115-511, 115-1804. The complaint rests upon the \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n claim that for a number of years, including the one here involved, the State acting through its board of equalization and other taxing authorities systematically and intentionally discriminated against respondent's railroad and in favor of all other property, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it regularly taxed the railroad at about 133 1\/3 per cent. while taxing all other property at about 60 per cent. of actual value. Respondent tendered and paid to the treasurer of each county the amount it claimed would have been levied against it if all taxable property had been assessed upon the same basis of valuation. The total claimed by the four counties was $168, 606.12; respondent paid $101,163.67, leaving in controversy $67,442.45.\n Petitioners' answer denied discrimination. There was a trial at which much evidence was introduced. The district court upon specific findings of fact concluded that respondent's railroad property in Wyoming had been substantially and arbitrarily overvalued. It found that, with exceptions that are here immaterial, all other property had been assessed at its actual value. It entered a decree requiring respondent to pay additional taxes amounting in all to $33,519.46 and enjoining collection of any part of the balance.\n Petitioners seek reversal upon the ground that respondent failed to exhaust an administrative remedy open to it by appeal from the determination of the state board of equalization to the district court under section 115-512, Wyoming Revised Statutes, 1931. They also maintain that under section 115-311 respondent had an adequate remedy at law and therefore was not entitled to relief in equity. These contentions depend upon serious questions of Wyoming law which have not been decided by its highest court. This court is reluctant, in advance of decision thereon by the state courts of last resort, to construe state \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n statutes of doubtful meaning or to decide other questions of state law as to which there may be substantial controversy.\n In this case it is not necessary for, upon an analysis of the grounds of the decision below, it is clear that respondent was not entitled to an injunction. Respondent does not challenge the finding that other property was assessed at actual value, and so there remains only the claim that its railroad was intentionally and arbitrarily overvalued by about 33 1\/3 per cent.\n The company had 278.35 miles of main line track in Wyoming and that constituted 3.29 per cent. of the main line track included in its system extending into nine States. Neither it nor the board dealt with that in Wyoming as a separate line; both appraised it as a part of the system. They took the value of the whole, attributed to Wyoming a portion and divided it among the four counties. The only matter in controversy is the amount to be assigned to that State.\n To ascertain system value, respondent made calculations based on a five year period ending with 1930. It found the average market value of its stocks and bonds, deducted non-operating property locally taxed, added the remainder ($385,800,085) to an amount produced by capitalizing at 6% average net operating income ($364,771,720). The sum divided by two produced $375,285,902 which the board accepted for the purposes of its calculation, though one of its members testified 'there are certain flaws in it.'\n To ascertain the value to be taxed in Wyoming respondent found for each year and also the average for the five-year period the percentages that Wyoming traffic units (ton miles and passenger miles) bore to the system total, the corresponding relation of use of rolling stock (ear miles and engine miles) and of gross operating rev- \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n enues, and by the calculations printed in the margin, 1 arrived at $5,849, 570.\n In pursuance of  115-1803, respondent filed a return showing 'grand total valuation $8,281,950.' It attached a statement which includes the following:\n'The valuations shown in this return are based upon the estimated cost of reproduction new of the physical properties ... less depreciation, and without further\n\n[]\n Value of entire Assigned to State of Wyoming on basis of line as represented by income Use of capitalized Traffic Operating rolling Average Year at 6% units revenues stock of 3 bases []\n 1 1926 $342,767,737 $5,827,052 $5,038,686 $5,929,882 $5, 508,540 2 1927 398,490,108 7,212,671 6,057,050 7,372,067 6,880,596 3 1928 397,772,006 6,085,912 5,847,248 6,284,798 6,072,653 4 1929 398,555,050 6,699,337 5,579,771 6,018,181 5,765,763 5 1930 391,415,526 5,558,100 5,714,667 6,027,799 5, 766,855\n 6 Aggregate $1,929,000,427 $30,383,072 $28,237,422 $31, 632,727 $30,084,407 7 Aver. 5 Yrs. $ 385,800,085 $ 6,076,614 $ 5,647,484 $ 6,326,545 $ 6,016,881 \n Value of entire Assigned to State of Wyoming on basis of line as represented by income Use of capitalized Traffic Operating rolling Average Year at 6% units revenues stock of 3 bases []\n 8 1926 $ 371,585,653 $ 6,316,956 $ 5,462,309 $ 6,428,432 $ 6,069,232 9 1927 337,628,225 6,111,071 5,131,949 6,246, 122 5,829,714 10 1928 387,094,715 5,922,549 5,690,293 6,116, 096 5,009,646 11 1929 437,002,491 6,249,136 6,118,035 6,598, 738 6,321,970 12 1930 290,547,517 4,125,775 4,241,994 4,474, 432 4,280,734\n 13 Aggregate 1,823,858,601 $28,725,487 $26,644,580 $29,863,820 $28,441,296 14 Aver. 5 Yrs.

Wyoming, or properly allocated to the State, does not exceed $5,849,570.'\n After receiving the return, the board found cost of reproduction new less depreciation of respondent's railroad properties in Wyoming on the basis of an appraisal by the Interstate Commerce Commission as of 1917 plus later betterments to be $11,724,126, depreciated that at the annual rate of 2.5 per cent. for 13 years and so produced $8,436,076; ascertained the Wyoming 1930 net operating income to be 2.23 per cent. of the total for that year, applied that ratio to system value ($375,285,902) and produced $8,368,876. Each of the two last mentioned indications of value is substantially more than the reproduction cost less depreciation given by respondent in its return. The board, in order to equalize the valuation of respondent's property with other Wyoming railroad properties, made the assessment $7,989,587 which is 2.13 per cent. of system value. This is considerably less than the cost figures stated in the return.\n After notice of the assessment there was a hearing at which respondent presented the theory and bases of its appraisal. It appears that upon further consideration the board took into account the facts that for the five-year period Wyoming net revenue was 2.114 per cent. of the system total; respondent's estimated cost of reproduction less depreciation of the Wyoming property was 2.21 per cent. of the system value, and that one-half the sum of these \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n percentages is 2.162 per cent. Of the percentages used by the respondent, the board accepted those based on traffic units and use of rolling stock, rejected that based on gross operating revenues, substituted for it one- half of the sum of the gross operating revenue percentage plus the net operating revenue percentage, introduced the percentage that Wyoming mileage is of system mileage and divided the total by four, producing 2.1 per cent. Its ascertainment of the ratio used follows:\n Traffic Units 1.58% Use of Rolling Stock 1.65% Average between gross and net operating revenues 1.89% Main track mileage 3.29% ___ Divided by 4 8.41% ___ Percentage to be allocated to Wyoming 2.10%\n The board applied this percentage to system value and so established the final assessment, $7,881,003.94, which is less than the earlier one by more than $100,000. This is about 63% of the mileage proportion of agreed system value.\n The district court rejected as without support respondent's use of the gross operating revenue percentage. It found that the board used the mileage basis, 3.29 per cent., without taking into account the fact that respondent's property in Wyoming measured on a mileage basis, was greatly less in quantity, quality, cost and value than the portion of its operating system located outside that State. It was upon that ground that the court concluded that respondent's property 'was substantially and arbitrarily overassessed.' And it condemned as unreasonable and arbitrary the board's use of the mileage percentage. Then proceeding to correct what it held to be the error of the board, the court found one-third of the sum of the percentages based on Wyoming and system traffic units, roll- \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n ing stock and the average between gross and net operating revenue to be 1. 673 per cent. \n2\n It applied that ratio to the admitted system value and so produced.$6,278,534.14-being a reduction of the assessment by $1,602,468. 90-directed respondent to pay taxes on that basis and enjoined petitioners from collecting more.\n The ascertainment of the value of a railway system is not a matter of arithmetical calculation and is not governed by any fixed and definite rule. Facts of great variety and number, estimates that are exact and those that are approximations, forecasts based on probabilities and contingencies have bearing and properly may be taken into account to guide judgment in determining what is the money equivalent-the actual value-of the property.

The apportionment of system value between Wyoming and the rest of the system involves the finding of the value of the portion of the railroad that is located in that State. The problem is quite like the ascertainment of the value of the whole. The determina- \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n tion is to be made in the exercise of a reasonable judgment based on facts so pertinent and significant as to be of controlling weight as indications of the value of the property.\n Where, as in this case, the evidence requires a finding that the railroad in one of the States reached by the system is clearly shown to be worth much less than the aver age value per mile of the system, an apportionment on mileage necessarily assigns an excessive amount to that State, and the use of that basis as the sole measure for apportionment must be condemned as arbitrary.

Chicago & N.W.R. Co. v. Eveland (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 442, 447. In arriving at the relation between value in Wyoming and system value, the State board did not confine its calculation to relative mileage. That percentage combined with the other ratios used in the calculation produced 2.1 per cent. finally adopted. Nor did it limit its consideration of the problem to the elements employed to make that computation. Among other things it took into account the cost of reproduction less depreciation of the Wyoming property; the relations between that figure and the agreed system value, and between operating net revenues derived from the Wyoming property and those earned by the system for the five-year period and for 1930. Each of these is an indication that the value of the Wyoming property is substantially more than the assessment in question.\n The record shows that the board considered respondent's calculation. Refusal to accept that formula as the measure was not arbitrary. Respondent's use of the average of three ratios indicates that it realized that there were substantial objections against each as the sole test. It is obvious, even when results of operation over a substantial \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n period are considered, that as a matter of fact the value of respondent's Wyoming line does not rise and fall with decline and increase of ton miles, passenger miles, car miles, engine miles or gross revenue in any other State or upon the balance of the system. Moreover, by the use of its formula respondent failed to take into account facts that justly may be considered to have significant bearing upon the relation between Wyoming value and system value. Such, for example, are the length of line to be assessed and the net operating revenues. The other factors that are shown to have been considered by the board give substantial support to the percentage finally adopted as the basis of the assessment.\n There is nothing in this record to suggest any lack of good faith on the part of the board. Overvaluation resulting from error of judgment will not support a claim of discrimination. There must be something that amounts to an intention, or the equivalent of fraudulent purpose, to disregard the fundamental principle of uniformity. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350\n, 38 S.Ct. 495; Sioux City Bridge v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441\n, 43 S.Ct. 190, 28 A.L.R. 979; chicago G.W.R. Co. v.

There was no discrimination against respondent by undervaluation of the property of others. We find no substantial support in the findings of the district court or in the evidence for the conclusion that the use that the state board made of relative mileage to ascertain the value of respondent's Wyoming railroad property was arbitrary or unreasonable or indeed erroneous, or for its conclusion that the property was substantially or arbitrarily overvalued. Respondent was not entitled to an injunction.\n The trial court was not called upon, and it was no part of the judicial function, to determine the base or amount \n\n[293 U.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n of the tax that in its view might legally be exacted as a result of the assessment in question.

Railroad Comm., \n290 U.S. 264\n, 271, et seq., 54 S.Ct. 154.

Ct. 613, exhibited the serious problems encountered by insurance companies when conflicting demands are made by residents of different States. There two individuals, residents of California and Pennsylvania, claimed the surrender value of a life policy. The insurer unsuccessfully sought through interpleader proceedings in Pennsylvania to secure release from all liability.\n In order to mitigate the difficulties, Congress, by the Act of February 22, 1917, 39 Stat. 929, authorized insurance companies to file bills of interpleader in District Courts of the United States. An amendment followed \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n February 25, 1925, 43 Stat. 976, USCA 28,  41(26). And the Act of May 8, 1926, 44 Stat. 416, USCA 28  41(26) (in the margin1), rewrote and amplified the provisions of the earlier enactments. \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n National Fire Insurance Company and Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Connecticut corporations, under policies issued to him, became indebted to W. D. Sanders, resident of the Eastern District of Texas, for loss by fire ( July 3, 1927) of property located therein and part of his homestead. Texas statutes exempt from execution the proceeds of such insurance. The indebtedness of the two insurers respectively was adjusted at $3,400 and $ 4,250; these sums they agreed to pay. Both Companies were garnished in a foreign attachment proceeding against Sanders instituted July 18, 1927, in an Illinois court by Armour Fertilizer Works, a corporation of that State. This proceeding was based upon his notes which undertook to waive homestead and exemption rights. The garnishees admitted liability to Sanders but gave notice of his claim that the proceeds of the policies were exempt from garnishment under Texas laws. He did not appear. After proper publication, judgment was entered against him September 19, 1927. This sustained the attachment and awarded recovery against him in favor of \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n the Fertilizer Works for the amount due upon the notes, $7,589.81; also directed execution. It is in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Before final trial in the Illinois court under their answers, as permitted by the Act of May 8, 1926, the Insurance Companies, claiming to be mere stakeholders, filed separate interpleader proceedings in the District Court, Eastern District of Texas, June 12, 1928. Sanders and Armour Fertilizer Works, alleged adverse claimants, were made defendants. The sums admitted to be \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 198]\n\u00a0\n due under the fire policies were paid into court. An injunction restrained the Armour Fertilizer Works from proceeding further in the Illinois court. Answers by both defendants followed. The causes were consolidated. The District Court awarded the fund to Sanders; the Circuit Court of Appeals held that it should go to Armour Fertilizer Works and reversed the trial court. National Fire Ins. Co. v. Sanders (D.C.) 33 F.(2d) 157; National Fire Ins. Co. v. Sanders (C.C.A.) 38 F.(2d) 212. Certiorari, granted upon Sanders' petition, brings the matter here.\n The facts are not in dispute. The parties agree that the proceedings in Illinois were according to her statutes; and that under the settled law there Sanders' claim of exemption would have been denied and judgment given against the garnishees if the cause had followed the ordinary course.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals overruled objections to the jurisdiction of the District Court and affirmed the latter's authority to consider and determine the rights of the claimants.\n It concluded that the Texas statutes did not control; that the Act of May 8, 1926, was intended to afford protection to stakeholders, not to alter the rights of adverse claimants; that the rights of each claimant under the law of the State where they arose should be considered; and that equitable principles commonly accepted in federal courts should be applied.\n It held that by the Illinois garnishment the money payable by the Companies to Sanders was sequestrated and that this was good against his claim of exemption; that the lien so obtained followed the fund paid into court. And it directed that the Illinois judgment against him should be satisfied.\n Upon the first hearing the District Court dismissed the bill for lack of jurisdiction; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Judgment went for San- \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 199]\n\u00a0\n ders on the second trial, the Circuit Court of Appeals again reversed.\n Objection to jurisdiction of the District Court is now made upon the theory that the defendants are not adverse claimants within the intendment of the interpleader Act since one admits the attached debt is payable primarily to the other and seeks to recover because of his indebtedness to it. The court below (38 F.(2d) 212, 214) adequately answered this contention: 'We think that the facts in this case show that the District Court is mistaken in concluding that the claims of Armour and Sanders are not adverse. Each is claiming the proceeds of the policies to the exclusion of the other. Armour claims by virtue of its Illinois judgment against Sanders and the attachment, and Sanders, while not disputing his obligation to Armour, claims the proceeds, notwithstanding, by virtue of the exemption under the laws of Texas. The statute is remedial and to be liberally construed. It is broad enough to cover any adverse claims against the proceeds of the policies, no matter on what grounds urged. Its terms are not to be interpreted as meaning only adverse claims of those pretending to be beneficiaries of the insured.'\n The general purpose and effect of the Act of May 8, 1926, were also well stated below (63 F.(2d) 902, 903):\n'Suits for interpleader in which actions in other courts are enjoined were familiar to equity when the Constitution was adopted (see Spring v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 8 Wheat. 268), and are one of the forms of controversy to which, when arising between citizens of different states, the federal judicial power was extended. The act enlarges the processes of the District Court to cover a broad territory, but otherwise authorizes only an ordinary form of equitable relief. ... The District Court, of course, is bound on an interpleader to give full faith and credit to \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 200]\n\u00a0\n the garnishment proceedings in Illinois. Cooper v. Newell, \n173 \nU.S. 567\n, 19 S.Ct. 506. ...\n\n'We do not think the filing of the federal interpleader and the payment thereunder of the money into the District Court in Texas operated to bring it under the dominion of Texas law. The applicant for interpleader often has a choice of forum, and he cannot at his will subject the rights of the contesting claimants to one set of laws rather than another. The purpose of the interpleader statute was to give the stakeholder protection, but in nowise to change the rights of the claimants by its operation. The interpleader is a suit in equity, and equitable principles and procedure are the same throughout the federal jurisdiction. The court is to weigh the right or title of each claimant under the law of the state in which it arose, and determine which according to equity is the better. The decision should be the same whether the interpleader is filed in Illinois or in Texas. No one's rights are intended to be altered by paying the fund into the court, which as an impartial neutral is to determine them.'\n\n Assertion by the complainant of entire disinterestedness is essential to a bill of interpleader. Groves v. Sentell, \n153 \nU.S. 465, 485\n, 14 S.Ct. 898. 'In such a bill it is necessary to aver that the complainant has no interest in the subject-matter of the suit; he must admit title in the claimants and aver that he is indifferent between them, and he cannot seek relief in the premises against either of them.' Killian v. Ebbinghaus, \n110 \nU.S. 568, 571\n, 4 S.Ct. 232, 233.\n The situation here is unlike that presented where one voluntarily subjects himself to its jurisdiction and seeks the aid of a court to enforce his claim. See Story on Conflict of Laws (8th Ed.)  598. The Armour Fertilizer Works asks nothing under any Texas law. Brought into the District Court against its will, it was held there against its protest and enjoined from proceeding further in Illinois. \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 201]\n\u00a0\n It now claims priority of right and only asks what it would have secured but for the injunction. Under such circumstances, to hold that the statutes of Texas control would destroy rights duly obtained in Illinois; would permit the Insurance Companies by interpleader proceedings to change the positions of defendants; and, in effect, seriously interfere with the impartial adjustment of existing equities. We think Congress had no intention to permit such destruction of acquired rights, if indeed it had power so to do.\n By his answer Sanders thus stated his claim to the fund in court: 'That by reason of the fact that the property which was the subject of insurance covered by said insurance policy was the homestead of the defendant, W. D. Sanders, the proceeds of the same which have been tendered into court by the plaintiff herein are exempt to the defendant, W. D. Sanders, under the laws and Constitution of the State of Texas, and his rights therein are superior and prior to the rights of the defendant, Armour Fertilizer Works.'\n Armour Fertilizer Works asserted: 'On or about the 18th day of July, 1927, it filed a suit in the Municipal Court of Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, styled Armour Fertilizer Works, a corporation, trading as the Planters Fertilizer and Chemical Company, versus W. D. Sanders, being numbered 1413423. Said suit was based upon eight promissory notes upon which there was due at that time, including principal, interest and attorney's fees, the sum of $7,589.81. That in connection with said proceedings a writ of attachment and garnishment was issued out of said court, and was, on the 19th day of July, 1927, served upon the plaintiff herein. That the defendant W. D. Sanders was duly cited by publication, in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, to appear and answer said suit. Judgment was taken \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 202]\n\u00a0\n against the said W. D. Sanders in said suit on September 19, 1927, for the sum of $7,589.81. That said case has not been dismissed as between this defendant and the plaintiff herein, garnishee in that suit. The judgment rendered in said suit is a valid and binding judgment and was procured in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, and is a valid judgment against the defendant W. D. Sanders to the extent of the funds impounded by said garnishment. That under the terms of said judgment the said attachment and garnishment against the plaintiff herein and against the defendant W. D. Sanders was sustained and all matters in dispute and with reference to the funds involved herein, were and have been judicially determined by said judgment.'\n We are not now primarily concerned with rights of a garnishee. The Insurance Companies have paid their debts and obtained complete discharge. Only Sanders and the Armour Fertilizer Works are interested.\n He presented claims against Connecticut corporations arising under insurance contracts which he had not undertaken to enforce. These were free from execution in Texas. He might have sued upon them in Illinois; there they were subject to valid attachment.\n The Armour Fertilizer Works, an Illinois corporation, presented the judgment against Sanders duly rendered by a court of that State in a proceeding properly begun and prosecuted. It had secured a lien upon the claims against the Insurance Companies. There is no ground for any claim of fraud. True, no final judgment had gone against the garnishees; but as between Sanders and the Fertilizer Works judgment stood against him; also, sequestration of the debts. The precise effect which would be given this preliminary judgment, as against the garnishees, in proceedings involving their rights may be doubtful, but opinions by the Supreme Court of Illinois clearly indicate that Armour Fertilizer Works secured a lien \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 203]\n\u00a0\n upon the Sanders claims; and that, but for the injunction, final valid judgment would have gone against the Insurance Companies, accompanied by a lien good against all the world.\n The effect of the proceedings in Illinois as against one occupying the position of Sanders is plain enough under her statutes and decisions. The Illinois courts would have rejected his claim of exemption under the laws of Texas. This view is affirmed here by agreement.\n The Illinois rule is that garnishment imposes an inchoate lien subject to defeat by certain subsequent events, none of which are present here. Also, that final judgment in Illinois against the garnishee prior to one in another jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties. Lancashire Insurance Co. v. Corbetts, 165 Ill. 592, 46 N.E. 631, 36 L.R.A. 640, 56 Am.St.Rep. 275; Becker v. Illinois Central Railroad, 250 Ill. 40, 95 N.E. 42, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1154. Also, 'that property, real and personal, attached, and funds in the hands of the garnishee, are placed on the same footing,-that is, when attached, such property or funds are appropriated from that time to the payment of a certain class of judgment creditors specifically enumerated.' Accordingly, the principal debtor may not assign his claim against the garnished one after the writ has been served upon the latter. National Bank of America v. Indiana Banking Co., 114 Ill. 483, 489, 2 N.E. 401. Martin v. Dryden, 6 Ill. (1 Gilman) 187, declares:\n'Without a levy of the attachment, or the service of a garnishee, the Court has no jurisdiction to proceed, by publication of notice, to render any judgment. But, by the seizure of any estate or property of the defendant, or the service by garnishment upon any having estate, property, or effects of his in their hands, the law has laid hold of a fund, which it may condemn, and appropriate to the satisfaction of whatever judgment it may render against the defendant, and thereupon the Court proceeds to hear as to the indebtedness. ... \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 204]\n\u00a0\n 'These remarks and views apply also to the question of lien. This specific appropriation of property must amount to something as to those who may deal in relation to it; else the defendant could, at any time before judgment, defeat the object of the party by a sale, and possibly, even the jurisdiction of the Court. We are of opinion, that the attachment is a lien from the date of the levy, when followed by a judgment, and which will have relation back to it. This doctrine is sanctioned by numerous authorities, which I will not review.'\n\n In the circumstances presented the proceedings in Illinois gave to Armour Fertilizer Works a paramount right or superior equity to the proceeds of the policies. To hold that the District Court in Texas could enjoin the Fertilizer Works from proceeding further and then declare that because the last step in the Illinois suit had not been taken Sanders, in some way, became entitled to priority, plainly would be inequitable. Moreover, it would deny to the garnishment proceedings the credit and effect accorded them in the State where taken.\n It is unnecessary to enter upon discussion of vexed questions arising out of garnishment proceedings in different jurisdictions. The different views are well stated in Minor on Conflict of Laws,  125, 126, 209. This Court has had occasion to consider the general subject in Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S.Ct. 269; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. v. Sturm, \n174 \nU.S. 710\n, 19 S.Ct. 797; King v. Cross, \n176 \nU.S. 396\n, 20 S.Ct. 131; Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215, 223\n, 25 S.Ct. 625, 627, 5 Ann.Cas. 1084. The latter says: 'Notice to the debtor (garnishee) of the commencement of the suit, and notice not to pay to his creditor, is all that can be given, whether the garnishee be a mere casual and temporary comer, or a resident of the state where the attachment is laid. His obligation to pay to his creditor is thereby arrested and a lien created upon the debt itself. Cahoon v. Morgan, 38 Vt. 234, 236; National Fire Ins. Co. v. Chambers, 53 N.J.Eq. 468, 483, 32 A. 663.. \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 205]\n\u00a0\n We can see no reason why the attachment could not be thus laid, provided the creditor of the garnishee could himself sue in that state, and its laws permitted the attachment.'\n Petitioner's argument proceeds upon the erroneous assumption that the money paid into court came under the dominion of Texas law-especially her exemption statutes. This view is not in harmony with the settled law of Illinois that an attachment when levied on the debtor fixes a lien upon the claim and prevents subsequent transfer by the creditor; also, with the reasoning and conclusion in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. v. Sturm, supra.\n The latter case-approved in King v. Cross, supra, and Harris v. Balk, supra-held that garnishment proceedings pending in Iowa against a claim for wages due by the Railway to a resident of Kansas, and there exempt from execution, constituted good defense when the wage-earner subsequently sued the Railway in Kansas. It approved the doctrine that debts accompany the debtor and may be attached wherever he can be sued by his creditor. Among others, it cited with approval National Fire Ins. Co. v. Chambers, 53 N.J.Eq. 468, 32 A. 663. It declared that the exemption law was no part of the contract of employment and disapproved the notion that when debts are exempt from execution in the State where created this privilege follows as an incident into other jurisdictions.\n In National Fire Ins. Co. v. Chambers, supra (an interpleader proceeding, 1895), Vice Chancellor Pitney elaborately discussed a situation substantially similar to the one before us. After full review of the authorities, he held that a pending garnishment proceeding properly instituted under the laws of Pennsylvania against indebtedness due to a resident of New Jersey created a lien thereon and gave the attaching creditor superior equity \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 206]\n\u00a0\n to one who claimed by transfer from the New Jersey creditor. He applied the familiar principle that he who is first in time is best in right. See, also, American Bank v. Rollins, 99 Mass. 313, and Garity v. Gigie, 130 Mass. 184.\n The record does not indicate that any other creditor was interested in the fund impounded in Illinois. The court below rightly gave precedence to the claim of the Fertilizer Works; also properly ruled that the controversy should be terminated by a decree devoting the fund in court to the Illinois judgment against Sanders.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n The federal court in Texas is under a duty, prescribed by statute (R. S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687 (28 USCA  687); American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 166\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298), to give full faith and credit to judicial proceedings in Illinois, including proceedings under writs of garnishment or attachment. Green v. Van Buskirk, 7 Wall. 139. This does not mean that the proceedings are to have any greater effect than they have by law or usage in the courts of Illinois. Robertson v. Pickrell, \n109 \nU.S. 608, 610\n, 611 S., 3 S.Ct. 407; Ohio v. Chattanooga Boiler Co., \n289 \nU.S. 439, 443\n, 53 S.Ct. 663. The duty is fulfilled if the force and efficacy are the same.\n Garnishment in Illinois does not create a lien upon the debt or chose in action subjected to the writ. Bigelow v. Andress, 31 Ill. 322, 330, 332 ( distinguishing Brashear v. West. 7 Pet. 608, which was based upon a different statute); Gregg v. Savage, 51 Ill.App. 281, 284, affirmed 150 Ill. 161, 37 N.E. 312; McElwee v. Wilce, 80 Ill.App. 338, 342. In substance it is a monition whereby the defendant is apprised that he will be acting at his peril if he makes a voluntary payment to the original creditor, the peril consisting in this, that he may have to pay again. Bigelow v. Andress, supra; Gregg v. Savage, supra; McElwee v. Wilce, \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 207]\n\u00a0\n supra. \n1\n The writ has not effect upon involuntary payments before the stage of judgment. Some other attaching creditor, suing the same defendant, may garnish the same debt in another jurisdiction. The Illinois plaintiff, though the first to have recourse to garnishment, will be postponed to the other plaintiff who is first with execution. Lancashire Insurance Co. v. Corbetts, 165 Ill. 592, 46 N.E. 631, 36 L.R.A. 640, 56 Am.St.Rep. 275. Indeed, the primary creditor, i.e., the debtor of the attaching plaintiff, may bring suit against the garnishee in another jurisdiction, and collect the indebtedness if he wins the race to judgment. Becker v. Illinois Central R. Co., 250 Ill. 40, 95 N.E. 42, 43, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1154.2 The garnishment suit is in personam against the debtor of a debtor (Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215\n, 25 S.Ct. 625, 3 Ann.Cas. 1084), and the res is not impounded till the compulsion of judgment and execution has caused it to be paid. Then, but not before, the garnishee will have protection against the hazard of conflicting claims. Cf. Harris v. Balk, supra; Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Deer, \n200 \nU.S. 176\n, 26 S.Ct. 207; B. & O.R. Co. v. Hostetter, \n240 \nU.S. 620\n, 36 S.Ct. 475.\n What has been written does not go beyond the law as declared in Illinois. The fact is not ignored that there are other jurisdictions in which the process of garnish- \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 208]\n\u00a0\n ment receives a different meaning. Sometimes the service of the writ is held to impose upon the debt a fixed and present lien which will have recognition and enforcement everywhere. See, e.g., Embree v. Hanna, 5 Johns. (N.Y.) 101; Wallace v. McConnell, 13 Pet. 136; In re Ransford (C.C.A.) 194 F. 658, 661; Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Sturm, \n174 \nU.S. 710\n, 19 S.Ct. 797. Sometimes the lien is spoken of as a quasi lien or an inchoate one. See e.g., Focke v. Blum, 82 Tax. 436, 441, 17 S.W. 770; North Star Boot Co. v. Ladd, 32 Minn. 381, 383, 20 N.W. 334; In re Ransford, supra. Cf. Becker v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra. In the conflict of laws the difference may be important between realities and metaphors, between the organism and the germ. Sometimes the Illinois rule is accepted, and there is said to be no lien, or one that does no more than restrain the garnishee from making voluntary payments. See e.g., Commercial State Bank v. Pierce,3 176 Iowa, 722, 158 N.W. 481; McGarry v. Lewis Coal Co., 93 Mo. 237, 6 S.W. 81, 3 Am.St.Rep. 522; Parker v. Farr, 2 Browne (Pa.) 331. Little is to be gained by dilating upon these and like decisions, for they are rooted in local laws or customs. Garnishment and attachment today are statutory remedies. They are what the state creating them declares that they shall be. It is of no moment that Illinois might have made their efficacy greaer as long as her legislature and courts have preferred to make them less.\n In that state of the law the garnishee would have been remiss if it had failed to shape its course with prudent recognition of conflicting possibilities. Its indebtedness \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 209]\n\u00a0\n to Sanders had been subjected to garnishment by the Armour Company in Illinois, but Sanders was threatening it with suit in Texas. If Sanders had a judgment there before Armour was in a position to issue execution in Illinois, the garnishment in all likelihood would count for nothing, yet there was a possibility even then of dispute and litigation. Plainly in the race for judgments and its aftermath, there was the risk of expense and embarrassment, if not of double payment.\n The ganishee in this dilemma paid the amount of the indebtedness into the registry of the federal court in Texas and had the rival claimants interplead. 28 U.S.C.  41(26), 28 USCA  4(26). The claimant Sanders was entitled to the money unless the Armour Company had a lien, and the courts of Illinois had held there was no lien. True there had been a judgment against Sanders, though not against his codefendant, the insurer, but this judgment had been obtained by default after service by publication, not followed by an appearance. It was therefore ineffective as a judgment in personam, and in the absence of a lien did not operate in rem. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dunlevy, \n241 \nU.S. 518\n, 36 S.Ct. 613. The joinder of Sanders had no effect except to give him notice of the garnishment and an opportunity to come in, if he was so minded, and contest the plaintiff's claim. Harris v. Balk, supra, page 227 of 198 U.S., 25 S.Ct. 625. He declined the invitation and preferred to litigate at home. Whatever lien has been adjudged as the result of his default was contingent upon the consummation of proceedings to charge the garnishee, and ended when they lapsed, just as if the suit were discontinued. It did not rise to the rank of a general interest in property, adhering to the debt everywhere and qualifying the title in another jurisdiction. Probably no one would contend that by force of the judgment against Sanders a suit could have been maintained by Armour as quasi owner of the policies outside of Illinois. If that was so before \n\n[292 U.S. 190, 210]\n\u00a0\n the interpleader, it was even more plainly so thereafter. By the express terms of the decree the stakeholder was discharged when the fund was paid into the registry (38 F.(2d) 212) with the result that there was no longer the possibility of pursuing the garnishee anywhere and thus perfecting the attachment. If some inchoate incumbrance had existed until then, it was then obliterated forever. The fund was free and clear.\n The federal court in Taxas was thus driven to a choice between a claimant with a foreign attachment which by the law of its creation was of no extraterritorial validity till it had ripened into payment under the compulsion of a judgment, and a claimant whose title to the fund was undisputed unless the lien of the attachment was presently effective. It is not easy to see how there could be any choice but one.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act approved May 8, 1926, 44 Stat. 416.

Colmery, of Topeka, Kan., for petitioners.\n Mr. Richard H. Wills, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Philip Sauder, as owner of the E. 1\/2 of section 16, Tp. 23, Range 13, Greenwood county, Kan., and the S.E. 1\/4 of the S.W. 1\/4 of the same section, amounting in all to 360 acres, brought suit in a Kansas state court for the cancellation of an oil and gas lease. The cause was removed to the federal District Court, where, after Sauder's death, it was revived in the right of his administratrix and heirs. The lease was made June 6, 1916; by sundry assignments the petroleum corporation had become the tenant. The recited consideration was $1 and the covenants and agreements on the part of the lessee. The term was ten years, and as long thereafter as oil and gas could be procured in paying quantities. The lessee was to deliver to the lessor one-eighth of the oil realized, and, if gas should be found, $100 per year was to be paid for each gas well so long as its product was sold or marketed. If no well were commenced within one year, all rights and obligations of the parties were to cease upon notice from the lessor to that effect, provided that the lessee should have the right to continue the lease in force from year to year until a well should be drilled, by paying an annual rental of $1 per acre. The instrument provided that the lessee might enter upon the premises for the purposes of the lease, use water from any creek or pond or drill for water to run machinery for prospecting and for operating the wells, should have the exclusive right to erect, lay, and maintain pipe, machinery, and structures necessary for producing, storing, or transporting oil or gas. The contract ran in favor of and against the heirs, assigns, successors, and personal representatives of the parties.\n To offset two wells drilled on adjoining property, the lessee completed one well in November, 1921, and a second in January, 1922; but no other wells have been sunk, \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n nor have any locations for wells been made. On the date of the expiration of the fixed term, Sauder wrote the respondent stating that the lease had expired, and adding that he understood if it was a profitable contract respondent was supposed to operate, and, if not, he understood the term had run out, and the respondent should release all the tract except the portion on which the wells were being operated. He asked what action the respondent proposed to take. The reply was that respondent considered it had a paying lease and would not surrender it.\n The suit was instituted June 27, 1930. In addition to reciting the facts above outlined, the complaint asserted there had been development and production of oil on adjacent tracts, with consequent drainage of oil from the leased land; the respondent was bound to explore and develop the land, and had neglected so to do; unless the lease were canceled, the respondent would continue to hold it for speculative purposes, and the plaintiffs be deprived of the objects and considerations for which the lease was made. The answer denied that the lease was being held for speculative purposes, denied the operations on surrounding tracts were causing drainage, alleged the drilling of the two wells was a fulfillment of the obligation to offset wells likely to drain from the demised premises, and denied any breach of the lease.\n Upon the trial the petitioners offered in evidence a map showing the number of wells drilled on adjacent premises, the date when they came into production, and the amount of production from each, as well as the location of all which proved to be dry holes. The respondent offered expert testimony showing that in the vicinity there were two sands, the upper of which pinched out eastward of the demised premises, and that the wells on the latter and those on lands to the west and south thereof were in the lower sand, known as the Mississippi lime. These \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n witnesses testified that in their judgment the geological formation, and the experience with wells drilled on nearby lands, made it so unlikely that oil would be obtained as to justify a prudent operator in abstaining from drilling additional wells on the Sauder tract.\n The District Judge found that the two wells were drilled as off-sets and had been producing oil in small but paying quantities. He summarized the evidence as to drilling on adjacent territory, and found that there was some probability that damage was being done to the leasehold through drainage by wells on adjoining properties. He was unable to decide the question of the likelihood that additional wells on the Sauder tract would produce oil or gas in paying quantities, and held that in the state of the proofs nothing but exploration and positive test by drilling could settle the controversy. After referring to the notice sent by Sauder to the respondent at the termination of the ten-year period, he found that no effort had thereafter been made toward exploration or development by drilling wells or otherwise, and that the respondent and its officers had no present intention of further exploring and developing, unless and until developments in the immediate vicinity should convince them that it would pay to take such action. The conclusion was that petitioners had no adequate remedy at law, the respondent and its predecessors in title had not in good faith and with reasonable diligence explored and developed the lands as required by the express and implied covenants of the lease; that it would be inequitable to permit the respondent to hold the property without further exploration and development, as it proposed to do; and that the petitioners were entitled to a decree canceling the lease, except as to a portion of the S.E. 1\/4 of the S.W. 1\/4 of section 16 (upon which the two off-set wells were drilled), as to which the respondent may hold and enjoy its leasehold right so long as it produces gas or oil there- \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n from in paying quantities. A decree was entered in accordance with the findings, adding the qualification that, as to tanks, pipes, and equipment located somewhat north of the acreage which the respondent was permitted to retain, these need not be moved until they should become obstacles to the development of the petitioners' land.\n Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting) reversed the decree, holding that the respondent had not violated the covenants of its lease, and, until it should be guilty of a breach, it was entitled to continue to hold the whole tract. The reversal was without prejudice to the bringing of a new suit in the event changed conditions should indicate a breach of respondent's implied covenant to develop. We brought the case here by writ of certiorari.\n The question for decision is whether the respondent failed to comply with an implied covenant to develop the tract with reasonable diligence. The petitioners' position is that, since the lease was of land in Kansas, the case is to be decided according to the rule of law adopted by the Supreme Court of the state, which is said to be more stringent as respects the lessee's obligation than that generally applied by state and federal courts. The majority of the Court of Appeals were of opinion that at the date of the making of the lease the law of the state, as evidenced by the decisions of its Supreme Court, was the same as that followed by the federal courts; and if, by decisions announced subsequent to the effective date of the lease, a broader rule was laid down, the federal courts ought not to apply it with retroactive effect. The petitioners assert that the court was in error in both conclusions.\n It is unnecessary to inquire as to the law of Kansas, or the effect to be given it in this case, since we think that the rule followed generally requires a reversal of the decree dismissing the bill. \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n It is conceded that a covenant on respondent's part to continue the work of exploration, development, and production is to be implied from the relation of the parties and the object of the lease; and that this covenant was not abrogated by the expiration of the primary term of ten years. \n1\n The matter in dispute is the respondent's alleged failure to comply with its obligation. The petitioners say that, if the lessee with good reason believes there is no mineral to be obtained by further drilling, it should give up the lease; the respondent insists that, as there is only a possibility of finding mineral, no prudent operator would presently develop, but the mere possibility entitles it to hold the lease, because it is producing oil from a portion of the area.\n We think the respondent's contention cannot be sustained. With respect to a lease quite similar in its provisions, it was said in Brewster v. Lanyon Zinc Co. (C.C.A.) 140 F. 801, 810, 814:\n'The implication necessarily arising from these provisions-the intention which they obviously reflect-is that if, at the end of the five- year period prescribed for original exploration and development, oil and gas, one or both, had been found to exist in the demised premises in paying quantities, the work of exploration, development, and production should proceed with reasonable diligence for the common benefit of the parties, or the premises be surrendered to the lessor. ... \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n 'The object of the operations being to obtain a benefit or profit for both lessor and lessee, it seems obvious, in the absence of some stipulation to that effect, that neither is made the arbiter of the extent to which or the diligence with which the operations shall proceed, and that both are bound by the standard of what is reasonable.'\n\n After commenting on the fact that the lessee is not required to carry the operations on beyond the point where they will be profitable to him, even though some benefit to the lessor will result, the court adds:\n'Whether or not in any particular instance such diligence is exercised depends upon a variety of circumstances. ... Whatever, in the circumstances, would be reasonably expected of operators of ordinary prudence, having regard to the interests of both lessor and lessee, is what is required.'\n\n This definition of the scope of the implied covenant has been generally adopted in decisions of federal and state courts. \n2\n The facts demonstrate that the respondent has not complied with its obligations. It has held a half section for seventeen years without the drilling of an exploratory well, and claims to be entitled to hold the lease for an indefinite period with no exploration unless some other operator brings in a producing well on adjoining land, or fresh geological data comes to light. The two producing wells are on the 40 acres comprising the smaller of the adjacent areas embraced in the lease. The justification for the respondent's position is that the geologic data and the experience upon surrounding lands \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 281]\n\u00a0\n are both unfavorable to the discovery of oil or gas upon the east half of section 16 (the 320-acre tract). The respondent's officers state that they desire to hold this tract because it may contain oil; but they assert that they have no present intention of drilling at any time in the near or remote future. This attitude does not comport with the obligation to prosecute development with due regard to the interests of the lessor. The production of oil on a small portion of the leased tract cannot justify the lessee's holding the balance indefinitely and depriving the lessor, not only of the expected royalty from production pursuant to the lease, but of the privilege of making some other arrangement for availing himself of the mineral content of the land.\n The decisions3 on which the Circuit Court of Appeals relied recognize and apply the rule of Brewster v. Lanyon Zinc Co., supra, but are distinguishable because of a difference in the circumstances in which the rule was applied. Some of them involved the duty to drill wells to offset others brought into production on adjoining lands; others turned upon a waiver by the lessor of the lessee's obligation to explore, or the meaning of the phrase 'so long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.' In none of them was there a neglect to explore or develop for any such period as is here shown, or an expressed intention not to do so, in a comparable situation.\n The petitioners are entitled to relief in equity as they have no adequate remedy at law. Brewster v. Lanyon Zinc Co., supra, pp. 818, 819, of 140 F.; Guffey v. Smith, \n237 \nU.S. 101, 114\n, 35 S.Ct. 526. The District Court decreed a cancellation as to all except a strip 400 feet wide along the southern boundary of the S.E. 1\/4 of the S.W. 1\/4 of section 16, con- \n\n[292 U.S. 272, 282]\n\u00a0\n taining about 8 acres. The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals thought that a decree should be entered canceling the lease as to the 320- acre tract (the E. 1\/2 of the section) unless within a reasonable time an exploratory well should be drilled therein to the Mississippi lime, and that the 40 acres embraced in the S.E. 1\/4 of the S.W. 1\/4 of section 16 should remain under the lease. We are of opinion that such a decree would recognize and protect the equities of both parties.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Allegheny Oil Co. v.

Shaffer, Jr., all of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henry B. Street and Province M. Pogue, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In granting the writ of certiorari, we limited our review to the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court under section 23b of the Bankruptcy Act. That provision, and its immediate context, section 23a, are set forth in the margin. \n1\n 44 Stat. 664, 11 U.S.C.  46(a)(b), 11 USCA  46(a, b).\n This is a plenary suit brought by respondent, trustee in bankruptcy, in the District Court to enjoin the sale of certain property, alleged to be fixtures, attached to the manufacturing plant of the bankrupt, which petitioner, as sheriff, was threatening to sell under an execution issued more than four months prior to the bankruptcy proceeding upon a judgment recovered against the bank- \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n rupt in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, Ohio. The trustee's petition alleged that sale by the sheriff, pending a determination whether or not the property was a part of the realty, would cause irreparable damage to the bankrupt's estate. The trustee contends that the sheriff's levy upon the property in question was invalid under the law of Ohio, and that at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy all writs of venditioni exponas, or orders for the sale of the real estate, had expired, and also that, as there were mortgages upon the property, the appropriate method of the enforcing the judgment was by a creditor's bill.\n The sheriff first appeared specially, asserting his claim by virtue of levy under execution, and sought dismissal of the suit upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction. Shortly after, the sheriff withdrew his motion to dismiss, entered his general appearance, and made answer to the petition, expressly consenting that the District Court should hear and determine all matters to which the petition referred. The sheriff in this answer, after stating that he had levied upon personal property and real estate of the judgment debtor, said that a controversy had arisen whether or not certain items of 'chattel property,' set forth in the exhibit attached to the trustee's petition, were 'in law fixtures and therefore a part of the real estate'; that it would be necessary to have that question determined so that he might be advised as to what part of the 'chattel property' he had a right to sell under the execution; and that he did not know 'as a matter of law whether the levy so made by him upon the real estate' was or was not a valid levy, and therefore he put the plaintiff 'on proof thereof.' The next day the sheriff asked leave to withdraw his answer. The disposition of that motion does not appear and the court below has assumed that it was not pressed. Later, the sheriff again \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n moved to dismiss the cause for the want of jurisdiction, and the motion was granted.\n This order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court concluded that the validity of the trustee's claim, and of that of the sheriff, depended upon disputed facts and issues of law; that the adverse claim of the sheriff was substantial and that its merits could be adjudged only in a plenary suit; that this proceeding should be treated as one of that nature and that there was consent to the jurisdiction of the District Court within the meaning of section 23b of the Bankruptcy Act. As the case had not been heard upon its merits, and the record presented no findings of fact or conclusions of law, the Circuit Court of Appeals did not deal with any question except that of jurisdiction and directed that the cause be remanded to the District Court with instructions to hear and determine the controversy.\n The trustee's petition, which the Circuit Court of Appeals treated as a bill of complaint, did not allege diversity of citizenship. Nor did it contain clear and sufficient averments showing that the complainant, as against the sheriff claiming under a judgment recovered and an execution issued more than four months before the bankruptcy, had possession of the property in question by virtue of which the District Court would have jurisdiction of the suit irrespective of the consent of the defendant. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The case thus turns on the effect of the sheriff's consent under section 23b. The sheriff contends that he had no authority to give the consent; but he was the defendant \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n in the suit and his consent was actually given. We find no ground for concluding that the consent was invalid.\n Conflicting views have been held of the meaning of the provision for consent in section 23b. In one view, the provision relates merely to venue, that is, only to a consent to the 'local jurisdiction.' Matthew v. Coppin ( C.C.A.) 32 F.(2d) 100, 101. See, also, McEldowney v. Card (C.C.) 193 F. 475, 479; De Friece v. Bryant (D.C.) 232 F. 233, 236; Operators' Piano Co. v. First Wisconsin Trust Co. (C.C.A.) 283 F. 904, 906; Coyle v. Duncan Spangler Coal Co. (D.C.) 288 F. 897, 901; Stiefel v. 14th Street & Broadway Realty Corporation (C.C.A.) 48 F.(2d) 1041, 1043. Compare Lovell v. Isidore Newman & Son, \n227 \nU.S. 412, 426\n, 33 S.Ct. 375. It has been said that if section 23b affects 'substantive jurisdiction,' as distinct from venue, section 23a appears to be redundant. Stiefel v. 14th Street & Broadway Realty Corporation, supra. The opposing view was set forth by the court below in Toledo Fence & Post Co. v. Lyons (C.C.A.) 290 F. 637, 645, and that decision was followed in the instant case. See, also, Boonville National Bank v. Blakey (C.C.A.) 107 F. 891, 893; Seegmiller v. Day (C.C.A.) 249 F. 177, 178; Stiefel v. 14th Street & Broadway Realty Corporation, supra; Lowenstein v. Reikes (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 933, 935. It proceeds upon the ground that the Congress had power to permit suits by trustees in bankruptcy in the federal courts against adverse claimants, regardless of diversity of citizenship, and that by section 23b the Congress intended that the federal courts should have that jurisdiction in cases where the defendant gave consent, and, without that consent, in cases which fell within the stated exceptions.\n We think that the latter view is the correct one. The provisions of the earlier bankruptcy acts and the purpose and significance of section 23 of the Act of 1898, as originally enacted (30 Stat. 552), were elaborately considered in Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 \nU.S. 524\n, 20 S.Ct. 1000. Section 8 of the Act of August 19, 1841 (5 Stat. 446), conferred on the Circuit Courts con- \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n current jurisdiction with the District Courts of all suits, at law or in equity, between assignees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants. This broad grant of jurisdiction was continued in section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 518). Lathrop v. Drake, \n91 U.S. 516\n. The Act of 1867 recognized and emphatically declared the distinction between proceedings in bankruptcy, properly so called, and independent suits between assignees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants. Jurisdiction of such suits was conferred upon the District Courts and Circuit Courts of the United States by the express provision to that effect in section 2 of that act, and was not derived from the other provisions of sections 1 and 2, conferring jurisdiction of proceedings in bankruptcy. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, supra, page 533 of 178 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 1000. The jurisdiction of such suits in law and equity was of the same character as that conferred upon the Circuit Courts by the eleventh section of the Judiciary Act of Sept. 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 78 (Morgan v. Thornhill, 11 Wall. 65, 80) and the conferring of that jurisdiction upon the federal courts did not divest or impair the jurisdiction of the state courts over like cases. Eyster v. Gaff, \n91 U.S. 521\n, 525; Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, supra, pages 532, 533 of 178 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 1000\n\n\n It was with this legislative background that the Congress undertook the framing of the Act of 1898 (30 Stat. 544). The distinction between proceedings in bankruptcy and suits between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants was maintained. As appellate jurisdiction had been vested in the Circuit Courts of Appeals by the Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 826), the Act of 1898, in lieu of the 'general superintendence and jurisdiction' given to the Circuit Courts by the Act of 1867 (section 2) 'of all cases and questions' arising in bankruptcy, conferred upon the Circuit Courts of Appeals the jurisdiction 'to superintend and revise in matter of law the proceedings of the several inferior courts of bankruptcy within their jurisdiction.' \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n Section 24b (11 USCA  47(b). But the Circuit Courts at that time were still courts of original jurisdiction and, by section 23 of the Act of 1898, the Congress provided the extent to which the Circuit Courts should have jurisdiction of suits at law or in equity between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants. Section 23, as originally enacted, was as follows (30 Stat. 552, 553):\n'Sec. 23. Jurisdiction of United States and State Courts.-\n\n'a The United States circuit courts shall have jurisdiction of all controversies at law and in equity, as distinguished from proceedings in bankruptcy, between trustees as such and adverse claimants concerning the property acquired or claimed by the trustees, in the same manner and to the same extent only as though bankruptcy proceedings had not been instituted and such controversies had been between the bankrupts and such adverse claimants.\n\n'b Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.\n\n'c The United States circuit courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of bankruptcy, within their respective territorial limits, of the offenses enumerated in this Act.'\n\n Section 23a thus related exclusively to the Circuit Courts. Section 23b applied both to the Circuit Courts and the District Courts, as well as to the state courts. This appears, said the Court in Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, supra (page 536 of 178 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 1000, 1005) 'not only by the clear words of the title of the section, but also by the use, in this clause, of the general words, 'the courts,' as contrasted with the specific words, 'the United States circuit courts,' in the \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n first and in the third clauses.' The argument that if section 23b affects 'substantive jurisdiction,' section 23a is redundant, loses sight of the original distinction and application of the section and of its historical development.\n By section 289 of the Judicial Code of 1911 (36 Stat. 1167), 28 USCA  431 note, the Circuit Courts were abolished; and by section 291 of that act (28 USCA  431 note) it was provided that wherever, in any law not embraced within the Judicial Code, any power or duty is conferred or imposed upon the Circuit Courts, that power and duty shall be deemed to be conferred and imposed upon the District Courts. This provision had the effect of amending section 23a of the Bankruptcy Act so as to make it apply to the United States District Courts instead of the United States Circuit Courts. Formal amendment, to conform the language of the section to the fact, was made by the Act of May 27, 1926,  8, 44 Stat. 664 (11 USCA  46(a).\n In enacting section 23, it was clearly the intent of the Congress that the federal courts should not have the unrestricted jurisdiction of suits between trustees in bankruptcy and adverse claimants which these courts had exercised under the broad provisions of section 2 of the Act of 1867. The purpose was to leave such controversies to be heard and determined for the most part in the state courts 'to the greater economy and convenience of litigants and witnesses.' But no reason appeared for a denial of jurisdiction to the federal court if the defendant, the adverse claimant, consented to be sued in that court. The Congress, by virtue of its constitutional authority over bankruptcies (Const. Art. 1,  8), could confer or withhold jurisdiction to entertain such suits and could prescribe the conditions upon which the federal courts should have jurisdiction. See Sherman v. Bingham, 21 Fed.Cas. 1270, 1272, No. 12,762. Exercising that power, the Congress prescribed in section 23b the condition of consent on the part of the defendant sued by the trustee. Section 23b was thus in effect a grant of jurisdiction subject to that condition. \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 375]\n\u00a0\n That this was the interpretation by this Court of section 23b, in its original form, is shown not only by the statement of the result of the Court's analysis in the Bardes Case, supra (page 538 of 178 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 1000, 1006) but quite clearly by its formal disposition of the questions before it. The Bardes Case was a bill in equity in the District Court by a trustee in bankruptcy to set aside a conveyance of property in fraud of creditors. The District Court dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction and the case came here on direct appeal with a certificate by the District Judge submitting the questions which had arisen. This Court considered those questions and specifically answered the first and second questions as follows:\n'1st. The provisions of the second clause of section 23 of the bankrupt act of 1898 control and limit the jurisdiction of all courts, including the several district courts of the United States, over suits brought by trustees in bankruptcy to recover or collect debts due from third parties, or to set aside transfers of property to third parties, alleged to be fraudulent as against creditors, including payments in money or property to preferred creditors.\n\n'2d. The district court of the United States can, by the proposed defendants' consent, but not otherwise, entertain jurisdiction over suits brought by trustees in bankruptcy to set aside fraudulent transfers of money or property, made by the bankrupt to third parties before the institution of the proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n\n As there was no pretense of consent of the defendant in that case, the District Court was found to be without jurisdiction and its decree was accordingly affirmed. Compare Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 22 S.Ct. 269; Spencer v. Duplan Silk Co., \n191 \nU.S. 526, 531\n, 24 S.Ct. 174; Whitney v. Wenman, \n198 \nU.S. 539, 552\n, 25 S.Ct. 778; Bush v. Elliott, \n202 \nU.S. 477, 479\n, 483 S., 26 S.Ct. 668; Harris v. First National Bank, \n216 \nU.S. 382, 383\n, 30 S.Ct. 296; Wood v. A. Wilbert's Sons Shingle & Lumber Co., \n226 \nU.S. 384, 387\n, 33 S.Ct. 125.\n After the decision in the Bardes Case, and by section 8 of the Act of February 5, 1903 (32 Stat. 797, 798), section 23b was \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 376]\n\u00a0\n amended by adding, after the words 'unless by consent of the proposed defendant,' the following: 'except suits for the recovery of property under section 60, subdivision b, and section 67, subdivision e.' 11 USCA  46 note.\n The excepted suits are those brought by the trustee in bankruptcy to recover property transferred by the bankrupt in effecting preferences made voidable by the Act, and suits to recover property conveyed by the bankrupt in fraud of creditors within four months prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. The effect of the exception was to remove, as to these classes of cases, the requirement in section 23b of the consent of the defendant as a condition of the exercise of jurisdiction. The Act of 1903 also amended sections 60b, 67e, and 70e, so as to provide that in suits to recover property under those sections 'any court of bankruptcy,' and 'any state court' which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, 'shall have concurrent jurisdiction,' Act of February 5, 1903,  13, 16, 32 Stat. 799, 800 (11 USCA  96 note, 107(e), 110(e). The scope of the amendment of section 23b by the Act of 1903, in the light of the amendment by the same act of section 70e-a question which was left undetermined in Harris v. First National Bank, supra (page 385 of 216 U.S., 30 S.Ct. 296)-was passed upon in Wood v. A. Wilbert's Sons Shingle & Lumber Co., supra (pages 389, 390 of 226 U.S., 33 S.Ct. 125, 128). The Court there decided that the amendment of section 70e could not be regarded as intended to create a conflict with the amendment of section 23b, which did not include in the exception suits brought under section 70e. The Court said: 'In other words, the respective sections and their subdivisions confer jurisdiction on the designated courts so far as it is dependent upon the character of the suits, but when the condition expressed in subdivision b of section 23 exists, the consent of the defendant determines the court, except when the suit is 'for the recovery of property under section 60, subdivision b, and section 67, \n\n[293 U.S. 367, 377]\n\u00a0\n subdivision e.' These special exceptions exclude any other.'\n By the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 840), section 23b was further amended so as to include in the exception suits for the recovery of property under section 70, subd. e, 11 USCA  46. See Weidhorn v. Levy, \n253 \nU.S. 268, 272\n, 40 S.Ct. 534.\n We think that the exceptions thus established by the amending acts show clearly that it was the intent of the Congress that section 23b should operate as a grant of jurisdiction to the federal court of suits brought by a trustee in bankruptcy against adverse claimants, provided the defendant consented to be sued in that court, although the bankrupt could not have brought suit there if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, and that, in suits falling within the exceptions, the federal court should have jurisdiction without the defendant's consent. The question was not necessarily involved in the case of Lovell v. Isidore Newman & Son, \n227 \nU.S. 412, 426\n, 33 S.Ct. 375, and so far as the language of the opinion indicated a contrary view, it is not approved. Compare MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 263, 268\n, 52 S.Ct. 505; Page v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation, \n286 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 272 S., 52 S.Ct. 507.\n We conclude that the court had jurisdiction in the instant case, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals setting aside the order of the District Court and directing that court to hear and determine the controversy upon its merits is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 23a, 23b, as amended by the Act of May 27, 1926, c. 406,  8, 11 USCA  46(a, b), are as follows:\n'Sec. 23.

Beardslee, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By complaint filed in the District Court for Oregon, May 22, 1929, petitioner sought judgment against the United States for benefits said to have accrued to her under war risk insurance taken out by her son, Elias Melvin Zimmerman, in 1917. While enlisted in the Naval Service he died aboard the United States Steamship Conestoga June 30, 1921\n\n\n The United States denied liability upon the ground that the policy lapsed for nonpayment of premiums and was not in force after April 30, 1918.\n By agreement the cause was tried without a jury. The District Court gave judgment for the complainant, petitioner here; the Circuit Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion and ordered reversal.\n There is no dispute in respect of he essential facts.\n Zimmerman enlisted in the Navy March 18, 1914, as an apprentice seaman and was honorably discharged at the expiration of his term March 17, 1918; he re-enlisted March 18, 1918, and received an honorable discharge September 15, 1919; he enlisted again September 16, \n\n[292 U.S. 337, 339]\n\u00a0\n 1919, and served until death. He held a continuous service certificate; but when this was actually received does not appear.* War risk insurance amounting to $10,000 issued upon his application dated December 3, 1917, which contained the following clause, never formally revoked: 'I authorize the necessary monthly deduction from my pay, or if insufficient, from any deposits with the United States in payment of the premiums as they become due, unless they be otherwise paid.'\n The policy provided for monthly payments in the event of death or total disability occurring while it remained in force. It designated petitioner as the beneficiary. A Bulletin issued by the Director of War Risk Insurance, as authorized by the War Risk Insurance Act, 40 Stat. 398, 409, in force when the policy became effective, contained the following regulation: 'Premiums shall be paid monthly on or before the 1st day of each calendar month and will unless the insured otherwise elects in writing be deducted from any pay due him from the United States or deposit by him with the United States and if so to be deducted a premium when due will be treated as paid whether or not such deduction is in fact made, if upon the due date the United States owe him on account of pay or deposit an amount sufficient to provide the premium; provided that the premium may be paid within thirty-one (31) days after the expiration of the month during which period of grace the insurance\n * Navy Regulations, 1913.\n'Paragraph 3529(1)-Any man who, having been honorably discharged, or discharged with a recommendation for reenlistment, shall within four months thereafter reenlist for four years shall receive in exchange for his discharge a continuous service certificate. ...\n\n'Paragraph 4427(22)-If any enlisted man or apprentice, being honorably discharged, shall reenlist for four years within four months thereafter, he shall, on presenting his honorable discharge or on accounting in a satisfactory manner for its loss, be entitled to a gratuity of four months' pay equal in amount to that which he would have received if he had been employed in actual service. ...' \n\n[292 U.S. 337, 340]\n\u00a0\n shall remain in full force'; also 'In case the applicant does not desire the premium to be deducted from his pay he should so state in writing at the time of making application; but if no election is made it shall have the effect to provide for such deduction from his pay or if such pay be insufficient any balance from his deposit.'\n\n Payments due upon the policy were met by deductions of $6.50 monthly from the assured's pay until the end of his first enlistment. Thereafter no deduction was made; he executed no new authorization for deductions; no premium was actually met. He was entitled to pay for every day from March 18, 1914, until his death.\n When honorably discharged from his first enlistment, Zimmerman received the full amount then due him; also, when discharged from his second enlistment. All pay due at his death was received by his mother, the petitioner. The records of the Navy Department 'disclose that he never made any allotment for War Risk Insurance Premiums other than the authorization for deduction of premiums at the time of his application for insurance.'\n Petitioner insists that although no premium upon the policy was actually paid after March, 1918, it nevertheless remained in full force and effect during the assured's active service because of the unrestricted authorization for deductions in his application of December 3, 1917, never thereafter revoked in writing, since there was due him at the end of each month enough to meet the required premiums and the Navy Department was under a duty to make proper deductions.\n In behalf of the United States the insistence is that the authorization for deductions was ineffective after the expiration of the first enlistment during which it was given. Moreover, that the action of the assured in accepting his pay without deduction for premiums during all of his second and third enlistments-more than three years-is enough to show acquiescence in the contempo- \n\n[292 U.S. 337, 341]\n\u00a0\n raneous construction by the administrative officers; and, no circumstance indicating the contrary, this establishes his purpose to surrender the contract as he properly could have done.\n We are of opinion there is enough to show abandonment of the contract by the assured and upon that ground the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n After expiration of the first enlistment, neither party to the contract appears to have treated as operative the authorization for deductions contained in the application. Zimmerman accepted every month during a considerable period the full amount due him; made no effort to provide for payment of premiums when he must have been aware that no deduction had been made. There is nothing to indicate that he did not have full possession of his faculties or lacked intelligence or probity, or that he was unaware of the important circumstances. If he had supposed the insurance remained in effect, common honesty would have moved him to provide for actual payment of the premiums. He must have known they had not been met. In the circumstances his conduct, we think, adequately indicates the exercise of his right to abandon the policy. See Sawyer v. United States (C.C.A.) 10 F.(2d) 416; United States v. Barry (C.C.A.) 67 F.( 2d) 763; contra, Unger v. United States (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 946.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSNYDER v. COM. OF MASS.(1934)\nNo. 241\nArgued: November 7, 1933Decided: January 8, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. C. Webber and Henry P. Fielding, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph E. Warner, of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of massachusetts.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 9, 1931, James M. Kiley was shot to death at a gasoline station at Somerville, Mass. Three men, Garrick, Donnellon, and the petitioner, Snyder, joined in the murder and in the attempted robbery that led to it. Garrick confessed to his part in the crime and became a witness for the state. Donnellon and Snyder were tried together, and sentenced to be put to death. The jury found upon abundant evidence that the guilt of each had \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 103]\n\u00a0\n been established beyond a reasonable doubt. At the trial and on appeal Snyder made the claim that through the refusal of the trial judge to permit him to be present at a view there had been a denial of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the conviction. 185 N.E. 376. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n At the opening of the trial there was a motion by the commonwealth that the jury be directed to view the scene of the crime. This motion was granted. In granting it the court acted under a Massachusetts statute which provides: 'The court may order a view by a jury impanelled to try a criminal case.' General Laws (Ter. Ed.) of Massachusetts, c. 234,  35. The court appointed counsel for Donnellon and for Snyder to represent their respective clients at the place to be viewed. Counsel for Donnellon moved that he be permitted to go there with his client after the view, but did not ask that his client be present with the jury. The court stated that such an order would probably be made. Counsel for Snyder moved that his client be permitted to view the scene with the jury, invoking the protection of the Federal Constitution. This motion was denied. The jurors were then placed in charge of bailiffs duly sworn. Accompanied by these bailiffs and also by the judge, the court stenographer, the district attorney, and the counsel for the defendants, they went forth to make their view.\n The first stopping place was at the filling station, 13 Somerville avenue. Entering the station, the district attorney pointed out to the jurors the particular parts of the building that he wished them to observe. He asked them to note the window at the rear, its position with reference to the entrance, the position of other windows to the right, the size of the room, the angle made by a partition, and the location of other objects. Counsel for \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 104]\n\u00a0\n Snyder called attention to the view from within the building looking out, and to the condition of the floor. Leaving the station by the front door, the jury viewed the building from the other side of the street. The district attorney asked that note be made of the driveway to the right and left of the station, the three pumps in front, and also the width of the street. Counsel for Snyder called attention to the nature of the travel, the setback of the station from the roadway, and in particular the possibility of observing from without what was taking place within. After the visit to the station, the jurors were taken a short distance away where they were asked to make note of the layout of the streets. They then went back to the station; the district attorney saying that he had omitted to direct their attention to the lights. The lights were then observed, the dimensions of a fence in front of them, and also, once more, the gasoline pumps. The district attorney stated that the middle pump was not there at the time of the homicide. Counsel for the petitioner answered that he had no knowledge on the subject, but would accept his adversary's statement. Thereupon the judge, who had guided the proceeding, stated the agreement to the jurors assembled on the walk. 'It is agreed,' he said, 'that at the time of the offense, that is, on April 9, 1931, there were but two pumps in front of the gasoline station, the one on the extreme right that is painted green, and the one on the extreme left that is painted black. Those two were there. The one in the middle, with the blue striping on it, was not there.'\n After the completion of the view, the group returned to the courthouse and the trial went on. In charging the jury the judge said, 'Now what have you before you on which to form your judgment and to render your finding and your verdict? The view, the testimony given by the witnesses and the exhibits comprise the evidence that is before you.' The question in this court is whether a \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 105]\n\u00a0\n view in the absence of a defendant who has made demand that he be present is a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The commonwealth of Massachusetts is free to regulate the procedure of its courts in accordance with its own conception of policy and fairness, unless in so doing it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.

White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 208\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Wagner Electric Mfg. Co. v. Lyndon, \n262 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 43 S.Ct. 589. Indictments by a grand jury may give way to informations by a public officer. Hurtado v. California, supra; Gaines v. Washington, \n277 \nU.S. 81, 86\n, 48 S.Ct. 468. The privilege against self- incrimination may be withdrawn and the accused put upon the stand as a witness for the state. Twining v. New Jersey, supra. What may not be taken away is notice of the charge and an adequate opportunity to be heard in defense of it. Twining v. New Jersey, supra; Powell v. Alabama, supra, pages 68, 71 of 287 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527; Holmes v. Conway, \n241 \nU.S. 624\n, 36 S.Ct. 681; Cf. Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421, 440\n, 52 S.Ct. 252.\n We assume in aid of the petitioner that in a prosecution for a felony the defendant has the privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 106]\n\u00a0\n against the charge. Thus, the privilege to confront one's accusers and cross-examine them face to face is assured to a defendant by the Sixth Amendment in prosecutions in the federal courts (Gaines v. Washington, supra, at page 85 of 277 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 468), and in prosecutions in the state courts is assured very often by the Constitutions of the states. For present purposes we assume that the privilege is reinforced by the Fourteenth Amendment, though this has not been squarely held. Cf. Schwab v. Berggren, \n143 \nU.S. 442, 448\n, 450 S., 12 S. Ct. 525; West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258\n, 24 S.Ct. 650; Diaz v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 442, 455\n, 32 S.Ct. 250, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1138; Blackmer v. United States, supra. Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 574\n, 4 S.Ct. 202, has been distinguished and limited. Frank v. Mangum, supra, pages 340, 341 of 237 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 582. Cf. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263. Again, defense may be made easier if the accused is permitted to be present at the examination of jurors or the summing up of counsel, for it will be in his power, if present, to give advice or suggestion or even to supersede his lawyers altogether and conduct the trial himself. See Lewis v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 370\n, 13 S.Ct. 136, a prosecution in the federal courts In such circumstances also we make a like assumption as to the scope of the privilege created by the Federal Constitution. Diaz v. United States, supra. No doubt the privilege may be lost by consent or at times even by misconduct. Diaz v. United States, supra. Cf. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, Digest of the Law of Criminal Procedure, art. 302. Our concern is with its extension when unmodified by waiver, either actual or imputed.\n In all the cases thus assumed the presence of the defendant satisfied the test that was put forward a moment ago as basic and decisive. It bears, or may fairly be assumed to bear, a relation, reasonably substantial, to his opportunity to defend. Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there a dictum, and still less a ruling, that the Fourteenth Amendment assures the privilege of presence when presence would be useless, or the benefit but a \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 107]\n\u00a0\n shadow. What has been said, if not decided, is distinctly to the contrary. Howard v. Kentucky, \n200 \nU.S. 164, 175\n, 26 S.Ct. 189; Valdez v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 432, 445\n, 37 S.Ct. 725, 728. Cf. Frank v. Mangum, supra, and particularly the dissenting opinion at page 346 of 237 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 582. The underlying principle gains point and precision from the distinction everywhere drawn between proceedings at the trial and those before and after. Many motions before trial are heard in the defendant's absence, and many motions after trial or in the prosecution of appeals. Cf. Schwab v. Berggren, supra, and Lewis v. United States, supra. Confusion of thought will result if we fail to mark the distinction between requirements in respect of presence that have their source in the common law, and requirements that have their source, either expressly or by implication, in the Federal Constitution. Confusion will result again if the privilege of presence be identified with the privilege of confrontation, which is limited to the stages of the trial when there are witnesses to be questioned. 'It was intended to prevent the conviction of the accused upon depositions or ex parte affidavits, and particularly to preserve the right of the accused to test the recollection of the witness in the exercise of the right of cross-examination.' Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 31 S.Ct. 590, 592. See, also, Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 3,  1395, 1397, collating the decisions. Nor has the privilege of confrontation at any time been without recognized exceptions, as, for instance, dying declarations or documentary evidence. Dowdell v. United States, supra. Cf. Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 17 S.Ct. 326; Motes v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 458, 472\n, 473 S., 20 S.Ct. 993. The exceptions are not even static, but may be enlarged from time to time if there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule. Commonwealth v. Slavski, 245 Mass. 405, 415, 140 N.E. 465, 29 A.L.R. 281. Cf. West v. Louisiana, supra. So far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, the presence of a defendant is a condition of due \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 108]\n\u00a0\n process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\n We are thus brought to an inquiry as to the relation between the defendant's presence at a view and the fundamental justice assured to him by the Constitution of the United States.\n At the outset, we consider a bare inspection and nothing more, a view where nothing is said by any one to direct the attention of the jury to one feature or another. The Fourteenth Amendment does not assure to a defendant the privilege to be present at such a time. There is nothing he could do if he were there, and almost nothing he could gain. The only shred of advantage would be to make certain that the jury had been brought to the right place and had viewed the right scene. If he felt any doubt about this, he could examine the bailiffs at the trial and learn what they had looked at. The risk that they would lie is no greater than the risk that attaches to testimony about anything. 'Constitutional law, like other mortal contrivances, has to take some chances.' Blinn v. Nelson, \n222 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 32 S.Ct. 1, 2, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 555. Here the chance is so remote that it dwindles to the vanishing point. If the bailiffs were to bear false witness as to the place they had shown, the lie would be known to the jury. There is no immutable principle of justice that secures protection to a defendant against so shadowy a risk. The argument is made that conceivably the place might have been changed and in a way that would be material. In that event the fact could be brought out by appropriate inquiry. There could be inquiry of witnesses in court and of counsel out of court. Description would disclose the conditions at the view, and the defendant or his witnesses could prove what the conditions were before. He could do nothing more though he had been there with the jury. Indeed, the record makes it clear that upon request he would have been allowed to go there afterwards in company with his \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 109]\n\u00a0\n counsel. Opportunity was ample to learn whatever there was need to know.\n If the risk of injustice to the prisoner is shadowy at its greatest, it ceases to be even a shadow when he admits that the jurors were brought to the right place and shown what it was right to see. That, in substance is what happened here. On the trial, photographs and diagrams of the scene of the homicide were put in evidence by the commonwealth and placed before the jury. There was no suggestion by the defendant or his counsel that these photographs and diagrams did not truly represent the place that had been seen upon the view. There was no suggestion of any change except the one that was conceded. The defendant took the stand and admitted that he was at the gasoline station at the time of the crime. He tried to reduce the grade of his wrongdoing by testifying that the shot had been fired by his codefendant, Donnellon, and that larceny, not robbery, was the aim of the conspiracy. \n1\n In the course of his testimony, he described his own and Donnellon's movements with the aid of the diagram in evidence. At the end of the trial he made a brief statement to the jury, supplementing the argument that had been made by his counsel. 'I am sorry' he said, 'that I had any part in the crime. I am sorry for the grief I have caused. But I did not fire the fatal shot. That is all.' Nowhere is there a suggestion of any doubt as to the place. Like concessions are implicit in the summing up of counsel. His argument reminds the jurors of what they had seen upon \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 110]\n\u00a0\n the view, and of the dimensions of the building, which are shown also on the diagram. The place is undisputed.\n If it be true that there is no denial of due process as the result of a bare inspection in the absence of a defendant, the question remains whether such a denial results where counsel are permitted, without any statement of the evidence, to point out particular features of the scene and to request the jury to observe them. The courts of Massachusetts hold that statements, thus restricted, are proper incidents of a view. 'The essential features may be pointed out by the counsel. No witnesses are heard. ... There can be no comment or discussion.' Commonwealth v. Dascalakis, 246 Mass. 12, 29, 140 N.E. 470, 477: 'One or two attorneys representing both the commonwealth and the defendant go on the view, it being permissible to them, in the presence of each other and of the officers of the court, merely to point out to the jury 'marks, matters, and things,' but not otherwise to speak to the jury.' Id. The rule in Massachusetts is that these acts are permissible, though the defendant is not present (Id.), and though he is kept away under protest. See Commonwealth v. Belenski, 276 Mass. 35, 176 N.E. 501, which was followed in the case at bar. Commonwealth v. Snyder, supra. We are to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment prescribes anything to the contrary.\n Obviously the difference between a view at which every one is silent and a view accompanied by a request to note this feature or another is one of degree, and nothing more. The mere bringing of a jury to a particular place, whether a building or a room or a wall with a bullet hole, is in effect a statement that this is the place which was the scene of the offense, and a request to examine it. When the tacit directions are made explicit, the defendant is not wronged unless the supplement of words so transforms the quality of the procedure that injustice will be done if the defendant is kept away. Statements to the jury \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 111]\n\u00a0\n pointing out the specific objects to be noted have been a traditional accompaniment of a view for about two centuries, if not longer. The Fourteenth Amendment has not displaced the procedure of the ages. Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, \n280 \nU.S. 218\n, 50 S.Ct. 94; Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94\n, 41 S.Ct. 433, 17 A.L.R. 873; Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at pages 100, 101, of 211 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 14.\n As early as 1747 there is the record of a precedent that exhibits the remedy in action. The practice then was to place the jury in the charge of 'showers,' who were sworn to lead them to the view. The defendant in a civil action complained that the plaintiff's shower had misbehaved himself in his comments to the jury. 'The court discharged the rule, being of opinion the showers may show marks, boundaries, etc., to enlighten the viewers, and may say to them, 'These are the places which on the trial we shall adapt our evidence to.\" Goodtitle v. Clark, Barnes, 457. At that time views were not taken in criminal cases without the consent of both the parties, the Crown as well as the defendant, except, it seems, upon indictments for maintaining a nuisance. Rex v. Redman, 1756, 1 Kenyon 384; s.c. Sayer's Rep. 303; Commonwealth v. Handren, 261 Mass. 294, 297, 158 N. E. 894; but see Anonymous, 1815, 2 Chitty 422. Cf. 1 Burr.Rep. 252. In 1825, however, a statute applicable to England and Wales supplied the defect of power, if defect there formerly had been. 6 George IV, c. 50, s. 23. Thereafter, in any case, 'either civil or criminal,' a view might be ordered in the discretion of the court. The form of oath administered to the showers appears in the reports. Thus, in Reg. v. Whalley, 1847, 2 Cox Crim. Rep. 231, the oath administered was this: 'You swear you will attend this jury and well and truly point out to them the place in which the offence for which the prisoner T.W. stands charged is alleged to have been committed; you shall not speak to them touching the supposed offence whereof the said T.W. is so charged, only so far as relates to describ- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 112]\n\u00a0\n ing the place aforesaid.' See, also, Reg. v. Martin, L.R., 1 Crown Cases Reserved 378; Tidd's Practice, vol. 2, pp. 797, 798; Gude's Crown Practice, London, 1828, vol. 2, pp. 655, 656. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 3,  1802, 1803, and cases cited. So also in our own country the power to order a view in criminal cases has been made certain by statutes enacted in nearly all the states (see the statutes collated in Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 2,  1163), though there are instances in which the power has been treated as inherent. State v. Perry, 121 N.C. 533, 27 S.E. 997, 61 Am.St.Rep. 683; Commonwealth v. Knapp, 9 Pick. (Mass.) 496, 515, 20 Am.Dec. 491. The statutes, when enacted, conform very generally to the practice in the English courts, provision being made for the presence of the judge, or, in his discretion, for the appointment of showers sworn in the ancient form. Cf. the statutes and decisions in Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 3,  1802, 1803, and vol. 2,  1163; and see President, etc., of Village of Brooklyn v. Patchen, 8 Wend. (N.Y.) 47, 65; State v. Perry, supra, at page 536 of 121 N.C., 27 S.E. 997, 61 Am.St.Rep. 683.\n When the scene is explained by showers who are not the counsel for the parties, a defendant gains nothing by being present at a view any more than he gains where there is only a bare inspection without an explanatory word. He has no privilege in such circumstances, and certainly no constitutional privilege, to speak to the showers and give suggestions or advice. 'We do not see what good the presence of the prisoner would do, as he could neither ask nor answer questions, nor in any way interfere with the acts, observations or conclusions of the jury.' People v. Bonney, 19 Cal. 426, 446. If they fail to point out anything material, he may prove the fact upon the trial and ask for another view. He had the same privilege here, for there was a stenographic transcript of all that was said and done. Never, at any stage of the proceeding, has there been a suggestion by the de- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 113]\n\u00a0\n fendant or his counsel that there was need of something more.\n The situation is not changed to his prejudice because the showers in this instance were the counsel for the parties. The choice of counsel for that purpose has its roots in ancient practice. Tidd's Practice, vol. 2, pp. 797, 798; Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 3,  1803; cf. 1 Burr.Rep. 252. Far from being harmful, it supplies an additional assurance that nothing helpful to either side will be overlooked upon the view. True, indeed, it is that, when counsel are the showers, the defendant may be able, if he is present, to give suggestion or advice, or so at least we may assume. Constitutional immunities and privileges do not depend upon these accidents. The Fourteenth Amendment does not say that showers are at liberty, in the absence of the defendant, to point out the things to be viewed if the showers are not counsel, but are not at liberty to do so if they happen to be counsel. The least a defendant must do, if he would annul the practice upon a view which the Commonwealth has approved by the judgment of its courts, is to show that in the particular case in which the practice is exposed to challenge there is a reasonable possibility that injustice has been done. Cf. Rutherford v. Commonwealth, 78 Ky. 639; Howard v. Kentucky, supra. No one can read what was said at this view in the light of the uncontroverted facts established at the trial, and have even a passing thought that the presence of Snyder would have been an aid to his defense.\n There is an approach to the subject from the viewpoint of history that clarifies the prospect. We may assume that the knowledge derived from an inspection of the scene may be characterized as evidence. Even if this be so, a view is not a 'trial' nor any part of a trial in the sense in which a trial was understood at common law. This is seen from two circumstances. In the first place, \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 114]\n\u00a0\n the judge is not required to be present at a view, though he may go there if he will. In the second place, the practice for many years was to have a committee of the jurors, the usual number being six, attend at the view to represent the whole body. See the rules laid down by Lord Mansfield in 1 Burr.Rep. 252; also the provisions of the Act of 6 George IV, c. 50,  23, 24 (1825), by which the practice was made uniform in criminal and civil cases; and compare Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 2,  1165, and the cases cited. We have no thought to suggest that a view by a part of a jury is permissible to-day. That question is not before us. There is significance, none the less, in the fact that it was permissible in England, the home of the principle that a defendant charged with felony has the privilege of confronting his accusers and of being present at his trial. Certain it is that in the land where these maxims had their genesis and from which they were carried to our shores the proceeding known as a trial was thought of as something very different from the proceeding known as a view. To transfer to a view the constitutional privileges applicable to a trial is to be forgetful of our history.\n A fertile source of perversion in constitutional theory is the tyranny of labels. Out of the vague precepts of the Fourteenth Amendment a court frames a rule which is general in form, though it has been wrought under the pressure of particular situations. Forthwith another situation is placed under the rule because it is fitted to the words, though related faintly, if at all, to the reasons that brought the rule into existence. A defendant in a criminal case must be present at a trial when evidence is offered, for the opportunity must be his to advise with his counsel, Powell v. Alabama, supra, and cross-examine his accusers, Dowdell v. United States, supra; Commonwealth v. Slavski, supra. Cf. Felts v. Murphy, \n201 \nU.S. 123\n, 26 S.Ct. 366. Let the words 'evidence' and 'trial' be extended \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 115]\n\u00a0\n but a little, and the privilege will apply to stages of the cause at which the function of counsel is mechanical or formal and at which a scene and not a witness is to deliver up its message. In such circumstances the solution of the problem is not to be found in dictionary definitions of evidence or trials. It is not to be found in judgments of the courts that at other times or in other circumstances the presence of a defendant is a postulate of justice. There can be no sound solution without an answer to the question whether in the particular conditions exhibited by the record the enforced absence of the defendant is so flagrantly unjust that the Constitution of the United States steps in to forbid it. What we are subjecting to revision is not the action of a Legislature excluding a defendant from a view at all times or in all conditions. What is here for revision is the action of the judicial department of a state excluding the defendant in a particular set of circumstances, and the justice or injustice of that exclusion must be determined in the light of the whole record. Cf. Howard v. Kentucky, supra; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 234\n, 235 S., 17 S.Ct. 581. Discretion has not been abdicated. To the contrary, the record makes it clear that discretion has been exercised. Much is made of a supposed analogy between a view and a photograph, but the analogy, whatever its superficial force, is partial and misleading. The photograph, to be admissible, should be verified by the oath of the photographer, who must be subject to cross-examination as to the manner of its taking. It is common knowledge that a camera can be so placed, and lights and shadows so adjusted, as to give a distorted picture of reality. Nor is there need for us to hold that conditions can never arise in which justice will be outraged if there is a view in the defendant's absence. Enough for present purposes that they have not arisen here. 'A statute may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 116]\n\u00a0\n to another.' Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, 108; Du Pont v. Commissioner, \n289 \nU.S. 685, 688\n, 53 S.Ct. 766. If this is true of the action of the legislative department of the state laying down a general rule, it is even more plainly true of the action of judicial or administrative officers dealing only with the instance. Cf. Nectow v. Cambridge, \n277 \nU.S. 183\n, 48 S.Ct. 447. We view the facts in their totality.\n True, indeed, it is that constitutional privileges or immunities may be conferred so explicitly as to leave no room for an inquiry whether prejudice to a defendant has been wrought through their denial. In saying this we put aside cases within the rule of de minimis. If the defendant in a federal court were to be denied the opportunity to be confronted with the 'witnesses against him,' the denial of the privilege would not be overlooked as immaterial because the evidence thus procured was persuasive of the defendant's guilt. In the same way, privileges, even though not explicit, may be so obviously fundamental as to bring us to the same result. A defendant who has been denied an opportunity to be heard in his defense has lost something indispensable, however convincing the ex parte showing. But here, in the case at hand, the privilege, if it exists, is not explicitly conferred, nor has the defendant been denied an opportunity to answer and defend. The Fourteenth Amendment has not said in so many words that he must be present every second or minute or even every hour of the trial. If words so inflexible are to be taken as implied, it is only because they are put there by a court, and not because they are there already, in advance of the decision. Due process of law requires that the proceedings shall be fair, but fairness is a relative, not an absolute, concept. It is fairness with reference to particular conditions or particular results. 'The due process clause does not impose upon \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 117]\n\u00a0\n the states a duty to establish ideal systems for the administration of justice, with every modern improvement and with provision against every possible hardship that may befall.' Ownbey v. Morgan, supra, page 110 of 256 U.S., 41 S.Ct. 433, 438, 17 A.L.R. 873. What is fair in one set of circumstances may be an act of tyranny in others. This court has not yet held that even upon a trial in court the absence of a defendant for a few moments while formal documents are marked in evidence will vitiate a judgment. \n2\n Cf. Commonwealth v. Kelly, 292 Pa. 418, 141 A. 246. But we do not need to dwell upon the measure of the privilege at such a time or in such conditions. Whatever it may be, not even an intimation will be found in our decisions that there is a denial of due process if the accused be excluded from a view, though present at every stage of the proceedings in the court. It is one thing to say that the prevailing practice is to permit the accused to accompany the jury, if he expresses such a wish. It is another thing to say that the practice may not be changed without a denial of his privileges under the Constitution of the United States. To hold this in the light of the historic concept of a view as something separate from a trial in court and in the light of the shadowy relation between the defendant's \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 118]\n\u00a0\n presence at such a time and his ability to defend is to travel far away from the doctrine of Hurtado v. California, and Twining v. New Jersey.\n One episode at the view must have a word of criticism. The statement by the judge that one of the three pumps was not there at the homicide goes beyond the bounds of explanation appropriate for showers. No objection on this score was made by the defendant, though he had or could have had the minutes of the proceeding. The blunder did not harm him, for there is no hint in all the evidence that the presence or absence of the pump had any bearing on the verdict. The situation is much the same as in cases where there has been misconduct by the jury. The verdict is not upset for such a cause, if there was no substantial harm. People v. Johnson, 110 N.Y. 134, 144, 17 N.E. 684; People v. Dunbar Contracting Co., 215 N.Y. 416, 426, 109 N.E. 554; United States v. Davis (C.C.) 103 F. 457, 467. But there is another answer more convincing, if these are insufficient. After returning from the view, the district attorney offered in evidence a diagram of the station, and said to the jury, 'It is agreed that this third pump was not there at the time of the offense.' To this, defendant and his counsel gave assent by acquiescence. In effect, the agreement was thus renewed and confirmed as if then made for the first time. The defendant was not hurt because it had been made once before.\n Whether a defendant must be present at a view has been considered in the state courts with varying conclusions. Nearly always the argument has been directed to the local constitutions, generally to a provision that the accused must be confronted with the witnesses against him, sometimes a specific mandate that he be present at the trial. Never, so far as our search of the books informs us, has the privilege been established in opposition to the \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 119]\n\u00a0\n local practice as an essential condition of due process under the Federal Constitution. Some courts have put their decision on the ground that a view is part of the trial. State v. McGinnis, 12 Idaho, 336, 85 P. 1089; Freeman v. Commonwealth, 226 Ky. 850, 10 S.W.(2d) 827; Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 619, 115 S.E. 679, 30 A.L.R. 1345; Benton v. State, 30 Ark. 328, 350. Others have held that it is not. People v. Thorn, 156 N.Y. 286, 50 N.E. 947, 42 L.R.A. 368; State v. Rogers, 145 Minn. 303, 177 N.W. 358; Washington v. State, 86 Fla. 533, 98 So. 605; State v. Mortensen, 26 Utah, 312, 73 P. 562, 633. Cf. State v. Congdon, 14 R.I. 458, 463; State v. Hilsinger, 167 Wash. 427, 437, 438, 9 P.(2d) 357. A trial, they remind us, is appointed to be held in a courthouse or a place designated by statute with a judge or magistrate presiding. People v. Thorn, at page 297 of 156 N.Y. 50 N.E. 947, 42 L.R.A. 368. A view may be had anywhere. Some courts, placing the emphasis on the privilege of confrontation, have thought that a view is equivalent to an examination of a witness, and that the privilege of attendance may not even be waived. Noell v. Commonwealth, supra; State v. McCausland, 82 W.Va. 525, 96 S.E. 938; Benton v. State, supra; Foster v. State, 70 Miss. 755, 12 So. 822; State v. Stratton, 103 Kan. 226, 173 P. 300. Other courts have held, and plainly with the better reason, that physical objects are not witnesses, even though they have the quality of evidence, and that the defendant is at liberty to waive the privilege to view them, if such a privilege exists. People v. Thorn, supra; Elias v. Territory, 9 Ariz. 1, 76 P. 605, 11 Ann. Cas. 1153; Blythe v. State, 47 Ohio, 234, 24 N.E. 268; State v. Hartley, 22 Nev. 342, 40 P. 372, 28 L.R.A. 33; State v. Buzzell, 59 N.H. 65. Cf. Patton v. United States, supra. \n3\n Still others, though conceding the possibility of \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 120]\n\u00a0\n waiver, uphold the privilege to be present if due demand is made. People v. Bush, 68 Cal. 623, 10 P. 169; People v. Auerbach, 176 Mich. 23, 141 N.W. 869, Ann.Cas. 1915B, 557; Carroll v. State, 5 Neb. 31; State v. Hilsinger, supra; Sasse v. State, 68 Wis. 530, 32 N.W. 849; Chance v. State, 156 Ga. 428, 119 S.E. 303; People v. Palmer, 43 Hun (N.Y.) 397. Massachusetts takes the position that waiver is unnecessary and that the defendant may be excluded in the discretion of the judge. Commonwealth v. Belenski, supra; Commonwealth v. Snyder, supra. So also does Minnesota. State v. Rogers, supra. In none of the cases where the privilege was upheld did the defendant make the claim that there had been an infringement of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The decisions in the federal courts are, none of them, controlling. Howard v. Kentucky, supra, sustained a judgment of conviction against the claim of a denial of due process where the court, in the absence of the defendant, had discharged a juror for misconduct, and substituted another. There was evidence, however, leading to an \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 121]\n\u00a0\n inference of waiver by the defendant and his counsel. Diaz v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 442\n, 32 S.Ct. 250, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1138, had to do with the privilege of confrontation, and drew an inference of waiver where the defendant had willfully absented himself after the trial had been begun. Cf. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, Digest of the Law of Criminal Procedure, Art. 302; Smellie's Case, 14 Crim. App. Reports 128. Frank v. Mangum, supra, found a waiver of the privilege of presence at the rendition of the verdict. None of these cases was concerned with the procedure at a view. Valdez v. United States, supra, considered a provision of the Philippine Code which confers the privilege of confrontation, and held that consistently therewith the scene of the crime might be viewed by the judge with the consent of the defendant's counsel, though without the knowledge of the client. The court added that, 'aside from any question of waiver,' it would be pressing the privilege of confrontation too far to apply it in such circumstances, and, moreover, that in the circumstances of the case the absence of the defendant was plainly immaterial, it 'is difficult to divine how the inspection ... added to or took from the case as presented.'\n We find it of no moment that the judge in this case described the view as evidence. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has said of a view that 'its chief purpose is to enable the jury to understand better the testimony which has or may be introduced.' Commonwealth v. Dascalakis, supra. Even so, its inevitable effect is that of evidence, no matter what label the judge may choose to give it. Commonwealth v. Handren, supra. Such is the holding of many well-considered cases. Wigmore, vol. 2,  1168, p. 705 et seq., vol. 3,  1802, 1803, collating the decisions. To say that the defendant may be excluded from the scene if the court tells the jury that \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 122]\n\u00a0\n the view has no other function than to give them understanding of the evidence, but that there is an impairment of the constitutional privileges of a defendant thus excluded if the court tells the jury that the view is part of the evidence-to make the securities of the constitution depend upon such quiddities is to cheapen and degrade them.\n The law, as we have seen, is sedulous in maintaining for a defendant charged with crime whatever forms of procedure are of the essence of an opportunity to defend. Privileges so fundamental as to be inherent in every concept of a fair trial that could be acceptable to the thought of reasonable men will be kept inviolate and inviolable, however crushing may be the pressure of incriminating proof. But justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a filament. We are to keep the balance true.\n The Constitution and statutes and judicial decisions of the commonwealth of Massachusetts are the authentic forms through which the sense of justice of the people of that commonwealth expresses itself in law. We are not to supersede them on the ground that they deny the essentials of a trial because opinions may differ as to their policy or fairness. Not all the precepts of conduct precious to the hearts of many of us are immutable principles of justice, acknowledged semper ubique et ab omnibus (Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 609\n, 23 S.Ct. 168), wherever the good life is a subject of concern. There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into contempt-that discredit will even touch the great immunities assured by the Fourteenth Amendment-if gossamer possibilities of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience to local law, and set the guilty free.\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 123]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n The petitioner and two others were charged with murder committed in an attempt to rob a gasoline station. The petitioner and one of his codefendants were tried together; the third testified for the commonwealth.\n There is no dispute that when the three embarked on their evil enterprise all were armed, and it is not denied that they approached the station with intent to commit either larceny or robbery; but the record exhibits grave contradictions as to which of them fired the fatal shot, and as to the petitioner's abandonment of the common plan before the shot was fired. The situation and size of the station, its arrangement, its contents, the location and size of doors and windows, and the position of surrounding objects, were vital factors in corroboration or contradiction of the varying accounts given in the testimony of the three participants.\n After the jury had been impaneled and sworn, the district attorney moved for a view of the scene of the murder. The request was granted. The district attorney then made a short statement to the jury, telling them they were to view the premises and that when they returned from the view he would make a fuller opening. In the course of a colloquy between counsel and the judge the latter announced that he would appoint the defendants' counsel to go on the view as representing their respective clients. Counsel for the petitioner moved that his client be permitted to accompany the jury on the view, asserting this was the defendant's right under the Federal Constitution. The motion was denied and an exception reserved to the ruling.\n The judge, the official stenographer, the district attorney, and counsel for the defendants, accompanied the jury to the scene. The judge controlled the entire proceeding, and everything that was said or done was taken by the stenographer and made a part of the record of \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 124]\n\u00a0\n the trial. The pointing out of features of the scene by the district attorney went beyond a mere showing, and what he said closely approached argument. \n1\n During the progress of the view the court formulated and placed of record a stipulation as to changes which had occurred since the shooting. \n2\n In his charge to the jury the judge said: \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 125]\n\u00a0\n 'Now, what have you before you on which to form your judgment and to render your finding and verdict? The view, the testimony given by the witnesses, and the exhibits, comprise the evidence in this case, comprise the evidence that is before you.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n'As I say, it is for the jury to say, from all the evidence before you, taking into consideration what it is contended outside of the evidence that you have relative to the firing of any shot-the conduct of any of the parties just before and just after, and any appearances or any evidence that you may gather from the appearance of the locality itself, the testimony relative to the result of the shot, the course of it, and what was done. All that is a part of the surrounding evidence and the circumstances that you shall take into consideration. And then, having taken all the surrounding circumstances into consideration, it is for you to say from all the evidence before you, whether or not it was a withdrawal.'3\n\n In Massachusetts what the jury observes in the course of a view is evidence in the cause. In Tully v. Fitchburg R. Co., 134 Mass. 499, 503, it was said:\n'In many cases, and perhaps in most, except those for the assessment of damages, a view is allowed for the pur- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 126]\n\u00a0\n pose of enabling the jury better to understand and apply the evidence which is given in court; but it is not necessarily limited to this; and, in most cases of a view, a jury must of necessity acquire a certain amount of information, which they may properly treat as evidence in the case.'\n\n And in Commonwealth v. Dascalakis, 246 Mass. 12, 29, 30, 140 N.E. 470, 478, a prosecution for homicide, the Supreme Judicial Court held:\n'The things thus seen by the jurors could not well be banished from their minds. A view often dispenses with the necessity of detailed description by plan or word of mouth. Inevitably that which the jury see on a view will be utilized in reaching a verdict. In that sense that which is disclosed on a view is evidence. It is rightly described as such. Expressions to that effect are in numerous decisions.'\n\n In Commonwealth v. Handren, 261 Mass. 294, 297, 158 N.E. 894, 896, the court observed:\n'And the knowledge which the jurors thus acquire is evidence in the case.'\n\n Of such weight is the knowledge thus obtained that it may tip the scales in favor of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict. Thus in Hanks v. B. & A.R. Co., 147 Mass. 495, 499, 18 N.E. 218, 220, where the question was whether the case ought to have been submitted to the jury or a binding direction given, it was said:\n'It is to be observed that it (the jury) may have been materially aided by a view (taken by them) of the locality.'\n\n Compare Smith v. Morse, 148 Mass. 407, 410, 19 N.E. 393.\n It necessarily follows that the court may instruct the jury to take into consideration what they saw. In Commonwealth v. Mara, 257 Mass. 198, 209, 153 N.E. 793, 795, the ruling was: \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 127]\n\u00a0\n 'There was no error in the part of the instructions which permitted the jury to consider in deciding this question what they observed on the view.'\n And in Commonwealth v. Mercier, 257 Mass. 353, 365, 153 N.E. 834, 836, this was said:\n'The defendant also excepted to the statement of the judge to the jury that what they would see on the view would be competent evidence for them to consider. ... There was no error in the statement of the judge as to the right of the jury to consider as evidence what was seen by them on the view.'\n\n In the light of these rulings, which were concretely applied in this case, the question is whether the denial of petitioner's request to be present at the view deprived him of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. This court has never had occasion to pass upon the precise point; but many pronouncements regarding the requirements of due process seem to leave no doubt as to the proper resolution of the issue.\n The concept of due process is not technical. Form is disregarded if substantial rights are preserved. \n4\n In whatsoever proceeding, whether it affect property or liberty or life, the Fourteenth Amendment commands the observance of that standard of common fairness, the failure to observe which would offend men's sense of the decencies and proprieties of civilized life. It is fundamental that there can be no due process without reasonable notice and a fair hearing. \n5\n Though the usual and customary forms of procedure be disregarded, the hearing may neverthe- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 128]\n\u00a0\n less be fair, if it safeguards the defendant's substantial rights.\n The states need not adopt a particular form of accusation,6 or prescribe any one method of trial,7 or adhere to any set mode of selecting the triers of fact. \n8\n To conform to modern conditions, they may substitute a new form of procedure for one long practiced and recognized. \n9\n But, whatever the form or method of procedure adopted, they remain always subject to the prohibition against that which is commonly thought essentially unfair to him who is to be afforded a hearing. Tested by this principle, the trial of an issue beyond the claim asserted,10 the participation of a judge affected with a personal interest in the result, 11 the forcing of a trial under pressure of mob domination,12 or the deprivation of the right to present evidence bearing on the issue,13 have been adjudged to deny due process. And this court has recently decided that in the trial of a capital offense due process includes the right of the accused to be represented by counsel. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 97, 129]\n\u00a0\n his trial is of the very essence of due process. The trial as respects the prisoner's right of presence in the Constitutional sense does not include the formal procedure of indictment or preliminary steps antecedent to the hearing on the merits, or stages of the litigation after the rendition of the verdict, 15 but does comprehend the inquiry by the ordained trier of fact from beginning to end. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Speaking generally of the administration of criminal justice throughout the nation, this court has said:17 'A leading principle that pervades the entire law of criminal procedure is that, after indictment found, nothing shall be done in the absence of the prisoner;' and in enforcing the mandate of a territorial statute this language was used:18\n'Such being the relation which the citizen holds to the public, and the object of punishment for public wrongs, the legislature has deemed it essential to the protection of one whose life or liberty is involved in a prosecution for felony that he shall be personally present at the trial; that is, at every stage of the trial when his substantial rights may be affected by the proceedings against him. If he be deprived of his life or liberty without being so present, such deprivation would be without that due process of law required by the constitution.'\n\n To allay the apprehensions of the people lest the federal government invade their liberties, the first ten Amendments to the Constitution were adopted. The Sixth assures one accused of crime that, if prosecuted under federal law, he shall have a public trial, be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, be confronted with \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 130]\n\u00a0\n the witnesses against him, and have the assistance of counsel for his defense. But the purpose that all trials, in state as well as national tribunals, should not lack the same quality of fairness, is evidenced by the embodiment of a guaranty of similar import in the Constitution of every state in the Union. \n19\n Out of excess of caution the fundamental law of many of the states specifically safeguards the right of the accused, 'to appear and defend in person.' \n20\n But mere differences in phraseology have not obscured the fact that all these instruments were intended to secure the same great privilege-a fair hearing. Accordingly, the courts have uniformly and invariably held that the Sixth Amendment, as respects federal trials, and the analogous declarations of right of the state Constitutions touching trials in state courts, secure to the accused the privilege of presence at every stage of his trial. This court has so declared. In commenting upon the section of the Philippine Civil Government Act which extends to the accused in all criminal prosecutions 'the right to be heard by himself and counsel' (32 Stat. 692,  5), this was said:\n'An identical or similar provision is found in the Constitutions of the several states, and its substantial equiv- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 131]\n\u00a0\n alent is embodied in the 6th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. ... In cases of felony our courts, with substantial accord, have regarded it (the right so granted) as extending to every stage of the trial, inclusive of the empaneling of the jury and the reception of the verdict, and as being scarcely less important to the accused than the right of trial itself.'21\n\n And, as if to make assurance doubly sure, the Legislatures of many of the states have adopted statutes redundant to the constitutional mandate explicitly declaring the right of the accused to be present at his trial. \n 22\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of the universal acceptance of this fundamental rule of fairness that the prisoner may be present throughout his trial, it is not a matter of assumption but a certainty that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the observance of the rule.\n It has been urged that the prisoner's privilege of presence is for no other purpose than to safeguard his opportunity to cross-examine the adverse witnesses. But the privilege goes deeper than the mere opportunity to cross-examine, and secures his right to be present at every stage of the trial. The cases cited in the margin,23 while by no \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 132]\n\u00a0\n means exhausting the authorities, sufficiently illustrate and amply sustain the proposition that the right is fundamental and assures him who stands in jeopardy that he may in person, see, hear, and know all that is placed before the tribunal having power by its finding to deprive him of liberty or life. It would be tedious and unnecessary to quote the language used in vindication of the privilege. The books are full of discussions of the subject.\n The accused cannot cross-examine his own witnesses. Will it be suggested that, for this reason, he may be excluded from the court room while they give their evidence? He cannot cross-examine documents or physical exhibits. But documents, plans, maps, photographs, the clothing worn by the victim and by the perpetrator of the alleged crime, the weapon used, and other material objects may be more potent than word of mouth to carry conviction to the jury's minds; and so of the physical appearance of the scene of the crime. No reason is apparent why, if the accused may be excluded from a view, he may not also be excluded from the courtroom while such documentary and physical evidence is proffered to and examined by the jury. The opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses is only one of many reasons for the defendant's presence throughout the trial. In so state save in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and in no \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 133]\n\u00a0\n cases save in those there recently decided, has the privilege or the fundamental nature of the right it preserves been questioned or denied. As as cases show,24 the right of presence exists at every step in the trial, whether it be during the giving of oral testimony, the submission of a document, the presentation of physical exhibits, the argument of counsel, the charge of the court, or the rendition of the verdict.\n It cannot successfully be contended that, as the Sixth Amendment has no application to trials in state courts, and the Fourteenth does not draw to itself and embody the provisions of state Constitutions (Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 556, 10 Ann.Cas. 689), the due process secured by the Fourteenth Amendment does not embrace a right secured by those instruments. In Powell v. Alabama, supra, the argument that the conclusion would be difficult that the right to counsel specifically preserved by the Sixth Amendment was also within the intendment of the due process clause of the Fourteenth was answered thus:\n'In ... Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 241\n, 17 S.Ct. 581, this court held that a judgment of a state court, even though authorized by statute, by which private property was taken for public use without just compensation, was in violation of the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment, notwithstanding that the Fifth Amendment explicitly declares that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This holding was followed in Norwood v. Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269, 277\n, 19 S.Ct. 187; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 524\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, and San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 754\n, 19 S.Ct. 804\n\n\n\n'Likewise, this court has considered that freedom of speech and of the press are rights protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although in the First Amendment, Congress is prohibited in spe- \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 134]\n\u00a0\n cific terms from abridging the right. Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S.Ct. 625; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625. ...\n\n'The rule is an aid to construction, and in some instances may be conclusive; but it must yield to more compelling considerations whenever such considerations exist. The fact that the right involved is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' (Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S. Ct. 103, 48 A.L.R. 1102), is obviously one of those compelling considerations which must prevail in determining whether it is embraced within the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although it be specifically dealt with in another part of the Federal Constitution.' Pages 66, 67 of 287 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 55, 63.\n\n If, then, a view of the premises where crime is alleged to have been committed is a part of the process of submission of data to the triers of fact, upon which judgment is to be founded; if the knowledge thereby gained is to play its part with oral testimony and written evidence in striking the balance between the state and the prisoner, it is a part of the trial. If this is true, the Constitution secures the accused's presence. In this conclusion all the courts, save those of Massachusetts, agree. Such difference of view as the authorities exhibit as to the prisoner's right to be present at a view arises out of a disagreement on the question whether the view is a part of the trial, whether it is, in effect the taking of evidence. The great weight of authority is that it forms a part of the trial, and for that reason a defendant who so desires is entitled to be present. \n25\n Many decisions hold that he may waive the \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 135]\n\u00a0\n privilege;26 but an examination of the cases discloses none (with a single possible exception) where a denial of his request to accompany the jury on the view has not been held reversible error. And the statements that a view is not a part of the trial or that it is not the taking of evidence, and denying, on that ground, the defendant's right to be present, are invariably found in cases where the defendant requested the view and did not ask to accompany the jury, or waived either expressly or by conduct his right so to do. Such statements are dicta, since the accused waived whatever right he had. Moreover, in several of the opinions which deny the right it is said that the prisoner ought always to be allowed to accompany the jury if he so requests. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 97, 136]\n\u00a0\n It is true there is disagreement as to the nature and function of a view. On the one hand, the assertion is that its purpose is merely to acquaint the jury with the scene and thus enable them better to understand the testimony, and hence it forms no part of the trial and is not the taking of evidence. On the other, the suggestion is that the jury are bound to carry in mind what they see and form their judgment from the knowledge so obtained, and so the view amounts to the taking of evidence. 28 The distinction seems too fine for practical purposes; but, however that may be, discussion of this abstract question is unimportant in a case like the present where the view was held to be evidence, and the jury were expressly so instructed.\n The respondent urges that, whatever may have been the petitioner's right, the record demonstrates he could have suffered no harm by reason of his absence. The argument is far from convincing in the light of the circumstances and the rule announced by the court as respects the use the jury were at liberty to make of the knowledge gained by their view of the premises. But, if it were clear that the verdict was not affected by knowledge gained on the view or that the result would have been the same had the appellant been present, still the denial of his constitutional right ought not be condoned. Nor ought this court to convert the inquiry from one as to the denial of the right into one as to the prejudice suffered by the denial. To pivot affirmance on the question of the amount of harm done the accused is to beg the constitutional question involved. The very substance of the defendant's right is to be present. By hypothesis it is \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 137]\n\u00a0\n unfair to exclude him. As this court has recently said with respect to disregard of the mandate of the Sixty Amendment respecting trial by jury: 29\n'But the constitutional question cannot thus be settled by the simple process of ascertaining that the infraction assailed is unimportant when compared with similar, but more serious infractions which might be conceived. ... It is not our province to measure the extent to which the Constitution has been contravened and ignore the violation, if, in our opinion, it is not, relatively, as bad as it might have been.'\n\n A distinction has always been observed in the meaning of due process as affecting property rights, and as applying to procedure in the courts. In the former aspect the requirement is satisfied if no actual injury is inflicted and the substantial rights of the citizen are not infringed; the result rather than the means of reaching it is the important consideration. But, where the conduct of a trial is involved, the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment is not that a just result shall have been obtained, but that the result, whatever, it be, shall be reached in a fair way. Procedural due process has to do with the manner of the trial; dictates that in the conduct of judicial inquiry certain fundamental rules of fairness be observed; forbids the disregard of those rules; and is not satisfied though the result is just, if the hearing was unfair.\n In this case, the view was a part of the trial. The jury were not sent to the scene in the custody of bailiffs who had no knowledge of the place or the circumstances of the crime. They were not instructed to view the premises so as to better understand the testimony. They went forth with the judge presiding, the stenographer officiating, the district attorney, and the counsel of the defendants. As has been shown, more than a mere view of the \n\n[291 U.S. 97, 138]\n\u00a0\n premises was had. Matters were called to the jury's attention in detail so that they could form judgments of distance, relative position, the alignments of objects, all having a crucial bearing upon the truthfulness of the testimony subsequently given, and they were told they might take their own estimates of these matters in corroboration or contradiction of the other evidence. Little wonder, in these circumstances, that the court felt it right to appoint the defendants' counsel to accompany the jury on the view. If the prisoners were entitled to this protection, by the same token they were entitled themselves to be present.\n I think that the petitioner was deprived of a constitutional right and that the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under the law of Massachusetts, homicide is murder in the first degree when committed 'with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought' or in the commission or attempted commission of a crime that would be punishable, if there were no homicide, with imprisonment for life. Robbery by one armed with a dangerous weapon is a crime so punishable, but not larceny or attempted larceny. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) Mass. c. 265,  1 and 17. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] What was said in Hopt v. Utah, supra, and Schwab v. Berggren, supra, on the subject of the presence of a defendant was dictum, and no more. See this opinion (\n291 \nU.S. 106\n, 54 S.Ct. 332). We may say the same of Lewis v. United States, supra, with the added observation that it deals with the rule at common law and not with constitutional restraints.\n There are decisions in the state courts that a conviction will stand even though rulings have been made by the trial court in the absence of the defendant if it appears that they could not by any possibility have resulted to his hurt. Whittaker v. State, 173 Ark. 1172, 294 S.W. 397; Lowman v. State, 80 Fla. 18, 85 So. 166. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in Commonwealth v. Kelly, supra, that the burden was on the defendant to show a probability of injury. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cases relating to the procedure at a view are not to be confused with cases where the defendant was absent during the examination of witnesses or the charge of the judge. Examples of such cases are Slocovitch v. State, 46 Ala. 227; People v. Beck, 305 Ill. 593, 137 N.E. 454; State v. Hutchinson, 163 La. 146, 111 So. 656; Duffy v. State, 151 Md. 456, 135 A. 189; State v. Jackson, 88 Mont. 420, 293 P. 309; State v. Dixon, 185 N.C. 727, 117 S.E. 170; State v. Schasker, 60 N.D. 462, 235 N.W. 345; State v. Chandler, 128 Or. 204, 274 P. 303. In most, if not all, there was an express statutory or constitutional requirement of presence at the trial, a requirement so clear as to leave little room for construction. One court has gone so far as to require the presence of the defendant upon a motion for a new trial (State v. Hoffman, 78 Mo. 256), in opposition to the judgments of this court in Schwab v. Berggren and Lewis v. United States, supra.\n As to the rule where the crime is of the grade of a misdemeanor only, see United States v. Santos, 27 Fed.Cas. page 954, No. 16,222; United States v. Shelton (D.C.) 6 F.(2d) 897; Gray v. State, 158 Tenn. 370, 13 S. W.(2d) 793. Cf. Hopt v. Utah, supra, at page 576 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 202. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following are outstanding instances:\n'The Court: Now, Mr. Volpe, if you are ready.\n\n'Mr. Volpe: Just first stand here, gentlemen, and take a look inside of the gasoline station. Now step in, please.\n\n'(The following occurred inside the filling station:)\n\n'Mr. Volpe: Now, gentlemen, I call your attention to this glass here ( indicating), this window (indicating the back window of the filling station,) about the position of the glass, and I ask you to look at that, and the relative position of the entrance, especially to the right or to the left, coming in through the door. And then this oil tank here on the right of this window; the other two windows on the right of the building, and I want you to take note of the size of the room, and this telephone here, and these two doors, one on each side of the telephone. Take note, also, of the location of this other gas tank over here, back of the door; this desk on the left. Also look out the window at the back, and notice the gravel in the yard, and the fence there.'\n\n'Mr. Volpe: I want you to take a view of the other side of the sidewalk from this location, and note the driveway on the right of the gas station, and on the left, and these two pumps, or three pumps, noticing the distance from the pumps on the entrance of the gas station.\n\n'Now, I would like to have you come over here and take a look at the gas station as it sits back there.\n\n'(The jury were taken across the street to the opposite sidewalk.)\n\n'Mr. Volpe: I want you to get a look at the whole layout, the righthand entrance and the lefthand entrance over there, where that car is standing. Take particular notice of the width of this street, and, as you stand here, notice the bridge going towards Union Square, with the right and left driveways.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] What occurred is shown by the notes as follows:\n'Mr. Volpe: That middle pump wasn't there at the time. \n\n'The Court: It is agreed that the only pumps that were there were the two outside pumps, and that the middle, or blue one, was not there.\n\n'Mr. Volpe: Yes, your Honor.\n\n'The Court: I can state that to them.\n\n'(The jury left the bus and assembled on the sidewalk.)\n\n'The Court: Now, it is agreed that at the time of the offense,-that is, on April 9, 1931-there were but two pumps in front of the gasoline station, the one on the extreme right, that is painted green, and the one on the extreme left, that is painted black. Those two were there. The one in the middle, with the blue striping on it, was not there. It is also suggested that the jurors look at the street lights from that corner down there (indicating), and the situation of those lights and those down the street.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] During the trial, when certain plans were being put in evidence, the judge said: 'What they (the jury) saw is to be taken equally with any evidence that is before them.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Hurtado v.

Tyrrell and Edgar L. Wood, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners for writs of certiorari were granted, 'limited to the question whether a debt ascertained to be partially worthless in 1920 was deductible in that year under either section 234(a)(4) or section 234(a)(5 ) (of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1077) and to the question whether the debt was returnable as taxable income in that year to the extent that it was then ascertained to be worthless.'\n Petitioner kept its books during the year 1920 and filed its income tax return for that year on the accrual basis. From March, 1920, to September, 1920, petitioner sold goods to the Cotta Transmission Company for which the latter became indebted in the amount of $39,983.27, represented by open account and unsecured notes. In the latter part of 1920 the Cotta Company found itself in financial straits. Efforts at settlement having failed, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Company on December 23, 1920, and a receiver was appointed. In the spring of 1922 the receiver paid to creditors, including petitioner, a dividend of 15 per cent. and, in 1923, a second and final dividend of 12 1\/2 per cent.\n Petitioner charged off on its books the entire debt on December 28, 1920, and claimed this amount as a deduction in its income tax return for that year. It included as income in its returns for 1922 and 1923 the dividends received in those years. The Commissioner disallowed the amount claimed as a deduction in 1920 but allowed a \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n deduction in 1923 of $28,715.76, the difference between the full amount of the debt and the two dividends.\n On review of the deficiency assessed by the Commissioner for 1920, the Board of Tax Appeals found that the debt was not entirely wortheless at the time it was charged off. An offer had been made in November, 1920, to purchase the assets of the debtor at 33 1\/3 per cent. of the creditors' claims and the offer had been declined. The Board concluded that in view of all the circumstances, including the probable expense of the receivership, the debt could be regarded as uncollectible, at the time of the charge-off, to the extent of $28,715.76, and allowed a deduction for 1920 of that amount. 25 B.T.A. 822. This ruling, contested by both the Commissioner and the taxpayer, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that 'there was in 1920 no authority for a debt deduction unless the debt were worthless.' 67 F.(2d) 385, 387. In view of the conflict of decisions upon this point,1 this Court granted writs of certiorari limited as above stated.\n\n 1. \nPetitioner first contends that the debt, to the extent that it was ascertained in 1920 to be worthless was not returnable as gross income in that year, that is, apart from any question of deductions, it was not to be regarded as taxable income at all. We see no merit in this contention. Keeping accounts and making returns on the accrual basis, as distinguished from the cash basis, import that it is the right to receive and not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of the amount in gross income. When the right to receive an amount becomes \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n fixed, the right accrues. When a merchandizing concern makes sales, its inventory is reduced and a claim for the purchase price arises. Article 35 of Regulations 45 under the Revenue Act of 1918 provided: 'In the case of a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business 'gross income' means the total sales, less the cost of goods sold, plus any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources.' \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n On an accrual basis, the 'total sales,' to which the regulation refers, are manifestly the accounts receivable arising from the sales, and these accounts receivable, less the cost of the goods sold, figure in the statement of gross income. If such accounts receivable become uncollectible, in whole or part, the question is one of the deduction which may be taken according to the applicable statute. See United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 440\n, 441 S., 46 S.Ct. 131; American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99, 102\n, 103 S., 47 S.Ct. 520; Brown v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 193, 199\n, 54 S.Ct. 356, 78 L.Ed. --; Rouss v. Bowers (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 628, 629. That is the question here. It is not altered by the fact that the claim of loss relates to an item of gross income which had accrued in the same year.\n\n 2. \nSection 234[a]\n\n[292 U.S. 182, 5]\n\u00a0\n of the Revenue Act of 1918 provided for the deduction of wortheless debts, in computing net income, as follows: 'Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year.' Under this provision, the taxpayer could not establish a right to the deduction simply by charging off the debt. It must be ascertained to be worthless within the taxable year. In this instance, in 1920, the debt was in suspense by reason of the bankruptcy of the debtor but it was not a total loss. What eventually might be recovered upon it was uncertain, but recovery to some extent was reasonably to be \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n expected. The receiver continued the business and substantial amounts were subsequently realized for the creditors. In this view, the Board of Tax Appeals decided that the petitioner did not sustain a loss in 1920 'equal to the total amount of the debt' and hence that the entire debt was not deductible in that year.\n The question, then, is whether petitioner was entitled to a deduction in 1920 for the portion of the debt which ultimately-on the winding up in bankruptcy-proved to be uncollectible. Such a deduction of a part of the debt, the Government contends and the Circuit Court of Appeals held, the act of 1918 did not authorize. The Government points to the literal meaning of the words of the statute, to the established administrative construction, and to the action of the Congress in recognition of that construction. 'Worthless,' says the Government, means destitute of worth, of no value or use. This was the interpretation of the statute by the Treasury Department. Article 151 of Regulations 45 (made applicable to corporations by Article 561) provided that 'An account merely written down' is not deductible. \n3\n To the same effect was the corresponding provision of the regulations under the Revenue Act of 1916. 4 \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n The right to charge off and deduct a portion of a debt where during the taxable year the debt was found to be recoverable only in part, was granted by the Revenue Act of 1921. By that act, section 234(a)(5), 42 Stat. 254, was changed so as to read: 'Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year (or in the discretion of the Commissioner, a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts); and when satisfied that a debt is recoverable only in part, the Commissioner may allow such debt to be charged off in part.' We think that the fair import of this provision, as contrasted with the earlier one, is that the Congress, recognizing the significance of the existing provision and its appropriate construction by the Treasury Department, deliberately intended a change in the law. Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 536\n, 42 S.Ct. 391, 26 A.L.R. 1454; Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181, 188\n, 49 S. Ct. 121.\n This intent is shown clearly by the statement in the report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives in relation to the new provision. The Committee said explicitly: 'Under the present law worthless debts are deductible in full or not at all.' \n5\n While the change was struck out by the Finance Committee of the Senate, the provision was restored on the floor of the Senate and became a law as proposed by the House. \n6\n Regulations 62 issued by the Treasury Depart- \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n ment under the act of 1921 made a corresponding change in Article 151. The Treasury Department consistently adhered to the former rule in dealing with deductions sought under the act of 1918.7\n In numerous decisions the Board of Tax Appeals has taken the same view of the provision of the act of 1918.8 See e.g., Appeal of Steel Cotton Mill Co., 1 B.T.A. 299, 302; Western Casket Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A. 792, 797; Toccoa Furniture Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A. 804, 805. The contrary result in the instant case was reached in deference to the opinion expressed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in Sherman & Bryan, Inc., v. Blair, Commissioner, 35 F.(2d) 713, 716, and by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Davidson Grocery Co. v. Lucas, 59 App.D.C. 176, 37 F.(2d) 806, 808-views which are opposed to those of the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit in Minnehaha National Bank v. Commissioner, 28 F.(2d) 763, 764, and of the Fifth Circuit in Collin County National Bank v. Commissioner, 48 F. (2d) 207, 208.\n We are of opinion that section 234(a)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1918 authorized only the deduction of a debt ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year; that it \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n did not authorize the deduction of a debt which was not then ascertained to be worthless but was recoverable in part, the amount that was not recoverable being still uncertain. Here, in 1923, on the winding up, the debt that then remained unpaid, after deducting the dividends received, was ascertained to be worthless and the Commissioner allowed deduction accordingly in that year.\n\n 3. \nPetitioner also claims the right of deduction under section 234(a)( 4) of the Revenue Act of 1918 providing for the deduction of 'losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.' We agree with the decision below that this subdivision and the following subdivision (5) relating to debts are mutually exclusive. We so assumed, without deciding the point, in Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243, 246\n, 48 S.Ct. 63. The making of the specific provision as to debts indicates that these were to be considered as a special class and that losses on debts were not to be regarded as falling under the preceding general provision. What was excluded from deduction under subdivision (5) cannot be regarded as allowed under subdivision (4). If subdivision (4) could be considered as ambiguous in this respect, the administrative construction which has been followed from the enactment of the statute-that subdivision (4) did not refer to debts-would be entitled to great weight. We see no reason for disturbing that construction.\n Petitioner insists that 'good business practice' forbade the inclusion in the taxpayer's assets of the account receivable in question or at least the part of it which was subsequently found to be uncollectible. But that is not the question here. Questions relating to allowable deductions under the income tax act are quite distinct from matters which pertain to an appropriate showing upon \n\n[292 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n which credit is sought. It would have been proper for the taxpayer to carry the debt in question in a suspense account awaiting the ultimate determination of the amount that could be realized upon it, and thus to indicate the status of the debt in financial statements of the taxpayer's condition. But that proper practice, in order to advise those from whom credit might be sought of uncertainties in the realization of assets, does not affect the construction of the statute, or make the debt deductible in 1920, when the entire debt was not worthless, when the amount which would prove uncollectible was not yet ascertained, rather than in 1923 when that amount was ascertained and its deduction allowed.\n We conclude that the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Sherman & Bryan, Inc., v.

PEOPLE(1934)\nNo. 347\nArgued: January 12, 1934Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of California.\n Messrs. V. K. Butler, Jr., Oscar Sutro, and Felix T. Smith, all of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Messrs. U. S. Webb and H. H. Linney, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By chapter 267 (page 571), Statutes 1923, as amended (chapters 716 and 795 (pages 1309, 1565), Statutes 1927), the state of California undertook to lay a license tax upon every distributor for each gallon of motor vehicle fuel 'sold and delivered by him in this State' with certain exceptions not here important. \n\n[291 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n At its own expense and risk, appellant, a Delaware corporation, qualified to do business in California, sold and delivered to the Post Exchange, within the Presidio of San Francisco, 420 gallons of gasoline. It carried this to the Exchange's place of business in barrels or by tank trucks. Both sale and delivery were within the area long held and occupied by the United States for military purposes.\n The state demanded of appellant three cents per gallon upon the gasoline so sold and delivered. Payment being refused, this suit followed. In the trial court the company prevailed. The Supreme Court held to the contrary and, among other things, said: 'We have thus presented the question whether sales and deliveries of gasoline at a military reservation under the sole jurisdiction of the United States, made to the army post exchange therein, are to be excluded in fixing the license fees to be paid by the distributor under said act of the Legislature. ... It is at once conceded, as already implied, that the military reservation in question is territory over which the United States exercises sole legislative authority. ... It is contended that, by reason of this concession, a sale consummated on it is a sale outside the state, as though consummated in Nevada or Oregon. It is our conclusion that the manifest intention of the act was to include all sales completed within the geographical confines of the state, and for this purpose said military reservation was to be included like all other territory.' 22 P.(2d) 2, 3.\n The Presidio of San Francisco, a tract of more than fourteen hundred acres, lies between that city and the Golden Gate, and is within the exterior limits of California. Established as a military post under Spanish dominion about 1776, it continued to be so used by the Republic of Mexico until ceded to the United States in 1848 by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (9 Stat. 922). An executive \n\n[291 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n order of November 6, 1850, dedicated it to public purposes; since then it has been occupied as a military reservation. By Act of March 2, 1897 (St. Cal. 1897, p. 51), California ceded to the United States exclusive jurisdiction over this area with a proviso: 'That this State reserves the right to serve and execute on said lands all civil process, not incompatible with this cession, and such criminal process as may lawfully issue under the authority of this State against any person or persons charged with crimes committed without said lands.' See United States v. Watkins (D.C.) 22 F.(2d) 437. The state reserved to herself no power whatever in respect of taxation.\n Appellant challenges the validity of the taxing act as construed by the Supreme Court. The argument is that since the state granted to the United States exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the Presidio, she is now without power to impose taxes in respect of sales and deliveries made therein. This claim, we think, is well founded; and the judgment below must be reversed.\n In three recent cases-Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439\n, 49 S. Ct. 227, United States v. Unzeuta, \n281 \nU.S. 138\n, 50 S.Ct. 284, and Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, 50 S.Ct. 455-we have pointed out the consequences of cession by a state to the United States of jurisdiction over lands held by the latter for military purposes. Considering these opinions, it seems plain that by the act of 1897 California surrendered every possible claim of right to exercise legislative authority within the Presidio-put that area beyond the field of operation of her laws. Accordingly, her Legislature could not lay a tax upon transactions begun and concluded therein.\n Arlington Hotel Company v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439\n, 49 S.Ct. 227, denied the power of Arkansas by legislation to modify the liability of innkeepers within a reservation ceded by her to the United States. \n\n[291 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Unzeuta, \n281 \nU.S. 138\n, 50 S.Ct. 284, affirmed the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States over crimes committed within a reservation lying within Nebraska. Jurisdiction had been ceded by the state.\n Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, 50 S.Ct. 455, ruled that land within Arkansas purchased by the United States for military purposes with the state's consent was under their exclusive jurisdiction. Private personal property therein was declared not subject to taxation by the state.\n The principle approved in those cases applies here. A state cannot legislate effectively concerning matters beyond her jurisdiction and within territory subject only to control by the United States.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL COMPANY v.

Finley, of Bartlesville, Okl., for appellee Cities Service Gas Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ten suits were consolidated for trial. \n1\n The appellee in each of the first nine is a local public service corporation, \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n for convenience called a distributing company, engaged in the business of furnishing natural gas to consumers, domestic and industrial, in Kansas, and together they operate in 128 cities and towns. The other appellee, Cities Service Gas Company, is a pipe line company, engaged in transporting gas from Texas and Oklahoma fields into Kansas and other states. The stock of each of the distributing companies is owned by the Gas Service Company, and its stock is owned by the Cities Service Company; the common stock of the Cities Service Gas Company is owned by the Empire Gas & Fuel Company, the voting stock of which is owned by the Cities Service Company. Henry L. Doherty, doing business as Henry L. Doherty & Co ., owns 35 per cent. of the voting stock of the Cities Service Company. The policies of the distributing companies and the pipe line company are subject to control by the Cities Service Company, and Doherty controls its policies. These corporations and he constitute 'affiliated interests' as defined by a Kansas statute effective March 9, 1931,2 the substance of which is later to be stated.\n The Kansas statutes empower its Public Service Commission to regulate the service and to fix rates to be charged by public utilities, including the distributing companies. \n3\n They prescribe heavy penalties for failure to comply with commission-made orders. \n4\n But the sale, transportation, and delivery of natural gas by the pipe line company to the distributing companies constitutes interstate commerce, and therefore the state is without power to prescribe rates or prices to be charged therefor.

Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 148\n, 51 S.Ct. 65.\n The Act of March 9, 1931,  1 (Rev. St. Supp. Kan. 1931, 74-602a), gives the commission jurisdiction over holders of the voting stock of public utility companies to the extent necessary to require disclosure of the identity of the owners of substantial interests therein, and provides that the commission shall have access to the accounts and records of affiliated interests, relating to transactions between them and public utility companies. Section 2 (Rev. St. Supp. Kan. 1931, 74-602b) declares that no management or similar contract with any affiliated interest shall be effective unless first filed with the commission, and authorizes the commission to disapprove any such contract found not to be in the public interest. Section 3 (Rev. St. Supp. Kan. 1931, 74-602c) provides: 'In ascertaining the reasonableness of a rate or charge to be made by a public utility, no charge for services rendered by a holding or affiliated company, or charge for material or commodity furnished or purchased from a holding or affiliated company, shall be given consideration in determining a reasonable rate or charge unless there be a showing made by the utility affected by the rate or charge as to the actual cost to the holding or affiliated company furnishing such service and material or commodity. Such showing shall consist of an itemized statement furnished by the utility setting out in detail the various items, cost for services rendered and material or commodity furnished by the holding or affiliated company.'\n July 2, 1931, the commission, exerting powers granted by the act, ordered an investigation of the charges made by holding companies for services rendered and commodities furnished to the distributing companies. It directed them to give the commission such information as they \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n might see fit and as the commission might require; it ordered them to show cause why charges made by any holding company, if found unreasonable, should not be disallowed as operating expenses. The order was not directed to Henry L. Doherty & Co., the pipe line company or any holding company, and none of them appeared or became a party to the proceeding before the commission.\n And, pursuant to the order, there were held extended hearings at which there was submitted much evidence as to the value of the pipe line company's properties located in five states, its operating expenses, including depreciation and taxes, and its gross revenues and income available for return. In short, the facts adduced were such as appropriately might be considered by a commission for the ascertainment of reasonable rates to be charged by the pipe line company, or by a court in determining whether established rates are confiscatory. Each distributing company tendered proof of the value of its own property used to furnish gas to its customers together with other facts essential to the determination of the reasonableness of the rates then being, and later to be, charged its customers. But the commission, not then being engaged in the investigation of the reasonableness of such rates, refused to hear evidence other than that hearing upon the reasonableness, as operating expense items, of charges made by affiliated interests for services rendered the distributing companies and especially of prices exacted by the pipe line company for gas delivered in interstate commerce at the gates or borders of the various cities and communities served by the distributing companies.\n The commission held payment of 1 3\/4 per cent. of their gross earnings to Henry L. Doherty & Co. unwarranted and the prices paid the pipe line company for gas \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded 29.5 cents per thousand cubic feet. \n5\n Re Cities Service Co., P.U.R. 1933A, pp. 113-202. It granted the companies' application for rehearing, and August 31, 1932, put aside the order filed with its report and in its place promulgated two orders:\n The first directed the distributing companies to cease setting up as an expense item payment of the 1 3\/4 per cent. charge and payment to the pipe line company for gas in excess of 30 cents per thousand cubic feet and to give no consideration to the payments so disapproved in fixing rates to domestic consumers. And it directed that, on October 17, 1932, the distributing companies show cause why the prescribed reduction should not be passed on to the consumers. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The second order directed that, effective September 1, 1932, and pending hearing and an order prescribing rates, 'All distributing companies paying a gate rate in excess \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n of 30 cents per M.C.F. shall deduct the difference between what the distributing company is now paying at the city gate and 30 cents per M.C.F. and pass on this difference to the consumer.'\n Apprehending that, as counsel for the commission asserted at the hearing, these orders would become final and absolutely binding unless within 30 days, section 66-113, Rev. St. 1923, section 66-118c, Rev. St. Supp. 1931, action were commenced to have them set aside, appellees brought these suits September 19, 1932. Each sued the commission, its members, and the Attorney General, invoking jurisdiction on the ground that its suit is one arising under the Federal Constitution. The complaint, upon the basis of fact set forth, asserts that the orders are repugnant to the commerce clause and the contract clause of the Constitution and to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and prays temporary and permanent injunction. The defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds that the bill fails to state a cause of action and that the court was without jurisdiction. A specially constituted court of three judges denied the motion to dismiss. The defendants answered, admitting that, because repugnant to a state statutory provision the second order was unauthorized and is void. The court granted temporary injunction and tried the case upon the merits. It was submitted upon the evidence introduced before the commission, stipulations as to matters of fact, and other evidence. The court made findings of fact and stated its conclusions of law. Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723). And it permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing the orders in so far as they required the distributing companies to cease to set up on their books any payment to the pipe line company for gas in excess of 30 cents per thousand cubic feet, to give no consideration to such payments in fixing a rate for the domestic consumer, and, commencing September 1, 1932, \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 568]\n\u00a0\n to charge rates reduced as directed by the second order. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The first order does not purport to establish or prescribe prices to be paid by the distributing companies to the pipe line company or purport to establish any rate to be charged by appellees to their customers. It merely directs the distributing companies not to include in their operating expense accounts more than 30 cents per thousand cubic feet for gas furnished by the pipe line company and not to consider any payments in excess of that price in fixing a rate for domestic consumers.\n We need not decide whether these provisions are repugnant to the Constitution or whether they are otherwise invalid. The invalidity of such an order is not of itself ground for injunction. Unless necessary to protect rights against injuries otherwise irremediable, injunction should not be granted. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S.Ct. 15. \n\n[290 U.S. 561, 569]\n\u00a0\n Appellees, in substance, suggest that, unless now adjudged invalid and enjoined, the findings and directions of the commission in respect of their operating expenses and the fixing of rates will be binding upon them in later proceedings for the prescribing of rates to be charged by them for gas furnished to consumers and in suits involving the validity of such rates. But the commission's proceedings are to be regarded as having been taken to secure information later to be used for the ascertainment of reasonableness of rates. The order is therefore legislative in character. The commission's decisions upon the matters covered by it cannot be res adjudicata when challenged in a confiscation case or other suit involving their validity or the validity of any rate depending upon them.

But the decisions of state courts reviewing commission orders making rates are res adjudicata and can be so pleaded in suits subsequently brought in federal courts to enjoin their enforcement.

The decree in so far as it enjoins enforcement of the provisions of that order will be vacated.\n The commission, its members, and Attorney General having in their answer and here admitted that the commission's second order is invalid, the decree in so far as it enjoins the enforcement of its provisions will be affirmed.\n Decree modified, and, as modified, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The appellees are: The Wichita Gas Company, the Hutchinson Gas Company, the Newton Gas Company, the Pittsburg Gas Company, the Capital Gas & Electric Company, the Wyandotte County Gas Company, the Girard Gas Company, Union Public Service Company, the Western Distributing Company, and Cities Service Gas Company. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Kansas Laws, 1931, c. 239; Kan.

STATE OF ARIZONA(1934)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 286, 287]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Logan Martin, of Birmingham, Ala., for complainant in support of the motion for leave to file the bill.\n Messrs. William A. Schnader, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Raymond T. Nagle, of Helena, Mont., for the defendants in opposition to the motion for leave to file the bill. \n\n[291 U.S. 286, 288]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For the purpose of invoking original jurisdiction as 'to Controversies between two or more States' (Const. art. 3,  2), Alabama lodged with the clerk and applied for leave to file a complaint against 19 states praying that the court adjudge invalid, because in violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, statutes by them respectively enacted to regulate or prohibit sales of articles produced by convict labor and an Act of Congress approved January 19, 1929, 45 Stat. 1084, effective January 19, 1934 (49 USCA  65 and note), to divest in certain cases such products of their interstate character. Responding to our orders to show cause why leave should not be granted, 17 of the states submitted returns suggesting that the complaint is multifarious and fails to allege facts sufficient to entitle Alabama to any relief. At the hearing upon the questions so raised, counsel for Alabama obtained leave to, and on a later day did, submit an amendment eliminating 14 states including those that merely regulate and some that prohibit sales of convict-made goods, leaving only Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n Each of the assailed state statutes, while not in all respects the same as the others, forbids the sale upon the open market of any goods produced wholly or in part by convicts of other states and prescribes penalties for violation. The Act of Congress declares that, with exceptions which need not be specified here, goods produced by convict labor and transported into any state shall be subject to the laws of that state to the same extent and in the same manner as if there produced. \n\n[291 U.S. 286, 289]\n\u00a0\n The substance of the complaint follows. Alabama's prison population averages about 5,500 and in connection with its prisons it has agricultural lands, cotton mills, and a shirt factory. About 1,050 inmates do farm work for the production of cotton and potatoes, and about 1,250 operate spindles and make shirts. In 1927 the state entered into a contract with a manufacturing company pursuant to which it sold the latter cotton goods made in its mills and, for hire at the rate of 75 cents per dozen shirts made, furnished convict labor to be employed in the prison factory. The contract expired March 31, 1933, and, the company having declined to renew or extend it, the parties agreed that during the ensuing quarter the state would sell the company prison-made goods for 5 cents a yard and furnish the convict labor for 54 cents per dozen shirts.\n While the contract was in force, the company sold some of the convict- made products in each of the 19 states originally named as defendants. In round figures, sales amounted annually to $347,000 of which it received for the goods sold in Arizona $1,000, Idaho $10,000, Montana $10,000, New York $30,000, Pennsylvania $25,000. For the material and labor furnished by it, Alabama received the equivalent of 30 per cent. of the amounts for which the company sold the goods. Because of the Act of Congress and state statutes in question, Alabama is unable to make any 'firm agreement' for the sale of its prison-made cotton goods or for the employment of its convicts. In the second quarter of 1933 it received for labor $11,500 less than was paid it in the preceding quarter. The lower rate of compensation will continue during the rest of 1933. And enforcement of the statutes in question will prevent Alabama from selling in defendant states potatoes produced by the labor of its convicts.\n Alabama's investment in the cotton mills and shirt factory exceeds $ 300,000 and will be valueless as a result of \n\n[291 U.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n its inability to find an employer for its convict labor and a market for its prison-made goods. The cost of maintaining unemployed convicts will be about $550,000 annually. Without employment convicts cannot be treated appropriately for their rehabilitation and the promotion of the good order and welfare of the state. The very existence of the assailed enactments is sufficient to bring about the unemployment which will continue unless their enforcement is enjoined.\n If Alabama is compelled to provide other employment, it will have to expend about $1,000,000 for the construction of plants for the manufacture of things to be used by the inmates of its eleemosynary institutions and in and about other state activities. As presently employed, its prisoners are divided into night and day shifts so as to avoid overcrowding of the prisons. And, if the state does not provide other industrial activities, it will have to expend about $100,000 for additional space to house its convicts.\n\n 1. \nThere is no test or rule of general application by which to determine whether a complaint in equity is multifarious. That question is to be decided by the court in the exercise of sound discretion having regard to the facts alleged, circumstances disclosed, and the character of the relief sought. Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 411; Nelson v. Hill, 5 How. 127, 132; Shields v. Thomas, 18 How. 253, 259; Fitch v. Creighton, 24 How. 159, 163, 164; Brown v. Guarantee Trust & Safe-Deposit Co., \n128 \nU.S. 403, 410\n, 9 S.Ct. 127. Unless necessary for the prompt, convenient, and effective administration of justice, a suit by one state against several states to set aside a statute of each is properly to be regarded as multifarious. There has been suggested no reason to sustain Alabama's complaint, as it stood before amendment, against the objection of misjoinder of parties defendant and of causes of action. Cf. Hale v. Allinson, \n188 \nU.S. 56, 74\n, 23 S.Ct. 244. \n\n[291 U.S. 286, 291]\n\u00a0\n The amendment of the bill serves merely to obviate objections that are based on dissimilarity of the state enactments. It is not shown that the joinder of five states is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of suits or that it will substantially serve the convenience of Alabama or of the court. Alabama does not claim concert of action on the part of the defendants or that they are jointly liable in respect of any matter referred to in the bill. The enforcement of the statutes attacked would prohibit the sale of Alabama's prison products in the five states named. If one is repugnant to the commerce clause, all transgress. Alabama cites Bitterman v. Louisville & Nashville R.R., \n207 \nU.S. 205\n, 28 S.Ct. 91, 12 Ann.Cas. 693. Considerations of convenience that in suits between private parties reasonably may justify exercise of discretion in support of such joinders have no bearing in a case such as this. If, in a suit brought by Alabama against one of these states, this court should hold the assailed statute invalid and enjoin its enforcement, the decision would be authoritative and controlling as a precedent in all courts, state and federal. Presumably no other state would attempt on similar facts to enforce a like measure, and Alabama would have no occasion to invoke our jurisdiction further. The amended bill is multifarious.\n\n 2. \nThis court may not be called on to give advisory opinions or to pronounce declaratory judgments. Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S.Ct. 250; Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n277 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 48 S.Ct. 507, and cases cited. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 262 S., 53 S.Ct. 345. Its jurisdiction in respect of controversies between states will not be exerted in the absence of absolute necessity. Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 20 S.Ct. 251. A state asking leave to sue another to prevent the enforcement of laws must allege, in the complaint offered for filing, facts that are clearly sufficient to call for a decree in its favor. \n\n[291 U.S. 286, 292]\n\u00a0\n Our decisions definitely establish that not every matter of sufficient moment to warrant resort to equity by one person against another would justify an interference by this court with the action of a state. Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 520\n, 521 S., 26 S.Ct. 268; New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 309\n, 41 S.Ct. 492; North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 365, 374\n, 44 S.Ct. 138. Leave will not be granted unless the threatened injury is clearly shown to be of serious magnitude and imminent. Missouri v. Illinois, supra, page 521 of 200 U.S., 26 S.Ct. 268. In the absence of specific showing to the contrary, it will be presumed that no state will attempt to enforce an unconstitutional enactment to the detriment of another. Cf. Ex parte La Prade, \n289 \nU.S. 444, 458\n, 53 S.Ct. 682. The burden upon the plaintiff state fully and clearly to establish all essential elements of its case is greater than that generally required to be borne by one seeking an injunction in a suit between private parties. Connecticut v. Massachusetts, \n282 \nU.S. 660, 669\n, 51 S.Ct. 286.\n Plainly the amended bill does not meet the requirements that reasonably should be imposed upon the applicant. It fails to show that Alabama has any agreement with any defendant or that there is any direct issue between them or that the validity of the statutes in question and Alabama's assertion of right may not, or indeed will not, speedily and conveniently be tested by the contracting company, that apparently is directly concerned, or by a seller of such goods. Cf. Louisiana v. Texas, supra, pages 18, 22 of 176 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 251. There is no allegation that an adequate market for the goods in question may not be found outside the five states named. The facts alleged are not sufficient to warrant a finding that the enforcement of the statutes of any defendant would cause Alabama to suffer great loss or any serious injury. If filed, the bill would have to be dismissed for want of equity. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 265.\n Leave denied.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ARIZONA v.

The bill was 'dismissed without prejudice to an application for relief in case the stored water is used in such a way as to interfere with the enjoyment by Arizona, or those claiming under it, of any rights already perfected or with the right of Arizona to make additional legal appropriations and to enjoy the same.' Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 464\n, 51 S.Ct. 522, 529. \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n On February 14, 1934, Arizona moved for leave to file in this Court its original bill of complaint to perpetuate testimony in an action or actions arising out of the Boulder Canyon Project Act which 'at some time in the future' it will commence in this Court against California, and others therein named as defendants. \n1\n The bill sets forth:\n\n\n (a)\n The Act of Congress, August 19, 1921, c. 72, 42 Stat. 171, which authorized Arizona, California, Colorado, Navada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming to enter into a compact regarding the waters of the Colorado river; and the appointment of a representative to act for the United States.\n\n\n (b)\n The Colorado River Compact dated November 24, 1922, signed by representatives of the seven states-to 'become binding and obligatory when it shall have been approved by the legislature of each of the signatory States and by the Congress of the United States.'\n\n\n (c)\n The Act of Congress, December 21, 1928, known as the Boulder Canyon Project Act, c. 42, 45 Stat. 1057 (43 USCA  617 et seq.), which approved the Colorado River Compact subject to certain limitations and conditions, the approval to become effective upon the ratification of the compact, as so modified, by the Legislature of California and at least five of the other six states.\n\n\n (d)\n The Act of California, c. 16, March 4, 1929 (St. Cal. 1929, p. 38) limiting its use of the waters of the Colorado river in conformity with the Boulder Canyon Project Act.\n\n\n (e)\n The Proclamation of the President declaring the Boulder Canyon Project Act to be in effect, June 25, 1929, 46 Stat. 3000\n\n\n\n\n[292 U.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n (f) The General Regulation of the Secretary of the Interior, concerning the storage of water in Boulder Dam Reservoir and the delivery thereof, dated April 23, 1930, as amended September 28, 1931.\n The bill alleges, among other things:\n That no right of Arizona has yet been interfered with; that attempts will be made hereafter to interfere with its rights; that it is not possible to bring the issues which will arise to an immediate judicial investigation or determination, and it may be years before this can be done, because 'the cause or causes of action have not accrued and may not accrue for years to come'; that facts known only to certain named persons will be evidence material in the determination of such controversy or controversies; that these persons will be necessary witnesses in the prosecution of the action or actions which Arizona will be compelled to institute in order to protect its rights and those of persons claiming under it; and that all the persons with present knowledge of the present facts may not be available as witnesses when the cause or causes of action shall have accrued to the plaintiff. The prayer is for process to take the oral depositions and to perpetuate the testimony of these witnesses.\n On February 20, 1934, a rule issued to those named as defendants to show cause why leave to file the bill should not be granted. All filed returns. Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming stated that they have no objection to the filing of the bill or to the taking of any competent testimony; and prayed that to each state should be granted the right of cross-examination and the right to object to any such testimony on any ground either at the time of the taking or of its presentation to this Court. California and the public agencies of that state expressed a doubt as to the existence of jurisdiction in this Court. They opposed the granting of the motion on the ground that the testimony, if taken, \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 347]\n\u00a0\n would not be admissible in evidence; opposed also on the ground that the United States is an indispensable party; and insisted that the bill should not be received in the absence of consent by the United States to be sued. The Secretary of the Interior conceded that this Court has jurisdiction, but objected on th same grounds as California to granting the motion. Thereupon a brief was filed by Arizona, reply briefs by respondents, and a brief amicus curiae by the city and county of Denver, Colo.\n First. No bill to perpetuate testimony has heretofore been filed in this Court; but no reason appears why such a bill may not be entertained in aid of litigation pending in this Court, or to be begun here. Bills to perpetuate testimony had been known as an independent branch of equity jurisdiction before the adoption of the Constitution. \n2\n Congress provided for its exercise by the lower federal courts. \n3\n There the jurisdiction has been repatedly invoked;4 and it has been recognized by this Court. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The sole purpose of such a suit is to perpetuate the testimony. To sustain a bill of this character, it must appear that the facts which the plaintiff expects to prove \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 348]\n\u00a0\n by the testimony of the witnesses sought to be examined will be material in the determination of the matter in controversy; that the testimony will be competent evidence; that depositions of the witnesses cannot be taken and perpetuated in the ordinary methods prescribed by law, because the then condition of the suit (if one is pending) renders it impossible, or ( if no suit is then pending) because the plaintiff is not in a position to start one in which the issue may be determined; and that taking of the testimony on bill in equity is made necessary by the danger that it may be lost by delay.\n The allegations of the bill presented by Arizona are sufficient to show danger of losing the evidence by delay; and also to show Arizona's inability to perpetuate the testimony by the ordinary methods prescribed by law for the taking of depositions. The only question which requires consideration is whether the testimony which it is proposed to take would be material and competent evidence in the litigation contemplated.\n Second. The action or actions which Arizona expects to bring may rest upon a claim that 'the stored water is used in such a way as to interfere with the enjoyment by Arizona, or those claiming under it, of any rights already perfected or with the right of Arizona to make additional legal appropriations and to enjoy the same.' Specifically, Arizona claims rights under section 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 USCA  617c(a); these rights, it is said, are governed in turn by the terms of the Colorado River Compact. Briefly, the compact apportions the waters of the Colorado river between a group of states, termed the upper basin, north of Lee Ferry, and a group south thereof, the lower basin, among which are Arizona and California. The interference apprehended will, it is alleged, arise out of a refusal of the respondents to accept as correct that construction of article III(b) of the \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 349]\n\u00a0\n compact which Arizona contends is the proper one. It claims that this paragraph, which declares:\n'In addition to the apportionment in Paragraph (a), the lower basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by 1,000,00 acre-feet annum,' means, 'that the waters apportioned by Article III(b) of said compact are for the sole and exclusive use and benefit of the State of Arizona.'\n\n The bill charges that the Secretary of the Interior and the other defendants refuse to accept such construction; and that, by certain contracts made between the Secretary and the California defendants, they are asserting a right to appropriate the said 1,000,000 acre-feet of water to California uses. The bill states that the decision in some future action construing paragraph (b) will materially affect rights of Arizona arising under the Boulder Canyon Project Act, in particular section 4(a) thereof. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Arizona seeks, as stated in the bill, to perpetuate, and proposes to introduce in support of its construction of paragraph (b) of article III of the compact, in the actions to be brought in the future, testimony to the following effect by those who in 1922 were connected with the negotiation of the compact:\n'The representatives of all the States and the United States except the Arizona delegation were in agreement \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 350]\n\u00a0\n as to the definition of the Colorado River System, including the Gila River and its tributaries, and as to the division proposed, which substantially apportioned the waters of the Colorado River at Lee Ferry, the point selected as dividing the Upper Basin from the Lower Basin. The Arizona delegation refused and declined to accept the proposed compact because of the inclusion of the Gila River and its tributaries without any compensating provision to the State of Arizona in lieu of the waters thereof, which had already been appropriated and in which no other State could have any interest, on account of the further fact that the waters of the Gila River and its tributaries enter the Colorado River at Yuma, at a point so far down stream and of such low elevation that it was and is impossible to put the waters thereof to beneficial use in the United States after they reach the main stream of the Colorado River. Hence, the Arizona delegation pointed out that the conference was discussing something which had already been disposed of and in any event could not concern any State, other than Arizona. Several days elapsed in a discussion between the said representatives of this problem before a solution was found. The problem was finally thought solved by adding subdivision (b) of Article III to the compact as finally approved by said representatives which reads as follows:\n\n'(b) In addition to the apportionment in paragraph (a), the Lower Basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million acrefeet per annum.'\n\n'It was agreed between all the representatives of the various States and the representative of the United States, negotiating said compact, that said one million acre-feet apportioned by subdivision (b) of Article III of said compact was intended for and should go to the State of Arizona to compensate for the waters of the Gila River and \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 351]\n\u00a0\n its tributaries being included within the definition of the Colorado River System and the allocations of said compact, and that said one million acre- feet was to be used exclusively by and for the State of Arizona, that being the approximate amount of water then in use within the State of Arizona from the Gila River and its tributaries, and it was agreed that in view of the act that no appropriation or allocation of water had otherwise been made by said compact directly to any State, the one million acre-feet for the State of Arizona should be included in said compact by an allocation for the Lower Basin. And it was further agreed that a supplemental compact between the States, California, Nevada and Arizona should be adopted and that such supplemental compact should so provide.\n\n'The Arizona delegation stated that if it were agreed by all the representatives of the several States and of the United States that said million acre-feet should be for the exclusive benefit of the State of Arizona to provide compensation to Arizona on account of the inclusion of the waters of the Gila River and its tributaries in said compact, they would accept said compact, otherwise they would refuse to accept said compact. It was thereupon agreed by all representatives of all the States and of the United States, participating in said negotiations and conferences, that the waters apportioned by Article III, (b), of said compact were for the sole and exclusive use and benefit of the State of Arizona, and it was further agreed that a supplemental compact between the States of California, Nevada and Arizona should be adopted and that such supplemental compact should so provide. Thereupon said compact was signed by the representatives of the several States and of the United States.'\n\n Third. In this suit Arizona asserts rights under the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, not under the Colorado River Compact, which she has refused to ratify. \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 352]\n\u00a0\n That act approved the Colorado River Compact subject to certain limitations and conditions, the approval to become effective upon the ratification of the compact, as so modified, by the Legislatures of California and at least five of the six other states. It was so ratified. Arizona claims that section 4(a) of that act imposing limitations on the use of water by California was intended for her benefit; that section 4(a) embodies by reference article III(b), among others, of the compact for the purpose of defining the limitation, and that the proper interpretation of article III(b) will be, therefore, essential to a determination of Arizona's rights under the statute; that, read in the light of other sections of the compact, article III(b) is ambiguous; and that the testimony sought to be perpetuated will be material and admissible in removing the ambiguity. The elaborate argument in support of these contentions appears to be, in substance, as follows:\n\n 1. \nColorado River Compact apportions the water of the Colorado River System between the upper and the lower basin. By article II it defines the terms used:\n'(a) The term 'Colorado River system' means that portion of the Colorado River and its tributaries within the United States of America.'\n\n'(b) The term 'Colorado River Basin' means all of the drainage area of the Colorado River system and all other territory within the United States of America to which the waters of the Colorado River system shall be beneficially applied.'\n\n'(g) The term 'Lower Basin' means those parts of the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado River system below Lee Ferry and also all parts of said States located without the drainage area of the Colorado River system which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the system below Lee Ferry.' \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 353]\n\u00a0\n By article III the apportionment is made:\n\n'(a) There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado River system in perpetuity to the upper basin and to the lower basin, respectively, the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre-feet of water per annum, which shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist.'\n\n'(b) In addition to the apportionment in Paragraph (a), the lower basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by 1,000,000 acre-feet per annum.'\n\n'(d) The States of the upper division (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre-feet for any period of 10 consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification of this compact.'\n\n Article III does not in terms apportion as between the upper and the lower basin the surplus waters in excess of the amounts specifically allocated. But it recognizes in paragraph (c) that there may be 'surplus' waters in the river, applicable to the lower basin. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nThe Colorado River Compact does not purport to apportion between the states of the lower basin the share of each in the waters of the Colorado River Sys- \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 354]\n\u00a0\n tem; but Boulder Canyon Project Act makes some provision for such apportionment. By section 4(a) it provides that:\n'California, by act of its legislature, shall agree irrevocably and unconditionally with the United States and for the benefit of the States of Marizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, as an express covenant and in consideration of the passage of this chapter, that the aggregate annual consumptive use (diversions less returns to the river) of water of and from the Colorado River for use in the State of California, including all uses under contracts made under the provisions of this chapter and all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist, shall not exceed four million four hundred thousand acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the lower basin States by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River compact, plus not more than one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said compact, such uses always to be subject to the terms of said compact.'\n\n And that section authorizes Arizona, California, and Nevada to enter into an agreement which, among other things, shall provide:\n'(1) That of the 7,500,000 acre-feet annually apportioned to the lower basin by paragraph (a) of Article III of the Colorado River compact, there shall be apportioned to the State of Nevada 300,000 acre-feet and to the State of Arizona 2,800,000 acre-feet for exclusive beneficial consumptive use in perpetuity, and (2) that the State of Arizona may annually use one-half of the excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Colorado River compact, and (3) that the State of Arizona shall have the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of the Gila River and its tributaries within the boundaries of said State ... (7) said agreement to take effect upon the ratification of \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 355]\n\u00a0\n the Colorado River compact by Arizona, California, and Nevada.'\n\n\n 3. \nArizona refused to ratify the Colorado River Compact, and the authority conferred upon Arizona, Nevada, and California by the Boulder Canyon Project Act to enter into an agreement for apportioning the waters has not been acted on. But California bound itself, by the act of its Legislature, March 16, 1929, to the limitation of 4,400,000 acre-feet, plus one-half of the surplus; Arizona claims that the limitation on California's use must have been enacted for the benefit solely of Arizona, since georgraphically she alone could use waters in the lower basin which California may not use; and that, because it is embodied in a statute, the limitation imposed by Congress on California's use confers rights upon Arizona, although she failed to sign either the principal or the subsidiary compact.\n\n 4. \nIn support of the contention that article III(b) of the compact has a bearing on the interpretation of the limitation of section 4(a) of the act, Arizona points to the fact that, while the Boulder Canyon Project Act makes no mention of the 1,000,000 acre-feet assigned to the lower basin by article III(b) of the compact, section 4(a) of the act limits California, in terms, to 4,400,000 acre-feet of the waters apportioned to the lower basin under article III(a) of the compact plus one-half of the 'surplus waters unapportioned by said compact'; that section 4(a) declares that such uses by California are 'always to be subject to the terms of said compact'; that California claims that, in addition to the waters already mentioned, she is entitled, as one of the parties to the compact, to draw upon the article III(b) waters; and that, acting upon this assumption, the Secretary of the interior has already contracted with California users for delivery of 5,362,000 acre-feet of water per annum from the main \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 356]\n\u00a0\n stream of the Colorado river, though this water is not yet being delivered; whereas Arizona contends that by a proper interpretation of article III(b) California is excluded from all the waters thereunder in favor of Arizona.\n\n 5. \nIn support of the contention that article III(b) is ambiguous, Arizona points out that, whereas the compact awards to the lower basin, in the aggregate, 8,500,000 acre-feet of water,8 article III(d) of the compact shows that only 7,500,000 of this is to come from the main stream of the Colorado river, since that section provides:\n'The States of the upper division will not cause the flow of the River at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre- feet for any period of 10 consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification of this compact.'\n\n It argues that the 75,000,000 was doubtless arrived at through multiplying by ten the 7,500,000 acre-feet per annum apportioned to the lower basin under article III(a); that, though the lower basin is entitled to 8,500,000 acre-feet, it can only call on the upper basin to release 7, 500,000 acre-feet from the main stream; that the only other waters below Lee Ferry which are available to the lower basin come from tributaries entirely in Arizona; that these waters enter the Colorado river at a point so far south that they could not be used in the United States after they enter the Colorado; and they have in fact been appropriated for use in Arizona; that therefore what has in terms been awarded to the lower basin is in practical effect available only to that part of the lower basin constituted by Arizona.\n Fourth. It is clear that the meaning of the compact, considered merely as a contract, can never be material in the contemplated litigation, since Arizona refused to ratify \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 357]\n\u00a0\n the compact. Arizona rests her rights wholly upon the acts of Congress and of California. Arizona claims that California's construction of section 4( a) of the statute would allow her water which under the compact has been assigned to Arizona, and that a conflict is thus raised between the statute and the compact which the suggested testimony is competent to resolve. But the resolution of this alleged conflict can never be material to any case based on the compact considered as contract, since Arizona neither has nor claims any contractual right.\n Fifth. Nor does Arizona show that article III(b) of the compact is relevant to an interpretation of section 4(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act upon which she bases her claim of right. It may be true that the Boulder Canyon Project Act leaves in doubt the apporti nment among the states of the lower basin of the waters to which the lower basin is entitled under article III(b). But the act does not purport to apportion among the states of the lower basin the waters to which the lower basin is entitled under the compact. The act merely places limits on California's use of waters under article III(a) and of surplus waters; and it is 'such' uses which are 'subject to the terms of said compact.'\n There can be no claim that article III(b) is relevant in defining surplus waters under section 4(a) of the act; for both Arizona and California apparently consider the waters under article III(b) as apportioned. \n9\n It is true that Arizona alleges (not in the bill however but in her brief) that she 'hopes to be able to show in the case hereafter to be brought' by evidence of Congressional Committee hearings and other legislative history that the failure in the statute to apportion the 1,000, 000 acre-feet of waters was due to an understanding by Congress that article \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 358]\n\u00a0\n III(b) of the compact had already assigned these waters to Arizona, and that the limitation on California was passed in the light of this understanding. This hope, if fulfilled, would not make article III(b) relevant. The allegation is, not that Congress incorporated article III(b) into the act; it is that Congress understood that article III(b) had allotted all the waters therein to Arizona.\n Sixth. The considerations to which Arizona calls attention do not show that there is any ambiguity in article III(b) of the compact. Doubtless the anticipated Physical sources of the waters which combine to make the total of 8,500,000 acre-feet are as Arizona contends, but neither article III(a) nor (b) deal with the waters on the basis of their source. Paragraph (a) apportions waters 'from the Colorado River system,' i.e., the Colorado and its tributaries, and (b) permits an additional use 'of such waters.' The compact makes an apportionment only between the upper and lower basin; the apportionment among the states in each basin being left to later agreement. Arizona is one of the states of the lower basin, and any waters useful to her are by that fact useful to the lower basin. But the fact that they are solely useful to Arizona, or the fact that they have been appropriated by her, does not contradict the intent clearly expressed in paragraph (b) (nor the rational character thereof) to apportion the 1,000,000 acre-feet to the states of the lower basin and not specifically to Arizona aone. It may be that, in apportioning among the states the 8,500,000 acre-feet allotted to the lower basin, Arizona's share of waters from the main stream will be affected by the fact that certain of the waters assigned to the lower basin can be used only by her; but that is a matter entirely outside the scope of the compact.\n The provision of article III(b), like that of article III(a), is entirely referable to the main intent of the \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 359]\n\u00a0\n compact, which was to apportion the waters as between the upper and lower basins. The effect of article III(b) (at least in the event that the lower basin puts the 8,500,000 acre-feet of water to beneficial uses) is to preclude any claim by the upper basin that any part of the 7,500,000 acre- feet released at Lee Ferry to the lower basin may be considered as 'surplus' because of Arizona waters which are available to the lower basin alone. Congress apparently expected that a complete apportionment of the waters among the states of the lower basin would be made by the subcompact which it authorized Arizona, California, and Nevada to make. If Arizona's rights are in doubt, it is, in large part, because she has not entered into the Colorado River Compact or into the suggested subcompact.\n Seventh. Even if the construction to be given paragraph (b) of the compact were relevant to the interpretation f any provision in the Boulder Canyon Project Act, and such provision were ambiguous, the evidence sought to be perpetuated is not of a character which would be competent to prove that Congress intended by section 4(a) of the 1928 act to exclude California entirely from the waters allotted by article III(b) to the states of the lower basin and to reserve all of those waters to Arizona. The evidence sought to be perpetuated is not documentary. It is testimony as to what divers persons said six years earlier while negotiating a compact with a view to preparing the proposal for submission to the Legislatures of the seven states and to Congress for approval-a proposal which Arizona has not ratified and which the six other states and Congress did ratify, as later modified, by statutes enacted in 1928 and 1929. The Boulder Canyon Project Act rests, not upon what was thought or said in 1922 by negotiators of the compact, but upon its ratification by the six states.\n It has often been said that, when the meaning of a treaty is not clear, recourse may be had to the negotia- \n\n[292 U.S. 341, 360]\n\u00a0\n tions, preparatory works, and diplomatic correspondence of the contracting parties to establish its meaning. Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 49 S.Ct. 223. Compare United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1\n, 16 S. Ct. 725; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 223\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; Cook v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 102\n, 53 S.Ct. 305. See Yu , The Interpretation of Treaties, pp. 138, 192; Chang, The Interpretation of treaties, p. 59 et seq. But that rule has no application to oral statements made by those engaged in negotiating the treaty which were not embodied in any writing and were not communicated to the government of the negotiator or to its ratifying body. There is no allegation that the alleged agreement between the negotiators made in 1922 was called to the attention of Congress in 1928 when enacting the act; nor that it was called to the attention of the Legislatures of the several states.\n As Arizona has failed to show that the testimony which she seeks to have perpetuated could conceivably be material or competent evidence bearing upon the construction to be given article III, paragraph (b), in any action which may hereafter be brought, the motion for leave to file the bill should be denied. We have no occasion to determine whether leave to file the bill should be denied also because the United States was not made a party and has not consented to be sued.\n Leave to file bill denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Namely, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Harold L.

Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal presents the question of the validity of an order made by the Interstate Commerce Commission on July 5, 1932, requiring to Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company to desist from an unjust discrimination \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n found to exist in the relation of intrastate and interstate rates and to maintain certain rates for the intrastate transportation of logs, as described, within and throughout the State of Florida for distances of 170 miles or less. 186 I.C.C. 157; 190 I.C.C. 588. The order was sustained by the District Court, three judges sitting. 4 F.Supp. 477.\n By an order of August 2, 1928, the Commission prescribed interstate rates on logs on the lines of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company from points in northern Florida to destinations in Georiga for distances not exceeding 170 miles. Finding that the Florida intrastate rates on similar logs for similar hauls, generally described as the Cummer scale, resulted in unjust discrimination, the Commission also established rates for intrastate application within Florida which would correspond with the rates fixed for interstate transportation. 146 I.C.C. 717. The order in the latter respect was assailed and the decree of the District Court sustaining it was reversed by this Court. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. We decided that the order could not be upheld on the ground of undue prejudice against persons and localities in interstate commerce, and that it could not be sustained on the ground of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce from the standpoint of revenue losses due to intrastate rates as the order in that aspect was not supported by appropriate findings.\n Meanwhile, in February, 1929, both the interstate rates and intrastate rates, as prescribed, had been put into effect. After the mandate of this Court, the Cummer scale of intrastate rates was restored and became effective on April 10, 1931. The Interstate Commerce Commission reopened the proceedings and, after hearing, found that the Cummer scale of intrastate rates caused unjust discrimination against interstate commerce from a revenue standpoint. The Commission made no finding with respect to undue prejudice against persons and localities \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce. The Commission accordingly entered the order of July 5, 1932, now under review. While bills were pending in the District Court to enjoin this order, the Commission granted a further hearing in view of the representation that a number of southern railroads had reduced their log rates, and on January 9, 1933, the Commission made an additional report which affirmed the findings previously made and restored the order of July 5, 1932, to be effective February 25, 1933. 190 I.C.C. 600. Supplemental bills were filed in the District Court, and on February 24, 1933, the decree was entered upholding the Commission's action.\n The order of the Commission is attacked upon the grounds: (1) That under Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 1933 (c. 91, 48 Stat. 211 (49 USCA  250, 251 and note, 252 et seq.)), the Commission was without power to make the order; (2) that the findings of the Commission are inadequate to sustain the order; and (3) that if the findings can be deemed to be adequate, they are not supported by the evidence.\n First. The power of the Commission. By Transportation Act, 1920 (41 Stat. 484 (49 USCA  13)), the Congress granted specific authority to the Commission to remove discriminations against interstate commerce caused by intrastate rates. The Congress amended section 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce so as to emplower the Commission to confer with state authorities 'with respect to the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State bodies and of the commission.' Section 13(3), 49 USCA  13(3). And, whenever in the course of its authorized investigations, the Commission, after full hearing, finds that any rate, regulation, or practice 'made or imposed by authority of any State' (section 13(3) causes 'any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrim- \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n ination against interstate or foreign commerce' (section 13(4), the Commission is required to prescribe the rate thereafter to be charged, or the regulation or practice thereafter to be observed, in such manner as in its judgment will remove the discrimination. The order of the Commission is to bind the carriers, parties to the proceeding, 'the law of any State or the decision or order of any State authority to the contrary notwithstanding.' Section 13(4), 49 USCA  13(4).\n In Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 585-587, 42 S.Ct. 232, 236, 22 A.L.R. 1086, we reached the conclusion that the provision of section 13(4) for the removal of 'any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate ... commerce' was not to be regarded as referring only to discrimination as between persons and localities. We held that Transportation Act 1920 imposed an affirmative duty on the Commission 'to fix rates and to take other important steps to maintain an adequate railway service for the people of the United States.' Intrastate rates, we said, must play a most important part in maintaining such an adequate system. If there was interference with the achievement of that purpose because of a disparity of intrastate rates as compared with interstate rates, the Commission was authorized to end that disparity. It was to be ended because it constituted an 'unjust discrimination against interstate ... commerce.' We concluded that these words in section 13(4) were not tautological, but had the necessary effect of conferring authority upon the Commission to raise intrastate rates so that the intrastate traffic may produce its fair share of the earnings required to meet maintenance and operating costs and to yield a fair return on the value of property devoted to the transportation service, both interstate and intrastate. United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70, 75\n, 54 S.Ct. 28.\n Appellants insist that this result was reached because of what was described as the 'dovetail relation' between \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n section 13(4) and section 15a, and that the amendment of the latter section by Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 1933 (49 USCA  15a), has effected a radical change. They contend that the Commission no longer has authority to remove an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce caused by a disparity of intrastate rates viewed from a revenue standpoint. We are unable to accept that view. Section 13(4) was not amended by Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 1933. The authority conferred by section 13(4) to prescribe intrastate rates for the purpose of removing an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce was not withdrawn. The Congress had knowledge of the construction given to section 13(4) by this Court and of the important effect of that construction in relation to intrastate rates found to be inadequate. The conclusion is not lightly to be reached that the Congress would have undertaken to change a policy of such great importance without explicit language indicating that purpose.\n The purpose of the changes in section 15a is not left in doubt. They were made with the manifest object of eliminating the provisions for the recapture of excess income of carriers and of revising the rule as to rate making. \n1\n The requirement imposed by Transportation Act 1920 for the adjustment of rates according to rate groups was abolished and in substitution the Commission was directed to give due consideration to the factors which are specified in the section as amended. \n2\n Thus the Commission is to consider, \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n among other factors, the effect of rates on the movement of traffic'; 'the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient railway transportation service at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service'; and 'the need of revenues sufficient to enable the carriers, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide such service.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Neither the elimination of the group method of rate making, nor the substituted rule, suggests an intention to impair the Commission's authority over intrastate rates for the appropriate protection of interstate commerce. On the contrary, the substituted rule of rate making by \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n its express terms emphasizes the carriers' need of adequate revenues. The Congress had provided authority to meet that need where inadequate intrastate rates caused unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. The Commission had exercised that authority. The Commission had not proposed the diminution of that authority. The new Act discloses no intention to weaken national control for essential national purposes over the railway system of the country. It was rather designed to aid that control in the light of the depressed economic condition of the railways. We conclude that the new rule of rate making left the power of the Commission under section 13(4) intact.\n Second. The Commission's findings. On the former appeal we pointed out that if the action of the Commission was not simply for the removal of undue prejudice against interstate commerce as between persons or localities, and the Commission undertook to prescribe a statewide level of intrastate rates in order to avoid an undue burden, from a revenue standpoint, upon the interstate carrier, there should be appropriate findings upon evidence to support an order directed to that end. We observed that in dealing with unjust discrimination as between persons and localities the question was one of the relation of rates to each other; but that in considering the authority of the Commission to enter the state field and to change a scale of intrastate rates in the interest of the carrier's revenue, the question was that of the relation of rates to income. But to support the order then under review, the Commission had made no findings as to the revenue which had been derived by the carrier from the traffic in question, or which could reasonably be expected under the increased rates, or that the alteration of the intrastate rates would produce, or was likely to produce, additional income necessary to prevent an undue burden upon the carrier's interstate revenues and to maintain an \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n adequate transportation service. Florida v. United States, supra, pages 212, 214, 215, of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 119.\n On the new hearing, the Commission made comprehensive findings to supply what had thus been found to be lacking. The findings set forth at length transportation conditions, traffic and revenues. 186 I.C.C. 160-189. Appellants' criticisms proceed upon an unwarranted assumption. The requirement of essential findings as to revenues did not demand an impracticable exactness. Losses through inadequate rates could be shown satisfactorily even though proof of the precise extent of such losses was not available. Reasonable determinations were required and these were made.\n Reviewing the history of the Cummer scale of intrastate rates on logs, and considering comparable interstate and intrastate rates, the Commission found that the Cummer scale was abnormally low and less than reasonably compensatory; that the defendants' revenue under the Cummer scale was 'insufficient under all the circumstances and conditions to cover the full cost of the service.' Id., pages 165, 187, of 186 I.C.C. The Commission was able to go further. In considering the effect of the Cummer scale upon interstate commerce, the Commission was aided by evidence of actual operations during the period from February 8, 1929, to January 31, 1931, when the increased intrastate rates prescribed by the former order were in effect. The Commission, in its summary, found (Id., pages 188, 189, of 186 I.C.C.):\n'The record shows that during the period of approximately two years following the increase in the rates the total movement amounted to 18,602 cars. This total included 3,740 cars transported to Eastport, Lacoochee, and Otter Creek in trainload movements that have ceased and will not be resumed. Under normal economic conditions it seems probable that the annual volume of the Florida log movement under rates the same as those previously \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n prescribed will not be less than the average of this 2-year period minus the number of cars included in the discontinued trainload movements. This average is 7,431 cars. That the movement will not be less than this under normal conditions is confirmed by the fact during the five months immediately preceding the last hearing in this case, February to June, 1931, when conditions were abnormal, there were shipped over defendant's lines in Florida a total of 2,765 cars of logs. This movement was at the rate of 6,636 cars a year. We believe that the movement of logs intrastate in Florida over defendant's lines will not be materially curtailed under the rates which we here prescribe, which are the same or substantially the same as the rates generally in effect and under which logs freely move throughout the South.\n\n'The freight charges collected on the 18,602 cars above referred to aggregated $571,508.94, and if the Cummer scale had applied the charges would have been $281,225.75. The freight charges collected on the 3,740 cars referred to were $100,439.06, and if the Cummer scale had applied they would have been $48,286.75. On the 14,862 cars remaining after deducting the 3,740 cars from the total movement of 18,602, the freight charges collected were $471,069.88 ($571,508.94 minus $100,439.06) and if the Cummer scale had been applicable they would have been $232,939 ($281, 225.75 minus $48,286.75) or $238,130.88 less than those actually collected. Accordingly, on the basis of an average of 7,431 cars a year under normal economic conditions, which basis we believe conservative, the gross revenues under the rates prescribed by the previous order herein would be more than $100,000 a year greater than under the Cummer scale, now in effect. The application of the Cummer scale, therefore, places a substantial burden upon defendant's interstate revenues. If the revenues yielded by the Cummer scale are not sufficient to cover the cost of the service, as the cost evidence \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n indicates, it would follow that part of the above-stated amount would constitute a dead loss in net revenue.\n\n'We find that the circumstances and conditions surrounding the transportation of these logs intrastate in Florida are not on the whole as favorable as the circumstances and conditions surrounding the interstate movement of logs over defendant's lines. ...\n\n'We further find that the intrastate rates on logs over 6 feet in length, except walnut, cherry, and cedar, applicable between points on the Atlantic Coast Line in Florida for distances of 170 miles and less are, and for the future will be, unjustly discriminatory against interstate commerce, and that such unjust discrimination can be and should be removed by the establishment between all points on the Atlantic Coast Line in Florida for distances of 170 miles or less of rates not less than the rates shown for such distances in Appendix F hereto, which are the rates found reasonable for interstate application from northern Florida to Georgia.'\n\n On the second rehearing, with respect to changes made by southern rail carriers in their log rates-which appeared to have been made largely for the purpose of meeting truck competition-the Commission found that in Florida the movement of logs had 'not been shown to have gone to the trucks to any substantial extent where the hauls are over 25 miles; that 'truck-competitive rates for distances under 25 miles would regain little, if any, traffic'; and that the maintenance of the Cummer scale to meet what little truck competition could be met in that way would greatly decrease the revenues of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company and would not be warranted. 190 I.C.C. 599.\n We perceive no ground for the contention that the Commission has failed to make the basic findings necessary to support its ultimate conclusion. \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Third. The evidence before the Commission. The question of the weight of the evidence was for the Commission and not for the court. The authority conferred upon the Commission by Section 13(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, with respect to intrastate rates, is not different in its quality or effect from that given to the Commission to prevent other sorts of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. That authority rests upon the constitutional power of the Congress, extending to interstate carriers as instruments of interstate commerce, to require that these agencies shall not be used in such manner as to cripple, retard, or destroy that commerce, and to provide for the execution of that power through a subordinate body. The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 354 S., 355, 34 S.Ct. 833; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co., supra. The purpose for which the Commission was created was to bring into existence a body which, from its special character, would be best fitted to determine, among other things, whether upon the facts in a given case there is an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S.Ct. 113. That purpose unquestionably extended to the prohibited discrimination produced by intrastate rates. In relation to such a discrimination, as in other matters, when the Commission exercises its authority upon due hearing, as prescribed, and without error in the application of rules of law, its findings of fact supported by substantial evidence are not subject to review. It is not the province of the courts to substitute their judgment for that of the Commission. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 100\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; Western Chemical Company v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S.Ct. 500; Virginian Railway Company v.

Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 50\n, 51 S., 52 S.Ct. 285. \n\n[292 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n We agree with the conclusion of the District Court that there was no lack of substantial evidence to support the Commission's findings.\n The Commission's determinations were 'without prejudice to the right of the authorities of the State of Florida or of any other interested party to apply in the proper manner for a modification of its (our) findings and order as to any specified intrastate rate on the ground that it is not related to interstate rates in such a way as to contravene the provisions of the interstate commerce act.' 190 I.C.C. 600.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See report of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, H.R.

It is difficult to conceive of a reasonable rate which would ignore any one of these considerations. The Commission as a fair and impartial body acting for the Congress will continue to give consideration to these factors. In the case of the power given to the Commission to prescribe just and reasonable rates the committee does not believe that it is necessary to encumber the statutes with further language which might be mandatory in terms but which could and nothing further to the plain duty of the Commission under the law, and which might be interpreted to imply a distrust of the Commission in prescribing just and reasonable rates. The Commission will and must give consideration to all facts developed on the record and see to it that the record is enlightening as to such factors as are mentioned in the first section of this bill.'

Allen, of St. Louis, Mo., and Lee B. Ewing, of Nevada, Mo., for the State of Missouri.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is a direct appeal to this Court from a decree of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri, entered May 6, 1933, in receivership proceedings, and allowing a claim of the state of Missouri for $7,000, as an unsecured obligation. The preference sought by the state was denied. The claim is founded upon alleged overcharges in railway passenger fares, exacted of the state of Missouri by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company during the years 1907 to 1913, inclusive, contrary to the provisions of the Missouri statute of 1907 ( Laws Mo. 1907, p. 170). In a suit to enjoin the enforcement of that statute, an interlocutory injunction was granted by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri, and later a final decree made the injunction permanent. St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Hadley, 168 F. 317. In 1913, on a direct appeal to this Court under authority of section 5 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891 (c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827, 828, Jud. Code, 1911,  238), the constitutional validity of the Missouri statute was sustained and the parties to the suit which embraced the Missouri Pacific Railway Company were directed to apply to the court below for the entry of an appropriate decree.

Thereafter, the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri entered a decree dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, and appointing a master to hear claims for ad interim overcharges. No such claim appears to have been filed in that court by this appellant.\n In 1915, in a suit in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri, a receiver was \n\n[292 U.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n appointed for the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and, in 1916, the state of Missouri intervened in that suit and presented the claim which resulted in the decree from which the present appeal is taken.\n Appellant contends that the decree should be treated as supplementary to that directed by this Court in Knott v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co., supra, and as appealable directly to this Court because the decree in the Knott Case was so appealable. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 142\n, 39 S.Ct. 237.\n The Court is of the opinion that it lacks statutory authority to entertain the appeal. The appeals in the Missouri Rate Cases and Knott v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co., supra, were taken from decrees of the United States Circuit Court entered in 1909 and were authorized by those provisions of section 5 of the Judiciary Act of 1891 (26 Stat. 828), supra, providing for a direct appeal to this Court from the circuit (later, district) courts 'in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States,' and 'in any case in which the constitution or law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.' By the Act of February 13, 1925 ( c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 938 (28 USCA  345)), the provision for a direct appeal to this Court from the decree of a District Court in cases involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, was deleted. While provision was retained for a direct review in this Court in cases involving an application for interlocutory injunction to prevent state officers from enforcing a state statute in violation of the Federal Constitution, this provision obtained only where the hearing in the District Court was before three judges, as provided by section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380).\n The appeal is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.

Bacon, and Wm. A. Stevens, of Red Bank, N.J., for the State of New Jersey.\n Messrs. Clarence A. Southerland and Reuben Satterthwaite, Jr., both of Wilmington, Del., for the State of Delaware.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Invoking our original jurisdiction, New Jersey brings Delaware into this court and prays for a determination of the boundary in Delaware Bay and river.\n The controversy divides itself into two branches, distinct from each other in respect of facts and law. The first branch has to do with the title to the bed or subaqueous soil of the Delaware river within a circle of twelve miles about the town of New Castle. Delaware claims to be the owner of the entire bed of the river within the limits of this circle up to low-water mark on the east or New Jersey side. New Jersey claims to be the owner \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 364]\n\u00a0\n up to the middle of the channel. The second branch of the controversy has to do with the boundary line between the two states in the river below the circle and in the bay below the river. In that territory as in the river above, New Jersey bounds her title by the Thalweg. Delaware makes the division at the geographical center, an irregular line midway between the banks or shores.\n The special master appointed by this court in January, 1930 (\n280 \nU.S. 529\n, 50 S.Ct. 151), has now filed his report. As to the boundary within the circle, his report is in favor of Delaware. To that part of the report exceptions have been filed by New Jersey. As to the boundary in the bay and in the river below the circle, his report is in favor of New Jersey. To that part exceptions have been filed by Delaware. The two branches of the controversy will be separately considered here.\n First. The boundary within the circle.\n Delaware traces her title to the river bed within the circle through deeds going back two and a half centuries and more.\n On August 24, 1682, the Duke of York delivered to William Penn a deed of feoffment for the twelve-mile circle whereby he conveyed to the feoffee 'all that the Towne of Newcastle otherwise called Delaware and All that Tract of Land lying within the Compass or Circle of Twelve Miles about the same scituate lying and being upon the River Delaware in America And all Islands in the same River Delaware and the said River and Soyle thereof lying North of the Southermost part of the said Circle of Twelve Miles about the said Towne.' On October 28, 1682, there was formal livery of seisin of the lands and waters within the twelve-mile circle. John Moll and Ephriam Herman, attorneys appointed in the deed of feoffment, gave possession and seisin 'by delivery of the fort of the sd Town and leaving the sd William Penn in quiet and peaceable possession thereof and allso \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n by the delivery of turf and twig and water and Soyle of the River of Delaware.' 'We did deliver allso unto him one turf with a twigg upon it a porringer with River water and Soyle in part of all what was specified in the sd Indentures or deeds.'\n By force of these acts there was conveyed to the feoffee any title to the river bed within the circle that then belonged to the feoffor. New Jersey insists, however, that the feoffor, the Duke of York, was not then the owner of any territory west of the easterly side of the Delaware river, and hence at the time of the feoffment had no title to convey. Letters patent from Charles II, dated May 12, 1664, had granted to the Duke full title to and government of a large territory in America, embracing much of New England and in particular 'all the land from the west side of Connecticut River to the east side of Delaware Bay,' not including, however, lands or waters to the west. True the Duke had gone into possession of lands westward of the grant, including land within the circle, and through his delegates and deputies was exercising powers of government. His acts in that behalf were the outcome of conflicts with the Dutch. What is now the state of Delaware had been subject to the government of the Dutch until 1664, when with the victory of the English arms it became an English colony. From that time until August 24, 1682, the date of the deed of feoffment, Delaware was governed (with the exception of a brief period from July, 1763, to February 9, 1764) as a dependency of the Government and Colony of New York through governors commissioned by the Duke of York and Albany. Upon the delivery of the deed to Penn, the Duke was the de facto overlord of the land within the circle, though title at that time was still vested in the Crown.\n The deed of feoffment had in it a covenant for further assurance at any time within seven years. At the in- \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 366]\n\u00a0\n stance of Penn and with little delay, the feoffor took steps to carry out this covenant and thus rectify his title. On March 22, 1682\/3, letters patent under the Great Seal of England were issued to the Duke of York for the identical lands and waters described in the deed of feoffment from York to William Penn. \n1\n There is no doubt that these letters were delivered to the Duke. The special master has found upon evidence supporting the conclusion that they were afterwards delivered to Penn from whom they passed to his descendants. The master also found, and again upon sufficient evidence, that the letters patent so delivered 'were never thereafter surrendered, nor was the grant of lands and waters thereby made ever abandoned nor was its validity ever impaired by any act or proceeding.' By force of this grant there passed to the Duke of York a title to the land within the circle which inured by estoppel to the grantee under the feoffment.\n The applicable principle in such circumstances is among the rudiments of the law of property. The covenant generating the estoppel is commonly one of warranty or seisin. Irvine v. Irvine, 9 Wall. 617; Van Rensselaer v. Kearney, 11 How. 297, 323, 325; Tefft v. Munson, 57 \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 367]\n\u00a0\n N.Y. 97; Vanderheyden v. Crandall, 2 Denio (N.Y.) 9, affirmed Wendell v. Crandall, 1 N.Y. 491; White v. Patten, 24 Pick.(Mass.) 324.2 The effect is the same where the covenant is one for further assurance. Taylor v. Debar, 1 Chan.Cas. 274 (1676); Lamb v. Carter, 14 Fed. Cas. page 991, No. 8,013, 1 Sawy. 212; Wholey v. Cavanaugh, 88 Cal. 132, 25 P. 1112; Hope v. Stone, 10 Minn. 141 (Gil. 114); Norfleet v. Russell, 64 Mo. 176. To enforce that conclusion we do not need to wander far afield and consider other deeds than the specific one in question. There exists for our enlightenment the opinion of the chancellor in an historic litigation where the relation between the feoffment of August, 1682, and the later patent from the Crown, was the very point at issue. A dispute had arisen between Lord Baltimore and Penn as to the title to part of the Delaware territory. On May 10, 1732, after Penn was in his grave, there was an agreement between his sons and Baltimore for the settlement of the boundaries between Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. Three years later a bill was filed in chancery for the specific performance of the agreement of May, 1732, to which suit the Attorney General was made a party as the representative of the Crown. \n3\n The Duke of York had become King under the name of James II on February 6, 1685, and George II sat upon the throne when the cause in chancery was heard. The Lord Chancellor, Hardwicke, gave judgment for the Penns. Penn v. Lord Baltimore, 1 Ves Sen. 444; also Ridg. t H. 332. In his opinion he holds that the effect of the letters patent is to make the deed of feoffment good either by force of an estoppel or by converting the feoffor into a trustee for \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 368]\n\u00a0\n the feoffee. The objection is urged upon him that an estoppel will not prevail against the Crown. The chancellor makes it plain that he is not favorably impressed. 'For the Duke of York, being then (i.e., at the date of the feoffment) in nature of a common person, was in a condition to be estopped by a proper instrument.' At the same time, he is diffident about declaring a technical estoppel, nor is there need to go so far. If his Majesty was not estopped, he was in any event a trustee of the title for the use of the feoffee, which will bring about a like result. 'The Duke of York ... while a subject was to be considered as a trustee; why not afterwards as a royal trustee?' 'His successors take the legal estate under the same equity; and it is sufficient for plaintiffs if they have an equitable estate.' So Lord Baltimore must make performance in accordance with the contract. True, the decree for performance will be 'without prejudice to any prerogative, right, or interest in the Crown.' This again is by virtue of the deference owing to the Crown by the keeper of his conscience. 'Being liberated from the restraints of the lord chancellor, we are at liberty to say, that the duke, at the date of the deeds, being a subject, was, in this respect, only 'a common person,' and as much bound by estoppel as any other subject.' Per Sergeant, Arbitrator, in the case of Pea Patch Island, 30 Fed. Cas. pages 1123, 1151, No. 18,311.\n In the meantime Penn had proceeded to organize a government for the Delaware territory. On October 29, 1682, he issued a summons to persons of note in the community to meet him at the town of New Castle on November 2 for the holding of a General Court to settle the jurisdiction of the territory. At that court he announced his title derived from the Duke of York, and instructed the magistrates that until laws were enacted by a proper assembly they should take for their guide the laws that had been provided by his Royal Highness for the Province \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 369]\n\u00a0\n of New York, promising that they should be governed thereafter by such laws and orders as they should consent to by their own deputies and representatives. A general assembly having been summoned, an Act of Union was passed, December 7, 1682, whereby the three counties of Delaware territory were annexed to Pennsylvania. In the same month was enacted an Act of Settlement providing for a Provincial Council and Assembly and reciting the letters patent to Pennsylvania and the deeds of release and feoffment from the Duke of York. Following the establishment of this government, Penn and his successors as Proprietaries and Governors, and the Assembly and Council of the Province, together with the Assembly of the Lower Counties subsequently established, continued to exercise the power of government in all its plenitude over Pennsylvania and the Delaware territory. This continued until the Revolution except for a brief interruption during the reign of William and Mary.\n There were, it is true, intermittent challenges both of the proprietary interest of Penn and his successors and of their governmental powers. As to these last, the most serious challenge was one that followed the accession of William and Mary in February, 1689, after the deposition of James II as the result of the 'Glorious Revolution.' Penn, who had been a favorite of royalty during the reign of James, was for a time under a cloud. In 1692, he was removed from the Government of Pennsylvania, including the New Castle country, and his place given to a successor. But he was soon restored to power, and, it seems, to the royal confidence. In August, 1694, there was an Order in Council by which he was reestablished in his former office. In the same month letters patent issued under the Great Seal of State restoring him in the most formal way to the administration of the government of the 'said province and territories,' and revoking any other appointment inconsistent therewith. \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 370]\n\u00a0\n This patent, it would seem, had settled for all time the validity of his exercise of governmental powers, however much it may have left in doubt his title to the land. Mutterings of uncertainty, however, continued to be heard as to his rights and powers in both aspects. In 1701, he had correspondence with the Board of Trade which showed itself restless on the subject of his ownership. At intervals during the reign of Anne and afterwards he was required to sign a declaration that the approval by the Crown of his governmental acts, such as the appointment of a deputy, was not to be construed in any manner to diminish 'her Majesty's claim of right to the said three lower counties.' But the claims of right thus reserved were never admitted by Penn to be valid, nor were they ever pressed by the Crown. Not even the petitions of jealous rivals, egging the Crown on, were of avail to wake it into action. Thus, in 1717, the Earl of Sutherland applied for a grant of the three Lower Counties, asserting that he was ready to prove that the title was in the Crown. The Attorney General issued a summons to Penn to be present at a hearing, but Penn, who had suffered a stroke of apoplexy, was unable to appear, and the proceeding was allowed to lapse. A like fate awaited similar petitions submitted in later years. Reservations of the royal claims might continue to be made by cautious scriveners. By the time of the Revolution they were little more than pious formulas. A title, good of record when reinforced by the patent of 1683, had been confirmed by a century of undisturbed possession. When the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, the land within the circle was part of the territory of Delaware, and the title was in the Penns or in persons claiming under them.\n The Declaration of Independence had made Delaware a state with boundaries fixed as of that time. Nothing that was done by her legislature thereafter has had the \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 371]\n\u00a0\n effect of cutting down her territorial limits, however much it may have affected the private ownership of the Penns and their successors. Nothing thereafter done has had the effect of adding to the territory then belonging to New Jersey. Even so, a word must be said as to resolutions and statutes that became a law in Delaware shortly after the treaty of peace, since they are much relied upon by New Jersey as marking the true boundary. The legislation is directed to the disposition of unappropriated lands. A resolution of January 16, 1793, recommends to the citizens of Delaware 'to take up no Warrants, and to accept of no Patents or Deeds whatever, from John Penn the Younger and John Penn, or either of them, or their Agents or Attornies.' A statute of February 2, 1793, visits the penalty of a fine on inhabitants refusing to abide by these recommendations and accepting any grants of vacant or uncultivated lands except from persons acting under the authority of the state. Another statute (February 7, 1794) recites in an elaborate preamble that 'the right to the soil and lands within the known and established limits of this state, was heretofore claimed by the crown of Great Britain,' that by the treaty of peace between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, his Majesty 'relinquished all rights, proprietary and territorial within the limits of the said United States, to the citizens of the same, for their sole use and benefit; by virtue whereof the soil and lands within the limits of this state became the right and property of the citizens thereof,' and that 'the claims of the late and former pretended proprietaries of this state, to the soil and lands contained within the same, are not founded either in law or in equity.'\n We do not yield assent to the contention that the effect of these acts was to establish a new boundary between Delaware and New Jersey either as the result of estoppel or through practical construction. There is no element of estoppel. The declarations in respect of title were not \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 372]\n\u00a0\n addressed to New Jersey, nor did action follow on the faith of them. There is not even a suficient basis for a claim of practical construction. The declarations were framed alio intuitu, with an eye to private titles, not to public boundaries. In the economic unrest and disturbance of the day, the inhabitants of Delaware were ready to disavow the claims of the Penns and others to the ownership of vast areas of uncultivated land. This is far from meaning that there was a disavowal of the grants whereby the colony of Delaware had derived its form and being. What the legislation had in view was enlargement, not restriction, of the domain of common ownership. The truth, indeed, is that for the purpose of an inquiry into the boundaries between colonies or states, questions of private ownership are of secondary importance. The Penns' title may have been misjudged, or may even have failed for reasons not now apparent, and yet it does not follow that the boundaries of New Jersey had thereby been enlarged or those of Delaware curtailed. Such a result could not be wrought without successfully impeaching the letters patent of 1683 whereby a seigniory in the new world was conveyed by Charles to James. The effect of those letters was to define the territorial limits of the province or colony of Delaware, whether Penn and his successors took anything thereby or not. The colony of Delaware as defined by this patent was the one that declared its independence in 1776 and that succeeded in 1783 to any fragment of ownership abiding in the Crown. In resuming the title to uncultivated lands, its people had no thought of modifying the ancient boundaries, of relinquishing a foot of soil above the waters or below. The later history of the controversy between the states makes this abundantly clear, if it could otherwise be doubtful. What concerns us now is more than a question of meum and tuum between one man and another. One concern \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 373]\n\u00a0\n is with the meaning of an instrument of government, a patent of jurisdiction, which was to generate a state.\n The letters patent of March 1683, being basic to the defendant's title, there must be another word of reference to the contention for the complainant that the letters were surrendered in April, 1683, a month after they were granted. The special master, as we have already stated, has made a finding to the contrary, and has summarized the evidence. There would be no profit now in repeating the analysis. Not only does the master find that there was no surrender of the patent, he finds that the original patent is in evidence before him. His holding that there was no surrender is in line with Lord Hardwicke's judgment in Penn v. Lord Baltimore. His holding that the original letters are extant and in the custody of Delaware is in line with the judgment of the arbitrator, rendered eighty- five years ago, in the case of Pea Patch Island, supra. We see no adequate reason for rejecting his conclusion.\n Assuming the existence of the patent, New Jersey makes the claim that in its application to the river bed it is void upon its face in that the Crown was without power to grant away the soil beneath navigable waters. The objection will not hold. The letters patent to the Duke of York and the grant from York to Penn were not for private uses solely, but for purposes of government. There is high authority for the view that power was in the Crown by virtue of the jus privatum to convey the soil beneath the waters for uses merely private, but subject always to the jus publicum, the right to navigate and fish. Commonwealth v. Alger, 7 Cush. (Mass.) 53; People v. N.Y. & S.I. Ferry Co., 68 N.Y. 71. 76; People v. Steeplechase Park Co., 218 N.Y. 459, 473, 113 N.E. 521, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 1099; Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 14 S.Ct. 548; Hale, De Jure Maris, p. 22. Never has it been doubted that the grant will be upheld \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 374]\n\u00a0\n where the soil has been conveyed as an incident to the grant or delegation of powers strictly governmental. Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410, 413, Massachusetts v. New York, \n271 \nU.S. 65, 89\n, 90 S., 46 S.Ct. 357. In such circumstances, 'the lands under the navigable waters passed to the grantee, as one of the royalties incident to the powers of government; and were to be held by him, in the same manner, and for the same purposes, that the navigable waters of England, and the soils under them, are held by the Crown.' Martin v. Waddell, supra, page 413 of 16 Pet .. The grant from Charles II to York was upon its face an instrument of government. The feoffments from York to Penn were in furtherance of kindred ends. Penn had no thought of using his title to the soil as an obstruction to navigation or to any other common right. In a letter to one of his commissioners he writes as early as April, 1683, concerning boundary negotiations with the Province of New Jersey: 'Insist upon my Title to ye River, Soyl and Islands thereof according to Grant . ... Whatever bee ye Argument, they are bounded Westward by the River Delaware, yn they cannot go beyond low water mark for land. They have ye Liberty of ye River, but not ye Propriety.' The title to the soil, which was subject to the jus publicum while it was vested in the King and his grantees, is subject to the same restrictions in the ownership of Delaware. The patent and the deeds under it are not void for want of power.\n Delaware's chain of title has now been followed from the feoffment of 1682 to the early days of statehood, and has been found to be unbroken. The question remains whether some other and better chain can be brought forward by New Jersey. Unless this can be done, Delaware must prevail. But down to the Peace of 1783 at the end of the Revolution, New Jersey has no chain to offer. Up to that time, if not afterwards, her reliance is less upon \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 375]\n\u00a0\n the strength of her own title than on the weakness of her adversary's. The supposed defects have already been reviewed in this opinion, and have been found to be unreal. There is still to be considered whether events during the years of statehood have worked a change of ownership. New Jersey argues that they have, though not even during those years does she build her claim of title upon instruments of record. Her claim is rather this, that through the exercise of dominion by riparian proprietors and by the officers of government, title to the subaqueous soil up to the centre of the channel has been developed by prescription. The special master held otherwise, and we are in accord with his conclusion.\n The acts of dominion by riparian proprietors are connected with the building of wharves and piers that project into the stream. The structures were built and maintained without protest on the part of Delaware, and no doubt with her approval. There is nothing in their presence to indicate an abandonment by the Sovereign of title to the soil. By the law of waters of many of our states, a law which in that respect has departed from the common law of England, riparian proprietors have very commonly enjoyed the privilege of gaining access to a stream by building wharves and piers, and this though the title to the foreshore or the bed may have been vested in the state. Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497; Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 \nU.S. 141, 157\n, 158 S., 21 S.Ct. 48; Shively v. Bowlby, supra, at pages 24, 55 of 152 U.S., 14 S.Ct. 548; Town of Brookhaven v. Smith, 188 N.Y. 74, 80 N.E. 665, 9 L.R.A. (N.S.) 326; United States v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352, 357\n, 53 S.Ct. 614. New Jersey in particular has been liberal in according such a license (State v. Jersey City, 25 N.J. Law, 525), and so, it seems, has Delaware (Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. v. Paschall, 5 Del.Ch. 435; State v. Reybold, 5 Har. 484, 486), though in Delaware, unlike New Jersey, title to the foreshore is in the riparian proprietor. From acquiescence in these improvements of the river front, there can \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 376]\n\u00a0\n be no legitimate inference that Delaware made over to New Jersey the title to the stream up to the middle of the channel or even the soil under the piers. The privilege or license was accorded to the owners individually and even as to them was bounded by the lines of their possession.\n Apart from these acts of dominion by riparian proprietors, there are other acts of dominion by New Jersey and its agents which are relied upon now as indicative of ownership. They include the service of process, civil and criminal; the assessment of improvements for the purpose of taxation;4 and the execution of deeds of conveyance to the United States and others. Of all it is enough to say that they are matched by many other acts, equally indicative of ownership and dominion, by the Government of Delaware. The master summarizes the situation with the statement that 'at no time has the State of Delaware ever abandoned its claim, dominion or jurisdiction over the Delaware River within said twelve-mile circle, nor has it at any time acquiesced in the claim of the State of New Jersey, thereto, except as modified by the ... Compact of 1905.'\n The truth indeed is that almost from the beginning of statehood Delaware and New Jersey have been engaged in a dispute as to the boundary between them. There is no room in such circumstances for the application of the principle tht long acquiescence may establish a boundary otherwise uncertain. Vermont v. New Hampshire, \n289 \nU.S. 593, 613\n, 53 S.Ct. 708; Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 U.S. 479\n, 509, \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 377]\n\u00a0\n 511, 10 S.Ct. 1051; Massachusetts v. New York, supra, page 95 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 357. Acquiescence is not compatible with a century of conflict. Only a few instances will be mentioned among many that are available. In 1813, the Delaware Assembly ceded to the United States an island in the Delaware river, east of the main channel and within the twelve mile circle, for the erection of a fort. A controversy arose between the United States as holder of the Delaware title and Henry Gale who claimed under New Jersey. In 1836, Gale brought ejectment in the United States Circuit Court against Beling, a tenant. Mr. Justice Baldwin charged the jury that Penn had no title, but the charge makes it plain that he had no knowledge of the letters patent of 1683, and that they were not in evidence before him. Later an arbitration was agreed upon between Humphrey, who had succeeded to the New Jersey title, and the Government of the United States, represented by the Secretary of War. In that proceeding the award was in favor of the Government. The opinion by the arbitrator, which was announced in January, 1849, is a careful and able statement of the conflicting claims of right. See the case of Pea Patch Island, supra. But the controversy would not down. In 1877, New Jersey began a suit in this court to establish the disputed boundary. It slumbered for many years, and finally in April, 1907, was discontinued without prejudice. \n205 \nU.S. 550\n, 27 S.Ct. 793. If a record such as this makes out a title by acquiescence, one is somewhat at a loss to know how protest would be shown.\n The complainant builds another argument upon a compact with the defendant which was ratified by the parties in March, 1905, and approved by Congress in January of that year. 34 Stat. c. 394, p. 858. We are told that by this compact the controversy was set at rest and the claim of Delaware abandoned. It is an argument wholly without force. The compact of 1905 provides for the en- \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 378]\n\u00a0\n joyment of riparian rights, for concurrent jurisdiction in respect of civil and criminal process, and for concurrent rights of fishery. Beyond that it does not go. 'Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State of, in, or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the subaqueous soil thereof, except as herein expressly set forth.'\n This opinion, though it has summarized many facts and arguments, has perforce omitted many others, important in the view of counsel. We content ourselves with the statement that they have not been overlooked. Omission is the less serious in view of the able and comprehensive report submitted by the special master. All that matters most in this keen but amicable controversy is there set forth at large, and there and in the supporting documents the student of our local history can live it over when he will.\n We uphold the title of Delaware to the land within the circle.\n Second. The boundary below the circle in the lower river and the bay.\n Below the twelve-mile circle there is a stretch of water about five miles long, not different in its physical characteristics from the river above, and below this is another stretch of water forty-five miles long where the river broadens into a bay.\n The title to the soil of the lower river and the bay is unaffected by any grant to the Duke of York or others. The letters patent to James do not affect the ownership of the bed below the circle. Up to the time when New Jersey and Delaware became independent states, the title to the soil under the waters below the circle was still in the Crown of England. When independence was achieved, the precepts to be obeyed in the division of the waters were those of international law. Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, 379. \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 379]\n\u00a0\n International law today divides the river boundaries between states by the middle of the main channel, when there is one, and not by the geographical center, halfway between the banks. Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 8 S., 9, 13 S.Ct. 239; Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n175 \nU.S. 626, 631\n, 20 S.Ct. 205; Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 26 S.Ct. 408, 571; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 169\n, 170 S., 38 S.Ct. 301, L.R.A. 1918D, 258; Arkansas v. Mississippi, \n250 \nU.S. 39\n, 39 S.Ct. 422; Minnesota v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 273, 282\n, 40 S.Ct. 313. It applies the same doctrine, now known as the doctrine of the 'Thalweg,' to estuaries and bays in which the dominant sailing channel can be followed to the sea. Louisiana v. Mississippi, supra; and compare 1 Halleck International Law (4th Ed.) p. 182; Moore, Digest International Law, vol. 1, p. 617; Matter of Devoe Manufacturing Co., \n108 \nU.S. 401\n, 2 S. Ct. 894; The Fame, 8 Fed. Cas. page 984, No. 4,634, Story, J .; The Open Boat, 18 Fed. Cas. page 751, No. 10,548, Ware, J. The 'Thalweg,' or downway, is the track taken by boats in their course down the stream, which is that of the strongest current. 1 Westlake, International Law, p. 144; Orban, Etude de Droit Fluvial International, pp. 343, 343; Kaeckenbeck, International Rivers, p. 176; Hyde, supra; Fiore, Internalational Law Codified,  1051; Calvo, Dictionnaire de Droit International. Delaware makes no denial that this is the decisive test whenever the physical conditions define the track of navigation. Her position comes to this, that the bay is equally navigable in all directions, or at all events was no navigable in 1783, and that in the absence of a track of navigation the geographical center becomes the boundary, not of choice, but of necessity. As to the section of the river between the bay and the circle, the same boundary is to be accepted, we are told, as a matter of convenience.\n The findings of the special master, well supported by the evidence, overcome the argument thus drawn from physical conditions. He finds that 'as early as Fisher's Chart of Delaware Bay (1756) there has been a well- \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 380]\n\u00a0\n defined channel of navigation up and down the Bay and River,' in which the current of water attains its maximum velocity; that 'Delaware River and Bay, on account of shoals, are not equally navigable in all directions, but the main ship channel must be adhered to for safety in navigation'; that the Bay, according to the testimony, 'is only an expansion of the lower part of the Delaware River,' and that the fresh water of the river does not spread out uniformly when it drains into the bay, but maintains a continuing identity through its course into the ocean. 'The record shows the existence of a well-defined deep water sailing channel in Delaware River and Bay constituting a necessary truck of navigation, and the boundary between the States of Delaware and New Jersey in said bay is the middle of said channel.'\n The underlying rationale of the doctrine of the Thalweg is one of equality and justice. 'A river,' in the words of Holmes, J. (New Jersey v. New York, \n283 \nU.S. 336, 342\n, 51 S.Ct. 478, 479), 'is more than an amenity, it is a treasure.' If the dividing line were to be placed in the centre of the stream rather than in the centre of the channel, the whole track of navigation might be thrown within the territory of one state to the exclusion of the other. Considerations such as these have less importance for commonwealths or states united under a general government than for states wholly independent. Per Field, J., in Iowa v. Illinois, supra, page 10 of 147 U.S., 13 S.Ct. 239. None the less, the same test will be applied in the absence of usage or convention pointing to another. Iowa v. Illinois, supra. Indeed, in 1783, the equal opportunity for use that was derived from equal ownership may have had a practical importance for the newly liberated colonies, still loosely knit together, such as it would not have today. They were not taking any chances in affairs of vital moment. Bays and rivers \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 381]\n\u00a0\n are more than geometrical divisions. They are the arteries of trade and travel.\n The commentators tell us of times when the doctrine of the Thalweg was still unknown or undeveloped. Anciently, we are informed, there was a principle of co-dominion by which boundary streams to their entire width were held in common ownership by the proprietors on either side. 1 Hyde, International Law, p. 243,  137. Then, with Grotius an Vattel, came the notion of equality of division (Nys, Droit International, vol. 1, pp. 425, 426; Hyde, supra, p. 244, citing Grotius, De Jure Belli et Pacis, and Vattel, Law of Nations), though how this was to be attained was still indefinite and uncertain, as the citations from Grotius and Vattel show. \n5\n Finally, about the end of the eighteenth century, the formula acquired precision, the middle of the 'stream' becoming the middle of the 'channel.' There are statements by the commentators that the term Thalweg is to be traced to \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 382]\n\u00a0\n the Congress of Rastadt in 1797 (Engelhardt, Du Re gime Conventionnel des Fleuves Internationaux, p. 72; Koch, Histoire des Traite  de Paix, vol. 5, p. 156), and the Treaty of Lune ville in 1801. Hyde, supra, pp. 245, 246; Kaeckenbeck, International Rivers, p. 176; Adami, National Frontiers, translated by Behrens, p. 17. If the term was then new, the notion of equality was not. There are treaties before the Peace of Lune ville in which the boundary is described as the middle of the channel, though, it seems, without thought that in this there was an innovation, or that the meaning would have been different if the boundary had been declared to follow the middle of the stream. Hyde, supra, p. 246. Thus, in the Treaty of October 27, 1795, between the United States and Spain (Article IV), it is 'agreed that the western boundary of the United States which separates them from the Spanish colony of Louisiana is in the middle of the channel or bed of the River Mississippi.' Miller, Treaties and other International Acts of the United States of America, vol. 2, p. 321.6 There are other treaties of the same period in which the boundary is described as the middle of the river without further definition, yet this court has held that the phrase was intended to be equivalent to the middle of the channel. Iowa v. Illinois, Arkansas v. Tennessee, Arkansas v. Mississippi, supra. See, e.g., the Treaty of 1763 between Great Britain, France and Spain, which calls for 'a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi.' The truth plainly is that a rule was in the making which was to give fixity and precision to what had been indefinite and fluid. \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 383]\n\u00a0\n There was still a margin of uncertainty within which conflicting methods of division were contending for the mastery. Conceivably that is true today in unusual situations of avulsion or erosion. Hyde, supra, pp. 246, 247. Even so, there has emerged out of the flux of an era of transition a working principle of division adapted to the needs of the international community. Through varying modes of speech the law has been groping for a formula that will achieve equality in substance, and not equality in name only. Unless prescription or convention has intrenched another rule (1 Westlake, International Law, p. 146), we are to utilize the formula that will make equality prevail.\n In 1783, when the Revolutionary War was over, Delaware and New Jersey began with a clean slate. There was no treaty or convention fixing the boundary between them. There was no possessory act nor other act of dominion to give to the boundary in bay and river below the circle a practical location, or to establish a prescriptive right. In these circumstances, the capacity of the law to develop and apply a formula consonant with justice and with the political and social needs of the international legal system is not lessened by the fact that at the creation of the boundary the formula of the Thalweg had only a germinal existence. The gap is not so great that adjudication may not fill it. Lauterpacht, The Function of Law in the International Community, pp. 52, 60, 70, 85, 100, 110, 111, 255, 404, 432. Treaties almost contemporaneous, which were to be followed by a host of others, were declaratory of a principle that was making its way into the legal order. Hall, International Law (7th Ed.) p. 7. International law, or the law that governs between states, has at times, like the common law within states, a twilight existence during which it is hardly distinguishable from morality or justice, till at length the imprimatur of a court attests its jural quality. Lauter \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 384]\n\u00a0\n pacht, supra, pp. 110, 255; Hall, supra, pp. 7, 12, 15, 16; Jenks, The New Jurisprudence, pp. 11, 12. 'The gradual consolidation of opinions and habits' (Vinogradoff, Custom and Right, p. 21) has been doing its quiet work. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It is thus with the formula of the Thalweg in its application to the division between Delaware and New Jersey. We apply it to that boundary, which goes back to the Peace of Paris, just as we applied it to the boundary between Illinois and Iowa, which derives from a treaty of 1763 ( Iowa v. Illinois, Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, Arkansas v. Tennessee, Arkansas v. Mississippi, supra), or to that between Louisiana and Mississippi (\n202 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 26 S.Ct. 408, 571), which goes back to 1812, or between Minnesota and Wisconsin (\n252 \nU.S. 273\n, 40 S. Ct. 313), going back to 1846. Indeed, counsel for Delaware make no point that the result is to be affected by difference of time. In requests submitted to the master they have asked for a finding that 'there was in 1783 no well defined channel in the Delaware Bay constituting a necessary track of navigation and the boundary line between the States of Delaware and New Jersey in said bay is the geographical center thereof.' The second branch of the request is dependent on the first. This is clear enough upon its face, but is made doubly clear by the exceptions to the report and by \n\n[291 U.S. 361, 385]\n\u00a0\n the written and oral arguments. The line of division is to be the center of the main channel unless the physical conditions are of such a nature that a channel is unknown.\n We have seen that even in the bay the physical conditions are consistent with a track of navigation, which is also the course of safety. Counsel do not argue that such a track is unknown in the five miles of river between the bay and the circle. The argument is, however, that the geographical center is to be made the boundary in the river as a matter of convenience, since otherwise there will be need for a sharp and sudden turn when the river meets the bay. Inconvenient such a boundary would unquestionably be, but the inconvenience is a reason for following the Thalweg consistently through the river and the bay alike instead of abandoning it along a course where it can be followed without trouble. If the boundary be taken to be the geographical center, the result will be a crooked line, conforming to the indentations and windings of the coast, but without relation to the needs of shipping. Minnesota v. Wisconsin, supra. If the boundary be taken to be the Thalweg, it will follow the course furrowed by the vessels of the world.\n The report will be confirmed, and a decree entered accordingly, which, unless agreed to by the parties, may be settled upon notice.\n Within the twelve-mile circle, the river and the subaqueous soil thereof up to low water mark on the easterly or New Jersey side will be adjudged to belong to the state of Delaware, subject to the Compact of 1905\n\n\n Below the twelve-mile circle, the true boundary between the complainant and the defendant will be adjudged to be the middle of the main ship channel in Delaware river and bay.\n The costs of the suit will be equally divided\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following is the description: 'All that the Towne of Newcastle otherwise called Delaware and the fort therein or thereunto belonging scituate lying and being between Maryland and New Jersey in America And all that Tract of land lying within the Compasse or Circle of twelve miles about the said Towne Scituate lying and being upon the River of Delaware and all Islands in the said River of Delaware and the said River and Soyle thereof lying North of the Southermost part of the said Circle of twelve miles about the said Towne And all that Tract of Land upon Delaware River and Bay beginning twelve miles South from the said Towne of Newcastle otherwise called Delaware and extending South to Cape Lopen.' Powers of government and other proprietary and seignorial rights were granted to the Duke along with ownership of the fee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare, however, as to covenants of seisin, Doane v. Willcutt, 5 Gray (Mass.) 328, 66 Am.Dec. 369; Allen v. Sayward, 5 Me. (5 Greenl.) 227, 17 Am.Dec. 221. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Attorney General filed two answers in the cause, neither of which asserted any beneficial title in the Crown, but merely prayed that the court might 'Preserve all such Rights Title and Interest of in or to the Premises as shall appertain or belong to his Majesty.'\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The complainant points for illustration to the construction of important works for the use of the Dupont Co. 4,400 feet below low water level, and taxation of these works like other property in New Jersey. At that time controversy was flagrant between the two states. No inference of ownership can be drawn from dominion exerted in such conditions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Grotius has this to say (De Jure Belli et Pacis, Book 2, c. 3,  18 ): 'In Case of any Doubt, the Jurisdictions on each Side reach to the Middle of the River that runs betwixt them, yet it may be, and in some Places it has actually happened, that the River wholly belongs to one Party; either because the other Nation had not got possession of the other Bank, 'till later, and when their Neighbours were already in Possession of the whole River, or else because Matters were stipulated by some Treaty.'\n In an earlier section (section 16, subdivision 2) he quotes a statement of Tacitus that at a certain point 'the Rhine began ... to have a fixed Channel, which was proper to serve for a Boundary.'\n Vattel (Law of Nations, supra) states the rule as follows: 'If, of two nations inhabiting the opposite banks of the river, neither party can prove that they themselves, or those whose rights they inherit, were the first settlers in those tracts, it is to be supposed that both nations came there at the same time, since neither of them can give any reason for claiming the preference; and in this case the dominion of each will extend to the middle of the river.'\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See, also, the treaties collected in the Argument of the United States before the International Boundary Commission in the Chamizal Arbitration of 1910 between the United States and Mexico.\n Nys traces the concept of the Thalweg to a period earlier than the Treaty of Munster, 1648. Droit International, v. 1, p. 426.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 'International law, as well as domestic law, may not contain, and generally does not contain, express rules decisive of particular cases; but the function of jurisprudence is to resolve the conflict of opposing rights and interests by applying, in default of any specific provision of law, the corollaries of general principles. ... This is the method of jurisprudence; it is the method by which law has been gradually evolved in every country resulting in the definition and settlement of legal relations as well between States as between private individuals.'

Code Ohio,  6064-1 et seq.), the state Legislature passed an act providing a system of control for the manufacture, sale, and importation of, and traffic in, beer and intoxicating liquors within the state, and creating a state monopoly for the distribution and sale of all spirtuous liquors under a department of liquor control; that the state has purchased intoxicating liquors at a cost of more than $4,500,000 for sale to permit holders and to the public through its state stores, each of which will be entirely and exclusively state owned, managed, and controlled; that the state is about to open in the various counties \n\n[292 U.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n one hundred and eighty-seven such state liquor stores; that defendants have threatened to, and unless enjoined by this court will, levy and collect excise taxes on the agencies and operations of the state in the conduct of its department of liquor control, and enforce against the state, its officers, agents, and employees, penalties for nonpayment of taxes imposed by section 3244, Rev. St., as amended (U.S.C. tit. 26,  205 (26 USCA  205)), and other designated statutes of the United States; that complainant is not subject to these statutes and is immune from any tax imposed thereby; and that the acts of Congress which impose such taxes do not by their terms include a state, or its officers or employees, and were not intended to do so. It is further alleged that the circumstances of the case are extraordinary and exceptional in several respects, among them being that the attempt is to tax a sovereign state; and it therefore is contended that the equity power of the court is properly invoked under the principles stated in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 62\n, 42 S.Ct. 453.\n The state act deals with the subject in great detail; but for present purposes the provisions set forth in the bill to which we have just referred are all that require consideration.\n The provisions of the federal statutes, so far as necessary to be stated, follow:\n U.S.C. tit. 26,  205, 26 USCA  205 (Rev. St.,  3244, as amended):\n'(a) Retail liquor dealers.-Retail dealers in liquor shall pay $25. Every person who sells or offers for sale foreign or domestic distilled spirits, wines or malt liquors otherwise than as hereinafter provided in less quantities than five wine gallons at the same time shall be regarded as a retail dealer in liquors.\n\n'(b) Wholesale liquor dealers.-Wholesale liquor dealers shall each pay $100. Every person who sells, or offers for sale foreign or domestic distilled spirits, wines or malt liquors, otherwise than as hereinafter provided in quanti- \n\n[292 U.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n ties of not less than five wine gallons at the same time shall be regarded as a wholesame liquor dealer.'\n\n U.S.C. tit. 26,  11, 26 USCA  11 (Rev. St.  3140, as amended):\n'... Where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, the word 'person,' as used in this title, shall be construed to mean and include a partnership association, company, or corporation, as well as a natural person.'\n\n Putting aside various preliminary questions raised by defendants ( compare Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 448\n, 49 S.Ct. 411; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 553), we pass at once to the fundamental question involved in the state's challenge to the validity of the tax. That challenge seeks to invoke a principle, resulting from our dual system of government, which frequently has been announced by this court and is now firmly established, that 'the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the states exert the governmental powers belonging to them are ... exempt from taxation by the United States.' Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 575\n, 51 S.Ct. 601, 602; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436; The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, and other cases cited in Trinityfarm Construction Co. V. Grosjean, \n291 \nU.S. 466\n, 54 S.Ct. 469, March 5, 1934. But, by the very terms of the rule, the immunity of the states from federal taxation is limited to those agencies which are of a governmental character. Whenever a state engages in a business of a private nature, it exercises nongovernmental functions, and the business, though conducted by the state, is not immune from the exercise of the power of taxation which the Constitution vests in the Congress. This court, in South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737, a case in no substantial respect distinguishable from the present one, definitely so held. Compare Board of Trustees of University of Illinois v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 48, 59\n, 53 S.Ct. 509. $The South ,Carolina Case arose under a state statute, which, like the one at bar, created a monopoly and rohibited the sale of intoxicating liquors except at dispen- \n\n[292 U.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n saries to be operated by the state. This court, while sustaining the validity of the statute and fully accepting the rule that the national government was without power to impose a tax in any form which had the effect of prohibiting the full discharge by the state of its governmental functions, held that 'whenever a State engages in a business which is of a private nature that business is not withdrawn from the taxing power of the Nation.' The decision sustained the identical tax provisions involved in the present case, and therefore we follow it as controlling.\n A distinction is sought in the fact that after that case was decided the Eighteenth Amendment was passed, and thereby, it is contended, the traffic in intoxicating liquors ceased to be private business, and then with the repeal of the amendment assumed a status which enables a state to carry it on under the police power. The point seems to us altogether fanciful. The Eighteenth Amendment outlawed the traffic; but certainly it did not have the effect of converting what had always been a private activity into a governmental function. The argument seems to be that the police power is elastic and capable of development and change to meet changing conditions. Nevertheless the police power is and remains a governmental power, and applied to business activities is the power to regulate those activities, not to engage in carrying them on. Rippe v. Becker, 56 Minn. 100, 111, 112, 57 N.W. 331, 22 L.R.A. 857. If a state chooses to go into the business of buying and selling commodities, its right to do so may be conceded so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned; but the exercise of the right is not the performance of a governmental function, and must find its support in some authority apart from the police power. When a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, and takes on the character of a trader, so far, at least, as the taxing power of the federal government is concerned. Compare Georgia v. Chattanooga, \n264 U.S. 472\n, 480-483, 44 S.Ct. 369; Bank of U.S. v. Planters' \n\n[292 U.S. 360, 370]\n\u00a0\n Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 907; Bank of Kentucky v. Wister, 2 Pet. 318, 323; Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, 323-325; Curran v. State of Arkansas, 15 How. 304, 309.\n We find no merit in the further contention that a state is not embraced within the meaning of the word 'person,' as used in U.S.C. tit. 26,  205, 26 USCA  205, and defined in section 11, supra. By section 205 the tax is levied upon every 'person who sells, etc.'; and by section 11 the word 'person' is to be construed as meaning and including a partnership, association, company, or corporation, as well as a natural person. Whether the word 'person' or 'corporation' includes a state or the United States depends upon the connection in which the word is found. Thus, in Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508, 517\n, 13 S.Ct. 418, it is said that the word 'person' in the statute there under consideration would include the United States as a body politic and corporate. See, also, Giddings v. Holter, 19 Mont. 263, 266, 48 P. 8; State v. Herold, 9 Kan. 194, 199. A state is a person within the meaning of a statute punishing the false making or fraudulent alteration of a public record 'with intent that any person may be defrauded.' Martin v. State, 24 Tex. 61, 68. Under a statute defining a negotiable note as a note made by one person whereby he promises to pay money to another person, and providing that the word 'person' should be construed to extend to every corporation capable by law of making contracts, it was held that the word included a state. State of Indiana v. Woram, 6 Hill (N.Y.) 33, 38, 40 Am.Dec. 378. And a state is a person or a corporation within the purview of the priority provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. \n1\n In re Western Implement Co.

Comm. 123.\n In the South Carolina Case this court disposed of the question by holding that, since the state was not exempt from the tax, the statute reached the individual sellers who acted as dispensers for the state. While not rejecting that view, we prefer, in the light of the foregoing examples, to place our ruling upon the broader ground that the state itself, when it becomes a dealer in intoxicating liquors, falls within the reach of the tax either as a 'person' under the statutory extension of that word to include a corporation, or as a 'person' without regard to such extension.\n The motion for leave to file the bill of complaint, accordingly, is denied.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.C. tit. 11,  104(b)(5), 11 USCA  104(b)(5), 'debts owing to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is entitled to priority.'

Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals from orders of a statutory court of three judges, convened in the Southern District of Ohio, in two suits, one brought by the state of Ohio and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, and the other by the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, to enjoin and set aside two orders of the commission. The suits were consolidated for trial. The first of the commission's orders, that of May 2, 1933, required the increase of Ohio intrastate rates on bituminous coal from certain mining districts in Eastern and Southern Ohio to destinations in the northeastern portion of the state. The second order, that of May 9, 1933, required the rates prescribed by the first to be increased by the amount of the surcharge authorized upon interstate rates on bituminous coal in the Fifteen Per Cent Case, 1931, 178 I.C.C. 539, 179 I.C.C. 215, and 191 I.C.C. 361. While the causes were under submission, the period during which the surcharge was authorized expired, and it was discontinued. The court, therefore, refrained from any adjudication as to the order of May 9, 1933, and no issue is here raised concerning it.\n The court granted preliminary injunctions, but after a hearing on the merits, dissolved them and dismissed the bills. It, however, stayed the operation of the order of May 2, 1933, for a period of sixty days, so that the plaintiffs might perfect an appeal to this Court. Upon the allowance of an a peal (No. 868) the defendants took a \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n cross-appeal (No. 886) assigning as error the entry of the stay order. By decree of February 12, 1934 (291 U.S. --, 54 S.Ct. 452, 78 L.Ed. --), the stay was vacated. The appeal in No. 886 will, therefore, be dismissed as moot.\n The commission's order of May 2, 1933, requiring the rates intrastate from points in Southern and Eastern Ohio to destinations in Northeastern Ohio, on bituminous coal in carload lots, to conform to those in effect prior to June 30, 1932, was entered under section 13(3) and (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act. \n1\n The commission found that the reduced rates put into effect on the intrastate traffic in question as a result of orders or permission of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio were unduly preferential of persons and localities in Ohio, unduly prejudicial to persons and localities without the state, and that they cast an undue revenue burden upon interstate commerce.\n The appellants, conceding the commission's power under section 13(3) and (4) of the act (Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 208\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70\n, 54 S.Ct. 28; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 78 L.Ed . --), claim the dismissal of the bills was erroneous for these reasons: ( 1) The commission did not afford them the full and fair hearing to which they are entitled by section 13 of the act. (2) There is no evidence to support the finding that restoration of the state rates to their former level was required to avoid undue preference and prejudice between persons and localities. (3) The commission exceeded its authority in requiring the state rates to be raised, without first having found reasonable, or made reasonable, all substantially competitive interstate rates to the same destinations.\n The District Court held the order justified by reason of undue preference and prejudice, but did not pass upon the lawfulness of the commission's action in respect of \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n revenue discrimination. We hold the decision of the court was right and we need not discuss the arguments presented as to revenue burden.\n The litigation does not involve state-wide rates, but only those on bituminous coal in carloads from producing fields in Ohio to destinations in that portion of the state lying northwardly of a line drawn east and west through Columbus, and eastwardly of a line drawn north and south through Galion and Sandusky and Columbus. The latter territory is highly industrialized, and great quantities of coal are there consumed for manufacturing and domestic purposes. This comes from the producing districts in Eastern Ohio and from those to the east and south in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and adjoining states. The rates are group rates from each mining district; all mines within a single district enjoying the same rate to a given destination. As found by the court below, prior to August 1, 1932, there was maintained what it described as 'a finely balanced and nicely adjusted schedule of interstate and intrastate rates on bituminous coal from the Western Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, and Ohio coal mining districts, to Northeastern Ohio, with fixed differentials which have been regarded as essentially reasonable, in view of all the elements which must be considered in rate making.' These differentials had been maintained long prior to the year 1932; the rates being based upon that from the Pittsburgh district to Youngstown. With that rate fixed those from more remote producing districts, such as Connellsville, immediately south of the Pittsburgh district, and Fairmont, south of Connellsville, in Northern West Virginia, were made by adding a differential; and rates to Cleveland and other more distant destinations also by adding a differential.\n In 1932 the Ohio Commission ordered a reduction in the rates from two Ohio producing districts (Middle-Massillon and Ohio No. 8) to Canton and to Massillon. ' \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway sought and obtained permission to extend the reductions to other destinations. The result was lowered scales to important coal consuming points such as Cleveland and Lorain. The New York Central, the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore & Ohio, and the Pittsburgh & West Virginia, as well as the Wheeling & Lake Erie, serve the Ohio producing territory. They resisted the proposed reductions of the Wheeling & Lake Erie, but without success. In order to meet competition, they reduced the rates between No. 8 District in Ohio and Northeastern Ohio destinations. Thereafter, in order to preserve rate relationships, the Ohio Commission compelled reductions from mines in the Cambridge, Hocking, and Pomeroy districts. Thus, by November 1, 1932, all of the intrastate rates between origins in Ohio and destinations in the territory above mentioned had been substantially lowered. This threw out of relation the interstate rates from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts.\n Several proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission resulted. In September and October, 1932, twelve carriers serving the Ohio districts and other origin territory in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and nearby states complained that the reductions gave an undue advantage and preference to persons and localities in Ohio to the prejudice of persons and localities outside the state, and charged also unreasonable and unjust discrimination against, and undue burden upon, interstate commerce. The commission ordered an investigation, and named as respondents all railroads operating in Ohio subject to its jurisdiction. Subsequently four complaints were filed on behalf of operators of mines in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. These alleged that the reduced Ohio rates in their relation to interstate rates were unduly preferential of Ohio shippers and localities, and unduly prejudicial to interstate shippers and localities, and un- \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n justly discriminated against interstate commerce. Three of the complaints asserted that the interstate rates to Northeastern Ohio from mines in the Pittsburgh, Freeport, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts were unreasonable and in violation of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 USCA  1). After the Ohio rates were reduced the P. & W. Va. Railroad lowered its rates from the Pittsburgh district. The commission suspended these rates, but by a subsequent order permitted their continuance subject to further investigation. The complaint cases and the investigation and suspension case against the P. & W. Va. Railroad were consolidated with the thirteenth section investigation and heard upon a single record.\n The commission found that Northeastern Ohio is served principally by the Pennsylvania, New York Central, Baltimore & Ohio, Wheeling, and Nickle Plate-Erie systems; that all of these carriers participate in the rates and transportation of bituminous coal from the Ohio mines and mines in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other states, to the same destination, and that there is a large movement of coal from the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia mines to Northeastern Ohio. From the record it concluded that coal is transported from the Ohio mines to the destinations in question 'at intrastate rates which are generally substantially lower, distance considered, than are the reasonable interstate rates herein provided, under which such coal is moved to such destinations from Pennsylvania and West Virginia'; and that 'this disparity in rates is greater than is warranted by differences in transportation conditions from the Ohio mines on the one hand and the Pennsylvania and West Virginia mines on the other.'\n There was evidence in substantial volume bearing upon the issue of the reasonableness of the existing interstate rates from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts to the destination territory involved. \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n Much evidence was adduced as to rates approved by th commission in other proceedings for approximately similar hauls, under similar transportation conditions. The Wheeling & Lake Erie introduced a cost study, and the state and other parties produced evidence as to coal rates in Illinois, fixed by the commission, and a comparison of the conditions in that territory and those found in Ohio, all for the purpose of demonstrating that the reduced Ohio rates were maximum reasonable rates. There was evidence in opposition to this contention. The testimony showed that coal had moved freely from all producing areas, intrastate and interstate, under the old rates, and tended to prove that the unbalancement of the relation between the state and interstate rates had retarded and prohibited the shipment of a large quantity of coal from the other states to Northeastern Ohio. The commission in its report discusses this evidence in detail, and, based upon it, makes findings to the effect that the interstate rates from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts are reasonable; the system of differentials between the nearer state origins and the more remote interstate origins is proper, distance and other conditions considered; the reduced state rates are unduly preferential of persons and localities in Ohio and unduly prejudicial to persons and localities in the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts; and in order to remove the undue discrimination between persons and localities the intrastate rates should be increased to the former level, and the pre-existing inter-relationship re-established.\n\n 1. \nThe assertion that appellants were denied a fair hearing rests not upon any refusal to receive evidence tendered, but upon the commission's alleged misconception of the rules as to burden of proof. It is said that from the outset the commission acted upon a presumption that the reduced Ohio rates were unlawful and cast \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n on the appellants the burden of overcoming it by a preponderance of proof impossible of production. This complaint is founded upon a portion of the opening sentence of the report and two sentences near its close and by an analysis of the remainder of the report intended to show that the commission gave too little weight to appellants' evidence and too much to that in opposition. On examination of the record, the report, and the findings, we are satisfied there is no adequate foundation for the contention. The excerpts from the report which are cited, when read in their context, indicate only that the commission intended fairly to inquire with respect to the lawfulness of the attacked rates and, after evaluating all the proofs on both sides, concluded that the preponderance was heavily against the appellants. The hearing was fair.\n\n 2. \nUntenable, also, is the position that there was no sufficient evidence to support the finding of preference and prejudice. We agree with the District Court that the proof of discrimination against interstate shippers and localities was convincing. Upon the issue whether the preference and prejudice was undue, that is, whether the interstate rates were reasonable, whether the attacked intrastate rates were reasonabe maxima, and what the proper relationship between the two scales shold be, a large amount of evidence was taken and considered in detail. There was ample support for each of the findings. In effect, we are asked to re- examine the evidence, appraise it, and hold the commission erred in its judgment as to the facts. We have often said that we have no such power.\n\n 3. \nThe claim is that the commission exceeded its authority in requiring state rates to be raised without having found or made reasonable all substantially competitive interstate rates. This contention requires the statement of certain matters in addition to those above recited. As we have seen, the coal which reaches North- \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n eastern Ohio comes from mines within and without the state. Those within Ohio are grouped in eight origin districts lying in the eastern and sou hern portions of the state. Those without Ohio lie in two rough arcs known as the inner and outer crescents. The inner includes the Pittsburgh district in Western Pennsylvania contiguous to the Ohio river, the Connellsville immediately to the south, the Fairmont to the south of that, and eleven others to the southwestward through Northern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee. The outer crescent is composed of districts extending in a wider are eastward and southward of the inner crescent from the Altoona in Pennsylvania at the northeastern extremity to the Rathburn in Southern Tennessee at the southwestern extremity. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The mines in each district enjoy the same rate to a single destination, but the rates from the more remote districts are higher than those from the Ohio districts and from the more northerly districts in the inner crescent. In the proceedings before the commission the only attack upon the reasonableness of interstate rates was leveled at those from the Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont regions. The complainants did not plead or offer proof that the rates from the more southerly districts in the inner crescent, or from those in the outer crescent, were unreasonably high. Nor did the appellants, who were respondents before the commission, assert or attempt to prove that they were too low. These rates were put in evidence by the appellants, but only for the purpose of showing, by comparison of the ton-mile earnings under them, that the reduced Ohio rates were reasonable maxima. \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 508]\n\u00a0\n The argument is that by confining its investigation of the reasonableness of the interstate rates to those from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont origins and neglecting to investigate the reasonableness of those from the inner and outer crescents generally, the commission exposed intrastate commerce to unjust discrimination in relation to competitive interstate commerce originating in the inner and outer crescents. Support for the argument is drawn from the assertion first, that the existing interstate rates from the crescents are lower than those from the Ohio mines, and, secondly, that the entire crescent adjustment has always been made and regulated so as to represent a reasonable average level, and therefore any consideration of the Ohio rates should rest upon a comparison of the average reasonableness of the entire interstate adjustment.\n The appellants fail to call attention to anything in the record which supports either of these statements, and we have been unable to find anything of the sort. The fact is that the rates from the southern inner and from the outer crescent territory are much higher than those from Ohio mines, and considerably in excess of those from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts. It is undoubtedly true that the former show lower earnings per ton-mile than the latter. This, however, is in entire accord with the theory of rate making, namely, that the longer haul may be expected to yield a lower ton-mile return. But entirely apart from this, the record not only does not disclose that the entire adjustment of interstate rates from the Appalachian district is upon an average basis, but shows the contrary. Coal moves from Ohio origins and from both the crescents to destinations in territory other than the destination area here involved. Rates upon these movements have been the subject of repeated investigations by the commission. Examination of the record and of the various proceedings with \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 509]\n\u00a0\n respect to these interstate rate adjustments discloses that there are four major adjustments on northwestward-bound coal from Ohio and the crescents. One is the lake cargo go adjustment, applicable on coal moving to lower Lake Erie ports for transshipment by water. The rate from any origin district is the same to all ports to hich rates are published, but there are differentials in favor of Ohio origins and against inner and outer crescent districts. \n3\n A second embraces rates to Northwestern Ohio, Northeastern Indiana, and the southern peninsula of Michigan. The third is to territory west of that just mentioned, in which Chicago is a typical destination point. To the destination territory covered by the last- mentioned areas the adjustments are similar, though the differentials from various points of origin are not the same. Five of the Ohio districts-No. 8, Cambridge, Hocking, Pomeroy, and Jackson-have the same rate to any given destination; the other Ohio districts take differentials under the rates from the former. All inner crescent districts have the same rate to a given destination. It is 50 cents over the Hocking rate to a destination in the first mentioned territory, and 35 cents over the Hocking rate to Chicago. The outer crescent has differentially higher rates than those applicable to the inner. The base rate for these two adjustments is the rate from Hocking to Toledo.4\n The fourth adjustment is that to Northeastern Ohio. It differs from the three previously mentioned. On shipments from Crooksville, Pomeroy, and Hocking in Ohio, and from Kanawha and other southern inner crescent districts, Northeastern Ohio prior to August 1, 1932, was included in the Toledo group, Cleveland taking the same rate as Toledo from those Ohio districts, and a rate 50 cents \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 510]\n\u00a0\n higher from the named inner crescent districts. On the other hand, from Middle, Massillon, No. 8, and Cambridge in Ohio, and from Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont in the northern part of the inner crescent, the adjustment was quite distinct. The base for these rates was not the Hocking-Toledo rate, but the Pittsburgh-Youngtown or Pittsburgh- Cleveland rate. The rate from Ohio district No. 8 to Cleveland was 10 cents under the Pittsburgh-Cleveland rate. The rate from Connellsville is 9 cents, and from Fairmont 15 cents, over the Pittsburgh-Cleveland rate. The more southerly Ohio districts have always had a rate differentially higher than No. 8. Thus it appears that the adjustment from the crescent districts has not been, as appellant asserts, based on an average principle or average rates of all origin territory shipping coal to Northeastern Ohio.\n The appellant's argument, then, comes to this: That if a commodity is shipped in large quantities in interstate commerce from certain districts without Ohio to a destination in that state, and if it happens that the commodity also reaches the same destination from wholly different regions whose rates have been built upon a different key rate, the commission cannot abate a discrimination between the first-named group of rates, found to be reasonable, and the intrastate rates, without first finding that the rate from every other region to the same destination in Ohio is reasonable. To state the proposition is to answer it. The commission has found the interstate rates from the Freeport, Pittsburgh, Connellsville, and Fairmont districts to Northeastern Ohio destinations are reasonable. It cannot remove a preference and prejudice due to the reduction of the Ohio intrastate rate, so the argument runs, unless it finds also that the rate from a district in Eastern Tennessee, close to the Alabama border, to the same destination, is also reasonable. Where rates are uniform from a group of origins to a given destination, it \n\n[292 U.S. 498, 511]\n\u00a0\n is necessary for the commission to find that the rates from the group as a whole are reasonable, before it can raise the intrastste rates. Compare Georgia Public Service Comm. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765\n, 51 S.Ct. 619; State Corporation Commission v. Aberdeen & R.R.R. Co., 136 I.C.C. 173. But it by no means follows that that body, before it can remove discriminat on against the district of origin whose rates are under consideration, must find or make reasonable rates adjusted to a different base rate and applying from districts lying in comparatively distant areas.\n The commission has found that the interstate rates from four districts of origin are reasonable. It has found that Ohio intrastate rates, the transportation conditions being similar, are, distance considered, out of relation to these interstate rates, so as to create undue preference and prejudice. These findings, supported by evidence, fully justified the order with respect to the intrastate rates under section 13 of the Act (49 USCA  13). Compare Louisiana Commission v. Texas & N.O.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 125\n, 52 S.Ct. 74. \n No. 868\n, judgment affirmed.\n No. 886, appeal dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.C. 49, c. 1,  13(3, 4), 49 USCA  13(3, 4). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A map showing the area and location of the Ohio districts and most of those in the inner and outer crescents will be found in 46 I.C.C. opposite page 158. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Lake Cargo Coal Cases, 1930, 181 I.C.C. 37. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Bituminous Coal to C.F.A.

A. R. Stout and James V. Allred, both of Austin, Tex., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Harold M. Stephens, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Samuel W. Moore, of New York City, for appellees Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. and Texarkana & F.S. Ry. Co. \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, by its report and order of October 4, 1933, authorized the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Missouri, to acquire control by lease of the railroad and properties of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company, incorporated under the laws of Texas. 193 I.C.C. 521. In this suit, the state of Texas, and officers and municipalities of that state, assailed the order as transcending the authority granted to the Commission by the Congress. The order was sustained by the District Court (6 F.Supp. 63), three judges sitting as required by statute (28 USCA  47), and from its decree this appeal is taken.\n The single point in controversy is with respect to the authority of the Commission to approve the acquisition of control by a lease which permits the lessee to abandon, or to remove from the state, the general offices, shops, etc., of the lessor. The provision of section 5 of the lease, which has that effect, is set forth in the margin. \n1\n The provi- \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n sion is attacked as being in violation of the laws of Texas, which confine to Texas corporations the right to 'own or maintain any railways' within the state, which require every railroad company chartered by the state to 'keep and maintain permanently its general offices within this State at the place named in its charter,' and at that place also to maintain the offices of its principal officers, and which prohibit any railroad company from changing 'the location of its general offices, machine shops, or roundhouses, save with the consent and approval of the Railroad Commission' of the State. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n The Interstate Commerce Commission was divided in opinion. Upon a prior hearing, the Commission approved the lease upon the condition that the paragraph in controversy should be eliminated. Report and order of December 27, 1932; 189 I.C.C. 253. Following the enactment of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933 (Act of June 16, 1933, c. 91), the proceeding was reopened, and, after hearing, the Commission modified its order by striking out the above-mentioned condition, thus approving and authorizing the lease with its provision, in section 5, as to offices and shops.\n The findings of fact set forth in the Commission's report are not contested. The lines which constitute what is called the Kansas City Southern Railway system (embracing the portions covered by the proposed lease) extend from Kansas City, Mo., to Port Arthur, Tex. (over 800 miles). The line of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, the applicant, extends from Kansas City, Mo., to Mena, Ark. The line of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company is in two segments. The northern segment extends from Mena in a southerly direction, crosses the Arkansas-Texas state line, and runs through Texarkana and thence southeasterly into Arkansas and to the Arkansas-Louisiana state line. \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n The portions of this segment in Arkansas are operated by the applicant under a lease previously authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 105 I.C.C. 523. The portion of the northern segment which lies in the state of Texas is approximately 31 miles in length. The southern segment of the Texarkana & For Smith Railway extends from the Louisiana-Texas state line at the Sabine river to Port Arthur, Tex., and is approximately 50 miles in length. Thus the total main line mileage of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway in Texas is 81 miles; there are about 18 miles of branch lines. The portion of the railroad system lying between the Arkansas-Louisiana state line and the Louisiana-Texas statel line, approximately 228 miles, is owned by the Kansas City, Shreveport & Gulf Railroad Company, a subsidiary of the applicant.\n The Commission, on the first hearing, found that the consummation of the plan presented by the applicant would result in an annual saving, under normal conditions, of about $81,000. This finding was repeated in the final report. The estimated saving would result from the unification of operations, the discontinuance of general offices of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company at Texarkana, and the removal to Shreveport and Kansas City of many of the activities at Texarkana which caused duplication of work. Thus, under the proposed plan, the auditor's and treasurer's departments of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company would be transferred to the applicant's headquarters at Kansas City, with an estimated annual saving of over $57,000. The offices of the general freight agent, general passenger agent, superintendent, and division engineer, and of the master mechanic at Port Arthur, would be removed to Shreveport and consolidated with similar offices of the applicant, at an estimated annual saving of over $21,000. There would also be a decrease in expenses for various services in connection with the building at Texarkana. \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n Shreveport, said the Commission, is considered to be more centrally located from an operating standpoint than Texarkana, and there are at that point the applicant's main terminal for the southern territory, shops for heavy repairs, more industry, greater population, and more railroad connections.\n The Commission found that for the four years, 1928-1931, the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company handled an average of 993,622 tons of intrastate traffic and 3,405,944 tons of interstate traffic. Of the average total of 4,399,566 tons, the applicant participated in the handling of 3,192,554 tons. The net income of the Taxarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company amounted to $441,922 in 1926, $204,052 in 1927, $437,270 in 1928, $598,172 in 1929, and $95,655 in 1930. In 1931 there appears to have been no net income. The Commission concluded that 'in view of the volume of interstate traffic handled by the T. & F.S. and the net income earned by that carrier, it is clear that the expenditure of approximately $ 81,000 a year, which will be unnecessary under the plan that the applicant proposes to put into effect under the lease, constitutes an undue burden upon interstate commerce.'\n The Commission further found 'that the lease by the Kansas City Southern Railway Company of the railroad and properties of the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company, located in Texas and elsewhere not now under lease, in accordance with the proposed lease, will be in harmony with and in furtherance of the plan for the consolidation of railroad properties heretofore established by us and will promote the public interest.'\n The state of Texas raises no question as to the constitutional power of the Congress to confer authority upon the Commission to approve the proposed lease with the stipulations under consideration. The question is simply as to the scope of the authority which has been con- \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n ferred-the construction of the applicable statutory provisions. These are found in section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933 (title 2,  201, 202 (49 USCA  5)). Paragraphs (4)(a) and (4)(b) of that section make it lawful, with the approval and authorization of the Commission, for two or more carriers to consolidate or merge their properties, 'or for any carrier ... to purchase, lease, or contract to operate the properties, or any part thereof, of another,' or to acquire control of another through purchase of its stock. On application to the Commission for such approval, appropriate notice of public hearing must be given to the Governor of each state in which any part of the properties of the carriers involved in situated, as well as to the carriers themselves. If, after hearing, 'the Commission finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the proposed consolidation, merger, purchase, lease, operating contract, or acquisition of control will be in harmony with and in furtherance of the plan for the consolidation of railway properties established pursuant to paragraph (3), and will promote the public interest,' the Commission may give its approval and authorization accordingly. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[292 U.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n These broadening provisions of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933 confirm and carry forward the purpose which led to the enactment of Transportation Act 1920 (Title 4, 41 Stat. 474 et seq. (49 USCA  1 et seq.)). We found that Transportation Act 1920 introduced into the federal legislation a new railroad policy, seeking to insure an adequate transportation service. To attain that end, new rights, new obligations, new machinery, were created. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 190 S., 43 S. Ct. 270; Dayton-Goose Creek Railway Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472. It is a primary aim of that policy to secure the avoidance of waste. That avoidance, as well as the maintenance of service, is viewed as a direct concern of the public. Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312, 317\n, 43 S.Ct. 556; Texas & Paci ic Railway Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263. The authority given to the Commission to authorize consolidations, purchases, \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 531]\n\u00a0\n leases, operating contracts, and acquisition of control, was given in aid of that policy. New York Central Securities Corporation v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45, 48. The criterion to be applied by the Commission in the exercise of its authority to approve such transactions-a criterion reaffirmed by the amendments of Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933-is that of the controlling public interest. And that term as used in the statute is not a mere general reference to public welfare, but, as shown by the context and purpose of the act, 'has direct relation to adequacy of transportation service, to its essential conditions of economy and efficiency, and to appropriate provision and best use of transportation facilities.' New York Central Securities Corporation v. United States, supra.\n It is in the light of this criterion that we must consider the scope of the Commission's authority in relation to provisions which are intended to relieve interstate carriers from burdensome outlays. The fact that burdensome expenditures may be required by state regulations is not a barrier to their removal by dominant federal authority in the protection of interstate commerce. As we said in Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 163\n, 46 S.Ct. 452, 454: 'Prejudice to interstate commerce may be effected in many ways. One way is by excessive expenditures from the common fund in the local interest, thereby lessening the ability of the carrier properly to serve interstate commerce.' Even explicit charter provisions must yield to the paramount regulatory power of the Congress. New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 42 S.Ct. 239. Obligations assumed by the corporation under its charter of providing intrastate service are subordinate to the performance by it of its federal duty, also assumed, 'efficiently to render transportation services in interstate commerce.' Colorado v. United States, supra, page 165 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 452, 455. See Transit Commission v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 360, 367\n, 368 S., 52 S.Ct. 157; Transit Commission v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 121, 127\n, 53 S.Ct. 536; State of Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 78 L.Ed . --, decided April 2, 1934. \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 532]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, the findings of the Commission, setting forth undisputed facts, leave no doubt that the provision of the lease permitting the abandonment, or removal from the state, of general offices and shops of the lessor, has direct relation to economy and efficiency in interstate operations and to the achievement of the purpose which the Congress had in view in its grant of authority.\n Counsel for the United States and for the Interstate Commerce Commission emphasize the limitations of the challenged provision. They point out that, in addition to the customary 'general offices' of railroads, section 3 of article 10, of the Constitution of Texas provides that railroad corporations must 'maintain a public office or place in this State for the transaction of its business, where transfers of stock shall be made and where shall be kept for inspection by the stockholders of such corporations, books,' in which shall be recorded the amount of capital stock subscribed, the names of stockholders, etc., and transfers, the amount of its assets and liabilities, and the names and places of residence of its officers. See, also, article 4115, Texas Revised Statutes 1879; Laws of Texas 1885, c. 68; articles 1358, 6281, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1925. Counsel for the United States and for the Interstate Commerce Commission urge that the 'Office-Shops Act,' here involved, was enacted independently of the above statutes. Laws of Texas 1889, c. 106; article 6275, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1925. Accordingly, they in ist that the order of the Commission and the lease in question apply to the 'general offices,' shops, etc., and not to the 'public office' of the domestic corporation. Counsel for the applicant, the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, submits that the lease by necessary implication requires the Texarkana & Fort Smith Railway Company to maintain its principal office \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 533]\n\u00a0\n in Texas as the Texas statute requires. See, as to service of process, article 2029, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1925. In view of the disclaimer on behalf of the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the interpretation placed upon the provision in the lease, we assume that the question before us merely relates to the abandonment or removal of 'general offices,' shops, etc., as distinguished from the 'public office' required by the Texas statutes; that is, to those transportation facilities the continued maintenance of which, in the circumstances described by the findings of the Commission, would entail unnecessary and burdensome expenditures in operation. As thus construed, we find no ground for concluding that the approval of the provision in the lease was beyond the Commission's authority. There is no interference with the supervision of the state over the lessor in matters essentially of state concern, as distinguished from the operations which in their effect upon interstate commerce are of national concern.\n The state invokes section 11 of title 1 of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933 (49 USCA  261), which provides that 'Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any carrier from any contractual obligation which it may have assumed, prior to the enactment of this Act (June 16, 1933), with regard to the location or maintenance of offices, shops, or roundhouses at any point.' But that section refers explicitly to what is contained in title 1 of the act, with respect to 'emergency powers,' dealing with the authority of the Federal Coordinator of Transportation and kindred matters, and does not by its terms apply to the provisions of title 2 of the Act, in which are found the amendments of section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to the approval and authorization by the Interstate Commerce Commission of consolidations, purchases, and leases. And section 11 of title 1 relates to 'contractual obligations' assumed by the carrier and does not aptly refer to obli- \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 534]\n\u00a0\n gations imposed by statute. \n4\n The insertion of the provision in title 1, with its restricted application, and the omission of a similar provision from title 2, indicate an intentional distinction.\n Title 2 of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act 1933, in amending section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, carries its own provision as to immunity from state requirements which would stand in the way of the execution of the policy of the Congress through the Commission's orders. Subdivision (15) of section 5 as amended (49 USCA  5( 15) reads:5\n'The carriers and any corporation affected by any order made under the foregoing provisions of this section shall be, and they are hereby, relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws as designated in section 1 of the Act entitled 'An Act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes,' approved October 15, 1914, and of all other restraints or prohibitions by or imposed under authority of law, State or Federal, insofar as may be necessary to enable them to do anything authorized or required by such order.'\n\n The view that, by reference to the context, this immunity should be regarded as limited to those 'restraints or prohibitions by or imposed under authority of law' which fall within the general description of 'antitrust' legislation is too narrow. The rule of 'ejusdem generis' is applied as an aid in ascertainin the intention of the Legislature, not to subvert it when ascertained. Mid-Northern Oil Company v. Walker, \n268 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 45 S.Ct. 440. The scope of the immunity must be measured by the purpose which Congress had in view and had constitutional power to accomplish. As that purpose involved the promotion of economy and efficiency in interstate transportation by the \n\n[292 U.S. 522, 535]\n\u00a0\n removal of the burdens of excessive expenditure, the removal of such burdens when imposed by state requirements was an essential part of the plan. The state urges that, in the course of the passage of Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456), a provision for federal incorporation of railroads was struck out. But, while railroad corporations were left under state charters, they were still instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and, as such, were subjected to the paramount federal obligation to render the efficient and economical service required in the maintenance of an adequate system of interstate transportation. Colorado v. United States, supra.\n The decision in International & Great Northern Railway Co. v. Anderson County, \n246 \nU.S. 424\n, 38 S.Ct. 370, is not opposed. Apart from the fact that in that case the state court had found, upon the verdict of a jury, that the maintenance of the offices and shops at the place at which the predecessor of the plaintiff in error had contracted to maintain them, did not impose a burden upon interstate commerce-a finding which this Court found no reason to disturb (Id., pages 433, 434 of 246 U. S., 38 S.Ct. 370, 373)-the case arose prior to the enactment of Transportation Act 1920, and the question here presented was not involved.\n The decree dismissing the bill of complaint is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'But the Southern Company (applicant) does not assume the performance of any corporate obligations on the part of the Texarkana Company independent of its obligations as a common carrier. The Southern Company does not assume any obligation to maintain, during the term of this lease, any general offices, machine shops or roundhouses for or belonging to the Texarkana Company at any particular place or places, regardless of present or previous locations thereof; but shall have the right to change any existing location of general offices, machine shops, roundhouses and terminal facilities, belonging to the Texarkana Company, and to relocate the same, and, from time to time, to change the same, during the full term of this lease, and shall have the right to make all such locations, changes and alterations as in the judgment of the Southern Company will enable it to operate the demised premises in the public interest and with the greatest economy and efficiency; and the Southern Company shall not be obligated or bound to perform any contractual, statutory or other obligations with refer nce to such matters which may now or hereafter rest upon the Texarkana Company; and any and all such changes may be made, from time to time, by the Southern Company as may be approved by the judgment of its officers or Board of Directors.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These provisions of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1925 are as follows:\n Art. 6260.

RY. CO. v. POTTORFF(1934)\nNo. 128\nArgued: December 7, 1933Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. E. Clinton and T. D. Gresham, both of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thornton Hardie, of El Paso, Tex., and Henry E. Hackney, of Uniontown, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The main question for decision is whether a national bank has power to pledge a part of its assets to secure a private deposit.\n The First National Bank of El Paso, Tex., failed on September 4, 1931, and S. O. Pottorff was appointed receiver. The Texas & Pacific Railway Company was then, and long had been, a depositor. To secure it as such the bank had, in January, 1931, pledged $50,000 Liberty bonds and held them for the railway in the trust department of the bank. The balance in the railway's regular checking account at the time of the failure was $54,646. 94. Of this claim it made proof as a secured creditor. The receiver approved the amount of the claim, but denied the validity of the pledge; and he tendered a dividend check only for the amount to which the railway would have been entitled as an unsecured creditor. Thereupon, the railway brought, in the federal court for western Texas, this suit against the receiver, praying, in the alternative, that the bonds be delivered to it; or that they be sold for its benefit; or that the claim be paid in full with interest. The receiver filed a cross-bill praying that the bank's title to the bonds be quieted.\n The case was first heard upon motions to dismiss the bill and the cross-bill. The decision on the motions was postponed until after hearing the case upon the evidence. Thereupon the court dismissed the bill and en- \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n tered a decree for the receiver upon the cross-bill, holding that the pledge was void and that the Liberty bonds constituted assets to be administered for the benefit of the general creditors of the bank. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 63 F.(2d) 1. This Court granted certiorari. \n290 \nU.S. 609\n, 54 S.Ct. 55, 78 L.Ed. --. The railway contends that the bank had power to make the pledge; that even if the bank did not have such power, the receiver is not in a position to question the validity of the pledge; and that even if he is not estopped from doing so, he may not disaffirm it without returning the consideration therefor received by the bank. We are of opinion that none of these contentions is sound.\n The District Court found the following additional facts: The relation between the railway and the bank began in 1922 when the railway was in receivership. Then, an order was entered appointing the bank a depositary upon condition that it should furnish a bond with solvent sureties. An acceptable bond was then given in the sum of $25,000. When, in 1924, the receivership terminated, the railway continued its deposit account; and a bond in like amount was given with the National Surety Company as surety. When, in 1927, the average deposits had increased to about $50,000, an additional bond of $25,000 was given with the Maryland Casualty Company as surety. While these bonds were in full force and effect and the bank was solvent, it requested the railway to accept, in substitution for the surety bonds, the pledge of the $50,000 Liberty bonds, giving as its reason for the request that the premiums payable on the surety bonds were a burden from which it wished to be relieved. The railway expressed willingness to assent to the substitution, but only on condition that thereby it would be as fully protected as by the surety bonds. The bank and its attorney gave this assurance; and thereupon the pledge was substituted \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n for the surety bonds and these were canceled. Without that assurance, the railway would not have consented to the cancellation of the surety bonds; or if they had been canceled without its consent, would have immediately withdrawn all of its deposits. In reliance upon the assurances and the pledge, the railway continued until the failure to make deposits; and in fact increased its deposits.\n National bank examiners commenced on August 6, 1931, an examination of the bank. Within a few days, they learned from the bank's books that the pledge had been made; but neither the examiners nor the comptroller of the currency advised the bank's officers that the pledge was beyond the powers of the bank or that it was irregular or otherwise objectionable. The bank had frequently secured private deposits by surety bonds; but never before by a pledge of assets. The examiners concluded their investigation on August 20, 1931. The failure occurred on September 4, 1931\n\n\n First. National banks lack power to pledge their assets to secure a private deposit. The measure of their powers is the statutory grant; and powers not conferred by Congress are denied. \n1\n For the act2 under which national banks are organized constitutes a complete system for their government. Cook County National Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 2 S.Ct. 561; California Bank v. Kennedy, \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n \n167 \nU.S. 362, 366\n, 17 S.Ct. 831; First National Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, \n263 \nU.S. 640\n, 44 S.Ct. 213. Confessedly the power to pledge assets to secure a private deposit was not granted in specific terms. The contention is that this power is incidental to the general grant of powers 'necessary to carry on the business of banking ... by receiving deposits'; and, hence, is implied. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n There is no basis for the claim that the power to pledge assets is necessary to deposit banking. The record is barren of evidence that the practice of so pledging assets has ever prevailed among national banks. And facts of which we take judicial notice indicate that among national banks such action must have been deemed contrary to good banking practice. 4 From the establishment of the system in 1864 to March 1, 1933, 2,159 national banks failed5 and there has been much litigation arising from their insolvency; but only two other reported cases have been found involving a pledge of assets to secure a private deposit, and in those cases, very recent ones, the existence of the power was denied. \n6\n Smith v. Baltimore & O.R. \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 255]\n\u00a0\n Co. (D.C.) 48 F.(2d) 861; Id. (C.C.A.) 56 F.(2d) 799; Illinois Central R. Co. v. Rawlings (C.C.A.) 66 F.(2d) 146. In the case at bar, there is a specific finding that the transaction challenged was the only instance in which this bank had ever pledged assets to secure a private deposit. Surely action cannot be deemed a necessary incident of a business when only a single instance has been found in which it was taken. Moreover, even a practice commonly pursued may not be a necessary one. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n To permit the pledge would be inconsistent with many provisions of the National Bank Act which are designed to ensure, in case of disaster, uniformity in the treatment of depositors and a ratable distribution of assets. Compare Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 290\n, 16 S.Ct. 502. This policy of equal treatment was held to preclude, in case of a national bank, even the preference under section 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 USCA  191), which otherwise is accorded to the United States when its debtor becomes insolvent. Cook County National Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445\n, 2 S.Ct. 561. The effect of a pledge is to withdraw for the benefit of one depositor part of the fund to which all look for protection. Thereby the legitimate expectations of a great body of the depositors are defeated and confidence in the fairness of the national banking laws and administration is impaired. It is no answer to say that the other depositors are benefited by the increased resources which the pledge brings to the bank, or at least are not harmed, since the new funds take the place of the securities pledged and are available to meet \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 256]\n\u00a0\n liabilities. \n8\n The immediate safety of unsecured creditors depends on the bank remaining open and solvent; the pledge reduces the fund of quick assets available to meet unusual demands without any assurance that the deposit will be used to replenish this fund.\n The fact that this bank had frequently secured private deposits by surety bonds lends no support to the contention that the power to pledge assets is necessary to carrying on the business of deposit banking. Such a practice would likewise be a departure from the policy of equal treatment of depositors; but the loss to other depositors resulting from such action would be far less serious. A pledge withdraws capital assets, while the giving of a surety bond merely increases the bank's expenses. There is, however, no finding that among national banks \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n there exists the practice of securing by surety bonds some private deposits. If there has been such a practice, it must have been a secret one; for reference to it has not been found in either official reports, or the books on banking or other publications dealing with financial affairs. 9 Whether a national bank could legally engage in such a practice we have no occasion to decide. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The railway insists that Congress in providing that the Secretary of the Treasury might deposit public money in national banks upon receiving satisfactory security by 'the deposit of United States bonds or otherwise,' Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106,  45, 13 Stat. 113,11 assumed a gen- \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n eral power in national banks to pledge their assets to secure deposits; and that the assumption indicates that it intended this power to be among the 'incidental' powers granted by section 8. But without such assumption, the duty of the Secretary to demand a pledge authorizes a national bank to make it. \n12\n We may not import into section 8 a meaning not derivable from the words of that section and inconsistent with other provisions of the act. Moreover, if the railway's argument were sound it would have been unnecessary to amend section 45 as was done by the Act of June 25, 1930, c. 604, 46 Stat. 809 (12 USCA  90), which provides:\n'Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof, give security for the safe- keeping and prompt payment of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State.'\n\n This amendment indicates that Congress believed that the original act had not granted general power to pledge assets to secure deposits. \n13\n The fact that the amendment was made to section 45 indicates that the power to pledge was granted only as an incident of the public officer's duty to demand a pledge. If, as is sug- \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 259]\n\u00a0\n gested, the 1930 amendment was passed merely in order to settle doubts as to the power of a national bank to pledge its assets to secure deposits, the amendment would naturally have been made not to section 45, but to section 8 which contains the grant of 'incidental' powers.\n The railway urges also that since the relation of the bank to its depositors is that of debtor to creditor, and since a national bank may borrow money, Aldrich v. Chemical National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 618\n, 20 S.Ct. 498, Auten v. United States Nat. Bank, \n174 \nU.S. 125\n, 19 S.Ct. 628, and pledge its assets therefor, Wyman v. Wallace, \n201 \nU.S. 230\n, 26 S.Ct. 495, it may likewise pledge assets to secure a private deposit. The fallacy of this contention has been many times exposed. \n14\n The difference between deposits and loans is fundamental and far-reaching. The amount of the deposits is commonly accepted as a measure of the bank's success; an increase of deposits as evidence of increased prosperity. The depositor does not think of himself as lending money to the bank. The modern deposit grew out of the older form of deposit in which the fund was held separate and intact, and the sole purpose of the deposit was safe-keeping. Safe-keeping is still a very important function of deposit banking; and from the point of view of most depositors the chief one. \n15\n Borrowing by a bank (as distinguished from a rediscount) is commonly regarded as evidence ofweakness. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[291 U.S. 245, 260]\n\u00a0\n Often the loan is made in the hope of averting insolvency. Loans made by one bank to another commonly involve a pledge of assets, since only upon such a condition is the transaction possible. Wyman v. Wallace, supra.\n Second. The receiver is not estopped to deny the validity of the pledge. The railway's argument is that the bank could not set up the defence of ultra vires since it had the benefit of the transaction; and that the receiver, as its representative, can have no greater right. Neither branch of the argument is well founded. The bank itself could have set aside this transaction. It is the settled doctrine of this court that no rights arise on an ultra vires contract, even though the contract has been performed; and that this conclusion cannot be circumvented by erecting an estoppel which would prevent challenging the legality of a power exercised. California Nat. Bank v. Kennedy, \n167 \nU.S. 362\n, 17 S.Ct. 831; McCormick v. Market Nat. Bank, \n165 \nU.S. 538\n, 17 S.Ct. 433; Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman's Palace-Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 24\n, 11 S.Ct. 478.17 But even if the bank would have been estopped from asserting lack of power, its receiver would be free to challenge the validity of the pledge. The unau- \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 261]\n\u00a0\n thorized pledge reduced the assets available to the general creditors. It is the duty of the receiver of an insolvent corporation to take steps to set aside transactions which fraudulently or illegally reduce the assets available for the general creditors, even though the corporation itself was not in a position to do so. 18\n Third. The receiver may assert the invalidity of the pledge without making restitution by paying the pledgee's claim in full. The railway's argument to the contrary is that when as a result of an ultra vires contract one of the parties is enriched at the expense of the other, the law creates an obligation to repay ex aequo et bono to the extent of the enrichment. The argument if applicable would not help the railway. Such claim under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is assimilated to an obligation of contract; and does not, in the absence of an identifiable res19 and a constructive trust based on special circum- \n\n[291 U.S. 245, 262]\n\u00a0\n stances of misconduct, confer a preference over other creditors. The pledge here challenged having failed because illegal, the railway is entitled only to a dividend as a general creditor. \n20\n Its right thereto is conceded.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] First National Bank v.

Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 44 S.Ct. 296, 31 A.L.R. 1261. A practice is not within the incidental powers of a corporation merely because it is convenient in the performance of an express power. Merrill v. Monticello, \n138 \nU.S. 673, 692\n, 11 S.Ct. 441; compare Beaty v. Knowler, 4 Pet. 152, 168-171.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] These arguments seem to ignore the realities of the banking business. The primary interest of a depositor is that the bank shall be able to pay as and when he demands payment. The ability to do so depends not on the bulk of the assets but on their liquidity. The law applicable to national banks requires them to maintain as reserves in the form of cash or of cash balances with a federal reserve bank, fixed percentages of their demand deposits in order to assure ability to meet probable demands as they arise; but such reserve is commonly deemed insufficient to meet possible emergencies. Because of this, soundly managed banks maintain so- called 'secondary reserves,' usually in the form of government obligations which can be liquidated quickly with little or no loss. The effect of pledging quick assets for particular deposits is to reduce the fund available for meeting current demands of an unexpected nature. The funds received from the deposit are not necessarily an equivalent for the securities withdrawn from available resources. In the first place the deposit, in the process of clearing and collection, may serve merely to cancel liabilities against the bank. This may mean that there will be fewer competing claims in case of insolvency, but it will still be true that the reserves have been depleted considerably beyond what would be justified by reason of the cancellation of the liability. In the second place, to the extent that the deposit represents free funds, it is not probable that the deposit will be used to buy other low yield quick assets to take the place of those which have been pledged.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See note 4. However, compare Lunt, Surety Bonds (1930), 206. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Nebraska v. First National Bank of Orleans (C.C.) 88 F. 947, and Interstate National Bank v. Ferguson, 48 Kan. 732, 30 P. 237, held in the case of a deposit of public funds that the practice was legal. Two Attorneys General have expressed the opinion that national banks lacked the power to pay for guaranteeing all depositors. 27 Op.Atty.Gen. 37, 40; 27 Op.Atty.Gen. 272, 279. But see 30 Op.Atty.Gen. 341, contra. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] The original national bank act of 1864 had provided merely that the Secretary of the Treasury might deposit public moneys in national banks. By legislation subsequent to 1864, national banks have been made depositaries of moneys of bankrupt estates, Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,  61, 30 Stat. 562 (11 USCA  101); of Indian moneys, Act March 3, 1911, c. 210,  17, 36 Stat. 1070 (25 USCA  156); Act May 25, 1918, c. 86,  28, 40 Stat. 591 (25 USCA  162); of funds in the hands of the receivers of insolvent national banks, Act May 15, 1916, c. 121, 39 Stat. 121 (12 USCA  192); of postal funds, Act May 18, 1916, c. 126,  2, 39 Stat. 159 (39 USCA  759); of proceeds from the sale of bonds, Act Sept. 24, 1917, c. 56 ,  8, 40 Stat. 291, amended by Act April 4, 1918, c. 44,  5, 40 Stat. 504 (31 USCA  771); Act July 9, 1918, c. 142,  4, 40 Stat. 845 (31 USCA  772); and of a number of other public funds. In all of these statutes the depositor is required to take security; but therein likewise nothing is said as to the power of the bank to pledge the required securities. Two of these statutes, those relating to deposits of the funds of insolvent banks and of bankrupt estates, have reference to the deposit of private funds. In some of the legislation, not only national, but state, banks also are made depositaries. It is true that Congress cannot make valid a pledge by a state bank, but that does not make it any the less likely that Congress intended to make valid every pledge by a national bank that would be called for under the statute. It would be the duty of a public officer depositing in a state bank to make sure that it had the power to give the security required by Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Where a statute specifically forbids a preferential pledge, it has been held that a public officer's duty to demand a pledge impliedly gives power to pledge in that specific case.

Board of Com'rs, 128 Okl. 58, 260 P. 1112; 31 Op.Attys.Gen. 41. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Senator Thomas, in introducing the bill, stated in the Senate: 'It is a bill simply to confer on a national bank the same opportunity for the giving of security for the safe-keeping and prompt payment of state and county moneys, as is authorized with reference to state banking institutions.' 72 Cong.R. 6243.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Farmers' & Merchants' State Bank v.

It is made a crime to accept a deposit with knowledge of insolvency. Only when the bank's condition measures up to the prescribed standards of safety and liquidity may deposits be received.\n Though large deposits frequently represent loans by the bank to the depositor, this is less likely to be true of small accounts. Out of 30,556, 105 accounts reported by 5,500 licensed member banks of the Federal Reserve System, 29,482,384 were under $2,500 and the average size of these accounts was $189.

Ray M. Stanley, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Ferris D. Stone, of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 21, 25]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George E. Brand, of Detroit, Mich., and Thomas C. Burke, of Buffalo, N.Y., for respondents.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 21, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits in admiralty to foreclose two mortgages given by the Barlum Steamship Company upon the vessels Thomas Barlum and John J. Barlum, respectively. The mortgages purported to be preferred mortgages under the Ship Mortgage Act 1920. 41 Stat. 1000-1006, 46 U.S.C. c. 25,  911-984 ( 46 USCA  911-984). The mortgagor, appearing as claimant, contended that the admiralty was without jurisdiction. The District Court overruled that contention and, finding that all the requirements of that Act had been met, entered decrees of foreclosure and sale. 56 F.(2d) 455; 2 F.Supp. 733. In the case of the John J. Barlum the decree provided for the recovery by certain seamen, intervening libelants, of amounts due for wages, as preferred maritime liens. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decrees, holding that the suits should have been dismissed for the want of jurisdiction. 68 F.(2d) 946. This Court granted certiorari. \n292 \nU.S. 619\n, 54 S.Ct. 717\n\n\n The mortgagor, at the time the mortgages were executed, was a close corporation, about four-fifths of its shares being owned by John J. Barlum, who was also interested in several nonmaritime enterprises. The mortgage, in No. 13, on the Thomas Barlum was executed in March, 1929, to petitioner, as trustee, to secure $200,000 of bonds which were purchased by petitioner with a definite understanding as to the application of the proceeds. Approximately $50,000 were to meet obligations secured by a prior mortgage upon the same vessel; about $100,000 were to take up loans of John J. Barlum and Thomas Barlum & Sons, a concern which was engaged in a nonmaritime enterprise; and the remainder, about $42,000, were to provide for repairs and for refitting the vessels Thomas Barlum and John J. Barlum. The mort- \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 31]\n\u00a0\n gage was executed while the Thomas Barlum was laid up.\n The mortgage, in No. 14, on the John J. Barlum was executed in December, 1927, to petitioner, as trustee, to secure an issue of $200,000 of bonds purchased by petitioner with the understanding that, of the proceeds, petitioner was to retain about $82,000 to cover principal and interest on bonds of John J. Barlum secured by a mortgage on real estate, and about $10,000 to be applied on one of his notes. Most of the remaining proceeds, which were paid over to the mortgagor, was used to take up loans in connection with nonmaritime enterprises, only a small part being devoted to payments relating to the operation of the vessels.\n In both instances, the bonds secured by the mortgages were negotiable bonds and were purchased by petitioner for sale to the general public and were largely so sold.\n There is no question as to the validity of the mortgages or of the bonds which they secure or as to the default in payment. The question is solely one of jurisdiction in admiralty of the foreclosure suits. Respondent contends that the mortgages 'were so devoid of connection with maritime purposes' that the provision of the Ship Mortgage Act conferring jurisdiction in admiralty 'either does not, or cannot constitutionally, apply.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals was divided in opinion. The majority of the judges, without passing on the extent of congressional authority, thought that it was sufficient to point out that the mortgagor and mortgagee knew, before the mortgages were made, that the moneys advanced 'were intended for and actually were used for non-maritime purposes,' and they concluded that the provisions of the Ship Mortgage Act did not extend to such a case. The minority view, supporting the decision of the District Court, was that the Congress intended to encourage the investment of capital in ships; that it \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 32]\n\u00a0\n might well be that this object could best be promoted by allowing vessels 'to be hypothecated as readily and with the same effect as other personal property'; that a mortgage on a ship would be 'a most undesirable security' if purchasers of bonds so secured must at their peril ascertain how moneys advanced upon the mortgage are to be spent; and that Congress had constitutional authority to give to a valid mortgage a preferred status, and to provide for the enforcement of the lien in admiralty, by virtue of its control over ships as essentially marine instrumentalities, a control which includes the promotion of their development and the regulation of their use.\n Prior to the enactment of the Ship Mortgage Act 1920, the admiralty had no jurisdiction of a suit to foreclose a mortgage on a ship. Bogart v. The Steamboat John Jay, 17 How. 399, 402; Schuchardt v. Babbidge (Ship Angelique), 19 How. 239, 241; People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393, 400; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 583; The Eclipse, \n135 \nU.S. 599, 608\n, 10 S.Ct. 873; The J. E. Rumbell, \n148 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 13 S.Ct. 498.1 If jurisdiction in the admiralty of the present suits is to be maintained it must be by reason of the application and validity of the provisions of the Ship Mortgage Act.\n\n 1. \nThe application of the statute. The grant of jurisdiction is found in subsection K (46 U.S.C.  951 (46 USCA  951)) which provides: 'A preferred mortgage shall constitute a lien upon the mortgaged vessel in the amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness secured by such vessel. Upon the default of any term or condition of the mortgage, such lien may be enforced by the mortgagee by suit in rem in ad- \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 33]\n\u00a0\n miralty. Original jurisdiction of all such suits is granted to the district courts of the United States exclusively.'\n The grant is thus one of exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the lien of a 'preferred mortgage.' If the mortgage is a preferred mortgage within the definition of the Act, jurisdiction is granted; otherwise not. 'Preferred mortgages' are carefully defined in the detailed provisions of subsection D. 2 46 U.S.C.  922 (46 USCA  922). The applica- \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 34]\n\u00a0\n tion of this term in the subsequent provisions of the Act, including the provision as to admiralty jurisdiction, is not left to inference but is explicitly stated in subdivision (b) of subsection D as follows: 'Any mortgage which complies in respect to any vessel with the conditions enumerated in this subsection is hereafter in this chapter called a 'preferred mortgage' as to such vessel.'\n Subdivison (a) of subsection D provides that a 'valid mortgage,' which 'includes the whole of any vessel of the United States of 200 gross tons and upward,' shall have, in addition, 'in respect to such vessel and as of the date of the compliance with all the provisions of this \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 35]\n\u00a0\n subdivision, the preferred status given by the provisions of subsection M,' 3 46 U.S.C.  953 (46 USCA  953). The term 'vessel of the United States' means any vessel documented under the laws of the United States; and, in the case of a mortgage 'involving a trust deed and a bond issue thereunder,' the term 'mortgagee' means the trustee. Subsection B, 46 U.S.C.  911 (46 USCA  911). The 'preferred status' given by subsection M is that, on foreclosure and sale in admiralty, all pre-existing claims in the vessel are to be held terminated and thereafter are to attach to the proceeds of the sale, and the 'preferred mortgage lien' is to have priority over all claims against the vessel, except 'preferred maritime liens' and expenses, fees, and costs allowed by the Court. 'Preferred maritime liens' are those arising prior to the recording and indorsement of the mortgage as required, or 'a lien for damages arising out of tort, for wages of a stevedore when employed directly by the owner, operator, master, ship's husband, or \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 36]\n\u00a0\n agent of the vessel, for wages of the crew of the vessel, for general average, and for salvage, including contract salvage.'\n The requirements of subdivision (a) of subsection D (46 USCA  922), which must be met in order to obtain this preferred status, are that the mortgage shall be indorsed upon the vessel's documents and shall be recorded; that an affidavit shall be filed with the record 'to the effect that the mortgage is made in good faith and without any design to hinder, delay, or defraud any existing or future creditor of the mortgagor or any lienor of the mortgaged vessel'; that the mortgage does not stipulate for a waiver of the preferred status; and that the mortgagee is a citizen of the United States. Subdivisions (c) and (d) of subsection D set forth the nature and manner of the required indorsement upon the documents of the vessel; and subsection C (46 U.S.C.  921 (46 USCA  921)), to which subsection D refers, contains detailed provisions as to recording.\n Subdivision (e) of subsection D provides that a mortgage which includes property other than a vessel 'shall not be held a preferred mortgage' unless there is provision for the separate discharge of such property by the payment of a specified portion of the mortgage indebtedness; subdivision (f) of subsection D makes provision for the case of a mortgage covering more than one vessel. And where a mortgage covers property in addition to vessels the Act is not to be construed as authorizing a proceeding in rem in admiralty to enforce the rights of the mortgagee in respect to such property. Subsection N,4 46 U.S.C.  954 (46 USCA  954). \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 37]\n\u00a0\n Subsection E (46 U.S.C.  923 (46 USCA  923)) imposes the duty upon the mortgagor to keep on board the mortgaged vessel a certified copy of the mortgage and to cause it and the vessel's documents to be exhibited by the master to any person having business with the vessel which may give rise to a maritime lien or to a transfer or mortgage of the vessel. Subsection F (46 U.S.C.  924 (46 USCA  924)) requires the mortgagor to disclose to the mortgagee, upon his request, the existence of any maritime lien, prior mortgage, or other obligation or liability of the vessel, that is known to the mortgagor, and prohibits the mortgagor, after the mortgage is executed and before the mortgagee has had reasonable time to record it and to have the necessary indorsements made upon the vessel's documents, from incurring 'any contractual obligation creating a lien upon the vessel,' other than those liens which are made 'preferred maritime liens' as above stated. Provision is also made for the record of notices of claims of lien on the mortgaged vessel, for certificates of discharge of liens, and for the inspection of records and obtaining copies. Subsections G and I (46 U. S.C.  925, 927 (46 USCA  925, 927)). Penalties are provided for failure to exhibit documents and for violation of the Act in other respects; and provision is also made for recovery, by suits in the district courts of the United States, against collectors of customs and mortgagors, or masters of vessels, of damages caused by failure to perform the duties imposed upon them. Subsection J (46 U.S.C.  941 (46 USCA  941 )).\n An examination of the provisions of the Act leaves no room for doubt that the subject of mortgages of vessels, and, in particular, the priority which should be assigned to them in relation to other liens, was under the close scrutiny of the Congress in determining its policy. But, among all the minute requirements of the Act, we find none as to the application of the proceeds of loans which such mortgages secure. No condition is imposed \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 38]\n\u00a0\n as to the purposes for which the moneys are lent. While the Congress took care to make distinct provision for cases where a mortgage covers property other than a vessel, no distinction is made as to the status of mortgages of vessels by reason of an intention to devote the borrowed moneys to uses other than maritime. We are not at liberty to imply a condition which is opposed to the explicit terms of the statute. It is enough, so the statute says expressly, that the mortgage is upon a vessel of the United States, that it is a valid mortgage, that it is made in good faith, that it is disclosed by proper indorsements on the vessel's documents and is duly recorded, and that the other conditions, specified in detail, are met. Such a mortgage upon a vessel documented under the laws of the United States, the Congress has undertaken to regulate with respect to priority of lien. If the conditions so laid down are fulfilled, the mortgage is to be a 'preferred mortgage' with all the incidents which the Act attaches to it, including that right to bring foreclosure in admiralty. To hold that a mortgage is not within the Act which the Act itself states is within it, is not to construe the Act but to amend it. The question of policy-whether different terms should have been imposed-is not for us. We may not add to the conditions set up by Congress any more than we can subtract from them. They stand, as defined, precise and complete.\n We see nothing in the general purpose of the act which can be deemed to restrict the natural meaning and effect of its language. Rather, the general purpose emphasizes that meaning and effect. The Ship Mortgage Act is a part of the Merchant Marine Act 1920 (41 Stat. 988). Its declared purpose is 'to provide for the promotion and maintenance of the American merchant marine.' The Congress, in its wisdom, decided upon the means to achieve that object and set forth its conclusions in the terms of the statute. The legislative \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 39]\n\u00a0\n history of the statute shows the controlling considerations. The report of the Senate Committee on Commerce pointed out that 'mortgage security on ships' was 'practically worthless'; that it was proposed to 'make it good except as to certain demands that should be superior to everything else, such as wages'; and that it was desired to have 'our people and capital interested in shipping and shipping securities.' Sen. Rep. No. 573, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9. The bill, with this purpose, was developed in conference. The managers on the part of the House of Representatives, in their statement accompanying the report of the Committee of Conference, observed that by the enlarged provisions of the bill 'the mortgagee under a mortgage upon a vessel of the United States is made more secure in his interest in the vessel than he is under existing admiralty law,' and, referring to the plan of 'creating a preferred mortgage,' added that 'the preferred status arises upon the recording of the mortgage as a preferred mortgage and its indorsement upon vessel's documents.' There is no suggestion of any requirement as to the use, intended or actual, of the moneys borrowed upon the faith of the mortgage security. H.R. No. 1102, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 34; H.R. No. 1107, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 31.5 The measure was enacted in the terms thus proposed. \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 40]\n\u00a0\n In placing ship mortgages upon a stronger basis as securities, the Congress had in mind, and expressly included, trust deeds securing issues of bonds to the public. Subsection B (46 U.S.C.  911 (46 USCA  911)). It is plain that the fundamental purpose to promote public confidence in such securities, and their extended use as investments, would have been frustrated if purchasers of bonds had to discover at their peril the application of the proceeds of the secured loans, or if their rights depended upon such knowledge as their trustee might have, rather than upon the satisfaction of the statutory conditions and the disclosures, as required, by indorsement on the vessel's documents and recording. But, while contemplating such bond issues, with their obvious practical incidents, the Congress did not set up a special rule for them, or for purchasers of bonds without notice as to the application of proceeds. The Congress made simple, clear, and definite conditions \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 41]\n\u00a0\n as to all ship mortgages otherwise valid, and when these were performed the mortgages were to have the status prescribed.\n Given the standing of such mortgages in admiralty, which the Congress desired to establish, an omission of a provision as to the use of the moneys borrowed cannot be regarded as anomalous. An analogous principle has been recognized in relation to bottomry and respondentia bonds. Thus, in the case of bottomry bonds, if the conditions of the bottomry attach, such bonds when given by the owner of the vessel have been held to be within the admiralty jurisdiction even if they are given to secure nonmaritime outlays. That view was emphatically stated by Justice Story in The Draco, Fed. Cas. No. 4,057, 2 Sumn. 157. There, jurisdiction of the District Court, sitting in admiralty, was challenged upon the ground that the bond in question was not a 'fit foundation for a proceeding in rem.' Id., page 174 of 2 Sumn. After a careful review of the historical conception of bottomry bonds, Justice Story concluded (Id., page 186 of 2 Sumn.): 'In my opinion, there is not the slightest ground to uphold the doctrine, that, in order to constitute a bottomry bond, as such, in the sense of the maritime law, it is necessary, that the money should be advanced for the necessities of the ship, or for the cargo, or for the voyage. Where it is given by the master, virtue officii, it must, in order to have validity, be for the ship's necessities; for the implied authority of the master extends no farther. But where it is given by the owner, as dominus navis, he may employ the money, as he pleases. It is sufficient, if the money be lent upon the bottom of the ship, at the risk of the lender, for the voyage.' So, in the case of a respondentia loan, it is not necessary that it should be made before the departure of the ship on the voyage or that the money lent should be employed in the outfit of the vessel or invested in the goods on which the risk is run. It matters not, this Court \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 42]\n\u00a0\n has said, at what time the loan is made, or upon what goods the risk is taken. 'If the risk of the voyage be substantially and really taken,' and the transaction be otherwise valid, 'it is no objection to it, that it was made after the voyage was commenced, nor that the money was appropriated to purposes wholly unconnected with the voyage.' The lender is not presumed to lend 'upon the faith of any particular appropriation of the money.' Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 386, 437. See Conard v. Nicoll, 4 Pet. 291, 310; 3 Kent's Com., 361; note (e); The Draco, supra, Fed. Cas. No. 4,057, 2 Sumn. 188, 189.\n It is also to be noted that the jurisdiction granted to the admiralty by the Ship Mortgage Act is exclusive. If a mortgage is within the Act, there can be no suit to foreclose it in a state court;6 if the mortgage is not within the Act, there can be no suit for foreclosure in the admiralty. It cannot be doubted that the Congress recognized the importance of basing the jurisdiction, as thus sought to be conferred, upon precise statutory conditions. We find no warrant for leaving it to be tested by extrinsic criteria, raising a host of questions as to the application of the proceeds of loans, in the solution of which the statute affords no aid.\n We conclude that the Court had jurisdiction of the suits provided the Congress had authority to grant it.\n\n 2. \nThe validity of the grant of jurisdiction. The Congress rested its authority upon the constitutional provisions extending the judicial power 'to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction' and conferring upon the Congress the power to make all laws which shall be 'necessary and proper' for carrying into execution all powers 'vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.' Article 3,  2; article 1,  8, par. 18.7 This author- \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 43]\n\u00a0\n ity was not confined to the cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in England when the Constitution was adopted. Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 457, 458. The limitations which had been imposed upon the high court of admiralty in the course of its controversy with the courts of common law were not read into the grant. But the grant presupposed a 'general system of maritime law' which was familiar to the lawyers and statesmen of the country, and contemplated a body of law with uniform operation. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 574, 575. The Constitution did not undertake to define the precise limits of that body of law or to lay down a criterion for drawing the boundary between maritime law and local law. Id. Boundaries were to be determined in the exercise of the judicial power in recognition of the purpose of the grant. 'No State law can enlarge it, not can an act of Congress or rule of court make it broader than the judicial power may determine to be its true limits.' The St. Lawrence, 1 Black, 522, 527. The framers of the Constitution did not contemplate that the maritime law should remain unalterable. The purpose was to place the entire subject, including its substantive as well as its procedural features, under national control. From the beginning the grant was regarded as implicitly investing legislative power for that purpose in the United States. When the Constitution was adopted, the existing maritime law became the law of the United States 'subject to power in Congress to alter, qualify or supplement it as experience or changing conditions might require.' Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, \n264 U.S. 375\n, 385- 387, 44 S.Ct. 391, 393. The Congress thus has paramount power to determine the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country. The Lottawanna, supra, page 577 of 21 Wall.; Butler v. Boston Steamship Co., \n130 \nU.S. 527, 557\n, 9 S.Ct. 612; Ex parte Garnett, \n141 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 11 S.Ct. 840; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 44]\n\u00a0\n 215, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 39\n, 52 S.Ct. 285; United States v. Flores, \n289 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 149 S., 53 S.Ct. 580. But in amending and revising the maritime law, the Congress necessarily acts within a sphere restricted by the concept of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 641; Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, supra; Crowell v. Benson, supra, page 55 of 285 U.S., 52 S. Ct. 285.\n The Congress began the exertion of this authority at an early date. In the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Congress conferred upon the district courts of the United States exclusive jurisdiction of all seizures under the laws of impost, navigation, or trade of the United States, where the seizures were made on navigable waters within the respective districts. Section 9, 1 Stat. 76, 77; Waring v. Clarke, supra, page 458 of 5 How.; The Margaret, 9 Wheat. 421, 427. By the Act of June 19, 1813, 3 Stat. 2, the Congress declared that a vessel employed in a fishing voyage should be answerable for the fishermen's share of the fish caught, upon a contract made on land, in the same form and to the same effect as any other vessel is liable to be proceeded against for the wages of seamen. Waring v. Clarke, supra. Important illustrations of the exercise of congressional power are found in the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, 9 Stat. 635, enacted for the purpose of encouraging investment in shipbuilding, by limiting the venture of shipowners to the loss of the ship itself, or her freight then pending, in cases of damage occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge (Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104; Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 47 S.Ct. 357); the extension, by the Act of June 26, 1884,  18, 23 Stat. 57, 58 (46 USCA  189), of the admiralty jurisdiction to proceedings for the limitation of liability, so as to include damages by a vessel to a land structure (The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20; Cleveland Terminal R.R. Co. v. Steamship Co., \n208 \nU.S. 316\n, 28 S.Ct. 414; Richardson v.

Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128\n, 50 S.Ct. 303; Crowell v. Benson, supra).\n Of special significance, in relation to the present question, are the Acts of 1884 and 1910, supra. By the former, the admiralty jurisdiction in limitation proceedings was enlarged so as to embrace the liability for a nonmaritime tort. Although the damaged structure was on land, the injury was due to the operation of the vessel, and it could not be said that the Congress had stepped beyond the limits of its authority to amend the law in furthering its policy to encourage investments in ships. Richardson v. Harmon, supra. Compare The Blackheath, \n195 \nU.S. 361, 367\n, 368 S., 25 S.Ct. 46. The Act of 1910 created a lien to be enforced in rem for repairs or supplies to vessels in their home ports. The state of the law as it existed be \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 46]\n\u00a0\n fore that enactment was fully described in The J. E. Rumbell, supra. For repairs or supplies furnished to a vessel in a foreign port, a lien was given by the general maritime law and could be enforced in admiralty, but for repairs or supplies in the home port, no lien existed, or could be enforced in admiralty under the general law, independently of local statute. When the statute of a State gave a lien to be enforced by process in rem against the vessel for repairs or supplies in her home port, that lien, being similar to the lien arising in a foreign port under the general law, was deemed to be in the nature of a maritime lien and therefore could be enforced in admiralty, and, in such case the enforcement of the lien was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United States sitting in admiralty. The result was that where necessaries were furnished to a vessel in her home port, the vessel could not be sued in the federal courts under the general maritime law, for that law was not deemed to confer a lien, and could not be sued in a state court for that court could not enforce the lien created by the state law, but the lien so given might be enforced in admiralty. \n8\n The Act of 1910 abolished the artificial distinction between repairs and supplies in a home port and those in a foreign port. While it created a lien where, in the absence of local provision therefor, none had theretofore existed, the change was not deemed to be inconsistent with the general principles of the maritime law and it effected a substitution of a single federal statute for the conflicting state statutes. Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., supra. The Act of 1910 also provided that it should not be necessary 'to allege or prove' that credit was given to the vessel; previously, supplies furnished to the vessel at the home port, or on the owner's order, were presumed to be furnished upon his personal credit and created no lien. Id. \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 47]\n\u00a0\n Respondent, in attacking the grant of jurisdiction by the Ship Mortgage Act, relies strongly upon the reasoning of the Court in Bogart v. The Steamboat John Jay, supra, which denied, under the former law, jurisdiction in admiralty to enforce payment of a mortgage upon a vessel. The Court there said that neither in England9 nor in the United States had the admiralty courts exercised jurisdiction in questions of property between a mortgagee and the owner; that the foundation of the rule was 'that the mere mortgage of a ship, other than that of an hypothecated bottomry,' was a contract 'without any of the characteristics or attendants of a maritime loan' and was made 'without reference to navigation or perils of the sea'; that it was a security 'to make the performance of the mortgagor's undertaking more certain'; that, while the mortgagor continued in possession of the ship, the mortgagee was disconnected 'from all agency and interest in the employment and navigation of her, and from all responsibility for contracts made on her account'; that there was nothing maritime in the contract; and that from the organization of courts of admiralty and their modes of proceeding they cannot secure to the parties to the mortgage 'the remedies and protection which they have in a court of chancery.'\n But it did not follow, because this view was taken of the existing law, that the Congress was without power to amend the law so as to enable the admiralty courts to take cognizance of mortgages on ships, and to regulate priorities of liens, in order to promote investment in shipping securities and thus to advance the maritime interests of the United States. Indeed, in the Bogart Case the Court seemed to recognize the existence of that constitutional authority. For the Court, in concluding its opinion, observed that the policy of commerce and its exigencies in England had given to its admiralty courts \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 48]\n\u00a0\n a more ample jurisdiction in respect to mortgages of ships than they had under the former rule. And the Court pointed out that this 'enlarged cognizance of mortgages' had been given by statute 3 and 4 Victoria, chap. 65, and said that 'until this shall be done in the United States by congress, the rule, in this particular, must continue in the admiralty courts of the United States as it has been.'\n The significance of this suggestion cannot be overlooked. The fact that mortgages on ships had not been considered to be maritime contracts was not conclusive as to the constitutional authority of the Congress to alter or supplement the maritime law in this respect, and thus to extend the admiralty jurisdiction, 'as experience or changing conditions might require,' while keeping within a proper conception of maritime concerns. The ship, documented under the laws of the United States, is the instrumentality of our maritime enterprise, the prime object of our maritime policy. The ship 'from the moment her keel touches the water' becomes 'a subject of admiralty jurisdiction'; she acquires personality; she becomes competent to contract, is individually liable for her obligations, and is responsible for her torts. Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 426, 438\n, 22 S.Ct. 195, 201. The existence of the ship, the investments which make that existence possible, is the necessary postulate of maritime liens. We cannot fail to regard the encouragement of investments 'in shipping and shipping securities'-the objective of the Ship Mortgage Act-as an essential prerogative of the Congress in the exercise of its wide discretion as to the appropriate development of the maritime law of the country. The regulation of the priorities of ship mortgages in relation to other liens, and the conferring of jurisdiction in admiralty in order to enforce this regulation, are appropriate means to that legitimate end. \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 49]\n\u00a0\n The enlargement of the cognizance of mortgages of ships, in the admiralty courts in England, nearly one hundred years ago, to which the Court referred in the Bogart Case, was to remedy an evil which had been found to exist. The purpose was 'to enable the Court to exercise its ordinary jurisdiction to the full extent.' \n10\n That Act applied whenever the ship was 'under arrest by process issuing from the high court of admiralty' or the proceeds of a ship so arrested had been brought into the registry of the court, and the court was invested with 'full jurisdiction to take cognizance of all claims and causes of action of any person in respect to any mortgage of such ship or vessel, and to decide any suit instituted by any such person in respect of any such claims or causes of action respectively.' 3 & 4 Vict., c. 65, secs. 3, 4. These provisions were expanded by later legislation. The admiralty court in England has jurisdiction in respect of any mortgage duly registered according to the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act 1894, 'whether or not the ship or proceeds are under the arrest of the Court, and such jurisdiction may be exercised by an action in rem or in personam.' Roscoe's Admiralty Practice ( 5th Ed.) p. 51.\n This response 'to the exigencies of commerce' has had its counterpart in the legislation of other European States. It may be said that the 'general maritime law' takes cognizance of mortgages of ships, provides for their registration, and establishes rules with respect to priorities. 11 \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 50]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the Ship Mortgage Act the right of the mortgagee to intervene as a claimant of proceeds of a vessel sold by process in the admiralty was recognized and was frequently exercised. Schuchardt v. Babbidge (Ship Angelique), supra; The Lottawanna, supra; The J. E. Rumbell, supra. The distinction between such an intervention and an original proceeding by the mortgagee was no doubt controlling as a matter of jurisdiction and procedure under the law as it then existed, but it cannot be considered as establishing a criterion of the constitutional power of the Congress in defining jurisdiction and procedure. The Congress undoubtedly could determine the priorities that should be recognized by the admiralty court and, having that authority, the Congress could fix the conditions upon which mortgages of ships documented under the laws of the United States should have the priority specified. The grant of jurisdiction in admiralty to entertain a suit by the mortgagee, where the mortgage complies with the prescribed conditions, in order to enforce the permitted lien against the vessel, is, after all, but a provision of suitable machinery to give effect to the rights which the Congress has created.\n If it be concluded, and we think it must be, that the Congress has this power in the case of the mortgage of a vessel to provide for its acquisition, or for the discharge of pre-existing liens, or for its necessities, that is, to authorize the enforcement by suits in admiralty of mortgages given to secure loans for the direct benefit of the vessel, we perceive no ground to deny to the Congress constitutional power to make similar provision as to mort- \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 51]\n\u00a0\n gages of ships, which comply with its rules, although the proceeds of the loans thereby secured are used for other purposes. The analogy of the decision by Justice Story in The Draco Case, supra, as to bottomry bonds, and of the decisions of this Court in the Conard Cases, supra, as to respondentia bonds, is apparent. If the maritime law does not require, as Justice Story held, that a bottomry bond, as such, must be given for the necessities of the ship or for the cargo or for the voyage, but that it is sufficient, when given by the owner, that the money be lent upon the bottom of the ship, at the risk of the lender, for the voyage, and that in such case the owner is free to employ the money as he pleases; if, as this Court decided, in the case of a respondentia loan, it is no objection that it is made after the departure of the ship, or that the money lent was not employed in the outfit of the vessel, or invested in the goods on which the risk was run, or that the money was appropriated for purposes wholly unconnected with the voyage, we cannot see that an analogous provision with respect to ship mortgages is so far inconsistent with the fundamental principles of maritime law as to place such mortgages beyond the authority of the Congress in determining the admiralty jurisdiction. The contention to the contrary loses sight of the dominant purpose of the Act, a purpose which the Congress was competent to achieve. That purpose, we repeat, was to establish the worth of 'shipping securities,' in the interest of the merchant marine. In order to create public confidence in such securities, in obligations issued on the faith of ship mortgages, the Congress deemed it necessary, not to hamper their issue or enforcement by compelling inquiries as to the application of loans, but to give a definite and assured character to such mortgages provided they met certain simple conditions. The Congress in the exercise of its discretion was entitled to consider the methods by which securities are issued to the public and \n\n[293 U.S. 21, 52]\n\u00a0\n dealt in, and the well-known usages of business in this regard amply support its judgment.\n The authority of the Congress to enact legislation of this nature was not limited by previous decisions as to the extent of the admiralty jurisdiction. We have had abundant reason to realize that our experience and new conditions give rise to new conceptions of maritime concerns. These may require that former criteria of jurisdiction be abandoned, as, for example, they were abandoned in discarding the doctrine that the admiralty jurisdiction was limited to tidewaters. The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443, overruling The Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428.\n The constitutional validity of the grant of jurisdiction by the Ship Mortgage Act has been sustained in The Oconee (D.C.) 280 f. 927, in The Nanking (D.C.) 292 F. 642, and in The Lincoln Land (D.C.) 295 F. 358.12 We find no reason for reaching a contrary conclusion in the instant cases.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, The William D.

(a) A valid mortgage which, at the time it is made includes the whole of any vessel of the United States of 200 gross tons and upward, shall in addition have, in respect to such vessel and as of the date of the compliance with all the provisions of this subdivision, the preferred status given by the provisions of subsection M, section 953, if-\n\n'(1) The mortgage is indorsed upon the vessel's documents in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;\n\n'(2) The mortgage is recorded as provided in subsection C, section 921, together with the time and date when the mortgage is so indorsed;\n\n'(3) An affidavit is filed with the record of such mortgage to the effect that the mortgage is made in good faith and without any design to hinder, delay, or defraud any existing or future creditor of the mortgagor or any lienor of the mortgaged vessel;\n\n'(4) The mortgage does not stipulate that the mortgagee waives the preferred status thereof; and\n\n'(5) The mortgagee is a citizen of the United States.\n\n'(b) Any mortgage which complies in respect to any vessel with the conditions enumerated in this subsection is hereafter in this chapter called a 'preferred mortgage' as to such vessel.\n\n'(c) There shall be indorsed upon the documents of a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage-\n\n'(1) The names of the mortgagor and mortgagee;\n\n'(2) The time and date the indorsement is made;\n\n'(3) The amount and date of maturity of the mortgage; and\n\n'(4) Any amount required to be indorsed by the provisions of subdivision (e) or (f) of this subsection.\n\n'(d) Such indorsement shall be made (1) by the collector of customs of the port of documentation of the mortgaged vessel, or (2) by the collector of customs of any port in which the vessel is found, if such collector is directed to make the indorsement by the collector of customs of the port of documentation; and no clearance shall be issued to the vessel until such indorsement is made. \n\n The collector of customs of the port of documentation shall give such direction by wire or letter at the request of the mortgagee and upon the tender of the cost of communication of such direction. Whenever any new document is issued for the vessel, such indorsement shall be transferred to and indorsed upon the new document by the collector of customs.\n'(e) A mortgage which includes property other than a vessel shall not be held a preferred mortgage unless the mortgage provides for the separate discharge of such property by the payment of a specified portion of the mortgage indebtedness. If a preferred mortgage so provides for the separate discharge, the amount of the portion of such payment shall be indorsed upon the documents of the vessel.\n\n'(f) If a preferred mortgage includes more than one vessel and provides for the separate discharge of each vessel by the payment of a portion of the mortgage indebtedness, the amount of such portion of such payment shall be indorsed upon the documents of the vessel. In case such mortgage does not provide for the separate discharge of a vessel and the vessel is to be sold upon the order of a district court of the United States in a suit in rem in admiralty, the court shall determine the portion of the mortgage indebtedness increased by 20 per centum (1) which, in the opinion of the court, the approximate value of the vessel bears to the approximate value of all the vessels covered by the mortgage, and (2) upon the payment of which the vessel shall be discharged from the mortgage.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Subsection M is as follows:\n'Preferred maritime lien; priorities; other liens. (a) When used hereinafter in this chapter, the term 'preferred maritime lien' means (1) a lien arising prior in time to the recording and indorsement of a preferred mortgage in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; or ( 2) a lien for damages arising out of tort, for wages of a stevedore when employed directly by the owner, operator, master, ship's husband, or agent of the vessel, for wages of the crew of the vessel, for general average, and for salvage, including contract salvage.\n\n'(b) Upon the sale of any mortgaged vessel by order of a district court of the United States in any suit in rem in admiralty for the enforcement of a preferred mortgage lien thereon, all preexisting claims in the vessel, including any possessory common-law lien of which a lienor is deprived under the provisions of subsection L, section 952, shall be held terminated and shall thereafter attach, in like amount and in accordance with their respective priorities, to the proceeds of the sale; except that the preferred mortgage lien shall have priority over all claims against the vessel, except (1) preferred maritime liens, and (2) expenses and fees allowed and costs taxed, by the court.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Subdivision (b) of subsection N (46 USCA  954(b) is as follows: '( b) This chapter shall not be construed, in the case of a mortgage covering, in addition to vessels, realty or personalty other than vessels, or both, to authorize the enforcement by suit in rem in admiralty of the rights of the mortgagee in respect to such realty or personalty other than vessels.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In this statement, the House managers said:\n'This Senate amendment is an extensive provision by which the mortgagee under a mortgage upon a vessel of the United States is made more secure in his interest in the vessel than he is under existing admiralty law. The amendment supplements the existing mortgage recording provisions by creating a preferred mortgage which in foreclosure proceedings will have priority in the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the mortgaged vessel over all maritime liens against the vessel except liens for damages arising out of tort, stevedores' and crews' wages, general average, and salvage. The preferred status arises upon the recording of the mortgage as a preferred mortgage and its indorsement upon vessel's documents. Under the Senate amendment the foreclosure proceedings are brought in the Federal courts in equity with simulated admiralty procedure under which the court in equity gives a title good against the world, and terminates all preexisting claims against the vessel. * *\n\n'The House recedes with an amendment which places the constitutional basis of Congress' power to legislate in respect to vessel mortgages, upon the grant of admiralty jurisdiction and the 'necessary and proper clause' of the Constitution, instead of the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. The amendment as agreed to further places exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal courts to foreclose vessel mortgages upon the grant of admiralty jurisdiction instead of the provisions of the Constitution relating to diversity of citizenship and cases arising under the laws of the United States. The amendment as agreed to also makes the title granted under the order of a court of admiralty in the case of the libel of a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage good against the world as under the existing admiralty law and international admiralty practice; clarifies the provisions as to fleet mortgages; provides for the reenactment and incorporation in the amendment of the existing vessel mortgage recording provisions, and prevents the repeal of section 4 of the maritime lien act of 1910 in respect to the doctrines of advances and laches.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Note 5. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Note 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Benedict's Admiralty (5th Ed.)  87, 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See The Neptune, 3 Hagg. 129 (132). \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See statement of Dr. Lushington in The Fortitude, 2 Wm.

Loomis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[293 U.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners brought suit in admiralty in the District Court for Southern New York, to recover damages for injury to a shipment of onions on respondent's steamship Vallescura from Spain to New York City. The onions, receipt of which in apparent good condition was acknowledged by the bill of lading, were delivered in New York damaged by decay. The vessel pleaded as a defense an exception, in the bill of lading, from liability for damage by 'decay' and 'perils of the seas,' and that the damage 'was not due to any cause or event arising through any negligence on the part of the vessel, her master, owner or agents.'\n On the trial there was evidence that the decay was caused by improper ventilation of the cargo during the voyage, and that the failure to ventilate was due in part to closing of the hatches and ventilators made necessary by heavy weather, and in part to the neglect of the master and crew in failing to keep them open at night in fair weather. The District Court entered an interlocutory decree, adjudging that the libelants recover the amount of the damage sustained by them, caused by closing the hatches and ventilators during good weather, and appointing a special commissioner to ascertain and compute the amount of damage. 43 F.(2d) 247.\n The commissioner, after hearing evidence, found that it was impossible to ascertain how much of the damage was due to want of ventilation in fair weather and how much to want of it in bad. But, after comparing the periods during which the ventilators were negligently closed with those during which they were open or properly closed,1 he stated: 'It would seem, therefore, that the \n\n[293 U.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n greater part of the damage must have been due to improper shutting of the hatches and ventilators.' He concluded that as the vessel had failed to show what part of the damage was due to bad weather, the petitioner should recover the full amount of the damage. The District Court, accepting the report of the commissioner as presumably correct, as required by Admiralty Rule 43 1\/2, \n286 U.S. 572\n (28 USCA  723), found no basis for rejecting its conclusions and gave judgment to libelants accordingly. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversed, 70 F.(2d) 261, holding that as the damage was within the clause of the bill of lading exempting the vessel from liability for decay, the burden was on petitioner to show what part of the damage was taken out of the exception, because due to respondent's negligence.\n Although certiorari was granted, \n293 \nU.S. 539\n, 55 S.Ct. 83, 79 L.Ed . --, to review this ruling of the court below, most of respondent's argument before us was given over to the contention that the record discloses no finding, by either court below, that any part of the damage was caused by respondent's negligence. The decision of the District Court was made before the promulgation of rule 46 1\/2 in Admiralty, \n281 U.S. 773\n ( 28 USCA  723), requiring the trial court to make special findings of fact. No formal findings were made, but in directing entry of the interlocutory decree, and after reviewing the evidence and commenting on the fact that the hatches and ventilators had been kept closed at night in fair weather, a circumstance which the trial judge declared established negligence in the care and custody of the cargo, he stated: 'Thus it appears that this notoriously perishable cargo of Spanish Onions (The Buckleigh (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 241, 1929 A.M.C. 449, 450) was deprived of all ventilation during the nighttime, regardless of the state of the weather. Such treatment was obviously ruinous and must have caused substantial damage.' We have no doubt that this was intended to \n\n[293 U.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n be a finding that negligence in failing to provide properventilation was the cause of some of the damage and that, as such, it was adequately supported by evidence. The commissioner and the court below assumed it to be such and we so accept it.\n The failure to ventilate the cargo was not a 'fault or error in navigation or management' of the vessel, from the consequences of which it may be relieved by section 3 of the Harter Act of February 13, 1893,  3, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445; section 192, tit. 46, U.S.C. (46 USCA  192). The management was of the cargo, within the meaning of sections 1 and 2 of the act (46 USCA  190, 191), and not of the vessel, to which section 3 relates. The Germanic, \n196 \nU.S. 589, 597\n, 25 S.Ct. 317; Knott v. Botony Mills, \n179 \nU.S. 69, 73\n, 74 S., 21 S.Ct. 30; The Jean Bart, 197 F. 1002, 1006 (D.C.). Hence, we pass to the decisive question whether, in view of the presumptions which aid the shipper in establishing the vessel's liability under a contract for carriage by sea, it was necessary for the petitioners to offer further evidence in order to recover the damage which they have suffered. If, in the state of the proof which the record exhibits, recovery depends upon their ability to produce evidence which would enable the court to separate the amount of damage attributable to respondent's negligence from that attributable to the unavoidable failure to ventilate in bad weather, they have failed to do so and judgment must go against them. But if respondent can relieve itself from liability only by showing what part of the damage was due to sea peril, in that bad weather prevented ventilation, judgment must go against it for the full damages.\n In general the burden rests upon the carrier of goods by sea to bring himself within any exception relieving him from the liability which the law otherwise imposes on him. This is true at common law with respect to the exceptions which the law itself annexed to his under \n\n[293 U.S. 296, 304]\n\u00a0\n taking, such as his immunity from liability for act of God or the public enemy. See Carver, Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.) c. I. The rule applies equally with respect to other exceptions for which the law permits him to stipulate. Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 280; Rich v. Lambert, 12 How. 347, 357; The Niagara v. Cordes, 21 How. 7, 29; The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 459; The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199, 211\n, 14 S.Ct. 823; The Folmina, \n212 \nU.S. 354, 361\n, 29 S.Ct. 363, 15 Ann.Cas. 748. The reason for the rule is apparent. He is a bailee intrusted with the shipper's goods, with respect to the care and safe delivery of which the law imposes upon him an extraordinary duty. Discharge of the duty is peculiarly within his control. All the facts and circumstances upon which he may rely to relieve him of that duty are peculiarly within his knowledge and usually unknown to the shipper. In consequence, the law casts upon him the burden of the loss which he cannot explain or, explaining, bring within the exceptional case in which he is relieved from liability. See Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Express Co., \n93 U.S. 174\n, 184; Chicago & Eastern Illinois R. Co. v. Collins Produce Co., \n249 \nU.S. 186, 192\n, 193 S., 39 S.Ct. 189; New York C. Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 379, 380.\n To such exceptions the law itself annexes a condition that they shall relieve the carrier from liability for loss from an excepted cause only if in the course of the voyage he has used due care to guard against it. Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 438\n, 9 S.Ct. 469; Compania De Navigacion la Flecha v. Brauer, \n168 \nU.S. 104, 117\n, 18 S.Ct. 12. This rule is reconized and continued in the first section of the Harter Act (46 USCA  190), which makes it unlawful to insert any clause in a bill of lading whereby the carrier shall be relieved of liability for negligence.\n It is commonly said that when the carrier succeeds in establishing that the injury is from an excepted cause, \n\n[293 U.S. 296, 305]\n\u00a0\n the burden is then on the shipper to show that that cause would not have produced the injury but for the carrier's negligence in failing to guard against it. Such we may assume the rule to be, at least to the extent of requiring the shipper to give evidence of negligence where the carrier has sustained the burden of showing that the immediate cause of the loss or injury is an excepted peril. Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 280; Memphis & C. Railroad Co. v. Reeves, 10 Wall. 176, 189, 190; Western Transportation Co. v. Downer, 11 Wall. 129, 134; The Victory & The Plymothian, \n168 \nU.S. 410, 423\n, 18 S.Ct. 149; Cau v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 427, 432\n, 24 S.Ct. 663; The Malcolm Baxter, \n277 \nU.S. 323, 334\n, 48 S.Ct. 516.\n But this is plainly not the case where the efficient cause of the injury for which the carrier is prima facie liable is not shown to be an excepted peril. The Mohler, 21 Wall. 230, 234; The Edwin I. Morrison, supra, \n153 \nU.S. 211\n, 14 S.Ct. 823. If he delivers a cargo damaged by causes unknown or unexplained, which had been received in good condition, he is subject to the rule applicable to all bailees, that such evidence makes out a prima facie case of liability. It is sufficient, if the carrier fails to show that the damage is from an excepted cause, to cast on him the further burden of showing that the damage is not due to failure properly to stow or care for the cargo during the voyage. Rich v. Lambert, supra, 12 How. 357; The Maggie Hammond, supra, 9 Wall. 459; The Folmina, \n212 \nU.S. 354, 361\n, 29 S.Ct. 363, 15 Ann.Cas. 748; Chesapeake & Ohio R.R. Co. v. A. F. Thompson Manufacturing Co., \n270 \nU.S. 416, 422\n, 423 S., 46 S.Ct. 318.\n Here the stipulation was for exemption from liability for a particular kind of injury, decay. But the decay of a perishable cargo is not a cause; it is an effect. It may be the result of a number of causes, for some of which, such as the inherent defects of the cargo, or, under the contract, sea peril making it impossible to ventilate properly, the carrier is not liable. For others, such as negligent stowage, or failure to care for the cargo properly during the \n\n[293 U.S. 296, 306]\n\u00a0\n voyage, he is liable. The stipulation thus did not add to the causes of injury from which the carrier court claim immunity. It could not relieve him from liability for want of diligence in the stowage or care of the cargo.\n It is unnecessary for us to consider whether the effect of the clause is to relieve the carrier from the necessity, in the first instance, of offering evidence of due diligence in caring for a cargo received in good condition, and delivered in a state of decay. See The Hindoustan, 67 F. 794, 795 (C.C.A.2d); The Patria, 132 F. 971, 972 (C.C.A.2d); Loma Fruit Co. v. International Navigation Co., Ltd., 11 F.(2d) 124, 125 (C.C.A.2d); The Gothic Star, 4 F.Supp. 240, 241 (D.C.). For here want of diligence in providing proper ventilation is established and it is found that the failure to ventilate has caused the damage. It is enough that the clause plainly cannot be taken to relieve the vessel from bringing itself within the exception from liability for damage by sea peril where the shipper has carried the burden of showing that the decay is due either to sea peril, in that bad weather prevented ventilation, or to the vessel's negligence. Where the state of the proof is such as to show that the damage is due either to an excepted peril or to the carrier's negligent care of the cargo, it is for him to bring himself within the exception or to show that he has not been negligent. The Folmina, supra.\n Similarly, the carrier must bear the entire loss where it appears that the injury to cargo is due either to sea peril or negligent stowage, or both, and he fails to show what damage is attributable to sea peril.

Co., 141 F. 260, 264 (C.C.A.9th); The Gualala, 178 F. 402, 406 (C.C.A.9th); The Jeanie, 236 F. 463, 472 (C.C.A. 9th); The Excellent, 16 F. 148 (C.C.); The Nith (Thompson v.

In each of these cases the carrier is charged with the responsibility for a loss which, in fact, may not be due to his fault, merely because the law, in pursuance of a wise policy, casts on him the burden of showing facts relieving him from liability.\n The vessel in the present case is in no better position because, upon the evidence, it appears that some of the damage, in an amount not ascertainable, is due to sea peril. That does not remove the burden of showing facts relieving it from liability. If it remains liable for the whole amount of the damage because it is unable to show that sea peril was a cause of the loss, it must equally remain so if it cannot show what part of the loss is due to that cause. Speyer v. The Mary Belle Roberts, supra; The Rona, 5 Asp. 259, 262; Carver, Carriage by Sea (7th Ed.),  78, p. 114.\n Since the respondent has failed throughout to sustain the burden, which rested upon it at the outset, of showing to what extent sea peril was the effective cause of the damage, and as the petitioners are without fault, no question of apportionment or division of the damage arises.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The voyage lasted twenty-three days. The commissioner found that during the voyage, day and night together, the hatches and ventilators were kept open only 170 hours, that they were properly closed 144 hours, and improperly closed for 238 hours. \n\n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRAVELERS' PROTECTIVE ASS'N v. PRINSEN(1934)\nNo. 429\nArgued: February 9, 1934Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 576, 577]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Emmett M. Bagley and Paul H. Ray, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph H. Peterson, of Pocatello, Idaho, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n James Prinsen when he died was a member of the petitioner, a fraternal benefit association, incorporated under the laws of Missouri. By his certificate of membership, benefits in case of death were payable to his wife, Uluetta Prinsen, the respondent in this court. The payment to be made to her in the event of death by accident was $5,000, unless the accident occurred while the member was engaged in enumerated activities. Death suffered in such circumstances was excluded from the coverage. By the terms of the certificate the association was not to be liable if disability or death occurred 'when a member is par- \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n ticipating ... in the moving or transportation of gunpowder, dynamite, or other explosive substance or substances.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n At the time of his death Prinsen was an officer of the Western Powder Company, which had an office in Salt Lake City, Utah, and a powder magazine outside the city limits. The Tintic Powder & Supply Company gave an order to the Hercules Powder Company for 300,000 dynamite caps, and the Hercules Company asked the Western Company to fill the order. The request was received by Prinsen, and with it a notice that within a few days the Hercules representative, Begaman, would come to Salt Lake City to accept delivery. On February 3, 1931, Begaman appeared at the Western office with a \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 579]\n\u00a0\n motortruck in which he was to carry the explosives. He and Prinsen then drove to the magazine beyond the city. The magazine was opened with a key which Prinsen had brought with him, and delivery of the caps was made by pilling them in boxes on the truck. The two men then boarded the truck again to go back to the Western office, Begaman driving the car, and Prinsen sitting beside him on the box. A small additional payment was made by Hercules to Western for the trip to the magazine, but Tintic, not Hercules, was the owner of the truck. On the way back, the truck was in collision with an engine while crossing the tracks of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. There was an immediate explosion, in which the truck was destroyed and Prinsen was blown to pieces. Begaman and the railway engineer were killed at the same time.\n The respondent brought suit on the membership certificate to recover the benefits payable in the event of death by accident. The association defended on the ground that the member was killed while 'participating' in the transportation of explosives.' In the District Court a verdict was directed in favor of the defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting. 65 F.(2d) 841. This court granted certiorari to resolve a possible conflict with other federal decisions. \n290 \nU.S. 618\n, 54 S.Ct. 101, 78 L.Ed. --. Pittman v. Lamar Life Insurance Co. (C.C.A.) 17 F.(2d) 370; Head v. New York Life Insurance Co. (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 517.\n We assume in favor of the respondent that 'participation' in the carriage of explosives imports something more than the presence of the assured in the vehicle of carriage. One who becomes a passenger in an aeroplane may thereby participate in aeronautics (cf. Head v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra; Bew v. Travelers' Insurance Co., 95 N.J. Law, 533, 112 A. 859, 14 A.L.R. 983; Pittman v. Lamar Life Insurance Co., supra ), but it does not follow that he participates in the carriage of the mails, and this though the plane to his \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 580]\n\u00a0\n knowledge is in part devoted to that use. One who travels in a sleeping car does not participate thereby in the movement of explosives, though information is brought home to him that in a baggage car forward explosives are in transit. But Prinsen's relation to this enterprise was not so remote or passive as the relation of the passenger in the cases just supposed. He had gone upon a truck which had been specially devoted by its owner to the transportation of explosives, and had gone there for the very purpose of making transportation possible. The respondent would have as split into separate parts a transaction that is unitary in aim and essence. Plainly the assured was facilitating the delivery of explosives in traveling with Begaman to the suburban magazine. Plainly he was still engaged in and about a like service when he opened the magazine and placed the caps upon the truck. But his participation in the errand did not end abruptly then and there. The return journey to his office had the same motive and occasion that induced the journey out. It was not an adventitious incident that there were explosives in the truck when he left the magazine. To the contrary, it was part of the plan from the beginning that the truck should take him out, and then, when laden, take him back. To say that he was riding on the truck 'while' explosives were transported is to state but half the case. The case is rather this, that he was riding on the truck 'because' explosives were transported. If he had not known in advance that this was the substance to be carried, he would not have stirred out of his office. There was a relation more intimate than contiguity in time or space between his presence on the truck and the presence of the explosive caps. The relation was no accident; it was preordained and causal.\n The respondent tells us that the assured at the time of the collision was a voluntary guest, and makes much of \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 581]\n\u00a0\n the label. The payment or nonpayment of a fare has little, if any, bearing upon the problem to be solved, yet the label, unless scrutinized, may have capacity to mislead. In his relation to this enterprise, Prinsen was more than a voluntary guest. He was a business 'invitee,' riding out and back at the invitation of the owner because of a business interest common to them both. Bennett v. Railroad Company, \n102 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 584 S.; Heskell v. Auburn L., H. & P. Co., 209 N.Y. 86, 102 N.E. 540, L.R.A. 1915B, 1127; Haefeli v. Woodrich Engineering Co., 255 N.Y. 442, 448, 175 N. E. 123; Indermaur v. Dames, L.R. 1 C.P. 274; American Law Institute, Restatement of Torts, Tentative Draft, No. 4,  202, 213. We may see the case more clearly if we ask ourselves the question whether Begaman would have been free to leave the 'guest' at the magazine after delivery of the caps, and refuse to bring him home. Plainly not, without breach of duty to the Tintic Company, the employer, which had sent the car out with instructions to the driver to carry Prinsen back. The result is all one whether the instructions in respect of carriage were tacit or express. By reasonable implication, the return trip, as well as the outward one, was within the orbit of the errand. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Parramore, \n263 \nU.S. 418, 426\n, 44 S.Ct. 153, 30 A.L.R. 532; Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, \n276 \nU.S. 154, 158\n, 48 S.Ct. 221, 66 A.L.R. 1402; Voehl v. Indemnity Insurance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 162\n, 53 S.Ct. 380, 87 A.L.R. 245.\n The argument is made that a causal connection between the death and the explosion is not a necessary inference from the facts in evidence. The assured was blown to pieces; the fragments of his body being so small that an autopsy was impossible. We are told that even so the impact of the engine may have been fatal without more. The contract does not say that the holder of the policy is to have no claim against the insurer if he dies 'by reason of' his participation in the carriage of explosives. The contract says that he is to have no claim \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 582]\n\u00a0\n against the insurer if he dies 'when' he is participating in the carriage of explosives, just as it provides for a like result when he is acting as a sailor or a soldier, or is participating in war or riot, or is under the influence of narcotics or of intoxicating liquors. \n2\n Courts of high authority have held that in policies so phrased there is no need of any causal nexus between the injury or death and the forbidden forms of conduct. \n3\n While the proscribed activity continues, the insurance is suspended as if it had never been in force. Other courts prefer the view that to work such a suspension, there must have been an aggravation of the hazard to which death or injury was owing. \n4\n In \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 583]\n\u00a0\n that aspect the insurer might be liable if the insured had fallen from the box while asleep or inattentive; the dynamite caps remaining unexploded in the truck. So policies excluding liability while the assured is doing an act in violation of the law have been read as directed to acts that aggravate the danger, with the result that liability is unaffected by violation of the Sunday laws or of the laws against profanity. See the cases cited in note 4, supra.\n In so far as these readings of the policy diverge, there is no need to choose between them for the decision of the case at hand, nor to search for a formula that may have capacity to reconcile them. If the first meaning is accepted, the controversy ends. If the second is accepted, it is still clear beyond debate that the effect of the forbidden act was to magnify the risk of death in the event of a collision, to aggravate the danger in the very event that happened. Less than this may be required to relieve the insurer of liability, but surely nothing more.\n The good sense of this construction of the policy has illustration in the case before us. At the very least the explosion was a concurrent cause of death, if not indeed the sole one. The policy does not mean that in the event of a proscribed activity there shall be a segregation of causes operating in unison and a distribution of the consequences assignable to each. One of the essential purposes to be served by the limitation of the risk is to put an end to such a process of dissection and comparison. By the form of its policy the insurer has given notice to assured and beneficiary that it will refuse to become entangled in these mystifying subtleties. At the moment of the casualty the insurance was suspended by an aggravation of the hazard, and suspended it remained till the forbidden hazard was removed. \n\n[291 U.S. 576, 584]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n If 'participation' means co-operation in the transportation more than is involved in presence on the transporting vehicle, with the knowledge that an explosive is being carried, I can perceive no ground for saying that there was participation here. That deceased had made the journey to deliver the caps and, as a 'business invitee,' had a right to return on the vehicle on which he had placed it, seems to me as irrelevant as though the deceased had embarked as a passenger on a railroad train on which the explosion occurred after he or his firm had shipped dynamite upon it. By the terms of the policy, participation, to exclude liability, must be at the time of the injury. After the return journey began, deceased did nothing to facilitate the transportation. He neither controlled nor had the right to control it. He was merely present. The distinction drawn between this case and that of mere presence, so difficult of statement and application, appears to me to obscure, rather than to define, the meaning of the term and to violate the cardinal principle that, so far as their language reasonably admits, insurance contracts are to be interpreted most favorably to the insured. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The full text of the exception follows: 'This Association shall not be liable to a member or his beneficiary for any disability benefits, special loss benefits or death benefits, when the disability, special loss, or death of a member occurs under any of the following conditions or circumstances; when inflicted by a member on himself, while sane or insane; when there are no visible marks of injury upon the body (the body itself not being deemed such a mark in case of death); when or while a member is in any degree under the influence of intoxicating liquor or liquors or of any narcotic or narcotics; when caused wholly or in part by reason of or in consequence of the use of intoxicating liquor or liquors or the use of any narcotic or narcotics; when caused wholly or in part by any bodily or mental infirmity or disease, dueling, fighting, or wrestling; when or while a member is acting as a sailor or soldier or is participating in war or riot; when or while a member is acting as an aviator or balloonist or is participating in aerial navigation or aeronautics of any kind either as a passenger, operator or assistant; when a member is participating in public or agreed automobile racing, or in wrecking, mining, blasting, or in the moving or transportation of gunpowder, dynamite, or other explosive substance or substances; when a member is murdered; when resulting from hazardous adventure or an altercation or quarrel; when there is a disappearance of a member; when the result of voluntary over-exertion ( unless in a humane effort to save a human life); when the result of voluntary or unnecessary exposure to danger or to obvious risk of injury.'\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A nice discrimination is maintained throughout the policy in suit between causes of the casualty and aggravations of the hazard. Thus, liability is excluded when the accident is 'the result' of voluntary overexertion, or 'the result' of voluntary or unnecessary exposure to danger, or when 'caused' by any bodily or mental infirmity or disease. There is no such insistence upon a causal sequence when the insurer is participating in a war or a riot, or in aeronautics or in the transportation of explosives. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v.

GROSJEAN(1934)\nNo. 355\nArgued: February 7, 1934Decided: March 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n Messrs. D. K. Woodward, Jr., of Austin, Tex., and Victor A. Sachse and H. Payne Breazeale, both of Baton Rouge, La., for appellant.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Peyton R. Sandoz and Justin C. Daspit, both of Baton Rouge, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant has contracts with the United States for the construction of levees in Louisiana to control the waters of \n\n[291 U.S. 466, 470]\n\u00a0\n the Mississippi river. It consumes much gasoline in the operation of machinery employed to do the work. It imports its supply from other states in carload lots and places it in a central tank from which distribution is made to other tanks located on its right of way in proximity to the machines. Appellee, an officer of Louisiana, is required to enforce the provisions of its statutes that impose an excise of 5 cents per gallon in respect of gasoline so imported and used. \n1\n The state Supreme Court has held that the exaction is an excise tax levied upon all gasoline or motor fuel sold, used, or consumed in the state (State v. Tri-State Company, 173 La. 682, 138 So. 507), and we accept that characterization. Claiming that these enactments are repugnant to several clauses of the Federal Constitution, appellant brought this suit to enjoin the collection of the tax in respect of the gasoline so used by it. A three judge court, having granted a temporary injunction, heard the case on the merits, upheld the tax, and dismissed the bill. (D.C.) 3 F.Supp. 785.\n The appellant seeks reversal on the ground that the contracts are federal means or instrumentalities; that the enactments referred to impose a direct burden upon them; \n\n[291 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n and that the state was without power to impose the tax. And on that basis it seeks to invoke the rule that, consistently with the Federal Constitution, a state may not tax the operations of an instrument employed by the government of the Union to carry its powers into operation. That principle, while not expressly stated in the Constitution, necessarily arises out of our dual government. It has often been given effect. \n2\n And reciprocally it safeguards every state against federal tax on its governmental agencies or operations. \n3\n Its application does not depend upon the amount of the exaction, the weight of the burden, or the extent of the resulting interference with sovereign independence. Where it applies, the principle is an absolute one wholly unaffected by matters or distinctions of degree. Indian Motorcycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 575\n, 51 S. Ct. 601, and cases cited. Its right application is essential to the orderly conduct of the national and the state governments and the attainment of justice as between them.\n The power granted by the commerce clause is undoubtedly broad enough to include construction and maintenance of levees in aid of navigation of the Mississippi \n\n[291 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n river and to authorize the performance of the work directly by government officers and employees or pursuant to contracts such as those awarded to appellant. The latter method was chosen and the validity of the challenged tax is to be tested on that basis. It is not laid upon the choice of means, the making of the contracts, the contracts themselves, or any transaction to which the federal government is a party or in which it is immediately or directly concerned. Nor is the exaction laid or dependent upon the amounts, gross or net, received by the contractor.

Unquestionably, as appellant here concedes, Louisiana is free to tax the machinery, storage tanks, tools, etc., that are used for the performance of the contracts. These things are as closely connected with the work as is the gasoline in respect of which is laid the excise in question. There is no room for any distinction between the plant so employed and the gasoline used to generate power. If the payment of state taxes imposed on the property and operations of appellant affects the federal government at all, it at most gives rise to a burden which is consequential and remote and not to one that is necessary, immediate or direct.

MATTHEWS(1934)\nNo. 441\nArgued: November 12, 1934Decided: December 3, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Thomas and Wm. L. Marbury, Jr., both of Baltimore, Md., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Charles F. Stein, Jr., and Frederick H. Hennighausen, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n July 30, 1925, one Warner gave petitioner, Mortgage Guarantee Company, a mortgage upon certain real estate in Baltimore, Md., to secure $3,000 loaned to him by that company. The mortgage instrument contained ordinary covenants concerning interest, insurance, taxes, etc. Also the following provision:\n'And the said mortgagor doth hereby declare his assent to the passing of a decree by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City or the Circuit Court No. 2 of the Baltimore City for a sale of the property hereby mortgaged in accordance with sections 720 to 732 inclusive of Chapter 123 of the laws of Maryland passed at the January session 1898 or any amendments or additions thereto.'\n\n In July, 1932, the mortgagee assigned to respondents, Mary and John Matthews, an undivided 500\/2950 interest in the unpaid portion of the debt-$ 2,950. \n\n[293 U.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n When the mortgage was executed, section 720, c. 123, Acts Md. 1898, was in force. It provided:\n'In all cases of conveyances of lands or hereditaments or of chattels real, or goods and chattels personal, situate in the said City, wherein the mortgagor shall declare his assent to the passing of a decree for the sale of the same, it shall be lawful for the mortgagee or his assigns at any time after filing the same to be recorded, to submit to either of the Circuit Courts of Baltimore City the said conveyances or copies thereof, under seal of the Superior Court; and the Circuit Court to which the same is so submitted, may thereupon forthwith decree that the mortgaged premises shall be sold at any one of the periods limited in said conveyances for the forfeiture of said mortgages or limited for a default of the mortgagors, and on such terms of sale as to the said court may seem proper, and shall appoint by said decree a trustee or trustees for making such sale, and shall require bond and security for the performance of the trust as is usual in cases of sales of mortgaged premises.' Article 4, Code Public Local Laws of Maryland (1930 Edition), entitled 'Baltimore City,' subtitle 'Mortgages,'  720.\n\n The Maryland Court of Appeals in Richardson v. Owings (1898) 86 Md. 663, 39 A. 100, construed the provisions of section 720, and ruled that one who owned part of a mortgage upon property in Baltimore, by proceeding under provisions of that section, might obtain the decree there provided for.\n There was no amendment or addition to section 720, until the passage of chapter 56, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.), approved December 15, 1933. That chapter provides:\n'Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That a new section be and the same is hereby added to Article 4 of the Code of Public Local Laws of Maryland (1930 Edition), title 'Baltimore City,' subtitle 'Mortgages,' said new section to be known as 720A \n\n[293 U.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n and to follow immediately after Section 720, and to read as follows:\n\n'720A. In all cases submitted to either of the Circuit Courts of Baltimore City for the passage of a decree as provided for in Section 720 aforesaid, no such decree shall hereafter be passed during the period of emergency hereinafter declared, unless such application is made or concurred in by the record holders of not less than 25% of the entire unpaid mortgage debt, it being hereby declared to be the intent of this Section during the period this Section is effective, that the holder or holders of a fractional interest in an entire mortgage debt of less than 25% of the entire interest, shall not have recourse to the summary and exparte remedies given under Section 720.'\n\n December 22, 1933, respondents, the Matthews, presented a petition to circuit court No. 2, Baltimore city, wherein they alleged execution of the mortgage by Warner, his assent to the passing of a decree for sale, the assignment of part of the mortgage debt to them, also default. They asked a decree directing sale as permitted by section 720.\n Thereupon the United States Mortgage Company, owner of the equity of redemption, and the Mortgage Guarantee Company, holder or duly authorized representative of approximately 83 per cent. of the unpaid mortgage debt, intervened. Answering, they relied upon chapter 56, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.), and opposed the prayed for decree. The Matthews then filed an amended petition challenging the validity of chapter 56, because of conflict with section 10, art. 1, Federal Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment; also because it violated the state Constitution.\n The trial judge held the chapter unconstitutional 'both as impairing the obligation of contract, and as class legislation of an arbitrary and illegal character.' Final decree ordered the sale of the mortgaged property and designated a trustee to make it. \n\n[293 U.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n Upon appeal the Court of Appeals (173 A. 903, 907) held:\n That the clause in the mortgage by which the mortgagor gave assent to decree for sale of the property as provided by section 720-732 'or any amendments or additions thereto,' when properly construed, did not amount to an agreement that the proceeding should be 'governed by any future amendments or additions to those sections which should become effective before the application for the consent decree,' but that 'the intention of the parties in employing that language embraced only such amendments or additions as had been made prior to the execution of the mortgage.'\n Also that chapter 56 impairs the obligation of the contract between the parties and therefore conflicts with article 1,  10, of the Federal Constitution, but is not subject to objection, 'on the ground that it is special legislation and denies the appellees the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and to similar provisions of the Constitution and Declaration of Rights of Maryland.'\n We agree that chapter 56 does not offend the Fourteenth Amendment by denying equal protection of the laws, and accept the reasons given to support that view: 'The classification thus made would seem clearly to have direct relation to the purpose which the Legislature had in mind, and which we cannot say was arbitrary or fanciful.'\n It is well-established doctrine that where the contract clause is invoked this Court must determine for itself the nature and effect of the alleged agreement and whether this has been impaired. Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., \n290 \nU.S. 163\n, 54 S.Ct. 134. Accordingly we must here decide what agreement resulted from the language employed by the parties to the mortgage.\n We cannot sanction the conclusion of the Court of Appeals on this point. The assent set forth in the mortgage was 'to the passing of a decree ... for a sale of \n\n[293 U.S. 232, 237]\n\u00a0\n the property hereby mortgaged in accordance with sections 720 to 732 inclusive of chapter 123 of the laws of Maryland passed at the January session 1898 or any amendments or additions thereto.' Prior to the mortgage, there had been no such amendment or addition, and it cannot, we think, be correctly said that 'the intention of the parties in employing that language embraced only such amendments or additions as had been made prior to the execution of the mortgage.' On the contrary, the words employed seem to us sufficient to embrace the amendments and additions thereafter made by chapter 56. A contrary holding would deprive the words employed of their customary meaning. And we find nothing which requires us to accept any other meaning.\n It follows that the challenged act cannot properly be said to impair the obligation of the agreement between the parties within the meaning of the Federal Constitution.\n The judgment under review must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for further action not in conflict with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. CHAMBERS(1934)\nNo. 659\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of North Carolina.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United states.\n\n\n\n[291 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Z. I. Walser, of High Point, N.C., and William M. Hendren, of Winston-Salem, N.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Clause Chambers and Byrum Gibson were indicted in the District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina for conspiring to violate the National Prohibition Act, and for possessing and transporting intoxicating liquor contrary to that act, in Rockingham county in that state. The indictment was filed on June 5, 1933. Chambers pleaded guilty, but prayer for judgment was continued until the December term. On December 6, 1933, the case was called for trial as to Gibson. Cham- \n\n[291 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n bers then filed a plea in abatement, and Gibson filed a demurrer to the indictment, each upon the ground that the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution deprived the court of jurisdiction to entertain further proceedings under the indictment. The District Judge sustained the contention and dismissed the indictment. The government appeals. 18 U.S.C.  682 (18 USCA  682).\n This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment1 of the Constitution of the United States, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, was consummated on December 5, 1933. Dillon v. Gloss, \n256 \nU.S. 368\n, 41 S.Ct. 510. Upon the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment, the Eighteenth Amendment at once became inoperative. Neither the Congress nor the courts could give it continued vitality. The National Prohibition Act, to the extent that its provisions rested upon the grant of authority to the Congress by the Eighteenth Amendment, immediately fell with the withdrawal by the people of the essential constitutional support. The continuance of the prosecution of the defendants after the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, for a violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA) alleged to have been committed in North Carolina, would involve an attempt to continue the application of the statutory \n\n[291 U.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n provisions after they had been deprived of force. This consequence is not altered by the fact that the crimes in question were alleged to have been committed while the National Prohibition Act was in effect. The continued prosecution necessarily depended upon the continued life of the statute which the prosecution seeks to apply. In case a statute is repealed or rendered inoperative, no further proceedings can be had to enforce it in pending prosecutions unless competent authority has kept the statute alive for that purpose.\n The decisions of this Court afford abundant illustration of this principle. In Yeaton (The General Pinkney) v. U.S., 5 Cranch, 281, 283, where the statute under which a ship had been condemned in admiralty had expired while the case was pending on appeal, the Court held that the cause was to be considered as if no sentence had been pronounced. Chief Justice Marshall said that 'it has long been settled, on general principles, that after the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force, unless some special provision be made for that purpose by statute.' Chief Justice Taney observed in Maryland v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co., 3 How. 534, 552: 'The repeal of the law imposing the penalty, is of itself a remission.' In United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 95, the Court thus stated the principle applicable to criminal proceedings: 'There can be no legal conviction, nor any valid judgment pronounced upon conviction, unless the law creating the offence be at the time in existence. By the repeal the legislative will is expressed that no further proceedings be had under the act repealed.' See, also, Norris v. Crocker, 13 How. 429, 440; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Rwy. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 506\n, 32 S.Ct. 542.\n The government endeavors to avoid the application of this established principle by invoking the general saving provision enacted by the Congress in relation to the \n\n[291 U.S. 217, 224]\n\u00a0\n repeal of statutes. That provision is to the effect that penalties and liabilities theretofore incurred are not to be extinguished by the repeal of a statute 'unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide,' and to support prosecutions in such cases the statute is to be treated as remaining in force. Rev. St.  13 (1 U.S.C.  29 (1 USCA  29)).2 But this provision applies, and could only apply, to the repeal of statutes by the Congress and to the exercise by the Congress of its undoubted authority to qualify its repeal and thus to keep in force its own enactments. It is a provision enacted in recognition of the principle that, unless the statute is so continued in force by competent authority, its repeal precludes further enforcement. The Congress, however, is powerless to expand or extend its constitutional authority. The Congress, while it could propose, could not adopt the constitutional amendment or vary the terms or effect of the amendment when adopted. The Twenty-First Amendment contained no saving clause as to prosecutions for offenses theretofore committed. The Congress might have proposed the amendment with such a saving clause, but it did not. The National Prohibition Act was not repealed by act of Congress, but was rendered inoperative, so far as authority to enact its provisions was derived from the Eighteenth Amendment, by the repeal, not by the Congress but by the people, of that amendment. The Twenty-First Amendment gave to the Congress no power to extend the operation of those provisions. We are of the opinion that in such a case the statutory provision relating to the repeal of statutes by the Congress has no application. \n\n[291 U.S. 217, 225]\n\u00a0\n The government cites decisions involving changes from territorial to state governments and recognizing the authority of the Congress to provide for the transfer of pending cases from territorial courts to the courts established within the new states. Pickett v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 456\n, 30 S.Ct. 265; United States v. Baum (C.C.) 74 F. 43. Compare Moore v. United States (C.C.A.) 85 F. 465. These decisions present no analogy to the instant case. As the function and jurisdiction of territorial courts would naturally terminate when a territory becomes a state, some provision for the transfer of pending business is necessary, and the Congress has adequate authority to that end. The Constitution authorizes the Congress to admit new states into the Union (article 4,  3, par. 1), and, also, to provide in the case of crimes, not committed within any state, for trial at such place as the Congress may direct (article 3,  2, par. 3). The Congress, in admitting a new state, may thus transfer 'jurisdiction in respect of local matters to state courts, and of civil and criminal business and jurisdiction arising under the laws of the United States to courts of the United States when they should come into existence.' Pickett v. United States, supra, at page 459 of 216 U.S., 30 S. Ct. 265, 267; Forsyth v. United States, 9 How. 571, 576, 577. In such cases, jurisdiction for the trial of pending criminal actions depends upon the provisions of the enabling act. Id. Provision in the enabling act for the vote of the people of the territory, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the new state and the adoption of its constitution, does not alter the fact that the state is admitted to the Union by the Congress under its constitutional authority. In the instant case, constitutional authority is lacking. Over the matter here in controversy, power has not been granted but has been taken away. The creator of the Congress has denied to it the authority it formerly possessed, and this denial, being unqualified, necessarily defeats any legislative attempt to extend that authority. \n\n[291 U.S. 217, 226]\n\u00a0\n Finally, the argument is pressed that the rule which is invoked is a common-law rule and is opposed to present public policy. We are told that the rule of construction, evidenced by the saving provision adopted by the Congress in relation to the repeal of statutes, is firmly entrenched, and attention is directed to corresponding statutory provisions in most of the states. But these state statutes themselves recognize the principle which would obtain in their absence. The question is not one of public policy which the courts may be considered free to declare, but of the continued efficacy of legislation in the face of controlling action of the people, the source of the power to enact and maintain it. It is not a question of the developing common law. It is a familiar maxim of the common law that, when the reason of a rule ceases, the rule also ceases. See Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212. But in the instant case the reason for the rule has not ceased. Prosecution for crimes is but an application or enforcement of the law, and, if the prosecution continues, the law must continue to vivify it. The law here sought to be applied was deprived of force by the people themselves as the inescapable effect of their repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. The principle involved is thus not archaic, but rather is continuing and vital-that the people are free to withdraw the authority they have conferred and, when withdrawn, neither the Congress nor the courts can assume the right to continue to exercise it.\n What we have said is applicable to prosecutions, including proceedings on appeal, continued or begun after the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment. We are not dealing with a case where final judgment was rendered prior to that ratification. Such a case would present a distinct question which is not before us.\n The judgment dismissing the indictment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article XXI of the Amendments of the Constitution provides as follows:\n'Section 1.

GUARANTY TRUST CO.(1934)\nNo. 120\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1934\n\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Justin Miller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Theodore Kiendl, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On September 5, 1929, the United States brought in the federal court for Southern New York this action to recover from the Guaranty Trust Company $160 with interest. That sum was claimed as damages resulting from the payment to the Trust Company, through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as fiscal agent of the United States, of a check, payable to Louis Macakanja drawn on the Treasury of the United States by the disbursing clerk of the United States Veterans' Bureau. The complaint alleged that the letter containing the check had been mailed to the payee in Yugoslavia, that neither the 'payee of said check nor any one on his behalf had ever received or endorsed the same'; and that 'the letter containing the check was taken or received in Jugoslavia by some person other than the payee thereof, and that thereafter the name of Louis Macakanja was written on the back of the said check by some person other than the payee thereof, and by a person who was not authorized to sign the name of said payee and who had no right, title or interest in and to said check, with pos- \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 343]\n\u00a0\n session thereof, and no right or authority to receive, endorse or dispose of the same.'\n The answer set up as a special defense that the 'check was negotiated and transferred in the Kingdom of Jugo-Slavia'; that under its law 'upon the negotiation and transfer of a check every transferee, if he takes without actual notice of any alleged forgery or other defect, in the absence of fraud or gross negligence, obtains a good title to the instrument, even if the endorsement of the payee is forged, and acquires the right to collect and retain the proceeds'; that 'each of the transferees of the check mentioned in the complaint gave valuable consideration and took without notice of any alleged forgery or other defect, and without fraud or negligence, and thereby obtained a good title to the instrument and acquired the right to collect and retain the proceeds'; and that the 'defendant under the law of Jugo-Slavia, duly obtained title to said check, as aforesaid, and duly collected and retained the proceeds.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 340, 344]\n\u00a0\n The case was tried before a jury. The evidence consisted of an agreement as to facts and the cancelled check. The agreement recited, among other things, that the purported indorsement of the payee was a forgery, made in Yugoslavia; that on or about November 30, 1921, the check was transferred and delivered there to the 'Merkur' Bank; that the 'Merkur' Bank duly indorsed the check and transferred it in Yugoslavia to the 'Slavenska' Bank; that the 'Slavenska' Bank indorsed and transferred the check in Yugoslavia to the Guaranty Trust Company and forwarded it by mail; that each of these banks paid a valuable consideration, received the check in good faith, took it without notice of the forgery or other defect, and was not guilty of any fraud or negligence; that 'the Treasurer of the United States upon receipt of said check paid the same by crediting the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the amount'; that, in December, 1921, that Bank credited the Trust Company with the amount; that the United States first learned of the forgery on or about April 27, 1926; and that on June 1, 1926, it requested, through the Federal Reserve Bank, reclamation from the defendant, which was denied.\n The check, dated October 29, 1921, was payable to the order of 'Louis Macakanja, 37 Sasava Kot Glina, Z. P. Maja, Yugoslavia.' When presented for payment, it bore what purported to be his indorsement made in the presence of two witnesses and a certification by the Municipal Administration of Maja to the effect that 'the holder \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n of the check is identical with the beneficiary thereof' and that the witnesses as well as the receiver of the money had subscribed the instrument. The check bore these further indorsements: \"Merkur' Banking and Exchange Business, Stanko Shon, Zagreb'; 'Pay to the order of Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, New York City, N.Y. Slavenska Bank D. D. Zagreb;' also the stamp of the Guaranty Trust Company. 'Previous Endorsements Guaranteed'; and the stamp of the Federal Reserve Bank.\n Each party moved for a directed verdict. The District Court directed a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $160 with interest from June 1, 1926; and entered judgment for that amount. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, 69 F.(2d) 799. This Court granted certiorari \n293 \nU.S. 538\n, 55 S.Ct. 81, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. The check was both drawn and payable in the District of Columbia. By the law of the District a forged indorsement of the payee is declared to be wholly inoperative. \n2\n Ordinarily, a subsequent bona fide holder for value without notice of the forgery would acquire neither title to the instrument nor the right to enforce payment; and would acquire no right to retain the proceeds if payment were made in ignorance of the forgery. But under settled principles of conflict of laws, adopted by both federal and state courts, the validity of a transfer of a chattel brought into a country by the consent of the \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n owner is governed by its law; and that rule applies to negotiable instruments.

Here, the rule is particularly applicable; for the Government, having made the check payable to one therein described as resident in Yugoslavia and having mailed it to his Yugoslavian address, must be deemed to have intended that it should be negotiated there, according to the law of that country. It was thereby given something of the quality of a foreign bill; although technically the check was delivered within the District when mailed there. Compare Koechlin et cie v. Kestenbaum Brothers, (1927) 1 K.B. 889; see Lorenzon, Conflict of Laws Relating to Bills and Notes (1919) p. 135, n. 267. The law of Yugoslavia provides that the transferee in due course acquires, despite the forgery, not only 'a good title to the instrument,' but also 'the right to collect and retain the proceeds thereof.' As the Government sent the check to Yugoslavia and the forged indorsement and the transfers of the check were made there, its law governs the validity of the transfer; and the banks acquired, at least, a good title to the check. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The Government contends that although the title to the check may have passed from the payee to the Trust Company, it acquired, as against the drawer, no right either to enforce payment or to retain the proceeds paid. The argument is that, since the check was both drawn and payable within the District, the obligation \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 347]\n\u00a0\n arising therefrom is governed by its laws; that under the law of the District the drawer agreed to pay the check only on the order of the payee; and that since there was no such order and the payment made was in ignorance of the forgery, the money may be recovered as having been paid under a mistake. The law of the District determines the formal and essential validity of the check, the interpretation of the contract, the incidents of the obligation. But the Trust Company does not attempt to enlarge or modify the obligation of the drawer as determined by the law of the District. The question presented is: Has the Trust Company, by acquiring title to the check, acquired the right to enforce the obligation which it represents? The enforcement does not contravene the public policy of the District. The question relates to the incidents of the transfer of title to a chattel; and, hence, is determined by the law of Yugoslavia. The Trust Company is not confronted with any procedural obstacle, like that presented in some jurisdictions where the transferee of a nonnegotiable cause of action seeks to sue thereon in his own name. Compare Harper v. Butler, 2 Pet. 239, 240. Nor is the Trust Company confronted by a divergent public policy of the forum, which forbids its courts from applying the Yugoslavian law. Compare Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15\n, 37 S.Ct. 366. Oscanyan v. Arms Co., \n103 U.S. 261\n, 277. Indeed, the courts of New York, where this suit was brought, would doubtless give effect to the rule of the foreign law here relied on. Compare Weissman v. Banque De Bruxelles, 254 N.Y. 488, 494, 173 N.E. 835.\n The Government argues that acquisition of the legal title to negotiable paper does not necessarily imply acquisition of a cause of action thereon. It is suggested that even an instrument properly endorsed by the payee so as to transfer the title may fail to confer any right to enforce the obligation of the maker, as where the cause of \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 348]\n\u00a0\n action had been lost by a discharge in bankruptcy; and that when the title to the instrument is transferred to a bona fide holder for value without an indorsement, or after maturity, the transferee may fail to acquire a right to enforce payment, because such paper is subject to any defense open as against the payee. But those rules have no application here. The discharge in bankruptcy operates upon the obligation represented by the check regardless of who the holder may be. The transferee without indorsement, or after maturity, acquires the rights which the payee had; and it is those rights only which the Trust Company asserts. To conclude that the forged indorsement was sufficient to pass legal title, but insufficient to transfer the right of the payee to collect the proceeds, would deprive the transfer of 'title' of all significance except as regards the right to retain a scrap of worthless paper. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The Government contends that irrespective of considerations discussed above, the Trust Company is liable because of its indorsement. The argument is that its indorsement, made when the check was presented for payment through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is an independent contract governed by the law of New York, Spies v. National City Bank, 174 N.Y. 222, 225, 66 N.E. 736, 61 L.R.A. 193; that, by the Negotiable Instrument Law of that state, the indorsement warrants, besides the title, the authenticity of penmanship of the payee or the authorization of the indorsement in his name;5 and that, if \n\n[293 U.S. 340, 349]\n\u00a0\n there be doubt as to the meaning and effect of an indorsement under the law of New York, there can be no doubt as to the Trust Company's obligation, because of the terms of its stamp: 'Prior endorsements guaranteed.' The express guaranty of prior indorsements means no more than what is implied by every unrestricted indorsement, namely, that the indorsements were effective to give to the holder a legal title and the right to enforce payment of the check.\n Fourth. The Government contends that it is entitled to recover because of exceptional rights conferred in express terms by regulations of the Treasury and of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A Treasury circular then in effect provided for the handling of Government checks by the Reserve Banks and branches 'subject to examination and payment by the Treasurer of the United States.' \n6\n A Reserve Bank circular recited: 'The Government has for many years exercised the right of returning at any time warrants and checks which for any cause have not been considered good, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of the United States as a condition of receiving government warrants and checks on the Treasurer of the United States from member banks or through the New York Clearing House reserves the right to charge back any such item and return the same at any time unconditionally to the institution from which it was received.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 340, 350]\n\u00a0\n The argument is that with knowledge of these regulations the check was presented by the Trust Company for payment through the Reserve Bank of New York, and sent by the Bank to the Treasurer of the United States; that the Treasurer paid the check by crediting the Reserve Bank with the amount and the Reserve Bank so credited the Trust Company; that the Trust Company was not obliged to avail itself of the facilities of the Reserve Bank; and that having done so with full knowledge of the regulation, it consented that the Government might charge back any such item and return the same at any time unconditionally. Closter National Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York (C.C.A.) 285 F. 138, 140, is cited as establishing this proposition. And it is suggested that, since the rule there declared is controlling no occasion exists for deciding the question of conflict of laws presented by the petition for certiorari. The rule declared in the Closter Case has no application here. 8 That case dealt solely with the relation between the holder of the check and the collecting agency employed. As against the United States, the rights of the holder of its checks drawn upon the Treasurer are the same as those accorded by commercial practice to the checks of private individuals. Compare United States v. National Exchange Bank, \n270 \nU.S. 527, 534\n, 46 S.Ct. 388; Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 579\n, 54 S.Ct. 840\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 340, 351]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, the Government expressly disclaimed the assertion of a preferred position. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Additional reasons are suggested for affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals: That the Government cannot recover on the guaranty of prior indorsements, because it has failed to show damage from the alleged breach. That it cannot recover the money as having been paid under a mistake, because it has failed to show 'that the defendant cannot retain the money with good conscience.' Compare United States v. Chase National Bank, \n252 \nU.S. 485, 495\n, 40 S.Ct. 361, 10 A.L.R. 1401. That recovery must be denied, regardless of the foreign law, because on the agreed facts, the Government is, under section 24 T. 22, of the Code of the District of Columbia 1929, 'precluded from setting up the forgery.' Compare Hortsman v. Henshaw, 11 How. 177. Since we sustain the special defense based on the law of Yugoslavia, we have no occasion to pass on these matters.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The law of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in reference to checks and bills of exchange according to the stipulation, was in 1921, and still is, as follows:\n'Upon the negotiation and transfer of a check or bill of exchange each transferee, endorse, or holder thereof obtains a good title to the instrument and acquires the right to collect and retain the proceeds thereof, even though the endorsement of the payee is forged where\n\n'(a) The instrument purports to bear a chain or series of endorsements from the payee of the instrument to the transferee, holder or endorsee thereof; and\n\n'(b) The said transferee, holder or endorsee gives valuable consideration for the instrument; and\n\n'(c) The said transferee, holder or endorsee takes the instrument without actual notice of any forgery or other defect in the instrument and is not guilty of any fraud or gross negligence in taking the instrument:\n\n'The law of Yugoslavia further provides that\n\n'(a) When an endorsement follows a blank endorsement there is a presumption of law that the person who executed the endorsement has acquired title to the instrument under the blank endorsement; and\n\n'(b) The transferee, holder or endorsee of the instrument is under no duty or obligation to investigate the genuineness of prior endorsements.\n\n'Under the law of Yugoslavia an endorser does not guarantee or warrant the genuineness of prior endorsements.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Code of Laws of the District of Columbia 1929, T. 22,  24, and also section 42 of the New York Negotiable Instruments Law provides: 'Where a signature is forged or made without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired through or under such signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare McClintick v.

Outlaw, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the Illinois Central Railroad Company and other railroad carriers, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, U.S.C. title 28,  47 (28 USCA  47), as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, U.S.C. title 28,  345 (28 USCA  345), to set aside, annul, and enjoin the enforcement of an amended order of the commission, made under section 3(e) of the Inland Waterways Corporation Act of June 3, 1924, c. 243, 43 Stat. 360, as amended, May 29, 1928, c. 891,  2, 45 Stat. 978 (49 USCA  153(e). That section provides that any person, etc., about to engage in conducting a common carrier service upon certain designated waters may, upon application to the commission, obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity in accordance with section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1); and that the commission 'shall thereupon, by order, direct all connecting common carriers and their connections to join with such water carrier in through routes and joint rates,' and shall, in such order, 'fix reasonable minimum differentials between all rail rates and joint rates in connection with said water service,' etc. The commission is further authorized to require the interested common carriers to enter into negotiations for the purpose of establishing equitable divisions \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n of these joint differential rates, and if they are unable to agree within a time specified in the act, the commission shall determine and establish reasonable divisions to become effective coincident with the effective date of the joint rates. The act further authorizes the commission, upon complaint, at once, and if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleading, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the reasonableness or lawfulness of any through route or joint rate filed pursuant to such order of the commission, etc., and after full hearings to 'make such order with reference to any such matters as it may find to be proper and in the public interest.' The burden of proof in such case is put upon the carrier or carriers making the complaint, and preference is to be given to the hearing and decision of the questions involved over all other questions pending before it, except where like preference is given by law; and the commission is directed to render a decision as speedily as possible.\n Upon application under this section, the commission, after a hearing confined to that application, granted to the American Barge Line Company, a certificate of public convenience and necessity, Application of American Barge Line Co., 182 I.C.C. 521; and thereupon, without further hearing, entered an order directing the interested carriers to establish through barge-rail routes and rates. Subsequently, in August or September, 1932, because of competition from unregulated truck and water carriers, the railroad carriers published all-rail carload rates on cotton lower than those previously in effect. These rates were further reduced in November, 1932. But the railroad carriers declined to join in joint water and rail rates; and, thereupon, the Barge Line sought from the commission supplemental orders requiring the establishment of rail-barge-rail rates between designated points. The rail \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n carriers opposed the application and requested a hearing before action by the commission. This hearing the commission refused, and entered an order requiring the rail carriers to join with the Barge Line in publishing specified rail-barge-rail rates on cotton in carloads. The order, particulars of which need not be stated, was issued December 10, 1932, to become effective on January 25, 1933, which time was afterwards extended to June 1, 1933, a period altogether of nearly six months from the date of issue.\n Appellees, on February 2, 1933, before the order had become effective, brought this suit and sought relief from the order, upon the grounds (1) that it was made without according them a full and fair hearing, and that section 3(e) of the statute (as amended), in so far as it authorizes the commission to make and enforce the order without such hearing, contravenes the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment; and (2) that it also constitutes a delegation to the commission of legislative power. The court below held with appellees upon the first ground, and entered a decree enjoining, setting aside, annulling, and suspending the order of the commission. 3 F.Supp. 1005\n\n\n 1. Assuming that the order in question, if enforced, would have the effect of depriving appellees of property or of property rights, we first inquire whether the statute, as interpreted and applied by the commission, does have the effect of denying appellants a full and fair hearing in respect of the matter prior to the enforcement of the order, and, consequently, fails to satisfy the constitutional requirement of due process of law. The provision of the statute that a certificate of public convenience and necessity to conduct a common carrier service upon the waters designated may be obtained upon application to the commission and thereupon the commission shall make the order described in the statute, undoubtedly empowers the commission to make the order, in the first instance, without a hearing. The commission, however, seems never to \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n have held that it is not obliged upon complaint to grant a full and fair hearing after the making of the order but before putting it into effect. And both in the briefs filed on behalf of appellants, including the United States and the commission, and in the argument at the bar, the position is definitely taken that the order is tentative and the rates prescribed thereby cannot be enforced without a hearing if properly sought by appellees. The brief for the Untied States and the commission quotes from the concurring opinion of Commissioner Brainerd in Ex parte 94 (Procedure Under Barge Line Act), 148 I.C.C. 129, 141, to this effect, and adopts it as the view of the government and the commission. Upon the oral argument, in response to a direct question from the bench, this view was reiterated by the Assistant Solicitor General, his statement in effect being that the commission is bound to grant the hearing upon complaint being made by the railway carriers, and pending such hearing to postpone the effective date of the order upon a showing which is not frivolous. The conclusion of Commissioner Brainerd, thus adopted, is that if the commission issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity and enter an order without hearing, directing the establishment of through routes and joint rates and fixing reasonable minimum differentials, and later, before said rates become effective, a complaint is filed by an interested carrier, 'it would then be our duty to hear said complaint and decide said matter before said rates become effective; that in the event such a hearing is not had and the matter disposed of before the effective date of said rates, it would be our further duty temporarily to suspend them until said matter is decided. ...' And he declared that this procedure would be necessary to comply with the requirements of due process of law.\n This is an admissible construction of the statutory provisions. That the order made by the commission upon \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n granting the certificate of public convenience and necessity is not final and conclusive is clear, since, by the affirmative provisions of the act, the railway carriers may file the through routes and joint rates pursuant to the preliminary order, and immediately, upon complaint, secure a full hearing from, and a plenary determination by, the commission. Pending that hearing, the commission is authorized to suspend the operation of the preliminary order for as long as seven months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Act March 4, 1927, U.S.C. title 49,  15(7), 49 USCA  15(7); and it is made clear by what has already been said that upon application and proper showing the commission would consider itself bound to take such action.\n The provisions of section 3(e) with which we are dealing were enacted by Congress in an avowed effort to bring about co-operation on the part of the rail carriers with the water carriers. The report of the House Committee on the proposed legislation (H. Rept. 1537, 70th Cong., 1st Sess ., pp. 5, 6) recites the necessity of overcoming opposition on the part of the rail carriers in respect of through routes, joint rates, etc., without interminable delay and the heavy expense necessary to carry on proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, as a necessary prerequisite to the realization of privately owned transportation service on the inland waterways of the country. Transportation Act 1920 (U.S.C. title 49,  142 ( 49 USCA  142)) declares the definite policy of Congress to be 'to promote, encourage, and develop water transportation, service, and facilities in connection with the commerce of the United States.' Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 29, 36\n, 47 S.Ct. 486, 488. In the light of the situation disclosed by this report and of the policy declared by the act just named, Congress evidently prescribed the course of procedure which section 3(e) (amended) requires. \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n Without attempting to lay down any general rule, but confining ourselves to the statute and case in hand, we accordingly hold that it was not essential, under the due process of law clause, that a hearing should be accorded in advance of the initiating order. It is enough that opportunity was given for a full and fair hearing before the order became operative. Since no routes or rates were in existence when the order was made, that order constituted the preliminary step toward their creation, equivalent, in essence, to an ex parte order on the carriers to show cause why the designated routes and rates should not be established. The effect of that order was simply to put upon the rail carriers the necessity, within a comparatively brief period, of either availing themselves of the right to file the routes and rates and appear and be heard in opposition thereto (the operation of the order in the meantime being held in abeyance ), or of suffering them to go into effect by default. The statute gives preference to the hearing and decision of the questions involved, and directs the commission to render a decision as speedily as possible. Congress evidently believed that the procedure thus prescribed would bring about an earlier settlement of the matter than otherwise would be the case. The various steps to be taken constitute parts of the administrative process which must be completed before the extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be invoked. Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 470\n, 471 S., 52 S.Ct. 617, 76 L.Ed.1226.\n The constitutional question raised by appellees, therefore, vanishes from the case, because the commission concedes and stands ready to grant every administrative procedural right that appellees are lawfully entitled to claim. If the preliminary order be erroneous in any particular, it is susceptible of correction by the commission upon the hearing thus provided for. It will be time enough for appellees to seek the aid of a court of equity when they \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n shall have fully availed themselves of this administrative remedy, and the commission shall have taken adverse action. Until then they are in no situation to invoke judicial action.\n The provision of the statute which puts the burden of proof upon the carriers is not inconsistent with the due process clause of the Constitution. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 199\n, 43 S.Ct. 270; Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n193 \nU.S. 53, 63\n, 24 S.Ct. 396.\n\n 2. \nThe precise ground upon which appellees place their contention that the statute is invalid as constituting a delegation of legislative power is not entirely clear. Undoubtedly, the statute furnishes a sufficient primary standard to govern the action of the commission; and this appellees do not dispute. Their contention, as set forth in their brief, is that the only rule of decision laid down in section 3(e) (as amended 49 USCA  153(e) is that the through routes, rates, and differentials to be established must be reasonable and lawful, and 'such reasonableness and lawfulness can be determined only by a full and fair hearing, and the establishment of rates and routes and differentials without such hearing constitutes necessarily an exercise by the Commission of pure legislative power.' Since the government and the commission concede that a full and fair hearing must be accorded before the order becomes effective, this objection to the statute, as a distinct ground, necessarily falls.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result.\n The statute, in words, authorizes the commission to grant a hearing as to the reasonableness and lawfulness of the proposed rates and divisions, if complaint is filed, and the commission has plenary power, upon consideration of the complaint, to postpone the effective date of \n\n[291 U.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n the order and to suspend the rates after the order becomes effective. Section 15(7), as amended March 4, 1927, and section 16(6), Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15(7), 16(6).\n As respondents have failed to invoke these administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the commission, it seems plain that their rights, constitutional or otherwise, have not been infringed, and I see no occasion for speculation as to what the statutory duty of the commission may be in the event a complaint is filed, or to resort to concessions of counsel in brief and argument to define that duty, or to suggest that the statute falls short of constitutional requirements if it fails to command the administrative action which it permits. The mere power, unexercised, to withhold constitutional right is not a denial of it. It is enough that respondents have filed no complaint with the commission designed to secure a hearing. Before administrative action which respondents may invoke, but have not, it cannot be said that there is any infringement of their constitutional rights to a hearing or to protection from the rates pending a hearing. Compare Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. City of Seattle, 290 U.S. --, 54 S.Ct. 383, 78 L.Ed. --, decided February 5, 1934; Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 470\n, 471 S., 52 S.Ct. 617.\n Further, there is no intimation in the record that upon resort to the administrative remedies which the statute permits any relief to which respondents are justly and equitably entitled will be withheld. And there is no contention that the proposed rates will not yield a fair return or that they otherwise infringe constitutional rights. At most it appears that the interest sought to be protected is a prospective share in future traffic which it is feared may be diverted to the Barge Line, an interest to which the Constitution plainly affords no protection. Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 44 S.Ct. 72; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768, 780\n, 49 S.Ct. 494; Sprunt & Son, Inc., v.

Norris, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent Willard Storage Battery Co.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are actions at law brought-in one instance against the United States and in two against a revenue collector-to recover in each instance money alleged to have been erroneously and illegally exacted as an excise tax-under subdivision 3 of section 900 of the Revenue Acts of 19181 and 19212 and subdivision 3 of section 600 of the \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 390]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 19243-from the plaintiff, a corporate manufacturer, on sales by it of articles which the revenue officers regarded as automobile parts or accessories.\n In No 1714 the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff $20,017.58 with interest and denied a counterclaim interposed by the United States. In No. 1965 the District Court for the District of Connecticut gave the plaintiff judgments on three claims6 for $329,250.00, $170,470.36, and $98,416.41 with interest on each sum; and the judgments were reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n7\n In No. 3298 the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio rendered judgments for the plaintiff on five claims9 for $ 89,195.36, $249,275.32, $189,853.88, $173,934.45, and $41,764.57 with interest on each sum; and the judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n10\n The cases are here on certiorari.\n After the taxes were collected, timely applications for refund were duly made by the plaintiffs, and the applications were denied. The actions were brought within the time generally limited therefor,11 but not prior to April 30, 1928\n\n\n The applications for refund and the actions proceeded on the theory that the sales were not taxable under the Revenue Acts because the articles sold were not automobile parts or accessories within the meaning of those acts, \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 391]\n\u00a0\n and not on the theory that the amount collected was in excess of what was properly collectible on taxable sales.\n In each case the court's authority to entertain the action and the plaintiff's right to recover were challenged in various ways as precluded by section 424 of the Revenue Act of 1928,12 which provides:\n'Sec. 424. Refund of Automobile Accessories Tax.\n\n'(a) No refund shall be made of any amount paid by or collected from any manufacturer, producer, or importer in respect of the tax imposed by subdivision (3) of section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924, or subdivision ( 3) of section 900 of the Revenue Act of 1921 or of the Revenue Act of 1918, unless either-\n\n'(1) Pursuant to a judgment of a court in an action duly begun prior to April 30, 1928; or\n\n'(2) It is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such amount was in excess of the amount properly payable upon the sale or lease of an article subject to tax, or that such amount was not collected, directly or indirectly, from the purchaser or lessee, or that such amount, although collected from the purchaser or lessee, was returned to him; or\n\n'(3) The Commissioner certifies to the proper disbursing officer that such manufacturer, producer, or importer has filed with the Commissioner, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, a bond in such sum and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the immediate repayment to the United States of such portion of the amount refunded as is not distributed by such manufacturer, producer, or importer, within six months after the date of the payment of the refund, to the persons who purchased for purposes of consumption (whether from such manufacturer, producer, importer, or from any other person) the articles in respect of which \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 392]\n\u00a0\n the refund is made, as evidenced by the affidavits (in such form and containing such statements as the Commissioner may prescribe) of such purchasers, and that such bond, in the case of a claim allowed after February 28, 1927, was filed before the allowance of the claim by the Commissioner.'\n\n As respects actions brought on or after April 30, 1928, to recover taxes charged to have been wholly invalid and not merely in excess of what was lawful, which is the situation here, the construction and application of section 424, particularly subdivision (a)(2), are matters about which there has been much contrariety of opinion, as is shown in three lines of decision.\n The decisions in the first line regard subdivision (a)(2) as committing all claims for the refunding of taxes of the class in question here to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for final determination and precluding any examination of such claims in the courts. This view has been taken by District Judges in two cases13 and by a Circuit Judge in a dissenting opinion in another case. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The decisions in the second line are to the effect that the subdivision relates to administrative action by the Commissioner, but not to proceedings in the courts, and leaves a taxpayer who has applied to the Commissioner unsuccessfully free to sue on his claim and the courts free to entertain the suit and adjudicate the claim-as could be and commonly was done before section 424 was enacted-save that under that section a judgment for the taxpayer in a suit brought on or after April 30, 1928, does not become obligatory or entitle him to the refund \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 393]\n\u00a0\n awarded by the judgment, unless and until (y) he satisfies the Commissioner that the tax was not collected directly or indirectly from the purchasers of the articles sold, or if so collected has been returned to the purchasers, or (z) gives the bond described in subdivision (a)(3). Such has been the ruling in two cases. In one the ruling was by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,15 and the Circuit Court of Appeals for that circuit substantially sustained it, and in that connection said,16 'This section clearly refers to a 'refund' of taxes by the Commissioner, and nowhere refers to the plaintiff's right of action to recover taxes by litigation nor to the jurisdiction of the court. In other words, this section is an administrative measure for the guidance of the Commissioner in the 'refund' of taxes, and does not purport to contain any provision prescribing conditions under which taxes may be collected by means of a suit.' The other case is No. 329 now under review, where the ruling was by the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio17 and was fully sustained by the \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 394]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals for that circuit, as is shown by the following excerpts from its opinion. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n'Section 424(a) deals not with rights of action, but with limitations upon the power of the commissioner to make refunds. Its provisions are not in conflict with the general provisions of law authoarizing suits for refund of taxes. (Citing cases.)\n\n'We agree with the authorities above cited, not only in reliance upon familiar principles governing repeal by implication, but also because the section appears to us to have an obvious literal meaning perfectly applicable to refunds by the commissioner after judicial determination of the legality of the tax. ...\n\n'If the claim for refund is made pursuant to a judgment of the court in an action begun prior to April 30, 1928, the commissioner is not forbidden to refund under the applicable statute, and this may well be without qualification, although this we are not required to decide. Failing to bring himself within the condition of paragraph 1, because of not having pursued his claim to judgment in an action begun prior to the critical date, the taxpayer must establish to the satisfaction of the commissioner ... (b) that such amount was not collected directly or indirectly from the purchasers, or (c) that such amount, although collected from the purchasers, was returned to them.'\n\n The decisions in the third line, like those in the second, regard the subdivision as neither cutting off the right of \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 395]\n\u00a0\n a taxpayer to sue for a refund after applying unsuccessfully to the Commissioner nor abrogating the authority of the courts to entertain the suit. But, unlike those in the second, they regard the subdivision as substantively limiting the right to a refund of taxes of the designated class to instances where the taxpayer either has not directly or indirectly collected the tax from the purchaser or after so collecting it has returned it to him. In other words, they regard the subdivision as making this substantive limitation and element of the right to a refund of such taxes, and therefore as requiring that this element, like others, be satisfactorily established in any proceedings where an asserted right to a refund is presented for examination and determination, whether the proceeding be before the Commissioner or be a suit brought after an application to him has been unavailing. The Court of Claims has so ruled in two cases,19 one being No. 171 now under review; and the District Court for the District of Connecticut came to a like conclusion in No. 19620 also now under review.\n We are of opinion that ther view taken in the third line of decisions is right.\n When section 424 was enacted, the internal revenue laws contained many related provisions constituting what this Court has termed a comprehensive 'system of corrective justice' in respect of the assessment and collection of erroneous or illegal taxes. \n21\n A summary of this system- it still is part of the internal revenue laws-will portray it sufficiently for present purposes. Anterior to collection the Commissioner possesses exclusive authority to revise, correct, or reject assessments and the courts are forbidden \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 396]\n\u00a0\n to entertain suits 'to restrain the assessment or collection.' After collection, aggrieved taxpayers are accorded a limited time within which to apply for refunds, and the Commissioner is authorized to grant the applications where the taxes are shown to have been erroneous or illegal; but a denial by him is not final. If the application is either denied or not acted on by the Commissioner, the taxpayer is accorded a fixed period within which to bring suit for a refund against the United States or the Collector who received the tax, and, if in the suit he establishes that the tax was erroneous or invalid, that it was paid by him, and that his claim has been duly and seasonably presented and prosecuted, he is entitled to judgment for a refund of the amount paid with interest. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n As a general rule where the legislation dealing with a particular subject consists of a system of related general provisions indicative of a settled policy, new enactments of a fragmentary nature on that subject are to be taken as intended to fit into the existing system and to be carried into effect conformably to it, excepting as a different purpose is plainly shown. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n That rule is applicable here. The existing system developed through long years of experience comprehends the entire subject, including all claims for refund. Section 424 is a new enactment and relates to a designated class of such claims, concededly within the scope of the exist- \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 397]\n\u00a0\n ing system. Obviously the section is intended to make some change as respects the particular class and must be given effect accordingly; but to determine what change is intended it must be examined in the light of the existing system.\n As respects claims of the designated class section 424 plainly prescribes, in subdivision (a)(2), an additional substantive element of the right to a refund-the additional element being that the taxpayer has not directly or indirectly collected the tax from the purchaser, or, after so collecting it, has returned it to him, so that the burden of the tax has been borne by the taxpayer and not the purchaser. Of subdivision (a)(3) it suffices to observe that it enables a taxpayer who has not borne the burden of the tax but has collected it from purchasers, and so is not entitled to a refund under subdivision (a)(2), to obtain from the Commissioner a qualified refund by giving a bond promptly to use the amount refunded in reimbursing the purchasers. No such bond has been given in the cases now before us and in all the right to judgment for a refund is rested on other facts independently of that.\n Apart from the change already described we think subdivision (a)(2) discloses no purpose to depart from the existing system. It does not purport to commit the decision of claims for refund exclusively to the Commissioner, or to give finality to his denials, or to take from aggrieved claimants the right to sue on their claims after denial or inaction by him, or to withdraw from the courts the power to entertain such suits. As to these matters, therefore, the rules prescribed in the existing system remain, as before, both applicable and controlling.\n The clause in that subdivision saying the additional element to which it relates is to be 'established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner' is much relied on; but we think it does not require a different conclusion. Only \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 398]\n\u00a0\n by inadmissible straining could it be held to invest the Commissioner with absolute authority or discretion in respect of such refunds. A more rational view is that it is largely admonitive and means that the additional element is not lightly to be inferred but to be established by proof which convinces in the sense of inducing belief. Such words often are so construed where applied to one who, like the Commissioner, is charged with the duty of ascertaining a matter of fact as a basis for further action. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n While the clause speaks only of the Commissioner, this becomes of minor significance when it is reflected that under the existing system he is the one to whom all claims for refund must be presented and on whom the duty of making an examination and decision is primarily placed, and that it doubtless was assumed-rightly we think-that under that system a taxpayer could by suit secure a judicial re-examination of his claim, and, if he did, the claim necessarily would be judged by the same substantive standards as if it were before the Commissioner. We say 'necessarily,' because subdivision (a)(2) says at the outset 'No refund shall be made of any amount paid ... unless,' etc., and thus shows that it is to be applied by all who examine and determine claims for refunds-the courts as well as the Commissioner.\n This view of the words 'established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner's has support in a long continued practice under a similar provision in a customs law of 186425 under which certain customs duties, if paid under protest, were to be refunded to the importer when 'shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treas- \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 399]\n\u00a0\n ury' to have been excessive. That provision remained in force many years, 26 and during that period was uniformly treated as neither investing the Secretary with final authority nor putting aside general provisions permitting suits for refunds, but as leaving the importer free, after an unavailing appeal to the Secretary, to sue under the general provisions and obtain a judicial re-examination of his claim. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n Some reliance is placed on Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S.Ct. 587; but that case is not in point. It was a suit for the refunding of excess-profits and war-profits taxes assessed under section 301 of the Revenue Act of 1918, and the question presented was whether in such a suit a refusal by the Commissioner to make a special assessment under sections 327(a) and (d) and 328 was open to re-examination. In answering the question in the negative, this Court referred to the purpose with which those sections provide for a special assessment, the language employed in expressing the conditions under which it is to be made, and the prescribed procedure; pointed out that the task involved is one requiring technical or special knowledge and experience in respect of such tax problems and ready access to data in the Bureau of Internal Revenue relating to a large group of taxpayers; and held that these exceptional conditions enforce the conclusion that Congress intended to confide the task to the Commissioner, subject only to a review by the Board of Tax Appeals where a direct appeal to that body is permitted, and thereby to exclude a re-examination in the courts such as in other situations is had in suits for refunds. It is very plain that no such excep- \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 400]\n\u00a0\n tional conditions are involved in giving effect to subdivision (a)(2) of section 424.\n As to effect to be given to that subdivision in suits for refunds, we are of opinion that, as it makes the right to a refund to depend on an additional element-that the taxpayer has not collected the tax, directly or indirectly, from the purchaser, or, if it was so collected, has returned it to him-the courts in adjudicating claims of the designated class are under a duty to give effect to the subdivision by regarding the additional element as a matter to be shown by suitable allegation and established by appropriate proof, like other elements of such a right or cause of action, and by determining the sufficiency of pleadings and evidence accordingly. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n We cannot assent to the view that a court may give a judgment awarding the taxpayer a refund without inquiring whether he has borne the burden of the tax or has reimbursed himself by collecting it from the purchaser. That view rests on two untenable premises-one that the question whether the burden of the tax has thus been borne by the taxpayer is solely for administrative solution, and the other that a judgment for a refund may be given subject to the condition that it is to become obligatory and be given effect only if and when the claimant proves to the Commissioner that he alone has borne the burden of the tax. Our reasons for rejecting the first premise already have been shown. Those for rejecting the other will be shortly stated. A judgment so conditioned is merely a finding that the tax paid by the claimant was invalid, coupled with a declaration that it should be refunded to him if he proves to the Commissioner that in other respects he is entitled to it. Decisions of this Court have long since established that it is not within the province of courts created by or under the judiciary article of \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 401]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution to give or review judgments of that character, for they are not final or binding adjudications. \n29\n The District Courts are created and exist under that article. While the Court of Claims is created under a different article, the statute defining its jurisdiction of suits for refunds and those defining the jurisdiction of the District Courts are alike, in that both contemplate that the judgments in such suits shall fully and finally determine whether the claimants are entitled to the refunds for which they sue.\n The contention is made that subdivision (a)(2), when construed and applied as we hold it should be, infringes the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution in that it strikes down rights accrued theretofore and still subsisting, but not sued on prior to April 30, 1928. This contention is pertinent, because the cases now being considered were begun after April 30, 1928, and in each the tax in question was paid before section 424 was enacted, which was May 29, 1928.\n If the tax was erroneous and illegal, as is alleged, it must be conceded that, under the system then in force, there accrued to the taxpayer when he paid the tax a right to have it refunded without any showing as to whether he bore the burden of the tax or shifted it to the purchasers. And it must be conceded also that section 424 applies to rights accrued theretofore and still subsisting, but not sued on prior to April 30, 1928, and subjects them to the restriction that the taxpayer (a) must show that he alone has borne the burden of the tax, or (b), if he has shifted the burden to the purchasers, must give a bond promptly to use the refunded sum in reimbursing \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 402]\n\u00a0\n them. But it cannot be conceded that in imposing this restriction the section strikes down prior rights, or does more than to require that it be shown or made certain that the money when refunded will go to the one who has borne the burden of the illegal tax, and therefore is entitled in justice and good conscience to such relief. This plainly is but another way of providing that the money shall go to the one who has been the actual sufferer and therefore is the real party in interest.\n We do not perceive in the restriction any infringement of due process of law. If the taxpayer has borne the burden of the tax, he readily can show it; and certainly there is nothing arbitrary in requiring that he make such a showing. If he has shifted the burden to the purchasers, they and not he have been the actual sufferers and are the real parties in interest; and in such a situation there is nothing arbitrary in requiring, as a condition to refunding the tax to him, that he give a bond to use the refunded money in reimbursing them. Statutes made applicable to existing claims or causes of action and requiring that suits be brought by the real rather than the nominal party in interest have been uniformly sustained when challenged as infringing the contract and due process clauses of the Constitution.\n The present contention is particularly faulty in that it overlooks the fact that the statutes providing for refunds and for suits on claims therefor proceed on the same equitable principles that underlie an action in assumpsit for money had and received. Of such an action it rightly has been said:30\n'This is often called an equitable action and is less restricted and fettered by technical rules and formalities \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 403]\n\u00a0\n than any other form of action. It aims at the abstract justice of the case, and looks solely to the inquiry, whether the defendant holds money, which ex aequo et bono belongs to the plaintiff. It was encouraged and, to a great extent, brought into use by that great and just judge, Lord Mansfield, and from his day to the present, has been constantly resorted to in all cases coming within its broad principles. It approaches nearer to a bill in equity than any other common law action.'\n\n As our conclusion respecting the operation of subdivision (a)(2) is applicable both where the suit for a refund is against the United States and where it is against the collector, there is no need for considering the arguments advanced concerning the power of Congress to condition or withdraw the consent of the United States to be sued. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n We come now to consider and dispose of the three cases and to apply to them our conclusions respecting the construction and operation of subdivision (a)(2) of section 424. \n No. 171.\n\n In the petition the plaintiff alleged that it absorbed the taxes in question and paid the same from its own funds; that no other person or persons paid the same either directly or indirectly; and that no other person or persons has any right either at law or in equity to the refund sought or any part of it. The defendant's answer was a general traverse accompanied by a counterclaim based on an alleged allowance and payment to the plaintiff, through error and mistake, of certain claims for the re- \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 404]\n\u00a0\n funding of like taxes aggregating $69,264.66. The Court of Claims made special findings of fact whereon it gave judgment for the plaintiff. The findings show that the taxes in question were assessed on sales by the plaintiff of ignition coils which the revenue officers regarded as parts or accessories for automobiles, but which the court regarded as equally adapted to other uses not comprehended in the taxing acts; and that the taxing period in question began with May, 1919, and continued to the end of February, 1926. Pertinent portions of the findings are as follows:\n'7. For the taxable period in question ... plaintiff, in the sale of ignition coils, invoiced its catalogue prices to all customers, and did not add thereto any amounts representing excise taxes, or collect from its customers amounts additional to the catalogue prices. The catalogue prices so invoiced and collected were transferred by plaintiff to its general ledger account in totals without separation into any elements, such as tax, charges for parcel post, insurance. The excise tax which it considered payable was set up in an additional account styled 'Excise Tax Expense.'\n\n'8. For a part of the taxable period in question plaintiff made on its invoices to customers certain notations with respect to the excise tax which it considered applicable.\n\n'Up to May 19, 1923, plaintiff made no such notations on its invoices to customers.\n\n'Beginning May 19, 1923, up to December 29, 1925, it was plaintiff's practice to note on its invoices to customers the following: 'On automotive accessories 1\/21 of amount indicated herein equals 5% excise tax. 20\/21 of amount indicated equal price,' during the period when the 5% tax rate was in effect, and substantially the same notation during the period when the 2 1\/2% rate was in effect, '1\/21' being changed to '1\/41' and '20\/21' to \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 405]\n\u00a0\n '40\/41'. It does not definitely appear what the practice was thereafter as to notations on invoices.\n\n'9. Plaintiff's catalogue prices were not increased or decreased by reason of the imposition of the excise tax on automobile parts or accessories.\n\n'10. It is not possible from the state of the record to determine the amount of excise tax paid for the period when plaintiff made the aforesaid tax notations on invoices sent to its customers.'\n\n These findings, which are all that bear on the question of who paid the taxes and bore the burden thereof, are wanting in precision and apparently conflicting. If findings 7 and 9 were not otherwise qualified, they might be regarded as meaning that the sales were at catalogue prices and that these prices did not include, and the purchasers did not pay, the tax or any part of it. But finding 8 makes it at least doubtful that findings 7 and 9 have that meaning, for it is plainly inferable from finding 8 that during much of the taxing period the plaintiff sold on invoices bearing notations indicating that when the tax was 5 per cent. of the selling price 1\/21 of the amount shown on the invoice represented the tax and 20\/21 represented the selling price; and that when the tax was 2 1\/2 per cent. of the selling price the fractions were changed to 1\/41 and 40\/41. The findings leave it uncertain whether the plaintiff in making its returns to the revenue officers gave the amount shown on the invoices or 20\/21 (later 40\/41) of that amount as the selling price; and they also leave it uncertain on which basis the tax was computed. If by its invoices the plaintiff represented to its purchasers that the amount shown thereon included the tax as well as the selling price, and if it returned that amount less the tax as the selling price, and caused the tax to be computed on that basis, it cannot be heard to say, in the absence of other controlling circumstances of which there is no \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 406]\n\u00a0\n finding, that it did not collect the tax from the purchasers but itself bore the burden thereof.\n Because of the uncertainty and apparent conflict in the findings, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Claims for a new trial and full and specific findings.\n No. 196.\n This case comprises three separate suits, designated in the District Court as Nos. 3360, 3371 and 3421, which were tried together and, after judgments for the plaintiff, were consolidated for purposes of appeal. They were tried to the court under a stipulation in writing waiving a jury. The court made special findings of fact on which it based its judgments. In the complaints the plaintiff alleged that the tax was not paid directly or indirectly by the purchasers, but entirely by the plaintiff; that the sales were at a flat price and no amount for the tax was included therein; and that the plaintiff absorbed the tax. These allegations and some others were denied by the defendant in his answer. In various ways the defendant challenged the plaintiff's right to sue for a refund and the court's power to entertain such a suit, the challenge being grounded on subdivision (a)( 2) of section 424; and the court held the challenge was not tenable. At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant moved for judgments thereon in his favor, and the motion was denied.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals re-examined the evidence, concluded therefrom, contrary to the findings of the District Court, that the articles on sales of which the tax was assessed were accessories for the taxable vehicles enumerated in the taxing acts, and on that ground sustained the tax and reversed the judgments, without considering the rulings relating to subdivision (a)(2) of section 424.\n The questions presented for consideration here are those involved in the rulings of the District Court and that involved in the reversal by the Circuit Court of Appeals on \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 407]\n\u00a0\n a re-examination of the evidence. The challenge of the plaintiff's right to sue for a refund and of the court's power to entertain such a suit was rightly overruled. This is sufficiently shown in the earlier part of this opinion. Whether the District Court erred in denying the defendant's motion at the conclusion of the evidence for judgments thereon in his favor must be determined by ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence fairly tending to establish every element of the plaintiff's causes of action. We think there was such evidence. There was conflict in it; parts of it admitted of diverging inferences; and as to some matters the preponderating weight was difficult of ascertainment. But these were all matters for the trial court to determine. It was exercising the functions of a jury and its findings are on the same plane as if embodied in a jury's special verdict. 32 We are accordingly of opinion that the motion was rightfully overruled, and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in not so holding. Even if there was some basis for thinking the weight of the evidence was with the defendant, as was strongly urged at our bar, it was not within the province of that court to re-examine the evidence and reverse the judgments because of what it regarded as error of fact. \n33\n\u00a0\n\n Whether the special findings give the requisite support to the judgments rendered thereon is a different question and is one which is open to consideration here. \n34\n The findings are long and the view which we take of one of them makes it unnecessary to state the others. The one relates to the matter made essential by subdivision (a)(2) of section 424, and is the only finding on the subject. It reads as follows: \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 408]\n\u00a0\n 'Paragraph 5 of the complaint alleged that the taxes in question were paid entirely by the plaintiff, and neither directly nor indirectly by the plaintiff's purchasers. These allegations also were denied.\n'As to this issue, I find that for the taxable period involved in case No. 3371, the plaintiff has sustained the burden of proof. The evidence on this issue relating to the periods involved in cases Nos. 3360 and 3421, disclosed that the plaintiff at some time during the period between January 1 and December 31, 1923, reduced its sale prices by the amount of the tax and so stamped its invoices and bills as to indicate that of the amount charged to the customer 1\/21 part was required by the sales tax in question. Thereafter the plaintiff computed and paid the excise tax upon the basis of the price thus reduced, thereby saving to itself the payment of a tax upon a tax, 5 per cent on 5 per cent. The arrangement cost the customer nothing, as he paid in the aggregate just what he had paid before. Consequently the plaintiff did not thereby pass the economic burden of the tax to its purchasers. However, since under this arrangement the invoices indicated the 1\/21 of the amount billed was for the tax, I am constrained to conclude that the balance, 20\/21, was the real sale price, especially since the tax was thereafter paid on that basis. This requires the conclusion of fact that in legal effect the tax was collected from the purchaser. But in view of the fact that the sales prices in vogue prior to the inauguration of this arrangement were thereafter reduced by the amount of the tax, I find further that in so far as the tax was collected from purchasers, it was wholly returned to them.'\n\n Saying that the plaintiff has sustained the burden of proof as to the designated issue in suit No. 3371 is not an adequate finding of the matters of fact involved in that issue, particularly where, as here, the subject is new and may admit of differing opinions. It is in the nature of a \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 409]\n\u00a0\n legal conclusion rather than a finding of the underlying facts, and we think it does not adequately respond to the issue and is not sufficient to support the judgment which rests on it.\n That which follows relates to suits Nos. 3360 and 3421 and evidently means that the plaintiff by its invoices was indicating to the purchasers that 1\/21 of the amount it was collecting from them represented the tax on the sales and 20\/21 represented its 'real sales price'; and that the plaintiff itself computed the tax on the basis of this 'real sales price' and thereafter paid the tax as so computed, thereby saving to itself the difference between the tax resulting from that computation and the tax which would have resulted had the full amount collected from the purchasers been used as the basis for the computation. If that be what is meant, the court rightly concluded that the tax was collected from the purchasers. It is of no importance that the prior sales price had been reduced by the amount of the tax, for under the taxing act the tax was to be computed on the price for which the articles actually were sold and not on some prior and discarded price. But the court's further conclusion that, as the price theretofore in vogue was reduced by the amount of the tax, the plaintiff in effect returned to the purchasers the tax it collected from them-because they got the articles for a price which was that much less than it would have been had the prior sales price been still in vogue- is shown by its mere statement to be not a finding of fact but unsatisfactory reasoning having little tendency to establish its objective. That conclusion must therefore be disregarded. It results that the finding, while showing that the plaintiff collected the tax from the purchasers, does not show whether it returned the tax to them. Thus the finding does not adequately respond to the issue arising on the plaintiff's allegation that it absored the \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 410]\n\u00a0\n tax-for, having collected it from them, the plaintiff could absorb it only by returning it to them. With that matter left in this situation the finding plainly does not support the judgments which rest on it.\n As the judgments of the District Court in the three suits must be reversed because of insufficiencies in the special findings, and as the reversal by the Circuit Court of Appeals was put on an untenable ground, we deem it the better course to enter here a judgment reversing the judgments of both courts and remanding the suits to the District Court with a direction to vacate its findings and grant a new trial in each suit.\n No. 329.\n This case comprises five separate suits which were tried together and, after judgments for the plaintiff, were consolidated for purposes of appeal. The trial was to the court under a written stipulation waiving a jury. The court made special findings and based its judgments on them. At the outset the plaintiff's right to recover on the facts stated in the petitions was challenged by the defendant by motions to dismiss and the motions were overruled. There were also motions at the close of the evidence for judgments thereon in favor of the defendant which also were overruled. These rulings and the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgments are the matters presented for consideration here. There was neither allegation nor proof that the plaintiff had not collected the tax from the purchasers, or after so collecting it had returned it to them; and, of course, there was no finding on the subject. The suits proceeded throughout as if that question was one for administrative solution after judgment, if the plaintiff prevailed. What we have said in the earlier part of this opinion shows that this was a mistaken theory. The judgments in both courts \n\n[291 U.S. 386, 411]\n\u00a0\n below must be reversed accordingly and the causes remanded to the District Court with directions to set aside the findings, and to sustain the motions to dismiss-but without prejudice to the exercise by that court of its discretion in permitting amendments of the petitions.\n Our conclusions in Nos. 171, 196, and 329 when summarized require that the judgments in all be reversed and the causes remanded with directions as before indicated.\n Judgments reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] C. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1122. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] C. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 291.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] C. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 322 (26 USCA  881 note). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 77 Ct.Cl. 199; 2 F.Supp. 778. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 58 F.(2d) 246, 248. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Each claim was asserted in a separate suit, but the suits were tried together and after judgment were consolidated for purposes of appeal. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 63 F.(2d) 783. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] For opinion overruling motion to dismiss action see 8 Am.Fed.

After the hearing on the merits the court, in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, said:\n'The objection to the court's jurisdiction founded on sec. 424 ... has heretofore been ruled on. There is an error in that opinion where it is said that any refund after judgment would be pursuant to sub (3) of sec. 424 and would be conditional and for the benefit of consumers. If refunds are made, they may be under either sub (2) or (3), depending upon whether the plaintiff bore the tax or passed it on, etc. Those are matters for the Commissioner to decide; the court has nothing to do with them, and no evidence respecting them was offered.\n\n'According to two recent decisions of the Court of Claims ... the absence of such evidence should prevent recovery. But with great respect, I am unable to agree with the holdings on that point. I still think it is for the Commissioner alone to determine the facts necessary to be established as the basis of refunds under either sub (2) or (3). Where as here, taxes on sales not taxable have been collected, then on proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioner 'that such amount was not collected, directly, or indirectly, from the purchaser or lessee, or if collected has been returned, they may be refunded.'\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Routzahn, Collector, v.

PROVIDENT TRUST CO.(1934)\nNo. 224\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1934\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph Carson, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[291 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Provident Trust Company is the administrator, with will annexed, of the estate of the deceased, who died in 1921, leaving a will thereafter duly admitted to probate. Subsequent to the filing of the federal estate tax return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue imposed an additional estate tax, amounting with interest to something over $21,000. The trust company paid the amount, and filed a claim for refund of $18,404.05, on the ground \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n that under the provisions of the will the value of the residuary estate, less the value of the life estate of the daughter of deceased, should have been but was not allowed as a deduction from the gross estate. The Commissioner rejected the claim, and this action was brought.\n The will, after making certain bequests, devised the remainder of the estate to the trust company, in trust to pay the income thereof to deceased's daughter during her natural life, and upon her death to her lawful issue; and further provided that, upon the death of the daughter without issue, the testator's residuary estate should be distributed among designated charitable institutions and societies-all belonging to that class of organizations, bequests to which are deductible from the gross estate under the provisions of  403(a)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1098. At the time of deceased's death, the daughter was fifty years of age. She had been in poor health and under a physician's care; and on February 9, 1914, upon medical advice, an operation was performed removing her uterus, Fallopian tubes, and both ovaries. The court below specifically found: 'The operation and removal of the organs were necessary to prevent further impairment of her health. After the operation she could not have become pregnant nor could she have given birth to a child. She died on March 12, 1927, unmarried, and without ever having given birth to a child.' Following her death, a state orphans' court awarded the residue of the estate, subject to payment of transfer or inheritance taxes which might be due, to the charitable organizations named in the will.\n Upon the foregoing facts, the court below held that respondent was entitled to recover, and accordingly awarded judgment in the sum of $17, 204.66. (Ct. Cl.) 2 F.Supp. 472. \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 281]\n\u00a0\n Section 403(a)(3), supra, so far as it is pertinent here, provides that, for the purpose of determining the value of the net estate to be taxed, there shall be deducted from the value of the gross estate '(3) The amount of all bequests, ... to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. ...' Article 53, Treasury Regulations 37, declares that the amount of the deduction in such case is the value at the date of decedent's death of the remainder interest in the money or property which is devised or bequeathed to charity. Compare Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 151\n, 49 S.Ct. 291. It follows that, in making a deduction for that interest, the value thereof must be determined from data available at the time of the death of decedent. Compare Humes v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 487, 494\n, 48 S.Ct. 347.\n The government contended in the court below, as it contends here, that, in view of the restriction in respect of issue contained in the will, the value could not be thus determined, since the law, without regard to the fact, conclusively presumes that a woman is capable of bearing children as long as she lives; and that this presumption controls where the organs of reproduction have been completely removed and inability to bear children admits of no valid dispute no less than where the question turns upon the circumstance of age alone, or upon conflicting evidence or medical opinions. The lower court held otherwise, for the reason that the facts established, as of the date of decedent's death, forbade any other conclusion than that the daughter was incapable of bearing children, and a presumption to the contrary could not be indulged.\n The rule in respect of irrebuttable presumptions rests upon grounds of expediency or policy so compelling in character as to override the generally fundamental re- \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 282]\n\u00a0\n quirement of our system of law that questions of fact must be resolved according to the proof. Mr. Best, writing more than ninety years ago when the force of the rule was more strictly regarded than it has come to be since, said that modern courts of justice (that is to say, the courts of that day) were slow to recognize presumptions as irrebuttable, and were disposed to restrict rather than extend the number.\n'Many presumptions,' he says, 'which, in earlier times, were deemed absolute and irrebuttable, have, by the opinion of later judges, acting on more enlarged experience, either been ranged among praesumptiones juris tantu m, or considered as presumptions of fact, to be made at the discretion of a jury. ... By an arbitrary rule, to preclude a party from adducing evidence which, if received, would compel a decision in his favour, is an act which can only be justified by the clearest expediency and soundest policy; and it must be confessed that there are several presumptions still retained in this class which never ought to have found their way into it, and which, it is to be feared, often operate seriously to the defeat of justice.' Best, Presumptions of Law and Fact (London, 1844),  18.\n\n Certainly the world has gained in experience since that was written; and the binding effect, in respect of particular situations, of the ancient rule precluding proof of facts to the end of avoiding supposed injurious results thought to be of greater consequence than the predominance of truth over error, still remains a proper subject of judicial inquiry to be made and resolved in the light of such further experience and knowledge. Compare Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, decided December 11, 1933\n\n\n The foregoing observations are peculiarly apposite to the phase of the subject now under review; for, as suggested by counsel for respondent, the presumption here \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 283]\n\u00a0\n involved had its origin at a time when medical knowledge was meager, and many centuries before the discovery of anaesthetics and, consequently, before surgical operations of the kind here involved became practicable. It was not until a comparatively recent period, therefore, that the effect of such an operation was disclosed to observation, and the incontrovertible fact recognized that a woman subjected thereto was permanently incapable of bearing children.\n The government argues that the rule is one of substantive law, and evidence to overcome it is inadmissible. Whether in particular instances so-called irrebuttable presumptions are, in a more accurate sense, rules of substantive law rather than true presumptions, is a matter in respect of which a good deal has been said by modern commentators on the law of evidence. 2 Chamberlayne on Evidence,  1086, 1087, 1159 et seq.; 5 Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  2492. Compare Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 328\n, 329 S., 52 S.Ct. 358; 2 Thayer, Evidence, 351, 352, 540, 541, 545, 546. But it is unnecessary to consider that interesting distinction, since, as will appear, the presumption in question in this instance must be dealt with as open to rebuttal and therefore, in any aspect of the matter, as a true presumption.\n The presumption generally has been held to be conclusive when the element of age alone is involved, albeit Lord Coke's view that the law seeth no impossibility of issue, even though both husband and wife be an hundred years old (Coke on Littleton, 551; 2 Blackstone Commentaries 125), if now asserted for the first time, might well be put aside as a rhetorical extravagance. But the presumption, even where age alone is involved, has not been universally upheld as conclusive or applied under all circumstances. It has been followed to a greater extent in this country than in England, though even here \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 284]\n\u00a0\n exceptional cases are to be found;1 and in England such cases are very numerous. \n2\n It does not seem necessary to review the decisions in either jurisdiction. It is enough to say that the English courts have treated the rule as possessing a considerable degree of flexibility, and have refused to give it a conclusive effect in a large number of cases; while the American courts, adhering to a more rigid view, have applied the rule more generally. See extended note, 67 A.L.R. 538 et seq., where the decisions are classified and digested. Few cases have arisen where elements other than, or in addition to, that of age were present, and the conclusive character of the rule in such cases is by no means established. Thus in Hill v. Spencer, 196 Ill. 65, 70, 63 N.E. 614, 616, the Supreme Court of Illinois held meaningless an allegation that a woman was past the age of child bearing, but was careful to add, 'unless more than a mere matter of age is stated in the bill.' See Denver, etc., Railway v. Harris, supra, note 1. And, speaking generally, this court has said (Lincoln v. French, \n105 U.S. 614\n, 617): 'But all presumptions as to matters of fact, capable of ocular or tangible proof, such as the execution of a deed, are in their nature disputable. No conclusive character attaches to them. They may always be rebutted and overthrown.'\n The basis for the interposition of an irrebuttable presumption is embodied in the general statement of Mr. \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 285]\n\u00a0\n Wigmore, quoted by the court below, that evidence of certain kinds of facts is excluded 'because its admission would injure some other cause more than it would help the cause of truth, and because the avoidance of that injury is considered of more consequence than the possible harm to the cause of truth.' 1 Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  11. Relating this obviously correct view to the presumption here invoked, not only do we perceive no grounds of expediency or policy that call for its hard and fast application to a particular physical condition, when ignorance has been supplanted by knowledge so as to put beyond the range of doubt the destructive effect of that condition upon the capacity for childbearing, but we conclude affirmatively that the policy of the statute under review as applied to the case in hand is quite to the contrary.\n The important point to be emphasized is that the question arises with respect to a surgical operation, the inevitably destructive effect of which upon the power of procreation is established by tangible and irrefutable proof. Moreover, the case does not involve the rule against perpetuities, the devolution of property, the rights or title of living persons in or to property, or any other situation such as constituted the background of practically all the decisions which have sustained the conclusiveness of the presumption. We have for consideration simply a statutory provision exempting from a prescribed tax the value of all bequests, etc., made to or for the use of charitable organizations and those which are akin, plainly evincing a legislative policy to encourage such bequests. Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 63\n, 44 S.Ct. 293. And, in that view, we well may assume that Congress could not have meant to leave its aim to be diverted by a purely arbitrary presumption, which, whether applicable or not to sustain another or different policy, would deny the \n\n[291 U.S. 272, 286]\n\u00a0\n truth and subvert the policy of this particular legislation. Compare Humes v. United States, supra, at page 494 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 347.\n The sole question to be considered is, What is the value of the interest to be saved from the tax' That is a practical question, not concluded by the presumption invoked, but to be determined by ascertaining in terms of money what the property constituting that interest would bring in the market, subject to such uncertainty as ordinarily attaches to such an inquiry. See Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, supra. Thus stated, the birth of a child to the daughter of the deceased after his death was so plainly impossible that, as a practical matter, the hazard disappears from the problem. Certainly, in the light of our present accurate knowledge in respect of the subject, if the interest had been offered for sale in the open market during the daughter's lifetime, a suggestion of the possibility of such an event would have been ignored by every intelligent bidder as utterly destitute of reason.\n The judgment of the court below is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Male v.

(a) declares that any person required to make return who willfully fails so to do shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; paragraph (b) that any person who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over any tax, and any person who willfully attempts to evade or defeat any tax, shall be guilty of felony; and paragraph (c) that 'the term 'person' as used in this section includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.' 26 USCA  2146 (a-c).\n Section 701 (26 USCA  2701) provides: 'When used in this chapter the term 'person' means an individual, a trust or estate, a part- \n\n[293 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n nership, or a corporation'; also 'the terms 'includes' and 'including' when used in a definition contained in this chapter shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.'\n Applicable portions of the act are copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n An indictment, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, charged appellee, Troy, with violating section 146, par. (b), of the act (26 USCA  2146(b), in that while president of the Troy Oil Company, Incorporated, he unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly attempted to defeat and evade a large part of the tax due from that corporation for 1929, by making a return for it which \n\n[293 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n falsely stated the gross income. The indictment was challenged because 'it fails to set forth that the defendant was under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurred and in the absence of this averment the indictment fails to set forth facts showing prima facie, a commission of the crime charged in the indictment.' The trial judge sustained the objection and quashed the indictment. In his view it was necessary that there should be allegation and proof that appellee, as president of the corporation, was under a duty to make the return.\n This was error; the questioned judgment must be reversed.\n Section 146, par. (a), penalizes any person required to make a return who willfully fails so to do; paragraph (b) any person under duty to collect, account for, and pay over any tax who willfully fails, also any person (without regard to duty) who willfully attempts to defeat the tax; and paragraph (c) declares that the term person as used in the section shall include an officer under duty to perform, etc.\n Considering these paragraphs along with the definitions of section 701, it seems sufficiently clear Congress did not intend that paragraph (c) should exclude from paragraph (b) one who actually attempted to defeat. If the charge against appellee had been failure to make return, or pay over the tax of for the corporation, it might have been neces- \n\n[293 U.S. 58, 62]\n\u00a0\n sary to allege and show some duty in respect thereto; but, when charged with willful effort to defeat the tax by presenting a false return, no allegation of duty to make the return was necessary. The alleged act sufficiently indicated appellee's criminal intent. Certainly we can find no legislative purpose to exempt from punishment one who actively endeavors to defeat a tax. And because some officers are said to be included in the term 'person,' all other individuals are not necessarily excluded.\n Thus construed, all parts of the statute may have effect, and the manifest purpose of Congress will not be obstructed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 808, 855, 878,  52, 146, 701 (26 USCA  2052, 2146, 2701).\n Sec. 52.

CITY OF ST. PETERSBURG, FLA.(1934)\nNo. 627\nArgued: March 12, 1934Decided: April 2, 1934\n\n\n\n On\nAppeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Florida.\n * Rehearing denied \n292 \nU.S. 604\n, 54 S.Ct. 712, 78 L.Ed. --. \n\n[292 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lloyd D. Martin, of St. Petersburg, Fla., for appellants.\n Mr. W. F. Way, of St. Petersburg, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants complain that assessments have been so laid upon their lands as to constitute a denial of due process of law. United States Constitution, Amendment 14.\n On April 20, 1925, the city commission of St. Petersburg, Fla., adopted a resolution for the grading and paving of certain streets and alleys, including First Ave- \n\n[292 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n nue North from Forty-Sixth street to Dusston, the abutting property to be assessed for the expense of the improvement 'in accordance with the benefits derived therefrom.'\n On August 16, 1926, the city accepted the work on First avenue, which had been completed by the contractor, and directed that the cost ($40,937. 46) be spread over the abutting parcels in proportion to the frontage.\n On September 6, 1926, the commission, pursuant to notice duly published, met for the purpose of receiving complaints in respect of the assessments, and, no complaints being received, the assessments were confirmed. The applicable statute provides that 'all persons who fail to object to the proposed assessments in the manner herein provided, shall be deemed to have consented to and approved the same.' Chapter 9914, Special Acts of 1923,  13.\n The commission, before confirming the assessments, had voted an issue of bonds, which were general obligations of the city, the proceeds to be used to make payments to contractors during the progress of the work. Chapter 9914, Special Acts of 1923,  17. The amount of the issue was 70 per cent. of the estimated cost of the improvement of all the streets, First avenue and others. The bonds were to be met at their maturity out of the proceeds of the special assessments, which were set apart as a separate fund. Sections 2, 17. If the fund turned out to be inadequate, the deficiency due upon the bonds was to be collected through general taxes like other city obligations. Section 2.\n On August 11, 1930, the city authorities levied an ad valorem tax on all the taxable property in the city to make good a deficiency which had then been ascertained; the tax being at the rate of 14 1\/2 mills on each dollar of assessed valuation of property of every kind.\n In 1929, and again in 1931, statutes were enacted confirming the assessments and curing any irregularities in the process of laying them. Chapter 14392, Special Acts of 1929; chapter 15511, Special Acts of 1931. \n\n[292 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n The appellants, who are property owners on First avenue within the area of the improvement, brought this suit in or about April, 1931, to set aside the special assessment and also the lien of the general tax. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, and the suit dismissed. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the decree, holding in its opinion that the applicable statutes did not infringe the immunities secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, and further that through laches and acquiescence, as well as through a failure to take advantage of other statutory remedies, the appellants were 'estopped' from maintaining the suit. 149 So. 806. Upon an appeal to this court the question of jurisdiction was postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n\n 1. \nThe appellants contend that the special assessment is invalid under the Constitution of the United States, for the reason that the resolution voting the improvement was adopted without an opportunity to landowners to be heard in opposition. This does not present a substantial federal question. Cf. Levering & G. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 108\n, 53 S.Ct. 549; Minneapolis, St. Paul & S. Ste. M.R. Co. v. C. L. Merrick Co., \n254 \nU.S. 376\n, 41 S.Ct. 142. There is no constitutional privilege to be heard in opposition at the launching of a project which may end in an assessment. It is enough that a hearing is permitted before the imposition of the assessment as a charge upon the land (Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Risty, \n276 \nU.S. 567\n, 48 S.Ct. 396; Londoner v. City & County of Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 378\n, 28 S. Ct. 708; Goodrich v. Detroit, \n184 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 22 S.Ct. 397), or in proceedings for collection afterwards (Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108, \n111 \nU.S. 701\n, 4 S.Ct. 663; Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526, 537\n, 16 S.Ct. 83; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165\n, 39 S.Ct. 62).\n This court will not listen to an objection that the charge has been laid in an arbitrary manner when an administrative remedy for the correction of defects or inequalities has been given by the statute and ignored by the objector. \n\n[292 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel District, \n262 \nU.S. 710, 723\n, 43 S.Ct. 694; Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 \nU.S. 7\n, 40 S.Ct. 271; Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461\n, 52 S.Ct. 617\n\n\n 2. On the assumption that a hearing was unnecessary in advance of the improvement, the appellants, none the less, contend that the later hearing provided for in advance of the assessment is so restricted in its scope as to be an illusory protection. There would be difficulty in framing a remedy more comprehensive than that given by the statute if it is to be taken at its face value. The owner 'may appear at the time and place fixed for the said hearing and object to the proposed assessment against the property, or to the amount thereof.' Section 13. 'The Governing Authority of the Municipality shall hear and determine all objections and protests to the proposed assessments under such reasonable rules and regulations as it may adopt.' Section 13. If the protest is overruled, the owner within thirty days thereafter may contest 'the legality' of the assessment by action in the courts. Section 15. On its face, the remedy thus supplied is plenary and adequate. What the appellants really claim is this, that the remedy, though adequate on its face, is made inadequate by provisions of the Florida Constitution, which are said to condemn it. We do not elaborate the argument, for the conflict, if there is any, between the statute regulating this improvement and the local Constitution must be adjudged, not by us, but by the courts of the locality. The landowners have had abundant opportunity to bring the conflict to a test. They have let the hour go by. They did not appear before the commission and either affirm or deny its jurisdiction. They stayed out of the proceeding altogether. When the assessment had been laid and they were suing to set it aside, they did not challenge the validity of the administrative remedy by the allegations of their bill. So far as the record shows, they did not even challenge it in argument when the case was heard \n\n[292 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n upon appeal. If the point was made, it was not accepted. If omitted, it was waived.\n The supposed defects in the scope of the administrative remedy do not present a substantial question within the federal jurisdiction.\n\n 3. \nThe appellants do not confine themselves to a challenge of the special assessment in their assault upon the statute; they urge the objection also that the levy of a general tax to make up the deficiency in the fund for the payment of the bonds is invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because the bonds were issued without notice to the taxpayers. But notice was unnecessary. The argument to the contrary goes counter to so many decisions that it must be condemned as unsubstantial. The distinction is fundamental between the incurring of the indebtedness and the imposition of the lien. Roberts v. Richland Irrigation District, \n289 \nU.S. 71\n, 53 S.Ct. 519; St. L. & S.W.R. Co. v. Nattin, \n277 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 48 S.Ct. 438; French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324\n, 21 S.Ct. 625; Webster v. Fargo, \n181 \nU.S. 394, 398\n, 21 S.Ct. 623, 645, 916; Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Risty, supra.\n\n 4. \nFinally, the appellants are barred, or so the Supreme Court of Florida has held, by laches and estoppel. They stood by without opposition while the property was improved. They refrained from making use of remedies, both administrative and judicial, that were ready to their call. For nearly five years they held aloof without word or act of protest, and then invoked the aid of equity. Following Abell v. Town of Boynton, 95 Fla. 984, 117 So. 507, and other state decisions, the Supreme Court of Florida withheld an equitable remedy from suitors who had slept upon their rights. By force of that ruling, the decree of the state court rests upon a nonfederal ground broad enough to support it. Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S.Ct. 318. Our jurisdiction therefore fails. Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., supra; Pierce v.

THOMAS(1934)\nNo. 856\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1934\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas. \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry M. Armistead, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellants.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Kenneth W. Coulter and Harry Robinson, both of Little Rock, Ark., for appellee.\n\n\n[292 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, Mrs. W. D. Thomas, and her husband, Ralph Thomas, were engaged in business as copartners in Little Rock, Arkansas, under the name of Enterprise Harness Company. The became indebted for the rent of premises leased o the partnership by appellant, W. B. Worthen Company, Agent. On August 31, 1932, judgment for the amount thus due ($1,200), with interest, was recovered against both partners. Ralph Thomas died on March 5, 1933. Thereupon, on March 10, 1933, a writ of garnishment was served upon the Missouri State Life Insurance Company alleging the indebtedness of that Company to Mrs. Thomas, in the sum of $5,000 as the beneficiary of a policy of insurance upon the life of Ralph Thomas. The service of the writ, under the laws of Arkansas, created a lien upon the indebtedness. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n A few days later, on March 16, 1933, the Legislature of Arkansas passed an act (Act No. 102 (p. 321) of the Laws of 1933) providing as follows: 'All moneys paid or payable to any resident of this state as the insured or beneficiary designated under any insurance policy or policies providing for the payment of life, sick, accident and\/or disability benefits shall be exempt from liability or seizure under judicial process of any court, and shall not be subjected to the payment \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n of any debt by contract or otherwise by any writ, order, judgment, or decree of any court, provided, that the validity of any sale, assignment, mortgage, pledge or hypothecation of any policy of insurance or if any avails, proceeds or benefits thereof, now made, or hereafter made, shall in no way be affected by the provisions of this act.'\n Appellee, on April 5, 1933, filed a motion to dismiss the writ of garnishment and for the purpose of scheduling the money owing to her by the Insurance Company as being exempt from seizure under judicial process. On April 6, 1933, the Insurance Company answered the garnishment, admitting its indebtedness. The court then ordered the payment of $2,000 into its registry as sufficient to cover appellant's claim and released the garnishee from further liability. Appellant responded to the motion to dismiss the garnishment, and to the claim of exemption, by insisting that Act No. 102 (p. 321) of the Laws of 1933, if so applied, contravened article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States by impairing the obligation of appellant's contract. The court of first instance overruling that contention, and holding the insurance moneys to be free from all judicial process, dismissed the garnishment and granted the schedule of exemption. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 65 S.W.(2d) 917. The constitutional question was again urged by petition for rehearing, which was denied. The case comes here on appeal.\n\n 1. \nThere is no question that the state court gave effect to the Act of 1933, and we are not concerned with any earlier state statute in relation to policies of insurance. \n2\n The debt of the wife herself, as a member of a business partnership, is involved. We have not been referred to any \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n statute of Arkansas, existing prior to the firm's contract and to the incurring by appellee of the debt in question, which in such a case, either by the terms of the statute or by the construction of it by the state court, precluded resort to insurance moneys such as those in question. \n3\n The state court has mentioned none. On the contrary, the state court recognized the greater breadth of the Act of 1933, as compared with earlier statutes, and its controlling operation, and with this recognition sustained and applied it. \n4\n 'The only question,' said the court, 'for determination here is the constitutionality of Act No. 102 (p. 321) of 1933, approved March 16, 1933.'\n\n 2. \nThe exemption created by the Act of 1933, as to the avails of life insurance policies, is unlimited. There is no limitation of amount, however large. Nor is there any limitation as to beneficiaries, if they are residents of the State. There is no restriction with respect to particular circumstances or relations. 'All moneys paid or payable' to any resident of the State 'as the insured or beneficiary designated' under any life insurance policy, are exempted 'from liability or seizure under judicial process' and 'shall not be subjected to the payment of any debt.' The profits of a business, if invested in life insurance, may thus be withdrawn from the pursuit of creditors to whatever extent desired. No conditions are imposed, save that assignees, mortgagees, or pledgees of policies are protected.\n Such an exemption, applied in the case of debts owing before the exemption was created by the Legislature, constitutes an unwarrantable interference with the obliga- \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n tion of contracts in violation of the constitutional provision. Gunn v. Barry, 15 Wall. 610, 622, 623; Edwards v. Kearzey, \n96 U.S. 595\n, 604; Bank of Minden v. Clement, \n256 \nU.S. 126, 129\n, 41 S. Ct. 408. Chief Justice Marshall, in Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 198, observed that: 'It is not true that the parties have in view only the property in possession when the contract is formed, or that its obligation does not extend to future acquisitions. Industry, talents, and integrity, constitute a fund which is as confidently trusted as property itself. Future acquisitions are, therefore, liable for contracts; and to release them from this liability impairs their obligation.' This principle was applied to an exemption of insurance moneys, in relation to antecedent debts, in Bank of Minden v. Clement, supra. The argument of appellee that a judgment is not in itself a contract within the constitutional protection,5 and that it is competent for the State to alter or modify forms of remedies, is unavailing. The judgment and garnishment in the instant case afforded the appropriate means of enforcing the contractual obligations of the firm of which appellee was a member and the statute altered substantial rights. Gunn v. Barry, supra; Edwards v. Kearzey, supra; Fisk v. Police Jury of Jefferson, \n116 \nU.S. 131, 134\n, 6 S.Ct. 329; Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 430\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481\n\n\n 3. The Legislature sought to justify the exemption by reference to the emergency which was found to exist. But the legislation was not limited to the emergency and set up no conditions apposite to emergency relief.\n We held in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, page 434 et seq. of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 231, that the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of the obligation of contracts did not make it impossible for the State, in the exercise of its essential reserved power, to protect the vital interests \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n of its people. The exercise of that reserved power has repeatedly been sustained by this Court as against a literalism in the construction of the contract clause which would make it destructive of the public interest by depriving the State of its prerogative of self-protection. We held that this reserved protective power extended not only to legislation to safeguard the public health, public safety, and public morals, and to prevent injurious practices in business subject to legislative regulation, despite interference with existing contracts-an exercise of the State's necessary authority which has had frequent illustration-but also to those extraordinary conditions in which a public disaster calls for temporary relief. We said that the constitutional prohibition should not be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity such as fire, flood or earthquake, and that the State's protective power could not be said to be nonexistent when the urgent public need demanding relief was produced by other and economic causes. But we also held that this essential reserved power of the State must be construed in harmony with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation, and that this principle precluded a construction which would permit the State to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them. We held that when the exercise of the reserved power of the State, in order to meet public need because of a pressing public disaster, relates to the enforcement of existing contracts, that action must be limited by reasonable conditions appropriate to the emergency. This is but the application of the familiar principle that the relief afforded must have reasonable relation to the legitimate end to which the State is entitled to direct its legislation. Accordingly, in the case of Blaisdell, we sustained the Minnesota mortgage moratorium \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n law in the light of the temporary and conditional relief which the legislation granted. We found that relief to be reasonable, from the standpoint of both mortgagor and mortgagee, and to be limited to the exigency to which the legislation was addressed.\n In the instant case, the relief sought to be afforded is neither temporary nor conditional. In placing insurance moneys beyond the reach of existing creditors, the Act contains no limitations as to time, amount, circumstances, or need. We find the legislation, as here applied, to be a clear violation of the constitutional restriction.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER and I concur unreservedly in the judgment of the court holding the Arkansas statute void as in contravention of the contract impairment clause of the federal Constitution. We concur thus specially because we are unable to agree with the view set forth in the opinion that the differences between the Arkansas statute and the Minnesota mortgage moratorium law, which was upheld as constitutional in the Blaisdell Case, are substantial. On the contrary, we are of opinion that the two statutes are governed by the same principles and the differences found to exist are without significance, so far as the question of constitutionality is concerned. The reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion in the Blaisdell Case, and the long line of cases previously decided by this court there cited, fully support this conclusion. We were unable then, as we are now, to concur in the view that an emergency can ever justify, or, what is really the same thing, can ever furnish an occasion for justifying, a nullification of the constitutional restriction \n\n[292 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n upon state power in respect of the impairment of contractual obligations. Acceptance of such a view takes us beyond the fixed and secure boundaries of the fundamental law into a precarious fringe of extraconstitutional territory in which no real boundaries exist. We reject as unsound and dangerous doctrine, threatening the stability of the deliberately framed and wise provisions of the Constitution, the notion that violations of those provisions may be measured by the length of time they are to continue r the extent of the infraction, and that only those of long duration or of large importance are to be held bad. Such was not the intention of those who framed and adopted that instrument. The power of this court is not to amend but only to expound the Constitution as an agency of the sovereign people who made it and who alone have authority to alter or unmake it. We do not possess the benevolent power to compare and contrast infringements of the Constitution and condemn them when they are long-lived or great or unqualified, and condone them when they are temporary or small or conditioned. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Desha v.

The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that a 'master' is not a 'seaman' within the meaning of the statute. The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the judgment for the owner. 334 Mo. 396, 67 S.W.(2d) 47. The case is here on certiorari. \n292 \nU.S. 617\n, 54 S.Ct. 641\n\n\n The statute is set forth at large in opinions of this Court. Panama R. Co. v.

It gives to 'any seaman' injured in the course of his employment and in case of the death of such seaman to his personal representatives, a cause of action similar to that given by the statutes of the United States to railway employees. In the enforcement of the statute a policy of liberal construction announced at the beginning has been steadily maintained. Early in the history of the act, the question came up whether it gave a remedy to stevedores. We decided that it did. 'It is true that for most purposes, as the word is commonly used, stevedores are not 'seamen.\" International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 47 S.Ct. 19. None the less, verbal niceties were bent to the overmastering purpose of the act to give protection to workers injured upon ships. 'Words,' we said, 'are \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 157]\n\u00a0\n flexible.' International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, supra, at page 52 of 272 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 19. Later decisions of this Court have been conceived in a like spirit (Jamison v. Encarnacion, \n281 \nU.S. 635\n, 50 S.Ct. 440; Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., \n282 \nU.S. 234\n, 51 S.Ct. 111; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra, at page 375 of 287 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 173), and other courts have followed suit. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The problem for solution here stands out upon this background.\n There are contexts in which the word seaman is held to exclude the master or even any officer. See, e.g., R.S.  4530, as amended by section 31 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (46 U.S.C.  597 (46 USCA  597)); also 46 U.S.C.  564, 568, 570, 592, 594, 658 (46 USCA  564, 568, 570, 592, 594, 658) re-enacting R.S.  4511, 4515, 4517, 4525, 4527 4561, as from time to time amended. There are other contexts in which it takes them in. 28 U.S.C.  837 (28 USCA  837); also R.S.  2174 (8 USCA  388 note); In re Scott (D.C.) 250 F. 647, 648; The Balsa (C.C.A.) 10 F.(2d) 408; The Burns Bros., No. 31 (D.C.) 29 F.(2d) 855. The respondent points to statutes that develop the antithesis between a seaman and those over him. See citations, supra. They do not carry us very far, any more than the contrast that exists for many purposes between a seaman and a stevedore. In a broad sense, a seaman is a mariner of any degree, one who lives his life upon the sea. It is enought that what he does affects 'the operation and welfare of the ship when she is upon a voyage.' The Buena Ventura (D.C .) 243 F. 797, 799, where a wireless operator was brought within the term. In a narrow sense the term is \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n limited to one who is an ordinary seaman and nothing more, a seaman as opposed to the master or an officer. One can find a like range of variation in the use of the word 'crew.' 'It is sometimes used to comprehend all persons composing the ship's company, including the master; sometimes to comprehend the officers and common seamen, excluding the master; and sometimes to comprehend the common seamen only, excluding the master and officers.' United States v. Winn, 3 Sumn. 209, 213, 214, Fed. Cas. No. 16,740 (Story, J.); cf. The Buena Ventura, supra, 243 F. 799( Hough, J.); The Bound Brook (D.C.) 146 F. 160, 164; United States v. Huff ( C.C.) 13 F.630. what concerns us here and now is not the scope of the class of seament at other times and in other contexts. Our concern is to define the meaning for the purpose of a particular statute which must be read in the light of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained. Congress knew that men employed upon a ship were without a remedy in damages for negligence beyond their cure and maintenance, unless the injury was a consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship or a defect in her equipment. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 384\n, 38 S.Ct. 501; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra. This restriction upon remedies was applicable to ordinary seament, but applicable also to officers and even to the master. The Brig George, 1 Sumn. 151, Fed. Cas. No. 5,329 (Story, J.); The Balsa, supra. 'It is said that the allowance by the maritime law belongs to the seamen only, and cannot be claimed by the master of the ship. ... No authority is cited for this position; and I am not aware that any exists.' Story, J., in The Brig George, supra, at page 155 of 1 Sumn., Fed. Cas. No. 5,329. Cf. the rule in Great Britain under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 (6 Edw. 7, No. 48,  34). The old measure of recovery was the same for all aboard, the highest and the lowest. The new measure was not designed to narrow the protected class while broadening the damages. We \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n stick too closely to the letter if we say that Congress had the will to give damages for wounds or death to the crew at large or their dependents and to leave the master and his dependents out. An ancient evil was to be uprooted, and uprooted altogether. It was not to be left with fibers still clinging to the soil.\n The purpose of the lawmakers, clear enough, we believe, upon the surface of the act, takes on an added clearness when the act is viewed in the setting of its history. Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 ( 46 USCA  688) is derived from section 20 of the Act of 1915, 38 Stat. 1185 (46 USCA  688 note). The parent section was aimed at the fellow- servant rule in its application to torts upon navigable waters. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., supra. It provided that 'in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow-servants with those under their authority.' Masters were thus recognized as within the genus seamen, though they were seamen having command. The decision of tis Court in the Chelentis Case gave warning that the change, if any, thus effected, did not avail to increase the damages beyond the cost of cure and maintenance. Thus warned, the lawmakers amended section 20 of the Act of 1915 by substituting section 33 of the Act of 1920. We cannot believe that in this process of amendment the word 'seamen' lost the broad meaning that it had in the law to be amended, and was narrowed by the exclusion of a particular species of seamen, i.e., seamen having command. The change is too sudden to be accepted as intended unless unmistakably declared.\n The scheme of legislation becomes symmetrical and consistent when the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 is read in the light of another act in pari materia, the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,  1 et seq. (33 U.S.C.  901 et seq. (33 USCA  901 et seq.)) adopted in 1927. This act expressly excludes from its 'coverage' a 'master or member of a \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n crew of any vessel.' Section 3 (33 USCA  903). The exclusion was at the request of seamen who notified the committee in charge that they preferred the remedy for damages under the act of 1920 to the benefits that would be theirs under a system of workmen's compensation. See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., on S. 3170, at p. 17; Cong. Rec., 69th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 68, part 5, p. 5908; Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128, 134\n, 136 S., 50 S.Ct. 303. The bill was accordingly amended in its progress through the House by declaring the exception. There can be little doubt that Congress did this in the belief that under the statutes then in force master and crew alike were already adequately protected in case of injury or death. The belief had a sound foundation in the act of 1920. Cf. Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., supra, at page 134 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 303.\n In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Supreme Court of Missouri rested its opinion on section 713 of title 46, c. 18 of the U.S. Code (46 USCA  713), which for the purpose of construction defines a master and a seaman as well as other terms. \n2\n With a few verbal changes section 713 is a re-enactment of section 653 of the Act of June 7, 1872 (17 Stat. 277), which was \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 161]\n\u00a0\n then known as section 4612 of the Revised Statutes. In the compilation of the Code some of the provisions for the protection of seamen contained in the act of 1872 were placed in title 46, which relates to shipping, and particularly in chapter 18 of that title, which relates to 'Merchant Seamen.' They had previously been re-enacted, as parts of the Revised Statutes, along with section 65. The acts of 1915 and 1920 were placed in the same chapter and title, and were thus brought into contiguity with the sections carried over from the Act of 1872. Very clearly the change of location did not work a change of meaning. The rule of construction laid down in section 713 must be confined to those sections of the chapter which were contained in the Act of 1872, or in the equivalent provisions of the Revised Statutes, before the Code had rearranged them. The compilers of the Code were not empowered by Congress to amend existing law, and doubtless had no thought of doing so. As to that the command of Congress is too clear to be misread. 1 USCA (title page)  2(a), 44 Stat. p. 1, pt. I. 4 To this it must be added that section 713, even in its relation to the sections fairly within its range, is 'directed to extension not to restriction.' Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., supra, at \n\n[293 U.S. 155, 162]\n\u00a0\n page 239 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 111, 112. It means that 'for the purposes of the chapter 'seaman' shall include persons who otherwise might be deemed not to be seamen.' It puts into the class some that might otherwise be excluded; it does not take any one out who would otherwise be there.\n The case for the respondent reduces itself to this, that by express or implied antithesis the word 'seaman' is used in many statutes to designate a class of mariners exclusive of the master. It is also true, however, that in these same statutes a seaman excludes a stevedore. A goodly number of the statutes where the antithesis is sharpest lay a duty upon the master to be performed for the seamen under him. In laws so framed, there is no room for construction. A goodly number in addition give a remedy to seamen for wages wrongfully withheld, or define terms of payment that agreement may not vary. In respect of dealings of that order, the maritime law by inveterate tradition has made the ordinary seaman a member of a favored class. He is a 'ward of the admiralty,' often ignorant and helpless, and so in need of protection against himself as well as others. The master, on the other hand, is able in most instances to drive a bargain for himself, and then when the bargain is made, to stand upon his rights. Discrimination may thus be rational in respect of remedies for wages. The Bethulia (D.C.) 200 F. 876; The Putnick (D.C.) 291 F. 902. It is neither rational nor just if extended to remedies for bodily wounds. At such times master and seaman are approximately equal. Congress did not mean that the master, any more than the seaman, should be left without a remedy if wounded in his body, or that his dependents were to be helpless if the wounds resulted in his death.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Missouri for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Grimberg v.

Harris, both of San Angelo, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Eugene P. Locke, of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by petitioner as beneficiary of a policy of insurance for $10,000 issued July 26, 1927, upon the life of her husband, who died on October 15, 1931. Application for the policy was made, and the policy was delivered in the state of Texas. A level premium of $449.10 was payable annually on June 10th, and was paid to and including June 10, 1930. The premium payable on June 10, 1931, was not paid either at that time or within the thirty-one days of grace allowed by the policy. \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n The 'loan value' or 'cash value' of the policy, as shown by the table which the policy set forth, was then $910. Loans against the policy, with interest, amounted to $898.88. The policy was a participating one, and a dividend of $74.80 was declared in favor of the insured on June 10, 1931. If that dividend had been applied in reduction of the amount advanced against the policy or to the purchase of extended insurance, the result would have been to extend the insurance beyond the date of the death of the insured. Petitioner contends that the dividend should have been so applied. Respondent insists that such application would have been contrary to the terms of the policy and that, on the expiration of the period of grace without payment of the premium due, the policy lapsed and the dividend was payable in cash and not otherwise.\n Respondent's request for the direction of a verdict was denied, and the verdict and judgment went for petitioner. The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 65 F.(2d) 240, 245. This Court granted certiorari.\n The policy gave the following options as to the disposition of dividends:\n'11. Dividend Options. Dividends may be withdrawn in cash; or applied to the payment of premiums; or left to accumulate with interest at three per cent., increased from surplus interest earnings as apportioned by the Directors, until the maturity of the policy, subject to withdrawal at any time; or applied to the purchase of paid-up participating additions to the policy, convertible into cash at any time for the amount of the original dividends or the reserve of the additions, if larger, but payment may be deferred by the Company ninety days from the date of application therefor.'\n\n There is no ambiguity in the terms of these options. They are clear and definite in the terminology of insurance, \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n and each is to be applied with its distinctive significance. No one of these options provides for the use of a dividend to procure extended insurance; that is, to procure an extension of the term of the insurance from the date to which premiums have been paid, without any further payment. Dividends may be withdrawn in cash or applied to the payment of premiums or left to accumulate with interest subject to withdrawal at any time. The further option to have dividends 'applied to the purchase of paid-up participating additions to the policy' is quite distinct from an option to procure extended insurance. A 'paid-up addition' to the policy, by the application of a dividend, is the amount added to the face of the policy and purchased by the use of the dividend as a single premium. For such paid-up additions there must be a legal reserve.\n The insured did not exercise any one of the options given by article 11. It appears that he had several other policies issued by the same company, and, in addition to the amount advanced by the company, he had borrowed certain amounts from the company's agents in Dallas, Tex. These agents, on September 18, 1931, obtained an order on the company, signed by the insured, which directed payment to them of the dividend on the policy in suit together with dividends on other policies. On this order, the dividend here in question was paid to the agents. Petitioner contested the order as having been signed at a time when the insured did not have sufficient mental capacity to understand the transaction. This issue of fact was decided by the jury in favor of petitioner, and the Circuit Court of Appeals did not pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence in that relation. Nor do we deal with that question. The only other indication of the intention of the insured is sought to be drawn from a statement in a letter addressed to the company by its \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n agents on September 14, 1931, referring to a conversation with the insured about September 1st. The agents said that the insured had rejected their proposal for the use of dividends on his policies in partial payment of his note held by the agents, saying that 'he was going to have every nickel applied towards paying these policies as far as it would carry them.' We agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals that this statement was too indefinite to serve as a direction to the company to apply the dividend in question in any particular way, and, unless the insurance had been extended under the provisions of the policy, it had already lapsed and could be reinstated only in accordance with the requirements of the policy; that is, upon payment of premium arrears with interest and satisfactory evidence of insurability. We are unable to find any basis for the conclusion that the insured either had, or attempted to exercise, any option to use the dividend to obtain extended insurance, and our decision must turn upon the construction of the provisions of the policy applicable to such a case.\n Article 12 provides for the 'automatic disposition' of dividends as follows:\n'12. Automatic Disposition. On payment of the premium, or on the policy anniversary if no further premium is payable, if no other option has been elected, the dividend then due shall be applied to the purchase of paid-up additions. In the event of the death of the insured during the days of grace, the current premium being unpaid, if no other option has been elected, or if the policy shall lapse, the dividend then due shall be paid in cash. At the death of the insured during the continuance of the policy, the pro rata part of the dividend for the current policy year shall be paid in cash.'\n\n The first sentence of article 12 is inapplicable, as it provides for the disposition of the dividend 'on payment \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n of the premium, or on the policy anniversary if no further premium is payable, if no other option has been elected.' The present case is not one where the premium was paid or where on the 'policy anniversary' no further premium was payable. The first part of the second sentence is also inapplicable, as the insured did not did during the days of grace. It is also clear that the third and last sentence does not apply. But the case does fall directly within the alternative of the second sentence, 'or if the policy shall lapse, the dividend then due shall be paid in cash.' That is precisely this case. And this provision of the policy is in plain opposition to the contention that the dividend should be applied to an extension of the insurance. The provision presupposes a dividend due and the lapse of the policy for nonpayment of premium, and the dividend is then to be paid in cash.\n Petitioner seeks to escape this definite stipulation by invoking the provisions of the policy as to the use of the 'policy value' or 'surrender value' in obtaining extended insurance. After stating that the reserve of the policy 'is computed on the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest 3 1\/2%,' the policy provides:\n'15. Surrender Value. After two full years' premiums have been paid, the surrender value for each thousand dollars of insurance is equal to the reserve at the end of the policy year, omitting cents, except that in the second, third and fourth policy years, it is equal to the reserve at the end of the policy year, taken to the nearest dollar, less surrender charges of $21, $13 and $6 respectively.\n\n'16. Policy Values. The surrender value may be used at the option of the owner of the policy in any one of the following ways, all of equal value, as set forth in the following tables, provided there be no indebtedness or advances on the policy. If, on failure to pay a premium, no \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 176]\n\u00a0\n option is exercised, such value shall be applied as provided in Option 1.\n\n'17. Option 1.-Extended Insurance. Applied to the extension of this policy as participating term insurance from the date to which premiums have been paid, without any further payment (Table 1.) The value of any paid-up additions will be used to increase the term of extension. Accumulations of dividends at interest may be applied to increase the term of extension. Dividends on extended insurance shall be paid in cash and only for completed policy years.\n\n'22. Deduction of Indebtedness. If there by any indebtedness or advances on this policy, the cash value shall be reduced thereby; the paid- up value shall be reduced proportionately; and the extended insurance shall be for the face value of the policy less the indebtedness and advances and for such term as said reduced cash value will provide.'\n\n Petitioner argues that an earlier provision of the policy (article 8) that 'after two full years' premiums have been paid, on failure to pay any subsequent premium, this policy shall lapse and its value, if any, shall be applied as set forth in article 16,' conflicts with the provision of article 12 that the dividend in case of lapse shall be paid in cash. There is no conflict, however, as article 16 refers to the use of the 'surrender value,' as defined in article 15. Instead of there being inconsistency, article 8 expressly provides for lapse on nonpayment of premium, the event on which, by article 12, the dividend is to be paid in cash. The dividend is not a part of the 'surrender value.' That value is equal to the 'reserve' at the end of the policy year, less the 'surrender charges' stated. Where level premiums are paid, the amount of the annual premium is necessarily greater than the mor- \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n tality cost during the early years of the insurance and less than the mortality cost in later years. With the mortality table and an assumed rate of interest on the investment of premiums received, the amount of the accumulated savings on this basis, at any date, can be mathematically computed. This amount constitutes the 'reserve' against the policy or its net value. The insurer must have on hand the aggregate amount of these reserves against its outstanding policies. And in case of lapse, after a policy has been in force for a specified time, its net value or 'surrender value,' less surrender charges, is made available to the policyholder.\n'Dividends' are in a different category. In fixing the annual level premium, there is added to the sum required on the basis of the mortality table, and assumed rate of interest, an amount to cover anticipated expenses and contingencies. If the rate of mortality exactly coincided with the expected rate, and the income, expenses, and contingencies were precisely in accordance with the allowance made therefor, there would be no surplus and hence no dividends. But in the actual course of business there may be, and probably will be, gains from the fact that the mortality turns out to be less than that expected, or that the income is larger or the outlays are less than those estimated, and these gains are distributable to policyholders by means of 'dividends' in accordance with the provisions of policies. The 'surrender value' is calculated on the basis of the reserve and without reference to such possible dividends.\n\n In this instance, according to the tables set forth in the policy to which article 16 refers, the surrender value at the time in question was $ 91 for each $1,000 of insurance, and thus amounted to $910. According to article 22, this 'cash value' was to be reduced by the amount advanced on the policy. It is not questioned that the \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 178]\n\u00a0\n amount which had been advanced, with interest, was $898.88. There was thus left, of the surrender value, the sum of $11.12 which the insured was entitled to have applied as provided in article 16. The insured, on the failure to pay the premium due, did not exercise any of the options for the use of the surrender value of the policy under article 16, and hence 'such value' was to be applied 'as provided in Option 1,' set forth in article 17. The amount to be so applied was clearly the surrender value of $ 11.12, as above stated. And under 'Option 1,' it was this amount that was to be used to obtain 'extended insurance.'\n Article 17 provided that this amount should be 'applied to the extension of this policy as participating term insurance from the date to which premiums have been paid, without any further payment (Table 1).' According to that table, the sum of $910, the total surrender value without deducting advances, would have sufficed to purchase $10,000 of participating term insurance for 'four years, 330 days'; that is, at between 50 and 51 cents a day. The amount remaining of the surrender value, after deducting advances, or $11.12, would thus purchase extended insurance for only twenty-two days, a period inadequate to keep the policy alive until the date of the death of the insured.\n The petitioner is not aided by the other provisions of article 17. It provides that 'the value of any paid-up additions will be used to increase the term of extension.' But there were no 'paid-up additions.' Prior dividends had been used in reduction of the annual premiums paid. No option had been exercised for the use of the dividend in question in the purchase of a paid-up addition as provided in article 11, and that dividend, on the lapse of the policy, became payable in cash by the terms of article 12. \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 179]\n\u00a0\n Article 17 also provided that 'accumulations of dividends at interest may be applied to increase the term of extension.' This provision manifestly refers to the option in article 11 that dividends may be 'left to accumulate with interest at three per cent.' That option had not been exercised and no dividends had been left to accumulate. The provision has no application to a current dividend as to which no option had been exercised and which on the lapse of the policy is expressly made payable in cash. If, after the lapse and during the life of the insured, the company had attempted to apply that dividend to extended insurance, its action would not have been binding upon the insured, and he would have been entitled to demand the cash payment explicitly promised him. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n It is the contention of the petitioner that, on the lapse of the policy, the dividend of $74.80 should have been applied in reduction of the amount advanced against the surrender value of the policy, thus raising what remained of that value from $11.12 to $85.92, a sum sufficient to extend the insurance until after the death. But the policy gave no warrant for an application of the dividend to the reduction of advances against the policy. As this Court pointed out in Board of Assessors of Parish of Orleans v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n216 \nU.S. 517, 522\n, 30 S.Ct. 385, 386, such advances being against the surrender value do not create a 'personal liability' or a 'debt' of the insured, but are merely a deduction from the sum that the company 'ultimately must pay.' While the advance is called a 'loan' and interest is computed in settling the account, 'the item never could be sued for,' and in substance 'is a payment, not a land.' \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 180]\n\u00a0\n Id. The company had no right, without agreement with the insured, to apply a dividend, payable in cash, to the reduction of the advance against the policy. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In the endeavor to support its contention, petitioner refers to a statement and a 'cash surrender voucher' sent by the company to the insured under date of July 15, 1931. These papers were submitted for the signature of the insured, but were not signed or approved by him. In them, the cash value of the dividend, or $74.80, was added to the cash value of the policy, and the amount of the advances against the policy with interest, together with a 'balance on loan' ($81.10) on another policy, were deducted, leaving a 'net cash surrender value available' of $4.82. The endeavor to treat this statement and proposed voucher as making the dividend a part of the surrender value is unsuccessful. Not only is this effort opposed to the clear terms of the policy, but the papers themselves show that the 'cash value' of the dividend was regarded as a separate item. These papers, so far as the present question is concerned, evidence neither an admission nor an agreement.\n As there is no ambiguity in the provisions under consideration, there is no occasion for resort to the familiar principle that equivocal words should be construed against the insurer. While it is highly important that ambiguous clauses should not be permitted to serve as traps for policyholders, it is equally important, to the insured as well as to the insurer, that the provisions of insurance policies which are clearly and definitely set forth in appropriate language, and upon which the calculations of the company are based, should be maintained unimpaired by loose and ill-considered interpretations. \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 181]\n\u00a0\n The remaining question is whether a different conclusion as to the interpretation of the policy is required by view of the provision of article 4732, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas 1925, quoted in the margin. \n3\n Petitioner insists that the phrase 'dividend additions,' as used in the statute, means 'dividends.' The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with this view, holding that 'dividend additions' are 'paid-up insurance in addition to the face of the policy and purchased with dividends.' We think that this construction is correct. It is in accord with the uncontradicted testimony which was given by actuaries upon the trial as to the general understanding of the phrase. It will be observed that the statutory provision refers to the reserve at the date of default on the policy 'and on any dividend additions thereto.' It thus refers \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 182]\n\u00a0\n to 'dividend additions' upon which there would be a reserve, that is, it would seem plainly, to paid-up insurance purchased by dividends, which would require a reserve. We also agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the case of First Texas State Insurance Co. v. Smalley, 111 Tex. 68, 228 S.W. 550, is not to be regarded as a construction of the phrase, as the present question was not before the court. The same is true of the case of Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. Jamora (Tex. Civ. App.) 44 S.W.( 2d) 808. In Great Southern Life Insurance Co. v. Jones (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 122, relating to a similar statute of Oklahoma, the policy provided for guaranteed 'premium reduction coupons' which were fixed liabilities requiring a reserve, and were not dividends in the proper sense as in the instant case. The ruling of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in United States Life Insurance Co. v. Spinks, 126 Ky. 405, 96 S.W. 889, 103 S.W. 335, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1053, is met by the later decision of the same court in Jefferson v. New York life Insurance Co., 151 Ky. 609, 616, 617, 152 S. W. 780, 783, where the court held that the words 'dividend additions' in the statute of Kentucky 'has reference solely to paid-up insurance.' See, also, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. v. O'Brien (Ky.) 116 S.W. 750. We see no reason for attributing, under the statute of Texas, any other meaning to the terms of the policy in suit than that which would otherwise be regarded as their clear import.\n The petition for certiorari in this case directed attention to what was deemed to be a conflict between the decision below and the decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeals in Harvey v. Union Central Life Insurance Co., 45 F.(2d) 78, and Atlantic Life Insurance Co. v. Pharr, 59 F.(2d) 1024. In the case of Harvey, the decision could, and did, rest on the fact that the period of extended insurance, to which the surrender value was applicable according to the provisions of the policy, ran from the effective date of the policy and, as thus calculated, the insurance extended be- \n\n[291 U.S. 170, 183]\n\u00a0\n yond the date of death. So far as what was said by the court in that case may be regarded as bearing upon the question presented in the instant case, it was, and was stated to be, unnecessary to the decision. In the case of Pharr, there were provisions in the policy, quite different from those before us, which were of doubtful meaning. The views expressed by the court may be taken as limited to the facts of the particular case.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Hutchinson v.

The ruling was upheld and the conviction sustained by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 64 F.(2d) 566, which adopted as the test of admissibility of the evidence its interpretation of the statute in force in the territory of Washington at the time of its admission to statehood. Section 392, Code of Washington 1881; see State v. Nelson, 39 Wash. 221, 81 P. 721; state v. Rasmussen, 125 Wash. 176, 215 P. 332.\n During the present term this Court has resolved conflicting views expressed in its earlier opinions by holding that the rules governing the competence of witnesses in criminal trials in the federal courts are not necessarily restricted to those local rules in force at the time of the admission into the Union of the particular state where the trial takes place, but are governed by common-law principles as interpreted and applied by the federal courts in the light of reason and experience. Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, decided December 11, 1933. If any different rule with respect to the admissibility of testimony has been thought to apply in the federal courts, Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  6; compare Alford v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 687\n, 51 S. Ct. 218, it is clear that it \n\n[291 U.S. 7, 13]\n\u00a0\n should be the same as that governing the competence of witnesses. So our decision here, in the absence of congressional legislation on the subject, is to be controlled by common-law principles, not by local statute.\n The statement to which the witness was permitted to testify in the present case was a relevant admission by petitioner, probative of his guilty purpose or intent to commit the crime charged. It was therefore rightly received in evidence, unless it should have been excluded because made in a communication to his wife.\n The government insists that confidential communications between husband and wife are privileged only when the testimony offered is that of one of the spouses, and that the privilege does not exclude proof of communications between them, however confidential, by a witness who is neither the husband nor the wife. The question thus raised remains open in the federal courts. \n1\n But we \n\n[291 U.S. 7, 14]\n\u00a0\n find it unnecessary to answer it here, for, in the view we take, the challenged testimony to the communication by the husband to his wife is not within the privilege because of the voluntary disclosure by him to a third person, his stenographer.\n The basis of the immunity given to communications between husband and wife is the protection of marital confidences, regarded as so essential to the preservation of the marriage relationship as to outweigh the disadvantages to the administration of justice which the privilege entails. See Hammons v. State, 73 Ark. 495, 500, 84 S.W. 718, 68 L.R.A. 234, 108 Am. St.Rep. 66, 3 Ann.Cas. 912; Sexton v. Sexton, 129 Iowa, 487, 489ff, 105 N. W. 314, 2 L.R.A. (N.S.) 708; O'Toole v. Ohio German Fire Ins. Co., 159 Mich. 187, 192, 123 N.W. 795, 24 L.R.A.(N.S.) 802; Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  2336. Hence it is that the privilege with respect to communications extends to the testimony of husband or wife even though the different privilege, excluding the testimony of one against the other, is not involved. See Gordon, Rankin & Co. v. Tweedy, 71 Ala. 202, 210; Wickes v. Walden, 228 Ill. 56, 81 N.E. 798; Southwick v. Southwick, 49 N.Y. 510, 519; Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.)  2227, 2228, 2332, 2333\n\n\n Communications between the spouses, privately made, are generally assumed to have been intended to be confidential, and hence they are privileged; but, wherever a communication, because of its nature or the circumstances under which it was made, was obviously not intended to be confidential, it is not a privileged communication. See Caldwell v. State, 146 Ala. 141, 143, 41 So. 473; Parkhurst v. Berdell, 110 N.Y. 386, 393, 18 N.E. 123, 6 Am.St.Rep. 384; Truelsch v. Miller, 186 Wis. 239, 249, 202 N.W. 352, 38 A.L.R. 914. And, when made in the presence of a third party, such communications are usually regarded as not privileged because not made in confidence. Jacobs v. United States (C.C.A.) 161 F. 694; Cocroft v. Cocroft, 158 Ga. 714, 124 S.E. \n\n[291 U.S. 7, 15]\n\u00a0\n 346; cf. Linnell v. Linnell, 249 Mass. 51, 143 N.E. 813, with Freeman v. Freeman, 238 Mass. 150, 130 N.E. 220.\n Here it is suggested that the voluntary disclosure to the stenographer negatives the confidential character of the communication. Cf. State v. Young, 97 N.J. Law, 501, 117 A. 713. But we do not think the question which we have to determine is one of fact whether the petitioner's letter to his wife was intended to be confidential. We may take it that communications between husband and wife may sometimes be made in confidence even though in the presence of a third person, see Robin v. King, 2 Leigh (Va.) 140, 144; and that would seem especially to be the case where the communication is made in the presence of or through the aid of a private secretary or stenographer whose duties, in common experience, are confidential. Cf. Edmonson v. Birch & Co., (1907) 1 K.B. 371, 382. Accordingly, the question with which we are now concerned is the extent to which the privilege which the law concedes to communications made confidentially between the husband and wife embraces the transmission of them, likewise in confidence, through a third party intermediary, communications with whom are not themselves protected by any privilege. Cf. Drew v. Drew, 250 Mass. 41, 144 N.E. 763.\n Petitioner invokes the authority of those cases where the privilege granted to communications between attorney and client has been held to excluded proof of the communication by the testimony of a clerk present when it was made, see Sibley v. Waffle, 16 N.Y. 180, 183; Wartell v. Novograd, 48 R.I. 296, 301, 137 A. 776, 53 A.L.R. 365; Taylor v. Forster, 2 C. & P. 195; cf. State v. Brown, 2 Marv.(Del.) 380, 397, 36 A. 458, and of those where the statutory privilege extended to the information gained by a physician from consultation with his patient has been deemed to exclude, by implication, proof of the condition of the \n\n[291 U.S. 7, 16]\n\u00a0\n patient by testimony of a nurse who attended the consultation. See Culver v. Union Pacific R. Co., 112 Neb. 441, 450, 199 N.W. 794; cf. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Owen, 111 Ark. 554, 164 S.W. 720. It is said that the stenographer here similarly stood in a confidential relationship to the petitioner, and that the communication to her of the contents of petitioner's letter to his wife should, on grounds both of reason and convenience, be protected by the privilege which the law extends to confidential communications privately made between husband and wife.\n We may assume for present purposes that, where it is the policy of the law to throw its protection around knowledge gained or statements made in confidence, it will find a way to make that protection effective by bringing within its scope the testimony of those whose participation in the confidence is reasonably required. It may be that it would be of little worth to forbid the disclosure of information gained by a physician from the examination or consultation of his patient, if the nurse, necessarily present, could reveal it. See Culver v. Union Pacific R. Co., supra; Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Jordan, 164 Miss. 174, 143 So. 483. It may plausibly be urged that the privilege of attorney and client would be as often defeated as preserved if it did not draw within its sweep the testimony of clerks in the lawyer's office. See Sibley v. Waffle, supra.\n But it is unnecessary now to determine the latitude which may rightly be given to the privilege which the law confers upon either of these relationships, for no considerations such as those suggested apply to marital communications under conditions disclosed here. Normally husband and wife may conveniently communicate without stenographic aid, and the privilege of holding their confidences immune from proof in court may be reasonably enjoyed and preserved without embracing within it the \n\n[291 U.S. 7, 17]\n\u00a0\n testimony of third persons to whom such cummunications have been voluntarily revealed. The uniform ruling that communications between husband and wife, voluntarily made in the presence of their children, old enough to comprehend them, or other members of the family within the intimacy of the family circle, are not privileged, Linnell v. Linnell, 249 Mass. 51, 143 N.E. Cowser v. State, 70 Tex.Cr.R. 265, 157 S.W. 758, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 598; Fuller v. Fuller, 100 W.Va. 309, 130 S.E. 270, is persuasive that communications like the present, even though made in confidence, are not to be protected. The privilege suppresses relevant testimony, and should be allowed only when it is plain that marital confidence cannot otherwise reasonably be preserved. Nothing in this case suggests any such necessity.\n We do not intimate whether in the present circumstances the wife's testimony, not offered against her husband, would likewise be freed of the restriction. Cf. Nash v. Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co., 106 W.Va. 672, 146 S.E. 726, 63 A.L.R. 101.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Justice Miller, sitting as Circuit Justice, excluded evidence of confidential communications in a letter written by the husband to his wife, found by the latter's administrator among her papers, although proved by a third party witness. Bowman v. Patrick (C.C.) 32 F. 368; cf. Lloyd v. Pennie (D.C.) 50 F. 4. A like decision was reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Ross, 30 F.(2d) 80. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit made the same ruling with respect to a communication between an attorney and client in Liggett v. Glenn, 51 F. 381, and a District Court reached a similar conclusion with respect to communications between physician and patient in Dreier v. Continental Life Ins. Co. (C.C.) 24 F. 670. Compare a dictum in Hopkins v. Grimshaw, \n165 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 17 S.Ct. 401. It seems that many state courts rule that a communication between husband and wife, however confidential, may be proved by the testimony of a third person who has acquired knowledge of it, even though without the assent of the spouse making the communication, at least where the spouse to whom the communication was made is not responsible for the disclosure.

In July, 1930, respondent acquired all the assets of the other German corporation.\n Section 24 of the Trading with the Enemy Act1 authorized the Custodian to pay expenses incurred in \n\n[292 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n obtaining and administering property taken and held by him and required payments to be made out of the property in respect of which the expenses were incurred. The Act of May 16, 1928, 45 Stat. 574, directed that all expenses of the Custodian's office, including his compensation, should be paid from interest and collections of trust funds and other property under his control. Under the Act of March 4, 1923,2 there was released to each of the German corporations $10,000 of principal and income in the same amount annually thereafter, less 1 per cent. of the amounts paid between March 4, 1923, and November 1, 1927, and 2 per cent. of those paid after the date last mentioned. The amount so withheld was $1,400. By the Act of March 10, 1928, 3 the President was authorized to order return of all except 20 per cent. of the principal of money and property to which he should find the claimant entitled. Respondent and the other German corporation filed their claims which in due course were allowed. The Custodian released to them various sums, retaining the required 20 per cent. and other amounts not here material. Of the amounts released he deducted two per cent., $60,346.52. He also retained out of Treasury interest paid upon the proceeds of the seized property $8,142.31. The total of these deductions is $69,888.83; all was taken by the Custodian to cover the general or administrative expenses of his office.\n The amended bill alleges, inter alia, the facts above stated and prays an accounting and judgment for the amount so withheld by the Custodian. Defendant in- \n\n[292 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n terposed a motion to dismiss and an answer. The trial court overruled the motion, and on special appeal its decree was affirmed. 62 App. D.C. 344, 68 F. (2d) 391.\n March 28, 1934, shortly after this writ was granted, Congress passed an Act4 containing an amendment to section 24 of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USCA Appendix  24), which declares: 'No claim shall be filed ... nor shall any suit be instituted or maintained against the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, or the United States, under any provisions of law, by any person who was an enemy or ally of enemy as defined in the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended , ... nor judgment entered in any such suit heretofore or hereafter instituted, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions, heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties, or income therefrom, held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for the general or administrative expenses of the office of the Alien Property Custodian ....'\n This amendment was intended to forbid, and it is broad enough to cover, the commencement or maintenance of suits such as this. If valid, it requires the decree below to be reversed and the bill to be dismissed. The moneys sued for are a part of proceeds of property that was taken by the Custodian from respondent and the other German corporation. The Trading with the Enemy Act was passed by Congress in the exertion of the war power; its purpose was to weaken enemies by diminishing the sources from which they could obtain aid, and to strengthen this country by adding to resources for the successful prosecution of the war. Section 12 declares that after the end of the war any claim of any enemy to recover money or property received and held by the \n\n[292 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury 'shall be settled as Congress shall direct.' 40 Stat. 424 (see 50 USCA Appendix  12). While this suggests that confiscation was not effected or intended, it plainly shows that Congress reserved to itself full freedom at any time to dispose of the property as might be deemed expedient and to deal with claimants as it should deem to be in accordance with right and justice, having regard to the conditions and circumstances that might arise during and after the war. It is clear the enemy owners were divested of every right in respect of property taken and held under the Act. United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 U.S. 1\n, 9-11, 47 S.Ct. 1.\n The original Act, coupled with the later Acts of March 4, 1923, and May 16, 1928, plainly discloses a reservation to Congress of power to appropriate the property seized or its proceeds, as far as might be deemed necessary, to the payment of expenses incurred in the seizure and subsequent administration. The funds here in question are proceeds which were deducted for that purpose when payments were made from time to time to the enemy owner. As respects property or proceeds so retained by the Custodian there is no room to doubt that Congress had full power to cause it to be applied to the payment of such expenses. And, of course, Congress had ample power to ratify deductions made by the Custodian to cover such expenses. This is in effect what was done by the Act of March 28, 1934. True, it forbade the commencement or maintenance of a suit to recover funds so deducted, but his merely reflects and emphasizes the purpose to sanction and ratify the deductions by the Custodian, and in such circumstances does not deprive the respondent of any vested interest.\n It follows that the Act of March 28, 1934, infringes no constitutional right of respondent. The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded to \n\n[292 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia with directions to that court to dismiss the bill.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Added by section 2, Act of March 4, 1923, 42 Stat. 1516 (50 USCA Appendix  24) \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sections 9(b)(10), (h) and 23, added by sections 1 and 2, Act of March 4, 1923, 42 Stat. 1512, 1513, 1515, 1516 (see 50 USCA Appendix  9(b)( 10), h, and  23). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 9(b)(16), (m), added by sections 11 and 14, Act of March 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 270, 272, and section 23, as amended by section 17, Act of March 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 275 (50 USCA Appendix  9(b)(16), (m) and  23). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Public No. 141, 73d Congress, 2d Session. \n\n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZELLERBACH PAPER CO. v. HELVERING(1934)\nNo. 37-39\nArgued: October 17, 1934Decided: November 5, 1934\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 172, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Francis Neylan and J. Paul Miller, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. William Stanley, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy in these cases hinges upon the date when the statute of limitations began to run against deficiency assessments by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n On July 16, 1921, Zellerbach Paper Company filed a consolidated income and profits tax return in behalf of itself and a subsidiary, National Paper Products Com- \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n pany, for the fiscal year beginning May 1, 1920, and ending April 30, 1921\n\n\n On March 15, 1921, it filed an income and profits tax return for the calendar year 1920 in behalf of A. S. Hopkins Company, a dissolved subsidiary, including in its own consolidated return the income of the A. S. Hopkins Company between January 1, 1921, and the date of dissolution.\n At the filing of these returns the income and profits tax statute applicable to the taxpayers was the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). Later (on November 23, 1921) another tax statute, the Revenue Act of 1921 ( 42 Stat. 227), became a law, with a provision (section 263) that it should take effect retroactively as of January 1, 1921.\n By the Act of 1921 (section 239(a) every corporation subject to taxation thereunder was required to 'make a return, stating specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions and credits allowed by this title.' Treasury Decisions issued by the Commissioner in March, 1922 ( T.D. 3305, March 16, 1922, amended by T.D. 3310, March 28, 19221), gave notice in substance that taxpayers who had filed returns under the Act of 1918 and who were subject to an additional tax for the same period under the Act of 1921, should file a new or supplemental return covering such additional tax. By implication this was a ruling that an additional return was not required of taxpayers whose taxes were not increased by the new law. \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n By implication, also, the new return was to be limited to a statement of the facts or figures necessary to exhibit the additions, without repetition of facts or figures that had been well returned already.\n The Act of 1921 in its application to the petitioners made one change and one only. If the net income of the taxpayer was more than $25,000, there was to be a denial of the credit or exemption of $2,000 otherwise allowable. Section 236(b). The fiscal year of the petitioners ran, as we have seen, from May 1, 1920, to April 30, 1921, and of this period one- third was in the calendar year 1921. The net income being largely in excess of $25,000, the effect of the new law was to cut down the permissible credit by one-third of $2,000, thus increasing the tax by little more than a nominal amount. What that amount was could be ascertained by a simple computation, dependent upon data fully supplied by the return already filed, and calling only for the application of the statutory rule.\n The petitioners did not make a new or supplemental return correcting the computation in the one on file. The change was so trivial and so obvious as perhaps to lead them to believe that no amendment was expected. Be that as it may, they heard nothing more from the Bureau of Internal Revenue with reference to their taxes till May 11, 1928, an interval of nearly seven years, when they received from the Commissioner notices of deficiency assessments in large amounts upon grounds unrelated (except for the deduction already mentioned) to any changes in the law. The Revenue Act of 1921 provides (section 250(d) that income and profits taxes shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within four years after a return is filed. If the return filed by the petitioners or in their behalf in July, 1921, served to set in motion the term of limitation, the assessments were too late. The Board of Tax Appeals, however, upheld the action of the Commissioner, and ruled (two members dissenting) that \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n the return on file was a nullity, and hence that the statute of limitations had never been set running. 26 B.T.A. 96. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 69 F.(2d) 852. In so doing, it refused to follow decisions directly to the contrary by courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction. Myles Salt Co., Ltd., v. Commissioner (C.C.A.5) 49 F.(2d) 232; Isaac Goldmann Co. v. Burnet, Commissioner, 60 App.D.C. 265, 51 F.(2d) 427; Valentine-Clark Co. v. Commissioner (C.C.A.8) 52 F.(2d) 346. Because of that conflict, writs of certiorari were granted by this Court. \n292 \nU.S. 621\n, 54 S.Ct. 866, 867.\n The opinion of the court below rests heavily upon the argument that what is required by the statute is a return under the act, and that this excludes by implication a return by the taxpayer before the act became a law. Various sections are cited as enforcing that conclusion. See, e.g., sections 205(a), 239(a), 250(d), which so far as material are quoted in the margin. \n2\n But the Act of 1921 was retro- \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 177]\n\u00a0\n active (sections 263, 1400), taking effect, as we have seen, as of the beginning of the year. Being law by relation, to the disadvantage of the taxpayer, in respect of the burden of his tax, it may well have been law by relation to his benefit in respect of the form and time of his return. There is no anomaly, to say the least, in such a rule of reciprocity. Indeed, there are special reasons why this very result must have been thought of in the framing of the statute. If a new return was required, when was it to be due? The statute tells us (sections 227(a), 241(a) that when a taxpayer makes his return on the basis of a fiscal year, the time for filing shall be the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of such year, which for these petitioners, was the fifteenth of July. Thus the date fixed for filing was far in advance of the date when the statute was enacted. From this the inference is a fair one that returns already filed were continued in effect, being treated as if made under the new act, which thus adopted and renewed them. Otherwise the taxpayer was placed in default before the duty was imposed. Nor is there anything unworkable in thus applying the doctrine of relation to keep returns alive. To the extent that gross income or deductions were to be computed differently thereafter, the Commissioner could make the necessary adjustment in connection with his audit. Moreover, by virtue of his general power to make 'all needful rules and regulations' with the approval of the Secretary (section 1303), he might require of taxpayers whatever supplementary information would be necessary to enable him to act correctly. This, as we have seen, he did, designating a new date selected by himself and wholly unrelated to the fiscal year covered. The validity of such a regulation will be assumed and indeed is not contested. None the less, the return exacted by the statute, the one that in the absence of fraud is to start the term of \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 178]\n\u00a0\n limitation (section 250(d), is the return filed by the taxpayer at the close of the fiscal year, though supplementary information may modify or add to it. Cf., Florsheim Bros. Dry Goods Co., Ltd., v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 462\n, 50 S.Ct. 215.\n A different conclusion would lead in practice to complications and injustice. Many taxpayers filing returns under the Act of 1918 were unaffected by the changes wrought by the Act of 1921. Their returns, if made over again, would have been an exact reproduction of those they had made already. A statute would have to be very plain to justify a holding in such circumstances that there was an obligation to report anew. Certainly the average man would be slow to suspect that he was subject to such a duty. If he looked into the Treasury Decisions, he would learn that the Commissioner agreed with him. In these he was told by the plainest inplication that unless he had an additional tax to pay, his return would stand as filed, without supplement or correction. Now, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is without dispensing power. If a return under the old act is not good under the new one, but, instead, is an utter nullity, he may not relieve the taxpayer of making a return over again. To this the government assents, and on it builds the argument that the first returns are to be disregarded altogether, whether more is due or nothing. In that view, hundreds of taxpayers, perhaps thousands, though innocent of willful wrong, have been deprived of the protection of any rule of limitation, not to speak of other penalties unwittingly incurred. A statute of uncertain meaning will not readily be made an instrument for so much of hardship and confusion.\n Administrative construction, confirmed by acts of Congress, brings reinforcement to the argument. Reference has been made already to the Treasury Decisions issued in March, 1922. The pertinent administrative history, \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 179]\n\u00a0\n however, does not begin at that point. It goes back to earlier statutes presenting a like problem. In the transit from the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 300) to the Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057), there was the same gap to be filled, the same necessity for determining the standing of returns made on a fiscal year basis before the new act became law. Treasury Decision 2797, issued by the Commissioner March 11, 1919, was designed to guide the taxpayer in that predicament. It is quoted in the margin. \n3\n It calls for an additional return when an additional tax is due, but not at other times. It treats the whole tax, computed under both returns, as made up of separate parts, one the part due under what is styled 'the original return,' and the other the additional part due 'under the amended return.' This regulation was in substance readopted in the regulations already referred to under the Act of 1921. There are verbal variations, but not of such a nature as to suggest a change of meaning. The like is true of a Treasury Decision issued under the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9; T.D. 3843). All these regulations have had the tacit assent and confirmation of the lawmakers. Successive revenue statutes have been enacted without substantial change in the applicable sections. Congress seemingly has been satisfied with the Decisions of the \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 180]\n\u00a0\n Treasury and with the interpretation of its own meaning implicit in them. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 40 S.Ct. 237; McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 493 S., 51 S. Ct. 510; Costanzo v. Tillinghast, \n287 \nU.S. 341, 345\n, 53 S. Ct. 152; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, 53 S.Ct. 350.\n From this administrative history the inference is compelling that a second return, reporting an additional tax, is an amendment or supplement to a return already upon the files, and being effective by relation does not toll a limitation which has once begun to run. Florsheim Bros. Dry Goods Co., Ltd., v. United States, supra. Cf. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62, 67\n, 53 S.Ct. 278; New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Kinney, \n260 \nU.S. 340, 346\n, 43 S.Ct. 122. Perfect accuracy or completeness is not necessary to rescue a return from nullity, if it purports to be a return, is sworn to as such (Lucas v. Pilliod Lumber Co., \n281 \nU.S. 245\n, 50 S.Ct. 297, 67 A.L.R. 1350), and evinces an honest and genuine endeavor to satisfy the law. This is so though at the time of filing the omissions or inaccuracies are such as to make amendment necessary. Even more clearly is it so when the return is full and accurate in the beginning under the statutes then in force, but is made inaccurate or incomplete by supervening changes of the law, unforeseen and unforeseeable. Supplement and correction in such circumstances will not take from a taxpayer, free from personal fault, the protection of a term of limitation already running for his benefit. Cf., Myles Salt Co., Ltd., v. Commissioner, supra, at page 233 of 49 F.(2d); Valentine-Clark Co. v. Commissioner, supra, at page 349 of 52 F.(2d). At the very least the statutes are sufficiently ambiguous to be susceptible of that construction without strain upon their meaning. So in effect the Commissioner has construed them by relieving taxpayers of the duty of filing a new return except for additional taxes and by treating such new return as an \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 181]\n\u00a0\n amendment or a supplement. So this Court construes them now.\n In the argument for the government much is made of the point that in giving effect for any purpose to the original return we cut down the period available to the bureau for audit and assessment. The reduction, however, is not serious. In the first place, it applies only to that part of the taxable year as to which the two statutes overlap. In the second place, the return in its first form was subject to immediate audit in respect of everything embraced within it. Indeed, at that time the examiners could not know whether a new statute would be passed before the end of the calendar year, or whether the changes would be great or small. Whatever shortening of time there has been is limited to those matters as to which the statutes differ from each other. Even for that purpose, however, the time available was ample. Almost three years and eight months were left for carrying the audit to completion. The curtailment is too slight, the inconvenience too nearly negligible, to affect the process of construction.\n A middle ground has been suggested, a path of compromise between the position of the petitioners at one extreme and that of the government at the other. Some such compromise is indicated, it seems, in decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals, though the rulings of the Board in that respect are involved in some obscurity. At all events, the suggestion is that the term of limitation shall run from the new return when it appears on the face of the original return that because of the changes in the law a tax will be due beyond the liability reported,4 and that \n\n[293 U.S. 172, 182]\n\u00a0\n the limitation shall run from the original return when there is nothing on the face of that return to indicate that the liability reported is less than is owing. \n5\n The statute supplies no basis for such a principle of division. An examiner needs more time for an audit when errors are latent, to be discovered only by digging into books and vouchers, than when errors are apparent upon a bare inspection of the record. It would be a strange rule of limitation that would vary his opportunity inversely to his needs.\n One other contention of the government is stated merely to exclude it from the scope of our decision. The government makes the point that the petitioners' return, even if filed at the proper time, must be held to be a nullity for the reason that it commingles the income of the affiliated companies, parent and subsidiary, with that of another company, the A. S. Hopkins Company, previously dissolved. No such point was considered by the court below, nor was it suggested either in the petition for certiorari or in any response thereto. Review by this Court will be limited accordingly. Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 479, 494\n, 53 S.Ct. 721; Charles Warner Co. v. Independent Pier Co., \n278 \nU.S. 85, 91\n, 49 S.Ct. 45.\n The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The text of the amended decision is as follows:\n'If any taxpayer has, before November 23, 1921, filed a return for a fiscal year ending in 1921, and paid or become liable for a tax computed under the Revenue Act of 1918, and is subject to additional tax for the same period under the Revenue Act of 1921, a return covering such additional tax shall be filed at the same time as the returns of persons making returns for the fiscal year ending February 28, 1922, are due under the laws and regulations, and payment of such additional tax will be due in the same installments and at the same times as in the case of payments based on returns for the fiscal year ending February 28, 1922. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 205(a): 'That if a taxpayer makes return for a fiscal year beginning in 1920 and ending in 1921, his tax under this title for the taxable year 1921 shall be the sum of: (1) the same proportion of a tax for the entire period computed under Title II of the Revenue Act of 1918 at the rates for the calendar year 1920 which the portion of such period falling within the calendar year 1920 is of the entire period, and (2) the same proportion of a tax for the entire period computed under this title at the rates for the calendar year 1921, which the portion of such period falling within the calendar year 1921 is of the entire period.'\n Section 239(a): 'That every corporation subject to taxation under this title and every personal service corporation shall make a return, stating specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions and credits allowed by this title.'\n Section 250(d): 'The amount of income, excess-profits, or war-profits taxes due under any return made under this Act for the taxable year 1921 or succeeding taxable years shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within four years after the return was filed. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'If a corporation has before February 25, 1919, filed a return for a fiscal year ending in 1918 and paid or become liable for a tax computed under the revenue act of 1917, and is subject to additional tax for the same period under the revenue act of 1918, the return covering such additional tax shall be filed at the same time as returns of persons making returns for the calendar year 1918 are due under existing rulings, and payment of such additional tax is due in the same installments and at the same times as in the case of payments based on returns for the calendar year 1918.
